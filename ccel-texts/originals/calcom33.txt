   HARMONY OF THE EVANGELISTS
     __________________________________________________________________

   MATTHEW 21:10-22; MARK 11:11-24;
   LUKE 19:39-48

   Matthew 21:10-22

   Mark 11:11-24

   Luke 19:39-48

   10. And when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved,
   saying, Who is this? 11. And the multitudes said, This is Jesus the
   prophet of Nazareth in Galilee. 12. And Jesus entered into the temple
   of God, and drove out all that sold and bought in the temple, and
   overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who
   sold doves; 13. And said to them, It is written, My house shall be
   called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.
   14. And the blind and lame came to him in the temple, and he cured
   them. 15. When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful
   works which he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying,
   Hosanna to the Son of David! They were enraged, [1] 16. And said to
   him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith to them, Yes; and
   have you never read, Out of the mouth [2] of infants and sucklings thou
   hast perfected praise? 17. And, leaving them, he went out of the city
   into Bethany, and lodged there. 18. And in the morning, returning to
   the city, he was hungry. 19. And when he saw a fig tree near the road,
   he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to
   it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth forever; and immediately the
   fig tree withered. 20. And when his disciples saw it, they wondered,
   saying, How quickly is the fig tree withered! 21. And Jesus answering
   said to them, Verily I say to you, If you have faith, and do not doubt,
   not only will you do what has taken place in the fig tree, but also, if
   you shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and thrown into the
   sea, it shall be done. 22. And all things, whatsoever you shall ask in
   prayer, believing, [3] you shall receive.

   11. And the Lord entered [4] into Jerusalem, and into the temple; and
   when he had looked around on all things, and it was now evening, he
   went out to Bethany with the twelve. 12. And the next day, when they
   departed from Bethany, he was hungry. 13. And when he saw at a distance
   a fig tree having leaves, he came, if perhaps he would find anything on
   it. [5] And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was
   not the season for figs. 14. And Jesus answering said o the fig tree,
   Let no man eat fruit from thee henceforth forever. And his disciples
   heard it. 15. And they come to Jerusalem. And Jesus entered into the
   temple, and began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple,
   and overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those
   who sold doves; 16. And did not suffer any man to carry a vessel
   through the temple. 17 And taught, saying to them, Is it not written,
   My house shall be called by all nations a house of prayer? But you have
   made it a den of robbers. 18. And the scribes and chief priests heard
   it, and sought how they would put him to death; for they dreaded him,
   because the whole multitude admired his doctrine. 19. And when it was
   evening, he went out of the city. 20. And in the morning, passing by
   the fig tree, they saw that it was dried up from the root. [6] 21. And
   Peter, remembering, saith to him, Rabbi, [7] lo, that fig tree which
   thou cursedst is dried up! 22. And Jesus answering saith to them, Have
   faith in God. 23. Verily I say to you, Whoever shall say to this
   mountain, Be thou removed, and thrown into the sea, and shall not doubt
   in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith shall be, he shall
   have whatever he saith. 24. Therefore I say to you, Whatever you ask,
   praying, believe that you will receive it, and you shall have it.

   39. And some of the Pharisees out of the multitude said to him, Master,
   rebuke thy disciples. 40. To whom he said, I say to you, that if these
   be silent, the stones will cry out. [8] (A little after.) 45. And
   having entered into the temple, he began to drive out those who sold
   and bought in it, 46. Saying to them, It is written, My house is a
   house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers. 47. And he
   taught daily in the temple. And the chief priests, and scribes, and
   rulers of the people, sought to put him to death, 48. And did not find
   what to do; for all the people hung upon his lips, while they were
   hearing him.


   There is a difference between Matthew and Mark in their narrative of
   the withering of the fig tree; for Matthew says that it was on the day
   after that Christ made a public appearance as King, while Mark appears
   to throw it back to the following day. [9] But the solution is easy;
   for they agree in this respect, that Christ, on the day after that he
   made his solemn entrance into the city, cursed the tree; only Mark
   states what Matthew had omitted, that the occurrence was observed by
   the disciples on the following day., So then, though Mark has stated
   more distinctly the order of time, he makes no contradiction.

   He appears to differ more openly both from Matthew and from Luke in the
   narrative of chastising the traders; [10] for while both of them
   declare that Christ, as soon as he entered into the city and temple,
   drove out those who sold and bought, Mark simply says that he looked
   around on all things, but has thrown back the driving of them out till
   another day. [11] But I reconcile them in this way, that Mark, not
   having spoken about the purifying of the temple, afterwards inserts it,
   though not in its proper place. He relates that, on the first day,
   Christ came into the temple, and there looked round on all things. [12]
   Now why did he look so earnestly, except for the purpose of correcting
   something that was wrong? For, having been formerly accustomed to pay
   frequent visits to the temple, it was not the novelty of the sight that
   affected him. Now as Mark ought immediately to have added, that those
   who sold and bought in the temple were driven out of it, he says that
   Christ went out of the city; but, having omitted what was worthy of
   being related, he inserts it afterwards.

   But perhaps some will be more inclined to believe that, in this
   narrative also, Mark observed the order of time, which the other two
   Evangelists had disregarded; for though they appear to indicate an
   uninterrupted succession of events, yet as they do not name a
   particular day, there would be no impropriety in dividing what we find
   to be connected in their writings. For my own part, however, I prefer
   the conjecture which I stated first; for it is probable that this
   demonstration of his power was made by Christ in presence of a large
   multitude. But any one who will consider how little care the
   Evangelists bestowed on pointing out dates will not stumble at this
   diversity in the narrative.

   Matthew 21:10. When he entered into Jerusalem. Matthew says that the
   city was moved, in order to inform us that the transaction did not take
   place secretly, or by stealth, but in the presence of all the people,
   and that the priests and scribes were not ignorant of it. Under this
   despicable aspect of the flesh the majesty of the Spirit was apparent;
   for how would they have endured that Christ should be conducted into
   the city, attended by the splendor of royalty, with so great danger to
   themselves, if they had not been seized with astonishment? The
   substance of it therefore is, that Christ's entrance was not made in a
   private manner, and that his enemies abstained from opposing it, not
   because they treated him with contempt, but rather because they were
   restrained by secret fear; for God had struck them with such alarm,
   that they dare not make any attempt. At the same time, the Evangelist
   glances at the careless indifference of the city, and commends the
   piety of those who have just reached it; for when the inhabitants, on
   hearing the noise, inquire, Who is this? it is manifest that they do
   not belong to the number of Christ's followers.

   12. And Jesus entered into the temple. Though Christ frequently
   ascended into the temple, and though this abuse continually met his
   eye, twice only did he stretch out his hand to correct it; once, at the
   commencement of his embassy, [13] and now again, when he was near the
   end of his course. But though disgraceful and ungodly confusion reigned
   throughout, and though the temple, with its sacrifices, was devoted to
   destruction, Christ reckoned it enough to administer twice an open
   reproof of the profanation of it. Accordingly, when he made himself
   known as a Teacher and Prophet sent by God, he took upon himself the
   office of purifying the temple, in order to arouse the Jews, and make
   them more attentive; and this first narrative is given by John only in
   the second chapter of his Gospel. But now, towards the end of his
   course, claiming again for himself the same power, he warns the Jews of
   the pollutions of the temple, and at the same time points out that a
   new restoration is at hand.

   And yet there is no reason to doubt that he declared himself to be both
   King and High Priest, who presided over the temple and the worship of
   God. This ought to be observed, lest any private individual should
   think himself entitled to act in the same manner. That zeal, indeed, by
   which Christ was animated to do this, ought to be held in common by all
   the godly; but lest any one, under the pretense of imitation, should
   rush forward without authority, we ought to see what our calling
   demands, and how far we may proceed according to the commandment of
   God. If the Church of God have contracted any pollutions, all the
   children of God ought to burn with grief; but as God has not put arms
   into the hands of all, let private individuals groan, till God bring
   the remedy. I do acknowledge that they are worse than stupid who are
   not displeased at the pollution of the temple of God, and that it is
   not enough for them to be inwardly distressed, if they do not avoid the
   contagion, and testify with their mouth, whenever an opportunity
   presents itself, that they desire to see a change for the better. But
   let those who do not possess public authority oppose by their tongue,
   which they have at liberty, those vices which they cannot remedy with
   their hands.

   But it is asked, Since Christ saw the temple filled with gross
   superstitions, why did he only correct one that was light, or, at
   least, more tolerable than others? I reply, Christ did not intend to
   restore to the ancient custom all the sacred rites, and did not select
   greater or smaller abuses for correction, but had only this object in
   view, to show by one visible token, that God had committed to him the
   office of purifying the temple, and, at the same time, to point out
   that the worship of God had been corrupted by a disgraceful and
   manifest abuse. Pretexts, indeed, were not wanting for that custom of
   keeping a market, which relieved the people from trouble, that they
   might not have far to go to find sacrifices; and next, that they might
   have at hand those pieces of money which any man might choose to offer.
   Nor was it within the holy place that the money-changers sat, or that
   animals intended for sacrifice were exposed to sale, but only within
   the court, to which the designation of the temple is sometimes applied;
   but as nothing was more at variance with the majesty of the temple,
   than that a market should be erected there for selling goods, or that
   bankers should sit there for matters connected with exchange, this
   profanation was not to be endured. And Christ inveighed against it the
   more sharply, because it was well known that this custom had been
   introduced by the avarice of the priests for the sake of dishonest
   gain. For as one who enters a market well-stocked with various kinds of
   merchandise, though he does not intend to make a purchase, yet, in
   consequence of being attracted by what he sees, changes his mind, so
   the priests spread nets in order to obtain offerings, that they might
   trick every person out of some gain.

   13. It is written. Christ quotes two passages taken out of two
   Prophets; the one from Isaiah 56:7, and the other from Jeremiah 7:11.
   What was written by Isaiah agreed with the circumstances of the time;
   for in that passage is predicted the calling of the Gentiles. Isaiah,
   therefore, promises that God will grant, not only that the temple shall
   recover its original splendor, but likewise that all nations shall flow
   to it, and that the whole world shall agree in true and sincere piety.
   [14] He speaks, no doubt, metaphorically; for the spiritual worship of
   God, which was to exist under the reign of Christ, is shadowed out by
   the prophets under the figures of the law. Certainly this was never
   fulfilled, that all nations went up to Jerusalem to worship God; and
   therefore, when he declares that the temple will be a place of prayer
   for all nations, this mode of expression is equivalent to saying, that
   the nations must be gathered into the Church of God, that with one
   voice they may worship the true God, along with the children of
   Abraham. But since he mentions the temple, so far as it then was the
   visible abode of religion, Christ justly reproaches the Jews with
   having applied it to totally different purposes from those to which it
   had been dedicated. The meaning therefore is: God intended that this
   temple should exist till no as a sign on which all his worshippers
   should fix their eyes; and how base and wicked is it to profane it by
   thus turning it into a market?

   Besides, in the time of Christ, that temple was actually a house of
   prayer; that is, so long as the Law, with its shadows, remained in
   force. But it began to be a house of prayer for all nations, when out
   of it resounded the doctrine of the Gospel, by which the whole world
   was to be united in one common faith. And though shortly afterwards it
   was totally overthrown, yet even in the present day the fulfillment of
   this prophecy is manifest; for, since

   out of Zion, went forth the law,
   (Isaiah 2:2; Micah 4:2,)

   those who wish to pray aright must look to that beginning. I do
   acknowledge that there is no distinction of places, for it is the will
   of the Lord that men should call upon Him everywhere; but as believers,
   who profess to worship the God of Israel, are said to

   speak in the language of Canaan, (Isaiah 19:18,)

   so they are also said to come into the temple, because out of it flowed
   the true religion. It is likewise the fountain of the waters, which,
   enlarged to an astonishing degree within a short period, flow in great
   abundance, and give life to those that drink them, as Ezekiel (Ezekiel
   47:9) mentions, [15] which, going out from the temple, spread, as
   Zechariah (Zechariah 14:8) says, from the rising to the setting sun.
   Though in the present day we make use of temples (or churches) for
   holding the holy assemblies, yet it is for a different reason; for,
   since Christ was manifested, no outward representation of him under
   shadows is held out to us, such as the fathers anciently had under the
   Law.

   It must also be observed, that by the word prayer the prophet expresses
   the whole worship of God; for, though there was at that time a great
   variety and abundance of religious rites, yet God intended briefly to
   show what was the object of all those rites; namely, that they might
   worship him spiritually, as is more clearly expressed in the fiftieth
   psalm, where also God comprehends under prayer all the exercises of
   religion.

   But you have made it a den of robbers. Christ means that the complaint
   of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7:11) applied equally well to his own time, in
   which the temple was not less corrupted. The prophet directs his
   reproof against hypocrites, who, through confidence in the temple,
   allowed themselves greater liberty in sinning. For, as it was the
   design of God to employ outward symbols, as a sort of rudiments, for
   instructing the Jews in true religion, so they satisfied themselves
   with the empty pretense of the temple, as if it were enough to give
   their attention to outward ceremonies; just as it is customary with
   hypocrites to

   change the truth of God into a lie (Romans 1:25.).

   But the prophet exclaims that God is not bound to the temple, or tied
   to ceremonies, and therefore that they falsely boast of the name of the
   temple, which they had made a den of robbers. For as robbers in their
   dens sin with greater hardihood, because they trust that they will
   escape punishment, so by means of a false covering of godliness
   hypocrites grow more bold, so that they almost hope to deceive God. Now
   as the metaphor of a den includes all corruptions, Christ properly
   applies the passage of the prophet to the present occasion.

   Mark adds, that Christ gave orders that no man should carry a vessel
   through the temple; that is, he did not permit any thing to be seen
   there that was inconsistent with religious services; for by the word
   vessel the Hebrews denote any kind of utensil. In short, Christ took
   away whatever was at variance with the reverence and majesty of the
   temple.

   14. And the blind and lame came to him. That the authority which Christ
   had claimed for himself out of the usual course might not be suspected
   of rashness, he supported it by miracles. He therefore cured the blind
   and lame in the temple, in order to proclaim that the rights and honor
   of Messiah truly belonged to him; for by these marks the prophets
   describe him. Hence we again perceive what I hinted a little ago that
   it is not every one of the people who is called to imitate this action
   of Christ lest he inconsiderately raise himself to the throne of the
   Messiah. We ought indeed to believe that the lame and blind, who were
   cured, were witnesses of the divine power of Christ, as if God, by his
   voice from heaven, approved what had been proclaimed by the multitude.
   [16]

   15. When the chief priests and scribes saw. Luke relates that the
   Pharisees began to grumble, while he was still on the road. [17] It was
   the disciples that were then crying out: the others wished to have them
   silenced. Christ replied, that it was in vain for them to make
   opposition; because God would rather make the stones cry out than
   permit the reign of His Son to be forgotten. It is probable that, as
   the crying out was not diminished, and as even the children now joined
   in it, the scribes and priests were roused to still fiercer
   indignation, and then commenced a new attack on Christ. They appear
   indirectly to reproach him by alleging that he is desirous to obtain
   the praises of children.

   But we must observe whence their displeasure arose. That it was
   connected with ungodly malice and outrageous contempt of God is evident
   from the fact, that his miracles gave them not less uneasiness than the
   shouts of applause. But I now inquire about some more special reason.
   What was it that chiefly vexed them? Now we know how eagerly they
   contended for their authority; for the object to which their zeal
   carried them was, that the tyranny, which they had once claimed, might
   continue to be enjoyed by them; and it was no slight diminution of
   their power, if the people were at liberty to bestow on Christ the
   title of King. Even in trifling matters they wished their decisions to
   be regarded as oracles, [18] so that it might not be permitted to
   approve or reject any thing but according to their pleasure. They
   therefore reckon it to be foolish and unreasonable, that the people
   should confer the title of Messiah on one whom they do not treat with
   any respect. And certainly, if they had done their duty, it would have
   been proper for them to direct the whole people, and to go before them
   as their leaders. For the priests had been appointed, that from their
   lips all might seek the knowledge of the Law, and, in short, that they
   might be the messengers and interpreters of the God of armies, (Malachi
   2:7.) But as they had basely extinguished the light of truth, Christ
   appropriately replies, that they gain nothing by endeavoring to
   suppress the doctrine of salvation, for it will rather break out from
   the stones.

   There is likewise an implied admission; for Christ does not deny that
   it is an unnatural order for the uneducated multitude and children to
   be the first to magnify with their voice the coming of the Messiah, but
   as the truth is wickedly suppressed by those who ought to have been its
   lawful witnesses, it is not wonderful if God raise up others, and -- to
   their shame -- make choice of children. Hence we derive no slight
   consolation; for though wicked men leave no stone unturned for
   concealing the reign of Christ, we learn from this passage that their
   efforts are in vain. They hope that, when some of the multitude, that
   is carrying forward the kingdom of Christ, shall have been put to
   death, and others shall be silenced by fear, they will gain their
   object. But God will disappoint them; for He will sooner give mouths
   and tongues to stones than allow the kingdom of His Son to be without
   witnesses.

   16. And have you never read? The scribes and priests seize on this as
   an opportunity of calumniating Christ, that he allows himself to be
   called a King by children; as it is always the custom of wicked people
   haughtily to despise the mean condition of the disciples of Christ.
   This malicious design Christ checks by a quotation from David, who
   makes even infants to be the heralds of the glory of God. Literally the
   words run,

   Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings thou hast founded strength,
   (Psalm 8:2;)

   by which David means that, though every tongue were silent, [19] God
   needs no other orators to proclaim his power than mere infants, who are
   still hanging on their mothers' breasts. In themselves, no doubt, they
   are silent; but the wonderful providence of God, which shines in them,
   serves the purpose of splendid and powerful eloquence. For he who
   considers with himself how the child is formed in the mother's womb, is
   nourished there for nine months, afterwards comes into the world, and
   finds nourishment provided as soon as it is born, must not only
   acknowledge that God is the Creator of the world, but will be
   altogether carried away into admiration of Him. [20] Thus the sun and
   moon, though they are dumb creatures, are said to have a loud and
   distinct voice for singing the praises of God, (Psalm 19:1, 2.) But
   since the praises of God are heard from the tongue of infants, Christ
   infers from this, that it is not strange if He cause them to be uttered
   by children who have already acquired the use of speech.

   18. And returning in the morning. Between that solemn entrance of
   Christ, of which we have spoken, and the day of the Passover, he had
   passed the night in Bethany; and during the day he appeared in the
   temple for the purpose of teaching. Matthew and Mark relate what
   happened during that interval, that Christ, when coming into the city,
   was hungry, approached a fig-tree, and, having found nothing on it but
   leaves, cursed it; and that the tree, which had been cursed by his
   voice, immediately withered. I take for granted that Christ did not
   pretend hunger, but was actually hungry; for we know that he
   voluntarily became subject to the infirmities of the flesh, though by
   nature he was free and exempt from them.

   But here lies the difficulty. How was he mistaken in seeking fruit on a
   tree that had none; more especially, when the season of fruit had not
   yet arrived? And again, Why was he so fiercely enraged against a
   harmless tree? But there would be no absurdity in saying, that as man,
   he did not know [21] the kind of tree; though it is possible that he
   approached it on purpose, with full knowledge of the result. Certainly
   it was not the fury of passion that led him to curse the tree, (for
   that would not only have been an unjust, but even a childish and
   ridiculous revenge;) but as hunger was troublesome to him according to
   the feeling of the flesh, he determined to overcome it by an opposite
   affection; that is, by a desire to promote the glory of the Father, as
   he elsewhere says,

   My meat is to do the will of my Father, (John 4:34;)

   for at that time he was contending both with fatigue and with hunger. I
   am the more inclined to this conjecture, because hunger gave him an
   opportunity of performing a miracle and of teaching his disciples. So
   when he was pressed by hunger, and there was no food at hand, he finds
   a repast in another way; that is, by promoting the glory of God. He
   intended, however, to present in this tree an outward sign of the end
   which awaits hypocrites, and at the same time to expose the emptiness
   and folly of their ostentation.

   19 Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth. Let us learn from this what is
   the meaning of the word curse, namely, that the tree should be
   condemned to barrenness; as, on the other hand, God blesses, when by
   his voice he bestows fertility. It appears more clearly from Mark, that
   the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not
   observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of
   leaves. Mark, too, attributes to Peter what Matthew attributes equally
   to all the disciples; but as Christ replies in the plural number, it
   may naturally be inferred that one put the question in the name of all.

   21 And Jesus answering. The use of the miracle is still farther
   extended by Christ, in order to excite his disciples to faith and
   confidence. By Mark, the general exhortation is placed first, to have
   faith in God; and then follows the promise, that they would obtain by
   faith whatever they asked from God. To have faith in God means, to
   expect, and to be fully assured of obtaining, from God whatever we
   need. But as faith, if we have any, breaks out immediately into prayer,
   and penetrates into the treasures of the grace of God, which are held
   out to us in the word, in order to enjoy them, so Christ adds prayer to
   faith; for if he had only said that we shall have whatever we wish,
   some would have thought that faith was presumptuous or too careless.
   And therefore Christ shows that those only are believers who, relying
   on his goodness and promises, betake themselves to him with humility.

   This passage is exceedingly adapted to point out the power and nature
   of faith; that it is a certainty, relying on the goodness of God, which
   does not admit of doubt. For Christ does not acknowledge as believers
   any but those who are fully convinced that God is reconciled to them,
   and do not doubt that he will give what they ask. Hence we perceive by
   what a diabolical contrivance the Papists are bewitched, who mingle
   faith with doubt, and even charge us with foolish presumption, if we
   venture to appear before God under the conviction of His fatherly
   regard toward us. But this benefit derived from Christ is that on which
   Paul chiefly dwells, when he says that

   by the faith of him we have boldness
   to approach to God with confidence (Ephesians 3:12).

   This passage shows also that the true test of faith lies in prayer. If
   it be objected, that those prayers are never heard, that mountains
   should be thrown into the sea, the answer is easy. Christ does not give
   a loose rein to the wishes of men, that they should desire any thing at
   their pleasure, when he places prayer after the rule of faith; [22] for
   in this way the Spirit must of necessity hold all our affections by the
   bridle of the word of God, and bring them into obedience. Christ
   demands a firm and undoubting confidence of obtaining an answer; and
   whence does the human mind obtain that confidence but from the word of
   God? We now see then that Christ promises nothing to his disciples,
   unless they keep themselves within the limits of the good pleasure of
   God.

   Luke 19:47. And he taught daily in the temple. Mark and Luke point out,
   first, what was the class of men of which the Church consisted, namely,
   of the despised multitude; and again, what enemies Christ had, namely,
   the priests and scribes, and all the rulers. Now this is a part of the
   folly of the cross, that God, passing by the excellence of the world,
   chooses what is foolish, weak, and despised. Secondly, they relate that
   those worthy guardians of the Church of God sought an occasion of
   putting Christ to death, by which their wicked impiety was discovered;
   for though there had been good grounds for pursuing Christ, yet they
   had no right to proceed to murder after the manner of robbers, or
   secretly to hire assassins. Thirdly, they show that the wicked
   conspiracy of those men was frustrated, because, by the secret purpose
   of God, Christ was appointed to the death of the cross.

   Luke 20:1-8

   23. And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and elders
   of the people came to him, saying By what authority doest thou these
   things? and who gave thee that authority? [23] 24. And Jesus answering
   said to them, I also will ask you something, which if you shall tell
   me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
   25. Whence was the baptism of John? From heaven, or from men? But they
   thought within themselves saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will
   say to us, Why then did you not believe him? 26. But if we shall say,
   From men, we dread the multitude, for they all hold John for a prophet.
   27. And answering Jesus, they said, We do not know. And he saith to
   them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

   27. And they come again to Jerusalem; and while he was walking in the
   temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders, come to him.
   28. And they say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and
   who gave thee that authority [24] to do these things? 29. And Jesus
   answering said to them, I will also ask you something, and answer me,
   and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 30. Whether
   was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me. 31. And
   they thought within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven,
   he will say, Why then did you not believe him? 32. But if we say, From
   men, they dreaded the people; [25] for all reckoned John that he was
   truly a prophet. 33. And they answering say to Jesus, We do not
   know. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither will I tell you by
   what authority I do these things.

   1. And it happened on one of those days, while he was teaching the
   people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests, and
   scribes, with the elders, came upon him, 2. And spoke to him saying,
   Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that
   gave thee that authority? 3. And Jesus answering said to them, I will
   also ask you something, and answer me. 4. Was the baptism of John from
   heaven, or from men? 5. But they reasoned within themselves, saying, If
   we shall say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe
   him? 6. But if we shall say, From men, all the people will stone us;
   for they are convinced that John is a prophet. 7. And they answered,
   That they did not know whence it was. 8. And Jesus said to them,
   Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.


   Matthew 21:23. By what authority doest thou these things. As the other
   schemes and open attempts to attack Christ had not succeeded, the
   priests and scribes now attempt, by indirect methods, if they may
   possibly cause him to desist from the practice of teaching. They do not
   debate with him as to the doctrine itself, whether it was true or
   not--for already had they often enough attacked him in vain on that
   question--but they raise a dispute as to his calling and commission.
   And, indeed, there were plausible grounds; for since a man ought not,
   of his own accord, to intermeddle either with the honor of priesthood,
   or with the prophetical office, but ought to wait for the calling of
   God, much less would any man be at liberty to claim for himself the
   title of Messiah, unless it were evident that he had been chosen by
   God; for he must have been appointed, not only by the voice of God, but
   likewise by an oath, as it is written, (Psalm 110:4; Hebrews 7:21.)

   But when the divine majesty of Christ had been attested by so many
   miracles, they act maliciously and wickedly in inquiring whence he
   came, as if they had been ignorant of all that he had done. For what
   could be more unreasonable than that., after seeing the hand of God
   openly displayed in curing the lame and blind, they should doubt if he
   were a private individual who had rashly assumed this authority?
   Besides, more than enough of evidence had been already laid before
   them., that Christ was sent from heaven., so that nothing was farther
   from their wish than to approve of the performances of Christ, after
   having learned that God was the Author of them. They therefore insist
   on this., that he is not a lawful minister of God, because he had not
   been chosen by their votes, as if the power had dwelt solely with them.
   But though they had been the lawful guardians of the Church, still it
   was monstrous to rise up against God. We now understand why Christ did
   not make a direct reply to them. It was because they wickedly and
   shamelessly interrogated him about a matter which was well known.

   25 Whence was the baptism of John? Christ interrogates them about the
   baptism of John, not only to show that they were unworthy of any
   authority, because they had despised a holy prophet of God, but also to
   convict them, by their own reply, of having impudently pretended
   ignorance of a matter with which they were well acquainted. For we must
   bear in mind why John was sent, what was his commission, and on what
   subject he most of all insisted. He had been sent as Christ's herald.
   He was not deficient in his duty, and claims nothing more for himself
   than to

   prepare the way of the Lord.
   (Malachi 3:1; Luke 7:27.)

   In short., he had pointed out Christ with the finger, and had declared
   him to be the only Son of God. From what source then do the scribes
   mean that the new authority of Christ should be proved, since it had
   been fully attested by the preaching of John?

   We now see that Christ employed no cunning stratagem in order to
   escape, but fully and perfectly answered the question which had been
   proposed; for it was impossible to acknowledge that John was a servant
   of God, without acknowledging that he was Himself the Lord. He did not
   therefore shelter arrogant men, [26] who without any commission, but
   out of their own hardihood, take upon themselves a public office; nor
   did he countenance, by his example, the art of suppressing the truth,
   as many crafty men falsely plead his authority. I do acknowledge that,
   if wicked men lay snares for us, we ought not always to reply in the
   same way, but ought to be prudently on our guard against their malice,
   yet in such a manner that truth may not be left without a proper
   defense.

   Baptism denotes here not only the sign of washing, but the whole
   ministry of John; for Christ intended to draw out a reply, Was John a
   true and lawful prophet of God, or an impostor? Yet this mode of
   expression contains a useful doctrine, Is the of John from God, or from
   men? For hence we infer, that no doctrine and no sacrament ought to be
   received among the godly, unless it be evident that it has come from
   God; and that men are not at liberty to make any invention of this
   nature. The discourse relates to John, whom our Lord, in another
   passage, raises, by a remarkable commendation, above all the prophets,
   (Luke 7:26, 28.) Yet Christ declares that his baptism ought not to be
   received, unless it had been enjoined by God. What, then, must we say
   of the pretended sacraments, which men of no authority have foolishly
   introduced without any command from God? For Christ plainly declares by
   these words, that the whole government of the Church depends on the
   will of God in such a manner, that men have no right to introduce any
   thing from themselves.

   But they thought within themselves. Here we perceive the impiety of the
   priests. They do not inquire what is true, nor do they put the question
   to their own conscience; [27] and they are so base as to choose rather
   to shuffle than to acknowledge what they know to be true, that their
   tyranny may not be impaired. In this manner, all wicked men, though
   they pretend to be desirous of learning, shut the gate of truth, if
   they feel it to be opposed to their wicked desires. So then Christ does
   not allow those men to go without a reply, but sends them away ashamed
   and confounded, and, by bringing forward the testimony of John,
   sufficiently proves that he is furnished with divine power. [28]

   MATTHEW 21:28-32

   Matthew 21:28-32

   28. But what think you? [29] A man had two sons, and, coming to the
   first, he said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. 29. And he answering
   said, I will not; [30] but afterwards he repented, and went. 30. And
   coming to the other, he spoke in the same manner. But he answering
   said, I [go,] Sir, and went not. 31. Which of the two did what his
   father wished? [31] And they say to him, The first. Jesus saith to
   them, Verily I say to you, That the publicans and the harlots will go
   before you into the kingdom of God. 32. For John came to you by the way
   of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the publicans and
   the harlots believed him. And you, when you had seen it, were not moved
   by repentance [32] to believe in him.


   This conclusion shows what is the object of the parable, when Christ
   prefers to the scribes and priests those who were generally accounted
   infamous and held in detestation; for he unmasks those hypocrites, [33]
   that they may no longer boast of being the ministers of God, or hold
   out a pretended zeal for godliness. Though their ambition, and pride,
   and cruelty, and avarice, were known to all, yet they wished to be
   reckoned quite different persons. And when, but a little ago, they
   attacked Christ, they falsely alleged that they were anxious about the
   order of the Church, as if they were its faithful and honest guardians.
   Since they attempt to practice such gross imposition on God and men,
   Christ rebukes their impudence by showing that they were at the
   greatest possible distance from what they boasted, and were so far from
   deserving that elevation with which they flattered themselves, that
   they ranked below the publicans and the harlots For as to the
   profession which they made of being eminent in observing the worship of
   God, and of being zealots of the Law, Christ tells them that it is
   quite as if a son were, in words, to promise obedience to his father,
   but afterwards to deceive him. [34] So far as regards the publicans and
   the harlots, he does not excuse their vices, but compares their
   dissolute life to the obstinacy of a rebellious and debauched son, who
   at first throws off his father's authority; but shows that they are
   greatly preferable to the scribes and Pharisees in this respect, that
   they do not continue to the end in their vices, but, on the contrary,
   submit gently and obediently to the yoke which they had fiercely
   rejected. We now perceive the design of Christ. Not only does he
   reproach the priests and scribes with obstinately opposing God, and not
   repenting, though so frequently admonished, but he strips them of the
   honor of which they were unworthy, because their ungodliness was worse
   than the lasciviousness of the harlots.

   30. I, Sir. [35] This phrase is borrowed from the Hebrew language; for,
   when the Hebrews wish to offer their services, and to declare that they
   are ready to obey, they speak in this manner, "Here I am, Sir," It is a
   laudable virtue in itself, as soon as God has spoken, to yield to Him
   ready and cheerful obedience; and Christ does not here give the
   commendation to slowness. But as both are improper--to delay before
   doing your duty, and to promise what you do not perform--Christ shows
   that this hypocrisy is less to be endured than the fierceness which, in
   process of time, is subdued.

   32. For John came. As John was a faithful servant of God, whatever he
   taught Christ ascribes to God himself. It might have been more fully
   expressed thus: God came pointing out the way of righteousness by the
   mouth of John; but as John spoke in the name of God, and not as a
   private individual, he is most properly named instead of God. Now this
   passage gives no small authority to the preaching of the word, when
   those persons are said to have been disobedient and rebellious against
   God, who despised the pious and holy warnings of a teacher whom tie had
   sent.

   There are some who give a more ingenious exposition of the word
   righteousness, and I allow them to enjoy their own opinion; but, for my
   own part, I think that it means nothing more than that John's doctrine
   was pure and right; as if Christ had said, that they had no good reason
   for rejecting him. When he says that the publicans believed, he does
   not mean that they assented in words, but that they sincerely embraced
   what they had heard. Hence we infer, that faith does not consist solely
   in a person's giving his assent to true doctrine, but that it embraces
   something greater and loftier, that the hearer, renouncing himself,
   devotes his life wholly to God. By saying that they were not moved even
   by such an example, he presents an aggravated view of their malice; for
   it was an evidence of the lowest depravity, not even to follow the
   harlots and the publicans. [36]

   Mark 21:1-12

   Luke 20:9-19

   33. Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, who planted
   a vineyard, and surrounded it by a ditch, and dug a wine-press in it,
   and built a tower, and let it to husbandmen, and went abroad, 34. And
   when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the
   husbandmen, that they might receive its fruits. 35. And the husbandmen,
   having seized his servants, wounded one, killed another, and stoned
   another. 36. Again, he sent other servants more numerous [37] than the
   first, and they did to them in the same manner. 37. And last of all he
   sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. 38. And when
   the husbandmen saw his son, they said within themselves, This is the
   heir: come, let us kill him, and seize on his inheritance. 39. And they
   caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. 40. When
   therefore the proprietor of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to
   those husbandmen? 41. They say to him, Since they are wicked, he will
   miserably destroy them, and will let his vineyard to other husbandmen,
   who will render to him the fruit in its seasons. 42. Jesus saith to
   them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the
   builders rejected is made the head of the corner; [38] this is done by
   the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes? [39] 43. Therefore I say to
   you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to
   a nation yielding its fruits. 44. And whosoever shall fall on this
   stone shall be bruised, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush
   him. 45. And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables,
   they knew that he spoke of them. 46. And though they sought to take
   him, they dreaded the multitudes, because they reckoned him a prophet.

   1. And he began to speak to them by parables: A man planted a vineyard,
   and surrounded it by a hedge, and dug a ditch, [40] and built a tower,
   and let it to husbandmen and went abroad. 2. And at the proper season
   he sent a servant, to the husbandmen to receive from the husbandmen of
   the fruit of the vineyard. 3. But they seized him, and beat him, and
   sent him away empty. 4. And again he sent to them another servant; and
   they threw stones at him, and bruised his head, and sent him away
   disgraced. 5. And again he sent another, and him they killed, and many
   others, beating some and killing some. 6. And while he had yet one son,
   [41] his well-beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will
   reverence my son. 7. But the husbandmen said within themselves, This is
   the heir: come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
   8. And they seized him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
   vineyard. 9. What then will the proprietor of the vineyard do? He will
   come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.
   10. And have you not read the Scripture, The stone which the builders
   rejected is made the head of the corner; 11. This is done by the Lord,
   and is wonderful in our eyes? [42] 12. And they sought to take him, and
   dreaded the multitude; for they knew that he had spoken the parable
   against them: and they left him, and went away.

   9. And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man
   planted a vineyard, and let it to husbandmen, and went abroad for a
   long time. 10. And at the proper season he sent a servant to the
   husbandmen, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard; and
   they beat him, and sent him away empty. 11. And again he sent yet
   another servant; and him also they wounded, and drove out. 13. And the
   proprietor of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my
   well-beloved son; perhaps they will reverence him when they see him.
   14. But when the husbandmen saw him, they thought within themselves,
   saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance
   may be ours. 15. And they cast him out of the vineyard, and slew
   him. What then shall the proprietor of the vineyard do to them? 16. He
   will come and destroy those husbandmen, and give the vineyard to
   others. And when they heard this, they said, God forbid. 17. And he
   looked at them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone
   which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner? 18. Every
   one that shall fall on this stone will be bruised; but on whomsoever it
   shall fall, it will crush him. 19. And the chief priests and scribes
   sought at that hour to lay hands on him; (and they dreaded the people;)
   for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.


   Matthew 21:33. Hear another parable. The words of Luke are somewhat
   different; for he says that Christ spoke to the people, while here the
   discourse is addressed to the priests and scribes. But the solution is
   easy; for, though Christ spoke against them, he exposed their baseness
   in the presence of all the people. Mark says that Christ began to speak
   by parables, but leaves out what was first in order, as also in other
   passages he gives only a part of the whole. The substance of this
   parable is, that it is no new thing, if the priests and the other
   rulers of the Church wickedly endeavor to defraud God of his right; for
   long ago they practiced the same kind of robbery towards the prophets,
   and now they are ready to slay his Son; but they will not go
   unpunished, for God will arise to defend his right. The object is
   two-fold; first, to reproach the priests with base and wicked
   ingratitude; and, secondly, to remove the offense which would be
   occasioned by his approaching death. For, by means of a false title,
   they had gained such influence over simple persons and the ignorant
   multitude, that the religion of the Jews depended on their will and
   decision. Christ therefore forewarns the weak, and shows that, as so
   many prophets, one after another, had formerly been slain by the
   priests, no one ought to be distressed, if a similar instance were
   exhibited in his own person. But let us now examine it in detail.

   A man planted a vineyard. This comparison frequently occurs in
   Scripture. With respect to the present passage, Christ only means that,
   while God appoints pastors over his Church, he does not convey his
   right to others, but acts in the same manner as if a proprietor were to
   let a vineyard or field to a husbandman, who would labor in the
   cultivation of it, and make an annual return. As he complains by Isaiah
   (5:4) and Jeremiah, (2:21,) that he had received no fruit from the vine
   on the cultivation of which he had bestowed so much labor and expense;
   so in this passage he accuses the vine-dressers themselves, who, like
   base swindlers, appropriate to themselves the produce of the vineyard.
   Christ says that the vineyard was well furnished, and in excellent
   condition, when the husbandmen received it from the hands of the
   proprietor. By this statement he presents no slight aggravation of
   their crime; for the more generously he had acted toward them, the more
   detestable was their ingratitude. Paul employs the same argument, when
   he wishes to exhort pastors to be diligent in the discharge of their
   duty, that they are stewards, chosen to govern the house of God, which
   is the

   pillar and round of truth, (1 Timothy 3:16.)

   And properly; for the more honorable and illustrious their condition
   is, they lie under so much the deeper obligations to God, not to be
   indolent in their work. So much the more detestable (as we have already
   said) is the baseness of those who pour contempt on the great kindness
   of God, and on the great honor which they have already received from
   Him.

   God planted a vineyard, [43] when, remembering his gratuitous adoption,
   he brought the people out of Egypt, separated them anew to be his
   inheritance, and called them to the hope of eternal salvation,
   promising to be their God and Father; for this is the planting of which
   Isaiah speaks, (60:21; 61:3.) By the wine-press and the tower are meant
   the aids which were added for strengthening the faith of the people in
   the doctrine of the Law, such as, sacrifices and other ritual
   observances; for God, like a careful and provident head of a family,
   has left no means untried for granting to his Church all necessary
   protection.

   And let it to husbandmen. God might indeed of himself, without the
   agency of men, preserve his Church in good order; but he takes men for
   his ministers, and makes use of their hands. Thus, of old, he appointed
   priests to be, as it were, cultivators of the vineyard. But the wonder
   is, that Christ compares the prophets to servants, who are sent, after
   the vintage, to demand the fruit; [44] for we know that they too were
   vine-dressers, and that they held a charge in common with the priests.
   I reply, it was not necessary for Christ to be careful or exact in
   describing the resemblance or contrariety between those two orders. The
   priests were certainly appointed at first on the condition of
   thoroughly cultivating the Church by sound doctrine; but as they
   neglected the work assigned them, either through carelessness or
   ignorance, the prophets were sent as an extraordinary supply, to clear
   the vine from weeds, to lop off the superfluous wood, and in other ways
   to make up for the neglect of the priests; and, at the same time,
   severely to reprove the people, to raise up decayed piety, to awaken
   drowsy souls, and to bring back the worship of God and a new life. And
   what else was this than to demand the revenue which was due to God from
   his vineyard? All this Christ applies justly and truly to his purpose;
   for the regular and permanent government of his Church was not in the
   hands of the prophets, but was always held by the priests; just as if
   lazy husbandman, while he neglected cultivation, claimed the place to
   which he had been once appointed, under the plea of possession.

   35. And wounded one, and killed another. Here Mark andLuke differ a
   little from Matthew; for while Matthew mentions many servants, all of
   whom were ill-treated and insulted, and says that afterwards other
   servants were sent more numerous than the first, Mark and Luke mention
   but one at a time, as if the servants had been sent, not two or three
   together, but one after another. But though all the three Evangelists
   have the same object in view, namely, to show that the Jews will dare
   to act towards the Son in the same manner as they have repeatedly done
   towards the prophets, Matthew explains the matter more at large,
   namely, that God, by sending a multitude of prophets, contended with
   the malice of the priests. [45] Hence it appears how obstinate their
   malice was, for the correction of which no remedies were of any avail.
   [46]

   37. They will reverence my son. Strictly speaking, indeed, this thought
   does not apply to God; for He knew what would happen, and was not
   deceived by the expectation of a more agreeable result; but it is
   customary, [47] especially in parables, to ascribe to Him human
   feelings. And yet this was not added without reason; for Christ
   intended to represent, as in a mirror, how deplorable their impiety
   was, of which it was too certain a proof, that they rose in diabolical
   rage against the Son of God, who had come to bring them back to a sound
   mind. [48] As they had formerly, as far as lay in their power, driven
   God from his inheritance by the cruel murder of the prophets, so it was
   the crowning point of all their crimes to slay the Son, that they might
   reign, as in a house which wanted an heir. Certainly the chief reason
   why the priests raged against Christ was, that, they might not lose
   their tyranny, which might be said to be their prey; [49] for he it is
   by whom God chooses to govern, and to whom He has given all authority.

   The Evangelists differ also a little in the conclusion. For Matthew
   relates that he drew from them the confession, by which they condemned
   themselves; while Mark says simply that Christ declared what punishment
   must await servants so unprincipled and wicked. Luke differs, at first
   sight, more openly, by saying that they turned away with horror from
   the punishment which Christ had threatened. But if we examine the
   meaning more closely, there is no contradiction; for, in regard to the
   punishment which such servants deserved, there can be no doubt that
   they agreed with Christ, but when they perceived that both the crime
   and the punishment were made to apply to themselves, they deprecated
   that application.

   42. Have you never read in the Scriptures? We must remember what we
   said a little before, that, as the priests and scribes kept the people
   devoted to them, it was a principle current among them, that they alone
   were competent to judge and decide as to the future redemption, so that
   no one ought to be received as Messiah, unless he were approved and
   sanctioned by their voice. They therefore maintain that what Christ had
   said is impossible, that they would slay the son and heir of the
   proprietor of the vineyard. But Christ confirms his statement by the
   testimony of Scripture, and the interrogation is emphatic, as if he had
   said, "You reckon it highly absurd to say that it is possible for the
   vine dressers to conspire wickedly against the Son of God. But what
   then? Did the Scripture (Psalm 118:22) foretell that he would be
   received with joy, and favor, and applause; or did it not, on the
   contrary, foretell that the rulers themselves would oppose him?"

   The passage which he quotes is taken from the same psalm from which had
   been taken that joyful exclamation, [50] Save, [51] O Lord. Blessed is
   he that cometh in the name of the Lord. That it is a prediction of the
   reign of the Messiah is evident from this consideration, that David was
   appointed by God to be king, on the condition that his throne would
   remain forever, so long as the sun and moon would shine in heaven, and
   that, when decayed, it would again be restored by the favor of God to
   its former prosperity. Since, therefore, that psalm contains a
   description of the reign of David, there is also added the perpetuity
   of it, on which the restoration depends. If the discourse had related
   to any temporal reign, Christ would have acted improperly in applying
   it to himself. But we must also observe what sort of reign God raised
   up in the person of David. It was that which He would establish in the
   true Messiah to the end of the world; for that ancient anointing was
   but a shadow. Hence we infer that what was done in the person of David
   was a prelude and figure of Christ.

   Let us now return to the words of the psalm. The scribes and priests
   reckoned it incredible that Christ should be rejected [52] by the
   rulers of the Church. But he proves from the psalm, that he would be
   placed on his throne by the wonderful power of God, contrary to the
   will of men, and that this had already been shadowed out in David,
   whom, though rejected by the nobles, God took to give an instance and
   proof of what he would at length do in his Christ. The prophet takes
   the metaphor from buildings; for, since the Church is God's sanctuary,
   Christ, on whom it is founded, is justly called the corner stone; that
   is, the stone which supports the whole weight of the building. If one
   were to examine minutely every thing that relates to Christ, the
   comparison would not apply in every part; but it is perfectly
   appropriate, for on him the salvation of the Church rests, and by him
   its condition is preserved. And therefore the other prophets followed
   the same form of expression, particularly Isaiah and Daniel. But Isaiah
   makes the closest allusion to this passage, when he represents God as
   thus speaking,

   Lo, I lay in Zion a foundation-stone, a precious and elect stone,
   against which both houses of Israel shall stumble!
   (Isaiah 28:16.)

   The same mode of expression frequently occurs in the New Testament.

   The amount of it therefore is, that the kingdom of God will be founded
   on a stone, which the builders themselves will reject as unsuitable and
   useless; and the meaning is, that the Messiah, who is the foundation of
   the safety of the Church, will not be chosen by the ordinary suffrages
   of men, but that, when God shall miraculously raise him up by a secret
   and unknown power, the rulers, to whom has been committed the care of
   the building, will oppose and persecute him. There are two things here
   which we ought to consider. First, that we may not be perplexed by the
   wicked attempts of men, who rise up to hinder the reign of Christ, God
   has warned us beforehand that this will happen. Secondly, whatever may
   be the contrivances of men, God has at the same time declared, that in
   setting up the kingdom of Christ, His power will be victorious. Both
   ought to be carefully observed by us. It appears to be monstrous that
   the Author of salvation should be rejected, not by strangers, but by
   those who belonged to his own household, -- not by the ignorant
   multitude, but by the rulers themselves, who hold the government of the
   Church. Against such strange madness of men our faith ought to be
   fortified, that it may not give way through the novelty of the
   occurrence. We now perceive how useful that prediction is, which
   relieves godly minds from the terror that would otherwise be produced
   by the mournful spectacle. For nothing is more unreasonable than that
   the members should rise up against the head, the vine-dressers against
   the proprietor, the counselors against their king, and that the
   builders should reject the foundation of the building.

   That stone is made the head of the corner. Still more emphatic is this
   clause, in which God declares that the wicked, by rejecting Christ,
   will avail nothing, but that his rank will remain unimpaired. The
   design of it is, that believers, relying on that promise, may safely
   look down with contempt and derision on the wicked pride of men; for
   when they have made all their contrivances, Christ will still, ill
   opposition to their wishes, retain the place which the Father has
   appointed to him. How fiercely soever he may be assailed by those who
   appear to possess honor and dignity, he will nevertheless remain in his
   own rank, and will abate nothing on account of their wicked contempt.
   In short, the authority of God will prevail, that he may be the elect
   and precious stone, which supports the Church of God, his kingdom and
   temple. The stone is said to be made the head of the corner, not that
   he is only a part of the building, (since it is evident from other
   passages that the Church is entirely founded on Him alone,) but the
   prophet merely intended to state that he will be the chief support of
   the building. Some go into ingenious arguments about the word corner,
   that Christ is placed in the corner, because he unites two separate
   walls, the Gentiles and Jews. But in my opinion, David meant nothing
   more than that the corner-stone supports the chief weight of the
   building.

   It may now be asked, How does the Spirit call those men builders, who
   are so strongly bent on the ruin and destruction of the temple of God?
   For Paul boasts of having been an honest builder, because he founded
   the Church on Christ alone, (1 Corinthians 3:10, 11.) The answer is
   easy. Though they are unfaithful in the execution of the office
   committed to them, yet he gives them this title with respect to their
   calling. Thus the name prophet is often given to deceivers, and those
   who devour the flock like wolves are called pastors. And so far is this
   from conferring honor on them, that it renders them detestable, when
   they utterly overthrow the temple of God, which they were appointed to
   build. Hence we draw a useful warning, that the lawful calling does not
   prevent those who ought to have been the ministers of Christ from being
   sometimes his base and wicked enemies. The legal priesthood had
   certainly been appointed by God, and the Lord had bestowed on the
   Levites permission to govern the Church. Did they therefore discharge
   their office faithfully? or ought the godly to have obeyed them by
   renouncing Christ?

   Let the Pope now go with his mitered bishops, and let them boast that
   they ought to be believed in all things, because they occupy the place
   of pastors. Even granting that they were lawfully called to the
   government of the Church, yet they have no right to claim any thing
   more than to hold the title of prelates of the Church. But even the
   title of calling does not belong to them; for, in order to raise them
   to that tyranny, it would be necessary that the whole order of the
   Church should be overturned. And even though they might justly claim
   ordinary jurisdiction, yet, if they overturn the sacred house of God,
   it is only in name that they must be reckoned builders. Nor does it
   always happen that Christ is rejected by those who are entrusted with
   the government of the Church; for not only were there many godly
   priests under the Law, but also, under the reign of Christ, there are
   some pastors who labor diligently and honestly in building the Church;
   but as it was necessary that this prediction should be fulfilled, that
   the builders should reject the stone, wisdom must be exercised in
   distinguishing between them. And the Holy Spirit has expressly warned
   us, that none may be mistaken as to an empty title or the dignity of
   calling.

   This has been done by the Lord, As it is a matter too far removed from
   the ordinary judgment of men, that the pastors of the Church should
   themselves reject the Son of God from being their Prince, the prophet
   refers it to the secret purpose of God, which, though we cannot
   comprehend it by our senses, we ought to contemplate and admire. Let us
   therefore understand, that this cuts short every question, and that
   every man is expressly forbidden to judge and measure the nature of
   Christ's kingdom by the reason of the flesh; for what folly is it to
   wish to subject to the capacity of our mind a miracle which the prophet
   exhorts us to adore? Will you then receive nothing but what appears to
   yourself to be probable, in reference to the kingdom of Christ, the
   commencement of which the Holy Spirit declares to be a mystery worthy
   of the highest admiration, because it is concealed from the eyes of
   men? So then, whenever the question relates to the origin, restoration,
   condition, and the whole safety of the Church, we must not consult our
   senses, [53] but must honor the power of God by admiring his hidden
   work. [54] There is also an implied contrast between God and men; for
   not only are we commanded to embrace the wonderful method of governing
   the Church, because it is the work of God, but we are likewise
   withdrawn from a foolish reverence for men, which frequently obscures
   the glow of God; as if the prophet had said, that however magnificent
   may be the titles which men bear, it is wicked in any man to oppose
   them to God.

   This furnishes a refutation of the diabolical wickedness of the
   Papists, who do not scruple to prefer to the word of God a decision of
   their pretended Church. For on what does the authority of the word of
   God depend, according to them, but on the opinion of men, so that no
   more power is left to God than what the Church is pleased to allow him?
   Far otherwise does the Spirit instruct us by this passage namely, that
   as soon as the majesty of God [55] appears, the whole world ought to be
   silent.

   43. Therefore I say to you. Hitherto Christ directed his discourse to
   rulers and governors, but in presence of the people. Now, however, he
   addresses in the same manner the people themselves, and not without
   reason, for they had been the companions and assistants of the priests
   and scribes in hindering the grace of God. It was from the priests, no
   doubt, that the evil arose, but the people had already deserved, on
   account of their sins, to have such corrupt and degenerate pastors.
   Besides, the whole body was infected, as it were, by a similar malice
   to resist God. This is the reason why Christ denounces against all
   indiscriminately the dreadful vengeance of God; for as the priests were
   inflated with the desire of holding the highest power, so the rest of
   the people gloried on the ground of having been adopted. Christ now
   declares that God was not bound to them, and, therefore, that he will
   convey to another the honor of which they rendered themselves unworthy.
   And this, no doubt, was once spoken to them, but was written for the
   sake of all of us, that, if God choose us to be His people, we may not
   grow wanton through a vain and wicked confidence in the flesh, but may
   endeavor, on our part, to perform the duties which he enjoins on his
   children;

   for if he spared not the natural branches, (Romans 11:21,)

   what will he do with those which were engrafted? The Jews thought that
   the kingdom of God dwelt among them by hereditary right, and therefore
   they adhered obstinately to their vices. We have unexpectedly come into
   their room contrary to nature, and therefore much less is the kingdom
   of God bound to us, if it be not rooted in true godliness.

   Now as our minds ought to be struck with terror by the threatening of
   Christ, that those who have profaned the kingdom of God will be
   deprived of it, so the perpetuity of that kingdom, which is here
   described, may afford comfort to all the godly. For by these words
   Christ assures us that, though the ungodly destroyed the worship of God
   among themselves, they would never cause the name of Christ to be
   abolished, or true religion to perish; for God, in whose hand are all
   the ends of the earth, will find elsewhere a dwelling and habitation
   for his kingdom. We ought also to learn from this passage, that the
   Gospel is not preached in order that it may lie barren and inoperative,
   but that it may yield fruit.

   44. And he who shall fall on this stone. Christ confirms more fully the
   former statement, that he suffers no loss or diminution when he is
   rejected by the wicked, because, though their obstinacy were like a
   stone or like iron, yet by his own hardness he will break them, and
   therefore he will be the more highly glorified in their destruction. He
   perceived in the Jews an astonishing obstinacy, and therefore it was
   necessary that this kind of punishment should be described to them in
   an alarming manner, that they might not flatter themselves, while they
   thus dashed against him. This doctrine partly instructs us to give
   ourselves up gently, with a mild and tractable heart, to the dominion
   of Christ, and partly fortifies us against the obstinacy and furious
   attacks of the wicked, for whom there awaits a dreadful end.

   Those persons are said to fall upon Christ, who rush forward to destroy
   him; not that they occupy a more elevated position than he does, but
   because their madness carries them so far, that they endeavor to attack
   Christ as if he were below them. But Christ tells them that all that
   they will gain by it is, that by the very conflict they will be broken.
   But when they have thus proudly exalted themselves, he tells them that
   another thing will happen, which is, that they will be bruised under
   the stone, against which they so insolently dashed themselves.

   45. They knew that he spoke of them. The Evangelists show how little
   success Christ had, that we may not wonder if the doctrine of the
   Gospel does not bring all men, in the present day, to yield obedience
   to God. Let us also learn that it is impossible but that the rage of
   ungodly men will be more and more inflamed by threatenings; for as God
   seals his word on our hearts, so also it is a hot iron to wound bad
   consciences, in consequence of which their ungodliness is the more
   inflamed. We ought therefore to pray that he would subdue us to
   voluntary fear, lest the mere knowledge of his vengeance should
   exasperate us the more. When they are restrained solely by the dread of
   the people from laying their hands on Christ, let us learn that God had
   laid a bridle on them; from which also arises a very delightful
   consolation to believers, when they learn that God protects them, and
   constantly enables them to escape from the jaws of death.

   15. Then the Pharisees went away, and took counsel how they might
   entrap him in his words. 16. And they send to him their disciples, with
   the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest
   the way of God in truth, and carest not for any man; for thou regardest
   not the person of men. 17. Tell us then, What thinkest thou? Is it
   lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? 18. But Jesus, perceiving
   their wickedness, saith, Why do you tempt me, hypocrites? 19. Show me
   the tribute money. And they presented to him a denarius. 20. And he
   saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription? 21. They say to
   him, Caesar's. Then said he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the
   things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.
   22. And having heard these things, they wondered, and left him, and
   went away.

   13. And they send to him certain Pharisees and Herodians, to entrap him
   in his words 14. And they, when they came, said to him, Master, we know
   that thou art true, and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not
   the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful
   to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give?
   15. But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you tempt me?
   Bring me a denarius, that I may see it. 16. And they brought it; and he
   saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to
   him, Caesars. 17. And Jesus answering said to them, Render to Caesar
   those things which are Caesar's, and to God those things which are
   God's. [56] And they wondered at him. [57]

   20. And they watched him, and sent spies, who would pretend to be
   righteous men, to entrap him in his words, and to deliver him to the
   authority and power of the governor. 21. And they put a question to
   him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest uprightly,
   and regardest not a person, [58] but teachest the way of God in truth.
   22. Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 23. And
   having perceived their craftiness, he said to them, Why do you tempt
   me? 24. Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription hath it? They
   answering said, Caesar's. 25. And he said to them, Render therefore to
   Caesar those things which are Caesar's, and to God those things which
   are God's. 26. And they could not find fault with his words in presence
   of the people; and wondering at his reply, they were silent.


   Matthew 22:15. That they might entrap him in his words. The Pharisees,
   perceiving that all their other attempts against Christ had been
   fruitless, at length concluded that the best and most expeditious
   method of destroying him was, to deliver him to the governor, as a
   seditious person and a disturber of the peace. There was at that time,
   as we have seen under another passage, [59] a great disputing among the
   Jews about the tribute-money; for, since the Romans had claimed for
   themselves the tribute-money, which God commanded to be paid to Himself
   under the Law of Moses, (Exodus 30:13,) the Jews everywhere complained
   that it was a shameful and intolerable crime for profane men to lay
   claim, in this manner, to a divine prerogative; besides that, as this
   payment of tribute, which was enjoined on them by the Law, was a
   testimony of their adoption, they looked upon themselves as deprived of
   an honor to which they had a just claim. Now the deeper any man's
   poverty was, [60] the bolder did it render him to raise sedition.

   This trick of taking Christ by surprise is therefore continued by the
   Pharisees, that, in whatever way he reply as to the tribute money, they
   may lay snares for him. If he affirm that they ought not to pay, he
   will be convicted of sedition. If, on the contrary, he acknowledge it
   to be justly due, he will be held to be an enemy of his nation, and a
   betrayer of the liberty of his country. Their principal object is, to
   lead the people to dislike him. This is the entrapping to which the
   Evangelists refer; for they suppose that Christ is surrounded on all
   sides by nets, so that he can no longer escape. Having avowed
   themselves to be his enemies, and knowing that they would, on that
   account, be suspected, they put forward -- as Matthew states -- some of
   their disciples. Luke, again, calls them spies, who pretended to be
   righteous men; that is, persons who deceitfully professed an honest and
   proper desire to learn: for the pretense of righteousness is not here
   used in a general sense, but is limited to the present occasion,
   because they would not have been received, had they not made a pretense
   of docility and of genuine zeal.

   With the Herodians. They take along with them the Herodians, because
   they were more favorable to the Roman government, and therefore would
   be more disposed to raise an accusation. It is worthy of attention
   that, though those sects had fierce contentions with each other, so
   bitter was their hatred against Christ, that they conspired to destroy
   him. What the sect of the Herodions was, we have formerly explained
   [61] for, Herod being only half a Jew, or a spurious and corrupt
   professor of the Law, those who desired that the Law should be kept
   with exactness and in every part, condemned him and his impure worship;
   but he had his flatterers, who gave plausible excuses for his false
   doctrine. In addition to the other sects, therefore, there sprung up at
   that time a religion of the Court.

   16. Master, we know that thou art true. This is the righteousness which
   they counterfeit, when they offer humble subjection to Christ, as if
   they were desirous to learn, and as if they not only had some relish
   for piety, but also were fully convinced of his doctrine; for if what
   they said had been from the heart, this would have been true
   uprightness. And therefore from their words we may obtain a definition
   of a good and faithful teacher, such as they pretended to believe
   Christ to be. They say that he is true, and teaches the way of God;
   that is, he is a faithful interpreter of God, and that he teaches it in
   truth; that is, without any corruption. The way of God is contrasted
   with the inventions of men, and with all foreign doctrines; and truth
   is contrasted with ambition, covetousness, and other wicked
   dispositions, which usually corrupt the purity of instruction. So then
   he ought to be reckoned a true teacher, who does not introduce the
   contrivances of men, or depart from the pure word of God, but gives
   out, as it were, with his hands what he has learned from the mouth of
   God, and who, from a sincere desire of edification, accommodates his
   doctrine to the advantage and salvation of the people, and does not
   debase it by any disguise. As to this latter clause, when Paul asserts
   that he

   does not make merchandise of the word of God,
   (2 Corinthians 2:17,)

   he means that there are some persons who use dexterity, and do not
   openly overturn sound doctrine, or incur the disgrace of holding wicked
   opinions, but who disguise and corrupt the purity of doctrine, because
   they are ambitious, or covetous, or easily turned in various directions
   according to their earnest desire. He therefore compares them to
   jockeys, (kupelleuontes,) because they deprave the pure use of the word
   of God.

   For thou regardest not the person of men. It is also worthy of
   attention, that those hypocrites likewise add, that Christ teaches
   rightly, because he has no regard for the person of men. Nothing has a
   more powerful tendency to withdraw teachers from a faithful and upright
   dispensation of the word than to pay respect to men; for it is
   impossible that any one who

   desires to please men (Galatians 1:10)

   should truly devote himself to God. Some attention, no doubt, is due to
   men, but not so as to obtain their favor by flattery. In short, in
   order to walk uprightly, we must necessarily put away respect of
   persons, which obscures the light and perverts right judgment, as God
   frequently inculcates in the Law, (Deuteronomy 1:16; 16:19,) and as
   experience also points out. Thus Christ (John 7:24) contrasts
   acceptance of persons (prosopolepsian) and sound judgment as things
   totally different.

   18. Knowing their malice. They had opened the conversation in such a
   manner that they did not appear to differ at all from excellent
   scholars. Whence then had Christ this knowledge, but because his Spirit
   was a discerner of hearts? It was not by human conjecture that he
   perceived their cunning, but because he was God he penetrated into
   their hearts, and therefore they gained nothing by attempting the
   concealment of flattery and of pretended righteousness Accordingly,
   before giving a reply, he exhibited a proof of his Divinity by laying
   open their concealed malice. Now since wicked men every day employ
   snares of the same kind, while their inward malice is concealed from
   us, we ought to pray to Christ to bestow upon us the spirit of
   discernment, and that what he had by nature and by his own right he may
   grant to us by a free gift. How much we need this prudence, is evident
   from the consideration that, if we do not guard against the snares of
   the wicked, we shall constantly expose the doctrine of God to their
   calumnies.

   19. Show me the tribute-money. When Christ orders them to bring forward
   a coin, though at first sight it appears to be of no great importance,
   yet it is sufficient for breaking their snares. In this way they had
   already made an acknowledgment of subjection, so that Christ did not
   find it necessary to enjoin upon them any thing new. The coin was
   stamped with Caesar's likeness; and thus the authority of the Roman
   government had been approved and admitted by the general practice.
   Hence it was evident that the Jews themselves had voluntarily come
   under obligation to pay tribute for they had given up to the Romans the
   power of the sword; [62] and there was no propriety in making a
   separate dispute about the tribute-money, for that question depended on
   the general arrangements of the government.

   21. Render therefore to Caesar those things which are Caesar's. Christ
   reminds them that, as the subjection of their nation was attested by
   the coin, there ought to be no debate on that subject; as if he had
   said, "If you think it strange to pay tribute, be not subjects of the
   Roman Empire. But the money (which men employ as the pledge of mutual
   exchanges) attests that Caesar rules over you; so that, by your own
   silent consent, the liberty to which you lay claim is lost and gone."
   Christ's reply does not leave the matter open, but contains full
   instruction on the question which had been proposed. It lays down a
   clear distinction between spiritual and civil government, in order to
   inform us that outward subjection does not prevent us from having
   within us a conscience free in the sight of God. For Christ intended to
   refute the error of those who did not think that they would be the
   people of God, unless they were free from every yoke of human
   authority. In like manner, Paul earnestly insists on this point, that
   they ought not the less to look upon themselves as serving God alone,
   if they obey human laws, if they pay tribute, and bend the neck to bear
   other burdens, (Romans 13:7.) In short, Christ declares that it is no
   violation of the authority of God, or any injury done to his service,
   if, in respect of outward government, the Jews obey the Romans.

   He appears also to glance at their hypocrisy, because, while they
   carelessly permitted the service of God to be corrupted in many
   respects, and even wickedly deprived God of his authority, they
   displayed such ardent zeal about a matter of no importance; as if he
   had said, "You are exceedingly afraid, lest, if tribute be paid to the
   Romans, the honor of God may be infringed; but you ought rather to take
   care to yield to God that service which he demands from you, and, at
   the same the to render to men what is their due." We might be apt to
   think, no doubt, that the distinction does not apply; for, strictly
   speaking, when we perform our duty towards men, we thereby render
   obedience to God. But Christ, accommodating his discourse to the common
   people, reckoned it enough to draw a distinction between the spiritual
   kingdom of God, on the one hand, and political order and the condition
   of the present life, on the other. We must therefore attend to this
   distinction, that, while the Lord wishes to be the only Lawgiver for
   governing souls, the rule for worshipping Him must not be sought from
   any other source than from His own word, and that we ought to abide by
   the only and pure worship which is there enjoined; but that the power
   of the sword, the laws, and the decisions of tribunals, do not hinder
   the worship of God from remaining entire amongst us.

   But this doctrine extends still farther, that every man, according to
   his calling, ought to perform the duty which he owes to men; that
   children ought willingly to submit to their parents, and servants to
   their masters; that they ought to be courteous and obliging towards
   each other, according to the law of charity, provided that God always
   retain the highest authority, to which every thing that can be due to
   men is, as we say, subordinate. [63] The amount of it therefore is,
   that those who destroy political order are rebellious against God, and
   therefore, that obedience to princes and magistrates is always joined
   to the worship and fear of God; but that, on the other hand, if princes
   claim any part of the authority of God, we ought not to obey them any
   farther than can be done without offending God.

   22 They wondered at him. Here, too, it appears how God turns to a
   different purpose the wicked attempts of His enemies, and not only
   disappoints their expectation, but even drives them back with disgrace.
   It will sometimes happen, no doubt, that wicked men, though vanquished,
   do not cease to growl; but, though their insolence be not subdued,
   however numerous may be their assaults on the Word of God, there is an
   equal number of victories which God has in his hand, to triumph over
   them and Satan their head. But in this reply, Christ intended to give a
   peculiar display of his glory, by compelling those men to depart
   crowned with shame.

   23. The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no
   resurrection, and interrogated him, 24. Saying, Master, Moses said, If
   a man die, not having a child, [64] his brother shall marry his wife,
   and raise up seed to his brother. 25. Now there were amongst us seven
   brothers, and the first, having married a wife, died, and, having no
   seed, left his wife to his brother. 26. In like manner, the second, and
   the third, till the seventh. 27. And last of all the woman died also.
   28. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife shall she be of the
   seven? for they all had her. 29. And Jesus answering said to them, You
   err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. 30. For in the
   resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as
   the angels of God in heaven. 31. But as to the resurrection of the
   dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying, 32. I am
   the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is
   not the God of the dead, but of the living. 33. And when the multitudes
   heard it, they were astonished at his doctrine.

   18. And the Sadducees come to him, who say that there is no
   resurrection; and they interrogated him, saying, 19. Master, Moses
   wrote to us, that, if any man's brother die, and leave a wife, and do
   not leave children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed
   to his brother. 20. There were seven brothers; and the first took a
   wife, and he, dying, left no seed. 21. And the second took her, and
   died, and neither did he leave any seed; and the third likewise.
   22. And the seven took her, and did not leave seed. And last of all the
   wife died also. 23. In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall
   rise again, whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her for
   a wife. 24. And Jesus answering said to them, Is it not the reason why
   you err, that you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
   25. For when they shall rise again from the dead, they neither marry
   nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God who are in
   heaven. 26. But as to the dead, that they rise again, have you not read
   in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him in the bush, saying, I am
   the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 27. God
   is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living; therefore you
   greatly err.

   27. And some of the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection,
   came, and interrogated him, 28. Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, that
   if any man's brother die having a wife, and he die without children,
   his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
   29. Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and died
   without children. 30. And the second took her, and also died without
   children. 31. And the third took her, and in like manner all the seven,
   and left no children, and died. 32. Last of all the woman also died.
   33. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of them shall she be?
   for the seven had her for a wife. 34. And Jesus answering said unto
   them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage.
   35. But they who shall be counted worthy of that world, [65] and of the
   resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.
   36. For they cannot die anymore; for they are equal to the angels, and
   are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
   37. But that the dead rise again, even Moses showed at the bush, when
   he says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
   the God of Jacob. 38. But he is not the God of the dead, but of the
   living; for all live to him. 39. And some of the scribes answering,
   said, Master, thou hast spoken well. 40. And they did not venture to
   put any more questions to him.


   Matthew 22:23. The same day came to him the Sadducees. We see here how
   Satan brings together all the ungodly, who in other respects differ
   widely from each other, to attack the truth of God. For, though deadly
   strife existed between these two sects, [66] yet they conspire together
   against Christ; so that the Pharisees are not displeased to have their
   own doctrine attacked in the person of Christ. Thus in the present day,
   we see all the forces of Satan, though in other respects they are
   opposed to each other, rising on every hand against Christ. And so
   fierce is the hatred with which the Papists burn against the Gospel,
   that they willingly support Epicureans, Libertines, and other monsters
   of that description, provided that they can avail themselves of their
   aid for accomplishing its destruction. In short, we see that they come
   out of various camps to make an attack on Christ; and that this was
   done, because all of them alike hated the light of sound doctrine. Now
   the Sadducees propose a question to Christ, that by the appearance of
   absurdity they may either lead him to take part in their error, or, if
   he disagree with them, that they may hold him up to disgrace and
   ridicule among an uneducated and ignorant multitude. It is no doubt
   possible, that they had been formerly accustomed to employ this
   sophistry for harassing the Pharisees, but now they attempt to take
   Christ in the same snare.

   Who say that there is no resurrection. How the sect of the Sadducees
   originated we have explained under another passage. Luke assures us
   that they denied not only the final resurrection of the body, but also
   the immortality of the soul, (Acts 23:8.) And, indeed, if we consider
   properly the doctrine of Scripture, the life of the soul, apart from
   the hope of the resurrection, will be a mere dream; for God does not
   declare that, immediately after the death of the body, souls live, --
   as if their glory and happiness were already enjoyed by them in
   perfections -- but delays the expectation of them till the last day. I
   readily acknowledge that the philosophers, who were ignorant of the
   resurrection of the body, have many discussions about the immortal
   essence of the soul; but they talk so foolishly about the state of the
   future life that their opinions have no weight. But since the
   Scriptures inform us that the spiritual life depends on the hope of the
   resurrection, and that souls, when separated from the bodies, look
   forward to it, whoever destroys the resurrection deprives souls also of
   their immortality.

   Now this enables us to perceive the dreadful confusion of the Jewish
   Church, that their rulers [67] in religious matters took away the
   expectation of a future life, so that, after the death of the body, men
   differed in no respect from brute beasts. They did not indeed deny that
   our lives ought to be holy and righteous, and were not so profane as to
   consider the worship of God to be superfluous; on the contrary, they
   maintained that God is the Judge of the world, and that the affairs of
   men are directed by His providence. But as the reward of the godly, and
   likewise the punishment due to the wicked, were limited by them to the
   present life, even though there had been truth in their assertion, that
   every man is now treated impartially according to his merit, [68] yet
   it was excessively absurd to restrict the promises of God within such
   narrow limits. Now experience plainly shows that they were chargeable
   with the grossest stupidity, since it is manifest that the reward which
   is laid up for the good is left incomplete till another life, and
   likewise that the punishment of the wicked is not wholly inflicted in
   this world.

   In short, it is impossible to conceive any thing more absurd than this
   dream, that men formed after the image of God are extinguished by death
   like the beasts. But how disgraceful and monstrous was it that while,
   among the profane and blind idolaters of all nations, some notion, at
   least, of a future life still lingered, among the Jews, the peculiar
   people of God, this seed of piety was destroyed. I do not mention that,
   when they saw that the holy fathers earnestly aspired to the heavenly
   life, and that the covenant which God had made with them was spiritual
   and eternal, they must have been worse than stupid who remained blind
   in the midst of such clear light. But, first, this was the just reward
   of those who had split the Church of God into sects; and, secondly, in
   this manner the Lord avenged the wicked contempt of His doctrine.

   24. Master, Moses said. As it was enough to mention the bare fact, why
   do they make use of this preface? They cunningly employ the name of
   Moses, for the purpose of proving that they were lawful marriages,
   which had been contracted not by the will of men, but by the command
   and appointment of God himself. But that God should contradict Himself
   is impossible. Their sophistry therefore is this: "If God shall one day
   collect believers into His kingdom, He will restore whatever He had
   given to them in the world. What then shall become of the woman, whom
   God assigned to seven husbands?" Thus all ungodly persons and heretics
   forge their calumnies, that by means of them they may disfigure the
   true doctrine of godliness, and put to shame the servants of Christ.
   Nay, the Papists are restrained by no shame from openly ridiculing God
   and his word, when they attempt to take us by surprise. And not without
   reason, therefore, does Paul enjoin a teacher to be furnished with
   armor for repelling the adversaries of the truth, (Titus 1:9.) With
   respect to the law, (Deuteronomy 25:5,) by which God commanded the
   relatives, who were nearest of kin, to succeed the dead in marriage, if
   the first had died without children, the reason was, that the woman who
   had married into a particular family should leave offspring in it. But
   if there had been children by the first marriage, a marriage within the
   degrees forbidden by the law (Leviticus 18:16) would have been
   incestuous.

   29. You err, not knowing the Scriptures. Though Christ addresses the
   Sadducees, yet this reproof applies generally to all inventors of false
   doctrines. For, since God makes known His will clearly in the
   Scriptures, the want of acquaintance with them is the source and cause
   of all errors. But this is no ordinary consolation to the godly, that
   they will be safe from the danger of erring, so long as they humbly,
   modestly, and submissively inquire from the Scriptures what is right
   and true. As to the power of God being connected by Christ with the
   word, it refers to the present occasion. For, since the resurrection
   far exceeds the capacity of the human senses, it will be incredible to
   us, till our minds rise to the contemplation of the boundless power of
   God, by which, as Paul tells us,

   he is able to subdue all things to himself, (Philippians 3:21.)

   Besides, the Sadducees must have been void of understanding, when they
   committed the error of estimating the glory of the heavenly life
   according to the present state. In the meantime, we learn that those
   men form and express just and wise sentiments respecting the mysteries
   of the heavenly kingdom, who join the power of God with the Scriptures.

   30. But are like the angels of God in heaven. He does not mean that the
   children of God will be, in all respects, like the angels, but only so
   far as they shall be free from every infirmity of the present life;
   thus affirming that they will no longer be exposed to the wants of a
   frail and perishing life. Luke expresses more clearly the nature of the
   resemblance, that they can no longer die, and therefore there will be
   no propagation of their species, as on earth. Now he speaks of
   believers only, for no mention had been made of the wicked.

   But a question arises, Why does he say that they will then be the
   children of God, because they will be children of the resurrection;
   since God bestows this honor on those who believe on him, though shut
   up within the frail prison of the body? And how would we be heirs of
   eternal life after death, unless God already acknowledged us as
   children? I reply: As we are engrafted by faith into the body of
   Christ, we are adopted by God as his children, and of this adoption the
   Spirit is the witness, seal, earnest, and pledge, so that with this
   assurance

   we may freely cry, Abba, Father, (Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6.)

   Now though we know that we are the children of God, yet as it doth not
   yet appear what we shall be, till, transformed into his glory, we shall
   see him as he is,
   (1 John 3:2,)

   we are not as yet actually reckoned to be his children. And though we
   are renewed by the Spirit of God, yet as

   our life is still hidden, (Colossians 3:3,)

   the manifestation of it will truly and perfectly distinguish us from
   strangers. In this sense our adoption is said by Paul to be delayed
   till the last day, (Romans 8:23.).

   Luke 20:37. But that the dead shall rise. After having refuted the
   objection brought against him, Christ confirms, by the testimony of
   Scripture, the doctrine of the final resurrection. And this is the
   order which must always be observed. Having repelled the calumnies of
   the enemies of the truth, we must make them understand that they oppose
   the word of God; for until they are convicted by the testimony of
   Scripture, they will always be at liberty to rebel. Christ quotes a
   passage from Moses, because he was dealing with the Sadducees, who had
   no great faith in the prophets, or who, at least, held them in no
   higher estimation than we do the Book of Ecclesiasticus, or the History
   of the Maccabees. Another reason was, that, as they had brought forward
   Moses, he chose rather to refer to the same writer than to quote any of
   the prophets. Besides, he did not aim at collecting all the passages of
   Scripture, as we see that the apostles do not always make use of the
   same proofs on the same subject.

   And yet we must not imagine that there were no good reasons why Christ
   seized on this passage (Exodus 3:6) in preference to others; but he
   selected it with the best judgment -- though it might appear to be some
   what obscure -- because it ought to have been well known and distinctly
   remembered by the Jews, being a declaration that they were redeemed by
   God, because they were the children of Abraham. There, indeed, God
   declares that he is come down to deliver an afflicted people, but at
   the same time adds, that he acknowledges that people as his own, in
   respect of adoption, on account of the covenant which he had made with
   Abraham. How comes it that God regards the dead rather than the living,
   but because he assigns the first rank of honor to the fathers, in whose
   hands he had placed his covenant? And in what respect would they have
   the preference, if they had been extinguished by death? This is clearly
   expressed also by the nature of the relation; for as no man can be a
   father without children, nor a king without a people, so, strictly
   speaking, the Lord cannot be called the God of any but the living.

   Christ's argument, however, is drawn not so much from the ordinary form
   of expression as from the promise which is contained in these words.
   For the Lord offers himself to be our God on the condition of receiving
   us, on the other hand, as his people, which alone is sufficient for the
   assurance of perfect happiness. Hence that saying of the Church by the
   prophet Habakkuk, (1:12,)

   Thou art our God from the beginning: we shall not die

   Since, therefore, the Lord promises salvation to all to whom he
   declares that he is their God, and since he says this respecting
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, it follows that there remains for the dead a
   hope of life. If it be objected, that souls may continue to exist,
   though there be no resurrection of the dead, I replied, a little
   before, that those two are connected, because souls aspire to the
   inheritance laid up for them, though they do not yet reach that
   condition.

   38. For all live to him. This mode of expression is employed in various
   senses in Scripture; but here it means that believers, after that they
   have died in this world, lead a heavenly life with God; as Paul says
   that Christ, after having been admitted to the heavenly glory, liveth
   to God, (Romans 6:10) because he is freed from the infirmities and
   afflictions of this passing life. But here Christ expressly reminds us,
   that we must not form a judgment of the life of the godly according to
   the perceptions of the flesh, because that life is concealed under the
   secret keeping of God. For if, while they are pilgrims in the world,
   they bear a close resemblance to dead men, much less does any
   appearance of life exist in them after the death of the body. But God
   is faithful to preserve them alive in his presence, beyond the
   comprehension of men.

   39. And some of the scribes answering. As it is probable that all of
   them were actuated by evil dispositions towards him, this confession
   was extorted, by a secret exercise of divine power, from some of them,
   that is, from the Pharisees. It may be that, though they could have
   wished that Christ had been disgracefully vanquished and silenced, when
   they perceived that his reply has fortified them against the opposite
   sect, [69] ambition led them to congratulate him on having obtained a
   victory. Perhaps, too, they burned with envy, and did not wish that
   Christ should be put down by the Sadducees. [70] Meanwhile, it was
   brought about by the wonderful providence of God, that even his most
   deadly enemies assented to his doctrine. Their insolence, to was
   restrained, not only because they saw that Christ was prepared to
   sustain every kind of attack, but because they feared that they would
   be driven back with disgrace, which already had frequently occurred;
   and because they were ashamed of allowing him, by their silence, to
   carry off the victory, by which his influence over the people would be
   greatly increased. When Matthew says that all were astonished at his
   doctrine, we ought to observe that the doctrine of religion was at that
   time corrupted by so many wicked or frivolous opinions, that it was
   justly regarded as a miracle that the hope of the resurrection was so
   ably and appropriately proved from the Law.

   34. But when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to
   silence, they assembled together. 35. And one of them, a doctor of the
   law, put a question to him, tempting him, and saying, 36. Master, which
   is the great commandment in the law? 37. Jesus saith to him, Thou shalt
   love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
   with all thy mind. 38. This is the first and great commandment. 39. And
   the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as much as thyself.
   40. On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.

   28. And when one of the scribes came, and heard them disputing
   together, and saw that he had answered them well, he put a question to
   him, Which is the first commandment of all? 29. And Jesus answered him,
   The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God
   is one Lord. 30. And, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
   strength; this is the first commandment. 31. And the second, which is
   like it, is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: there is no
   other commandment greater than these. 32. And the scribe said to him,
   Master, thou hast answered well with truth, that there is one God, and
   there is no other besides him. 33. And that to love him with all the
   heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with
   all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is better than
   all the burnt offerings and sacrifices. 34. And Jesus, when he saw that
   he had replied skillfully, said to him, Thou art not far from the
   kingdom of God. And after that, no man ventured to put a question to
   him.

   25. And, lo, a certain lawyer [71] rose up, tempting him, and saying,
   Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 26. And he said to
   him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? 27. He answering
   said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
   thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
   neighbor as thyself. 28. And he said to him, Thou hast answered right:
   do this, and thou shalt live. 29. But he wishing to justify himself,
   said to Jesus, and Who is my neighbor? 30. And Jesus answering said, A
   certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among
   robbers, who even stripped him of his raiment, and, having wounded him,
   went away, leaving him half-dead. 31. And it happened that a certain
   priest came down that way, and having seen him, passed by. 32. And in
   like manner a Levite, going near the place, having approached and seen
   him, passed by. 33. And a certain Samaritan, on his journey, came to
   him, and when he saw him, was moved with compassion. 34. And
   approaching, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and, setting
   him on his own beast, conducted him to an inn, and took care of him.
   35. And, next day, as he was departing, he drew out two denarii, and
   gave them to the landlord, and said to him, Take care of him, and
   whatever thou spendest more, when I return, I will repay thee.
   36. Which therefore of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor to him
   who fell among robbers? 37. And he said, He who took compassion on
   him. Jesus therefore said to him, Go, and do thou in like manner.


   Although I think that this narrative has nothing more than a
   resemblance to what is related by Matthew in the 22^nd, and by Mark in
   the 12^th chapter, of his Gospel, and that they are not the same; I
   have chosen to collect them into one place, because, while Matthew and
   Mark affirm that this was the last question by which our Lord was
   tempted, Luke makes no mention of that circumstance, and seems
   intentionally to leave it out, because he had stated it in another
   passage. And yet I do not dispute that it may be the same narrative,
   though Luke has some things different from the other two. They all
   agree in this, that the scribe put a question for the sake of tempting
   Christ; but he who is described by Matthew and Mark goes away with no
   bad disposition; for he acquiesces in Christ's reply, and shows a sign
   of a teachable and gentle mind: to which must be added, that Christ, on
   the other hand, declares that he is not far from the kingdom of God.
   Luke, on the other hand, introduces a man who was obstinate and swelled
   with pride, in whom no evidence of repentance is discovered. Now there
   would be no absurdity in saying that Christ was repeatedly tempted on
   the subject of true righteousness, and of keeping the Law, and of the
   rule of a good life. But whether Luke has related this out of its
   proper place, or whether he has now passed by the other question --
   because that former narrative relating to doctrine was sufficient --
   the similarity of the doctrine seemed to require me to compare the
   three Evangelists with each other.

   Let us now see what was the occasion that led this scribe to put a
   question to Christ. It is because, being an expounder of the Law, he is
   offended at the doctrine of the gospel, by which he supposes the
   authority of Moses to be diminished. At the same time, he is not so
   much influenced by zeal for the Law, as by displeasure at losing some
   part of the honor of his teaching. He therefore inquires at Christ, if
   he wishes to profess any thing more perfect than the Law; for, though
   he does not say this in words, yet his question is ensnaring, for the
   purpose of exposing Christ to the hatred of the people. Matthew and
   Mark do not attribute this stratagem to one man only, but show that it
   was done by mutual arrangement, and that out of the whole sect one
   person was chosen who was thought to excel the rest in ability and
   learning. In the form of the question, too, Luke differs somewhat from
   Matthew and Mark; for, according to him, the scribe inquires what men
   must do to obtain eternal life, but according to the other two
   Evangelists, he inquires what is the chief commandment in the law. But
   the design is the same, for he makes a deceitful attack on Christ,
   that, if he can draw any thing from his lips that is at variance with
   the law, he may exclaim against him as an apostate and a promoter of
   ungodly revolt.

   Luke 10:26. What is written in the law? He receives from Christ a reply
   different from what he had expected. And, indeed, no other rule of a
   holy and righteous life was prescribed by Christ than what had been
   laid down by the Law of Moses; for the perfect love of God and of our
   neighbors comprehends the utmost perfection of righteousness. Yet it
   must be observed, that Christ speaks here about obtaining salvation, in
   agreement with the question which had been put to him; for he does not
   teach absolutely, as in other passages, how men may arrive at eternal
   life, but how they ought to live, in order to be accounted righteous in
   the sight of God. Now it is certain that in the Law there is prescribed
   to men a rule by which they ought to regulate their life, so as to
   obtain salvation in the sight of God. That the Law can do nothing else
   than condemn, and is therefore called the doctrine of death, and is
   said by Paul to increase transgressions, (Romans 7:13,) arises not from
   any fault of its doctrine, but because it is impossible for us to
   perform what it enjoins. Therefore, though no man is justified by the
   Law yet the Law itself contains the highest righteousness, because it
   does not falsely hold out salvation to its followers, if any one fully
   observed all that it commands. [72] Nor ought we to look upon this as a
   strange manner of teaching, that God first demands the righteousness of
   works, and next offers a gratuitous righteousness without works; for it
   is necessary that men should be convinced of their righteous
   condemnation, that they may betake themselves to the mercy of God.
   Accordingly, Paul (Romans 10:5, 6) compares both kinds of
   righteousness, in order to inform us that the reason why we are freely
   justified by God is, that we have no righteousness of our own. Now
   Christ in this reply accommodated himself to the lawyer, and attended
   to the nature of his question; for he had inquired not how salvation
   must be sought, but by what works it must be obtained.

   Matthew 22:37. Thou shalt love the Lord thou God. According to Mark,
   the preface is inserted, that Jehovah alone is the God of Israel; by
   which words God supports the authority of his law in two ways. For,
   first, it ought to be a powerful excitement to the worship of God, when
   we are fully convinced that we worship the actual Creator of heaven and
   earth, because indifference is naturally produced by doubt; and,
   secondly, because it is a pleasing inducement to love him, when he
   freely adopts us as his people. So then, that they may not hesitate, as
   usually happens in cases of uncertainty, the Jews are informed that the
   rule of life is prescribed to them by the true and only God; and, on
   the other hand, that they may not be kept back by distrust, God
   approaches to them in a familiar manner, and reminds them of his
   gracious covenant with them. And yet there is no reason to doubt that
   the Lord distinguishes himself from all idols, that the Jews may not be
   drawn aside from him, but may adhere to the pure worship of God
   himself. Now if uncertainty does not keep back the wretched worshippers
   of idols from being carried away to the love of them by impetuous zeal,
   what excuse is left for the hearers of the Law, if they remain
   indifferent, after that God has revealed himself to them?

   What follows is an abridgment of the Law, [73] which is also found in
   the writings of Moses, (Deuteronomy 6:5.) For, though it is divided
   into two tables, the first of which relates to the worship of God, and
   the second to charity, Moses properly and wisely draws up this summary,
   [74] that the Jews may perceive what is the will of God in each of the
   commandments. And although we ought to love God far more than men, yet
   most properly does God, instead of worship or honor, require love from
   us, because in this way he declares that no other worship is pleasing
   to Him than what is voluntary; for no man will actually obey God but he
   who loves Him. But as the wicked and sinful inclinations of the flesh
   draw us aside from what is right, Moses shows that our life will not be
   regulated aright till the love of God fill all our senses. Let us
   therefore learn, that the commencement of godliness is the love of God,
   because God disdains the forced services of men, and chooses to be
   worshipped freely and willingly; and let us also learn, that under the
   love of God is included the reverence due to him.

   Moses does not add the mind, but mentions only the heart, and the soul,
   and the strength; and though the present division into four clauses is
   more full, yet it does not alter the sense. For while Moses intends to
   teach generally that God ought to be perfectly loved, and that whatever
   powers belong to men ought to be devoted to this object, he reckoned it
   enough, after mentioning the soul and the heart, to add the strength,
   that he might not leave any part of us uninfluenced by the love of God;
   and we know also that under the word heart the Hebrews sometimes
   include the mind, [75] particularly when it is joined to the word soul
   What is the difference between the mind and the heart, both in this
   passage and in Matthew, I do not trouble myself to inquire, except that
   I consider the mind to denote the loftier abode of reason, from which
   all our thoughts and deliberations flow.

   It now appears from this summary that, in the commandments of the Law,
   God does not look at what men can do, but at what they ought to do;
   since in this infirmity of the flesh it is impossible that perfect love
   can obtain dominion, for we know how strongly all the senses of our
   soul are disposed to vanity. Lastly, we learn from this, that God does
   not rest satisfied with the outward appearance of works, but chiefly
   demands the inward feelings, that from a good root good fruits may
   grow.

   39. And the second is like it. He assigns the second place to mutual
   kindness among men, for the worship of God is first in order. The
   commandment to love our neighbors, he tells us, is like the first,
   because it depends upon it. For, since every man is devoted to himself,
   there will never be true charity towards neighbors, unless where the
   love of God reigns; for it is a mercenary love [76] which the children
   of the world entertain for each other, because every one of them has
   regard to his own advantage. On the other hand, it is impossible for
   the love of God to reign without producing brotherly kindness among
   men.

   Again, when Moses commanded us to love our neighbors as ourselves, he
   did not intend to put the love of ourselves in the first place, so that
   a man may first love himself and then love his neighbors; as the
   sophists of the Sorbonne are wont to cavil, that a rule must always go
   before what it regulates. But as we are too much devoted to ourselves,
   Moses, in correcting this fault, places our neighbors in an equal rank
   with us; thus forbidding every man to pay so much attention to himself
   as to disregard others, because kindness unites all in one body. And by
   correcting the self-love (philautian) which separates some persons from
   others, he brings each of them into a common union, and--as it
   were--into a mutual embrace. Hence we conclude, that charity is justly
   pronounced by Paul to be

   the bond of perfection, (Colossians 3:14,)

   and, in another passage, the

   fulfilling of the law, (Romans 13:10;)

   for all the commandments of the second table must be referred to it.

   Luke 10:28. Do this, and thou shalt live. I have explained a little
   before, how this promise agrees with freely bestowed justification by
   faith; for the reason why God justifies us freely is, not that the Law
   does not point out perfect righteousness, but because we fail in
   keeping it, and the reason why it is declared to be impossible for us
   to obtain life by it is, that

   it is weak through our flesh, (Romans 8:3.)

   So then these two statements are perfectly consistent with each other,
   that the Law teaches how men may obtain righteousness by works, and yet
   that no man is justified by works, because the fault lies not in the
   doctrine of the Law, but in men. It was the intention of Christ, in the
   meantime, to vindicate himself from the calumny which, he knew, was
   brought against him by the unlearned and ignorant, that he set aside
   the Law, so far as it is a perpetual rule of righteousness.

   29. But he wishing to justify himself. This question might appear to be
   of no importance for justifying a man. But if we recollect what was
   formerly stated, that the hypocrisy of men is elderly detected by means
   of the second table--for, while they pretend to be eminent worshippers
   of God, they openly violate charity towards their neighbors--it will be
   easy to infer from this, that the Pharisee practiced this evasion, in
   order that, concealed under the false mask of holiness, he might not be
   brought forth to light. So then, aware that the test of charity would
   prove unfavorable to him, he seeks concealment under the word neighbor,
   that he may not be discovered to be a transgressor of the Law. But we
   have already seen, that on this subject the Law was corrupted by the
   scribes, because they reckoned none to be their neighbors but those who
   were worthy of it. Hence, too, this principle was received among them,
   that we have a right to hate our enemies, (Matthew 5:43.) For the only
   method to which hypocrites can resort for avoiding the condemnation of
   themselves, is to turn away as far as they are able, that their life
   may not be tried by the judgment of the Law.

   30. And Jesus answering said. Christ might have stated simply, that the
   word neighbor extends indiscriminately to every man, because the whole
   human race is united by a sacred bond of fellowship. And, indeed, the
   Lord employed this word in the Law, for no other reason than to draw us
   sweetly to mutual kindness. The commandment would have run more clearly
   thus: Love every man as thyself. But as men are blinded by their pride,
   so that every man is satisfied with himself, scarcely deigns to admit
   others to an equal rank, and withholds from them the duties he owes
   them, the Lord purposely declares that all are neighbors that the very
   relationship may produce mutual love. To make any person our neighbor,
   therefore, it is enough that he be, a man; for it is not in our power
   to blot out our common nature.

   But Christ intended to draw the reply from the Pharisee, that he might
   condemn himself. For in consequence of the authoritative decision being
   generally received among them, that no man is our neighbor unless he is
   our friend, if Christ had put a direct question to him, he would never
   have made an explicit acknowledgment, that under the word neighbor all
   men are included, which the comparison brought forward forces him to
   confess. The general truth conveyed is, that the greatest stranger is
   our neighbor, because God has bound all men together, for the purpose
   of assisting each other. He glances briefly, however, at the Jews, and
   especially at the priests; because, while they boasted of being the
   children of the same Father, and of being separated by the privilege of
   adoption from the rest of the nations, so as to be God's sacred
   heritage, yet, with barbarous and unfeeling contempt, they despised
   each other, as if no relationship had subsisted between them. For there
   is no doubt that Christ describes the cruel neglect of brotherly
   kindness, with which they knew that they were chargeable. But here, as
   I have said, the chief design is to show that the neighborhood, which
   lays us under obligation to mutual offices of kindness, is not confined
   to friends or relatives, but extends to the whole human race.

   To prove this, Christ compares a Samaritan to a priest and a Levite. It
   is well known what deadly hatred the Jews bore to the Samaritans, so
   that, notwithstanding their living close beside them, they were always
   at the greatest variance. Christ now says, that a Jew, an inhabitant of
   Jericho, on his journey from Jerusalem, having been wounded by robbers,
   received no assistance either from a Levite or from a priest, both of
   whom met with him lying on the road, and half-dead, but that a
   Samaritan showed him great kindness, and then asks, Which of these
   three was neighbor to the Jew? This subtle doctor could not escape from
   preferring the Samaritan to the other two. For here, as in a mirror, we
   behold that common relationship of men, which the scribes endeavored to
   blot out by their wicked sophistry; [77] and the compassion, which an
   enemy showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of
   nature are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man.
   Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.

   The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is
   too absurd to deserve refutation. According to them, under the figure
   of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall;
   from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly
   extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it
   had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the
   corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which
   Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not
   plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all
   are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice, (John 5:25.) As
   little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has
   been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost
   universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This
   Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and
   they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound,
   because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They
   have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately
   restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be
   gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these
   interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture
   than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning.
   And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led
   them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of
   Christ.

   Matthew 22:40. On these two commandments. I now return to Matthew,
   where Christ says that all the Law and the prophets depend on these two
   commandments; not that he intends to limit to them [78] all the
   doctrine of Scripture, but because all that is anywhere taught as to
   the manner of living a holy and righteous life must be referred to
   these two leading points. For Christ does not treat generally of what
   the Law and the Prophets contain, but, in drawing up his reply, states
   that nothing else is required in the Law and the prophets than that
   every man should love God and his neighbors; as if he had said, that
   the sum of a holy and upright life consists in the worship of God and
   in charity to men, as Paul states that charity is

   the fulfilling of the law, (Romans 13:10.)

   And therefore some ill-informed persons are mistaken in interpreting
   this saying of Christ, as if we ought to seek nothing higher in the Law
   and the Prophets. For as a distinction ought to be made between the
   promises and the commandments, so in this passage Christ does not state
   generally what we ought to learn from the word of God, but explains, in
   a manner suited to the occasion, the end to which all the commandments
   are directed. Yet the free forgiveness of sins, by which we are
   reconciled to God, -- confidence in calling on God, which is the
   earnest of the future inheritance, -- and all the other parts of faith,
   though they hold the first rank in the Law, do not depend on these two
   commandments; for it is one thing to demand what we owe, and another
   thing to offer what we do not possess. The same thing is expressed in
   other words by Mark, that there is no other commandment greater than
   these.

   Mark 12:32. Master, thou hast spoken well, and with truth. Mark alone
   mentions that the scribe was softened down; and it is worthy of notice
   that, though he had attacked Christ maliciously, and with the intention
   of taking him by surprise, not only does he silently yield to the
   latter, but openly and candidly assents to what Christ had said. Thus
   we see that he did not belong to the class of those enemies whose
   obstinacy is incurable; for, though they have been a hundred times
   convinced, yet they do not cease to oppose the truth in some manner.
   From this reply it may also be concluded, that Christ did not precisely
   include under these two words the rule of life, but embraced the
   opportunity which presented itself for reproving the false and
   hypocritical holiness of the scribes, who, giving their whole attention
   to outward ceremonies, almost entirely disregarded the spiritual
   worship of God, and cared little about brotherly kindness. Now though
   the scribe was infected by such corruptions, yet, as sometimes happens,
   he had obtained from the Law the seed of right knowledge, which lay
   choked in his heart, and on that account he easily allows himself to be
   withdrawn from the wicked custom.

   33. Is better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices. But it appears
   to be incongruous that sacrifices, which are a part of divine worship,
   and belong to the first table of the Law, should be reckoned of less
   importance than charity towards men. The reply is, Though the worship
   of God is greatly preferable, and is more valuable than all the duties
   of a holy life, yet its outward exercises ought not to be estimated so
   highly as to swallow up brotherly kindness. For we know that brotherly
   kindness, in itself and simply, is pleasing to God, though sacrifices
   are not regarded by him with delight or approbation, except with a view
   to another object. Besides, it is naked and empty sacrifices that are
   here spoken of; for our Lord contrasts a hypocritical appearance of
   piety with true and sincere uprightness. The same doctrine is to be
   found very frequently in the prophets, that hypocrites may know that
   sacrifices are of no value, unless spiritual truth be joined to them,
   and that God is not appeased by offerings of beasts, where brotherly
   kindness is neglected.

   34. But when Jesus saw. Whether this scribe made any farther progress
   is uncertain; but as he had shown himself to be teachable, Christ
   stretches out the hand to him, and teaches us, by his example, that we
   ought to assist those in whom there is any beginning either of docility
   or of right understanding. There appear to have been two reasons why
   Christ declared that this scribe was not far from the kingdom of God.
   It was because he was easily persuaded to do his duty, and because he
   skillfully distinguished the outward worship of God from necessary
   duties. Nor was it so much with the design of praising as of exhorting
   him, that Christ declared that he was near the kingdom of God; and in
   his person Christ encourages us all, after having once entered into the
   right path, to proceed with so much the greater cheerfulness. By these
   words we are also taught that many, while they are still held and
   involved in error, advance with closed eyes towards the road, and in
   this manner are prepared for running in the course of the Lord, when
   the time arrives.

   And after that, no man ventured to put a question to him. The assertion
   of the Evangelists, that the mouth of adversaries was stopped, so they
   did not venture any more to lay snares for Christ, must not be so
   understood as if' they desisted from their wicked obstinacy; for they
   groaned within, like wild beasts shut up in their dens, or, like unruly
   horses, they bit the bridle. But the more hardened their obstinacy, and
   the more incorrigible their rebellion, so much the more illustrious was
   Christ's triumph over both. And this victory, which he obtained, ought
   greatly to encourage us never to become dispirited in the defense of
   the truth, being assured of success. It will often happen, indeed, that
   enemies shall molest and insult us till the end, but God will at length
   secure that their fury shall recoil on their own heads, and that, in
   spite of their efforts, truth shall be victorious.

   Matthew
   22:41-46

   Mark 12:35-37

   Luke 20:41-44

   41. And when the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,
   42. Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him,
   David's. 43. He saith to them, How then doth David by the Spirit call
   him Lord, saying, 44. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
   till I have made thy enemies thy footstool? [79] 45. If David then
   calleth him Lord, how is he his son? 46. And no man could make any
   reply to him; [80] nor did any man from that day venture to put any
   more questions to him.

   35. And Jesus answering said, while he was teaching in the temple, How
   do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David? 36. For David
   himself by the Holy "Spirit said, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my
   right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool. [81] 37. David
   himself therefore calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And a
   vast multitude heard him gladly.

   41. And he said to them, How do they say that Christ is the son of
   David? 42. And David himself saith in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said
   to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, 43. Till I make thy enemies thy
   footstool. [82] 44. David therefore calleth him Lord; and how is he his
   son?


   Matthew 22:42. What think you of Christ? Mark and Luke express more
   clearly the reason why Christ put this question. It was because there
   prevailed among the scribes an erroneous opinion, that the promised
   Redeemer would be one of David's sons and successors, who would bring
   along with him nothing more elevated than human nature. For from the
   very commencement Satan endeavored, by all the arts which he could
   devise, to put forward some pretended Christ, who was not the true
   Mediator between God and men. God having so frequently promised that
   Christ would proceed from the seed, or from the loins of David, this
   conviction was so deeply rooted in their minds, that they could not
   endure to have him stripped of human nature. Satan therefore permitted
   Christ to be acknowledged as a true man and a son of David, for he
   would in vain have attempted to overturn this article of faith;
   but--what was worse--he stripped him of his Divinity, as if he had been
   only one of the ordinary descendants of Adam. But in this manner the
   hope of future and eternal life, as well as spiritual righteousness,
   was abolished. And ever since Christ was manifested to the world,
   heretics have attempted by various contrivances--and as it were under
   ground--to overturn sometimes his human, and sometimes his Divine
   nature, that either he might not have full power to save us, or we
   might not have ready access to him. Now as the hour of his death was
   already approaching, the Lord himself intended to attest his divinity,
   that all the godly might boldly rely on him; for if he had been only
   man, we would have had no right either to glory in him, or to expect
   salvation from him.

   We now perceive his design, which was, to assert that he was the Son of
   God, not so much on his own account, as to make our faith rest on his
   heavenly power. For as the weakness of the flesh, by which he
   approached to us, gives us confidence, that we may not hesitate to draw
   near to him, so if that weakness alone were before our eyes, it would
   rather fill us with fear and despair than excite proper confidence. Yet
   it must be observed, that the scribes are not reproved for teaching
   that Christ would be the Son of David, but for imagining that he was a
   mere man, who would come from heaven, to assume the nature and person
   of a man. Nor does our Lord make a direct assertion about himself, but
   simply shows that the scribes hold a wicked error in expecting that the
   Redeemer will proceed only from the earth and from human lineage. But
   though this doctrine was well known to be held by them, we learn from
   Matthew, that he interrogated them in presence of the people what their
   sentiments were.

   43. How then does David by the Spirit call him Lord. The assertion made
   by Christ, that David spoke by the Spirit, is emphatic; for he
   contrasts the prediction of a future event with the testimony of a
   present event. By this phrase he anticipates the sophistry by which the
   Jews of the present day attempt to escape. They allege that this
   prediction celebrates the reign of David, as if, representing God to be
   the Author of his reign, David would rise above the mad attempts of his
   enemies, and affirmed that they would gain nothing by opposing the will
   of God. That the scribes might not shelter themselves under such an
   objection, Christ began with stating that the psalm was not composed in
   reference to the person of David, but was dictated by the prophetic
   Spirit to describe the future reign of Christ; as it may easily be
   learned even from the passage itself, that what we read there does not
   apply either to David, or to any other earthly king; for there David
   introduces a king clothed with a new priesthood, by which the ancient
   shadows of the Law must be abolished, (Psalm 110:4)

   We must now see how he proves that Christ will hold a higher rank than
   to be merely descended from the seed of David. It is because David, who
   was king and head of the people, calls him Lord; from which it follows,
   that there is something in him greater than man. But the argument
   appears to be feeble and inconclusive; for it may be objected that,
   when David gave the psalm to the people to sing, without having any
   view to his own person, he assigned to Christ dominion over others. But
   to this I reply that, as he was one of the members of the Church,
   nothing would have been more improper than to shut himself out from the
   common doctrine. Here he enjoins all the children of God to boast, as
   with one voice, that they are safe through the protection of a heavenly
   and invincible King. If he be separated from the body of the Church, he
   will not partake of the salvation promised through Christ. If this were
   the voice of a few persons, the dominion of Christ would not extend
   even to David. But now neither he, nor any other person, can be
   excluded from subjection to him, without cutting himself off from the
   hope of eternal salvation. Since then there was nothing better for
   David than to be included in the Church, it was not less for himself
   than for the rest of the people that David composed this psalm. In
   short, by this title Christ is pronounced to be supreme and sole King,
   who holds the preeminence among all believers; and no exception ought
   to be allowed to ranking all in one class, when he is appointed to be
   the Redeemer of the Church. There can be no doubt, therefore, that
   David represents himself also as a subject of his government, so as to
   be reckoned one of the number of the people of God.

   But now another question arises: Might not God have raised up one whom
   he appointed from among mankind to be a Redeemer, so as to be David's
   Lord, though he was his son? For here it is not the essential name of
   God, but only Adonai [83] that is employed, and this term is frequently
   applied to men. I reply: Christ takes for granted that he who is taken
   out of the number of men, and raised to such a rank of honor, as to be
   the supreme Head of the whole Church, is not a mere man, but possesses
   also the majesty of God. For the eternal God, who by an oath makes this
   claim for himself, that

   before him every knee shall bow, (Isaiah 45:23,)

   at the same time swears that

   he will not give his glory to another, (Isaiah 42:8.)

   But, according to the testimony of Paul, when Christ was raised to
   kingly power,

   there was given to him a name which is above every name, that before
   him every knee should bow, (Romans 14:11; Philippians 2:9.)

   And though Paul had never said this, yet such is the fact, that Christ
   is above David and other holy kings, because he also ranks higher than
   angels; which would not apply to a created man, unless he were also

   God manifested in the flesh, (1 Timothy 3:16.)

   I do acknowledge that his divine essence is not expressed directly and
   in so many words; but it may easily be inferred that He is God, who is
   placed above all creatures.

   44. The Lord said to my Lord. Here the Holy Spirit puts into the mouth
   of all the godly a song of triumph, that they may boldly defy Satan and
   all the ungodly, and mock at their rage, when they endeavor to drive
   Christ from his throne. That they may not hesitate or tremble, when
   they perceive great emotions produced in the earth, they are commanded
   to place the holy and inviolable decree of God in opposition to all the
   exertions of adversaries. The meaning therefore is: whatever may be the
   madness of men, all that they shall dare to contrive will be of no
   avail for destroying the kingdom of Christ, which has been set up, not
   by the will of men, but by the appointment of God, and therefore is
   supported by everlasting strength. Whenever this kingdom is violently
   attacked, let us call to remembrance this revelation from heaven; for
   undoubtedly this promise was put into the hand of Christ, that every
   believer may apply it to his own use. But God never changes or
   deceives, so as to retract what has once gone out of his mouth.

   Sit at my right hand. This phrase is used metaphorically for the second
   or next rank, which is occupied by God's deputy. And therefore it
   signifies, to hold the highest government and power in the name of God,
   as we know that God has committed his authority to his only-begotten
   Son, so as to govern his Church by his agency. This mode of expression,
   therefore, does not denote any particular place, but, on the contrary,
   embraces heaven and earth under the government of Christ. And God
   declares that Christ will sit till his enemies be subdued, in order to
   inform us that his kingdom will remain invincible against every attack;
   not that, when his enemies have been subdued, he will be deprived of
   the power which had been granted to him, but that, while the whole
   multitude of his enemies shall be laid low, his power will remain for
   ever unimpaired. In the meantime, it points out that condition of his
   kingdom which we perceive in the present day, that we may not be uneasy
   when we see it attacked on all sides.

   1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitude, and to his disciples, 2. Saying,
   The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses. 3. Observe and

   45. And while all the people were hearing, he said to his disciples,
   46. Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in robes, and love
   salutations in the marketplaces and the first seats in the synagogues,
   and the first places at entertainments.


   Matthew 23:1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes. This warning was
   highly useful, that, amidst contentions and the noise of combats,
   amidst the trouble and confusion of public affairs, amidst the
   destruction of proper and lawful order, the authority of the word of
   God might remain entire. The design of Christ was, that the people
   might not, in consequence of being offended at the vices of the
   scribes, [88] throw away reverence for the Law. For we know how prone
   the minds of men are to entertain dislike of the Law; and more
   especially when the life of their pastors is dissolute, and does not
   correspond to their words, almost all grow wanton through their
   example, as if they had received permission to sin with impunity. The
   same thing happens -- and something worse -- when contentions arise;
   for the greater part of men, having thrown off the yoke, give utterance
   to their wicked desires, and break out into extreme contempt.

   At that time the scribes burned with covetousness and swelled with
   ambition; their extortions were notorious; their cruelty was
   formidable; and such was their corruption of manners, that one would
   think they had conspired for the destruction of the Law. Besides, they
   had perverted by their false opinions the pure and natural meaning of
   the Law, so that Christ was constrained to enter into a sharp conflict
   with them; because their amazing rage hurried them on to extinguish the
   light of truth. So then, because there was danger that many persons,
   partly on account of such abuses, and partly on account of the din of
   controversies, would come to despise all religion, Christ seasonably
   meets them, and declares that it would be unreasonable if, on account
   of the vices of men, true religion were to perish, or reverence for the
   Law to be in any degree diminished. As the scribes were obstinate and
   inveterate enemies, and as they held the Church oppressed through their
   tyranny, Christ was compelled to expose their wickedness; for if good
   and simple men had not been withdrawn from bondage to them, the door
   would have been shut against the Gospel. There was also another reason;
   for the common people think themselves at liberty to do whatever they
   see done by their rulers, whose corrupt manners they form into a law.

   But that no man might put a different interpretation on what he was
   about to say, he begins by stating, that whatever sort of men the
   teachers were it was altogether unreasonable, either that on account of
   their filth the word of God should receive any stain, or that on
   account of their wicked examples men should hold themselves at liberty
   to commit sin. And this wisdom ought to be carefully observed; for many
   persons, having no other object in view than to bring hatred and
   detestation on the wicked and ungodly, mix and confound every thing
   through their inconsiderate zeal. All discipline is despised, and shame
   is trampled under foot; in short, there remains no respect for what is
   honorable, and, what is more, many are emboldened by it, and
   intentionally blazon the sins of priests, that they may have a pretext
   for sinning with less restraint. But in attacking the scribes, Christ
   proceeds in such a manner, that he first vindicates the Law of God from
   contempt. We must attend to this caution also if we desire that our
   reproofs should be of any service. But, on the other hand, we ought to
   observe, that no dread of giving offense prevented Christ from exposing
   ungodly teachers as they deserved; only he preserved such moderation,
   that the doctrine of God might not come to be despised on account of
   the wickedness of men.

   To inform us that he spoke publicly about their vices, not to raise
   envy against their persons, but to prevent the contagion from spreading
   more widely, Mark expressly states that he spoke to them in his
   doctrine; by which words he means that the hearers were profitably
   warned to beware of them. Now, though Luke appears to restrict it to
   the disciples, yet it is probable that the discourse was addressed
   indiscriminately to the whole multitude; which appears more clearly
   from Matthew, and, indeed, the subject itself required that Christ
   should have his eye on all without exception.

   2. In the chair of Moses. Reasons were not wanting for inserting here
   what Luke relates at a different place. Besides that the doctrine is
   the same, I have no doubt that Luke, after having said that the scribes
   were sharply and severely reproved by our Lord, added also the other
   reproofs which Matthew delayed till the proper place; for already we
   have frequently seen that the Evangelists, as occasion required,
   collected into one place various discourses of Christ. But as the
   narrative of Matthew is more full, I choose rather to take his words as
   the subject of exposition.

   Our Lord gives a general exhortation to believers to beware of
   conforming their life to the wicked conduct of the scribes, but, on the
   contrary, to regulate it by the rule of the Law which they hear from
   the mouth of the scribes; for it was necessary (as I have lately
   hinted) that he should reprove many abuses in them, that the whole
   people might not be infected. Lest, through their crimes, the doctrine
   of which they were the ministers and heralds should be injured, he
   enjoins believers to attend to their words, and not to their actions;
   as if he had said, that there is no reason why the bad examples of
   pastors should hinder the children of God from holiness of life. That
   the word scribes, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, denotes the teachers
   or expounders of the Law, is well known; and it is certain that Luke
   calls the same persons lawyers [89]

   Now our Lord refers peculiarly to the Pharisees, who belonged to the
   number of the scribes, because at that time this sect held the highest
   rank in the government of the Church, and in the exposition of
   Scripture. For we have formerly mentioned that, while the Sadducees and
   Essenes preferred the literal interpretation of Scripture, the
   Pharisees followed a different manner of teaching, which had been
   handed down, as it were, to them by their ancestors, which was, to make
   subtle inquiries into the mystical meaning of Scripture. This was also
   the reason why they received their name; for they are called Pherusim,
   that is, expounders. [90] And though they had debased the whole of
   Scripture by their false opinions, yet, as they plumed themselves on
   that popular method of instruction, their authority was highly esteemed
   in explaining the worship of God and the rule of holy life. The phrase
   ought, therefore, to be thus interpreted: "The Pharisees and other
   scribes, or, the scribes, among whom the Pharisees are the most highly
   esteemed, when they speak to you, are good teachers of a holy life, but
   by their works they give you very bad instructions; and therefore
   attend to their lips rather than to their hands."

   It may now be asked, Ought we to submit to all the instructions of
   teachers without exception? For it is plain enough, that the scribes of
   that age had wickedly and basely corrupted the Law by false inventions,
   had burdened wretched souls by unjust laws, and had corrupted the
   worship of God by many superstitions; but Christ wishes their doctrine
   to be observed, as if it had been unlawful to oppose their tyranny. The
   answer is easy. He does not absolutely compare any kind of doctrine
   with the life, but the design of Christ was, to distinguish the holy
   Law of God from their profane works. For to sit in the chair of Moses
   is nothing else than to teach, according to the Law of God, how we
   ought to live. And though I am not quite certain whence the phrase is
   derived, yet there is probability in the conjecture of those who refer
   it to the pulpit which Ezra erected, from which the Law was read aloud,
   (Nehemiah 8:4.) Certainly, when the Rabbis expounded Scripture, those
   who were about to speak rose up in succession; but it was perhaps the
   custom that the Law itself should be proclaimed from a more elevated
   spot. That man, therefore, sits in the chair of Moses who teaches, not
   from himself, or at his own suggestion, but according to the authority
   and word of God. But it denotes, at the same time, a lawful calling;
   for Christ commands that the scribes should be heard, because they were
   the public teachers of the, Church.

   The Papists reckon it enough, that those who issue laws should possess
   the title and occupy the station; for in this way they torture the
   words of Christ to mean, that we are bound to receive obediently
   whatever the ordinary prelates of the Church enjoin. But this calumny
   is abundantly refuted by another injunction of Christ, when he bids
   them beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, (Matthew 16:6.)

   If Christ pronounces it to be not only lawful, but even proper, to
   reject whatever of their own the scribes mingle with the pure doctrine
   of the Law, certainly we are not bound to embrace, without
   discrimination or the exercise of judgment, whatever they are pleased
   to enjoin. Besides, if Christ had intended here to bind the consciences
   of his followers to the commandments of men, there would have been no
   good ground for what he said in another passage, that it is in vain to
   worship God by the commandments of men, (Matthew 15:9.)

   Hence it is evident, that Christ exhorts the people to obey the
   scribes, only so far as they adhere to the pure and simple exposition
   of the Law. For the exposition of, Augustine is accurate, and in
   accordance with Christ's meaning, that, "the scribes taught the Law of
   God while they sat in the chair of Moses; and, therefore, that the
   sheep ought to hear the voice of the Shepherd by them, as by
   hirelings." To which words he immediately adds: "God therefore teaches
   by them; but if they wish to teach any thing of their own, refuse to
   hear, refuse to do them." With this sentiment accords what the same
   writer says in his Fourth Book of Christian Doctrine: "Because good
   believers do not obediently listen to any sort of man, but to God
   himself; therefore we may profitably listen even to those whose lives
   are not profitable." It was, therefore, not the chair of the scribes,
   but the chair of Moses, that constrained them to teach what was good,
   even when they did not do what was good. For what they did in their
   life was their own; but the chair of another man did not permit them to
   teach what was their own.

   4. For they bind heavy and intolerable burdens. He does not charge the
   scribes with oppressing and tyrannizing over souls by harsh and unjust
   laws; for, though they had introduced many superfluous ceremonies -- as
   is evident from other passages -- yet Christ does not at present refer
   to that vice, because his design is, to compare right doctrine with a
   wicked and dissolute life. That the Law of God should be called a heavy
   and intolerable burden is not wonderful, and more especially in
   reference to our weakness. But though the scribes required nothing but
   what God had enjoined, yet Christ reproves the stern and rigid manner
   of teaching which was usually followed by those proud hypocrites, who
   authoritatively demand from others what they owe to God, and are
   rigorous in enforcing duties, and yet indolently dispense with the
   performance of what they so strictly enjoin on others, and allow
   themselves to do whatever they please. In this sense Ezekiel (34:4)
   reproaches them for ruling with sternness and rigor. For those who
   truly fear God, though they sincerely and earnestly endeavor to bring
   their disciples to obey Him, yet as they are more severe towards
   themselves than towards others, they are not so rigid in exacting
   obedience, and, being conscious of their own weakness, kindly forgive
   the weak. But it is impossible to imagine any thing that can exceed the
   insolence in commanding, or the cruelty, of stupid despisers of God,
   because they give themselves no concern about the difficulty of doing
   those things from which they relieve themselves; and therefore no man
   will exercise moderation in commanding others, unless he shall first
   become his own teacher. [91]

   5. And all their works they do that they may be seen by men. He had
   lately said that the scribes live very differently from what they
   teach; but now he adds that, if they have any thing which is apparently
   good, it is hypocritical and worthless, because they have no other
   design than to please men, and to vaunt themselves. And here zeal for
   piety and a holy life is contrasted with the mask of those works which
   serve no purpose but for ostentation; for an upright worshipper of God
   will never give himself up to that empty parade by which hypocrites are
   puffed up. Thus not only is the ambition of the scribes and Pharisees
   reproved, but our Lord, after having condemned the transgression and
   contempt of the Law of God in their whole life, that they might not
   shield themselves by their pretended holiness, anticipates them by
   replying, that those things of which they boast are absolute trifles,
   and of no value whatever, because they spring from mere ostentation. He
   afterwards produces a single instance, by which that ambition was
   easily perceived, which was, that by the fringes of their robes they
   held themselves out to the eyes of men as good observers of the Law.

   And make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge the fringes of their
   robes. For why were their fringes made broader, and their phylacteries
   more magnificent, than what was customary, except for idle display? The
   Lord had commanded the Jews to wear, both on their forehead and on
   their raiment, some remarkable passages selected out of the Law,
   (Deuteronomy 6:8.) As forgetfulness of the Law easily creeps upon the
   flesh, the Lord intended in this manner to keep it constantly in the
   remembrance of his people; for they were likewise enjoined to inscribe
   such sentences

   on the posts of their houses, (Deuteronomy 6:9,)

   that, wherever they turned their eyes, some godly warning might
   immediately meet them. But what did the scribes do? In order to
   distinguish themselves from the rest of the people, they carried about
   with them the commandments of God more magnificently inscribed on their
   garments; and in this boasting there was displayed an offensive
   ambition.

   Let us also learn from this, how ingenious men are in mixing up vain
   deception, in order to conceal their vices under some pretext and cloak
   of virtues, by turning to the purposes of their own hypocrisy those
   exercises of piety which God has enjoined. Nothing was more profitable
   than to exercise all their senses in the contemplation of the Law, and
   it was not without good reason that this was enjoined by the Lord. But
   so far were they from profiting by these simple instructions, that, by
   making perfect righteousness to consist in the adorning of robes, they
   despised the Law throughout their whole life. For it was impossible to
   treat the Law of God with greater contempt, than when they imagined
   that they kept it by pompous dress, or pronounced masks contrived for
   enacting a play to be a keeping of the Law.

   What Mark and Luke say about the robes relates to the same subject. We
   know that the inhabitants of Eastern countries commonly used long
   robes, -- a custom which they retain to this day. But it is evident
   from Zechariah (13:4) that the prophets were distinguished from the
   rest of the people by a particular form of a cloak. And, indeed, it was
   highly reasonable that the teachers should dress in this manner, that
   there might be a higher degree of gravity and modesty in their dress
   than in that of the common people; but the scribes had made an improper
   use of it by turning it into luxury and display. Their example has been
   followed by the Popish priests, among whom robes are manifestly nothing
   more than the badges of proud tyranny.

   6 And love the first places at entertainments.. He proves, by evident
   signs, that no zeal for piety exists in the scribes, but that they are
   wholly devoted to ambition. For to seek the first places and the first
   seats belongs only to those who choose rather to exalt themselves among
   men, than to enjoy the approbation of God. But above all, Christ
   condemns them for desiring to be called masters; for, though the name
   Rabbi in itself denotes excellence, yet at that time the prevailing
   practice among the Jews was, to give this name to the masters and
   teachers of the Law. But Christ asserts that this honor does not belong
   to any except himself; from which it follows that it cannot, without
   doing injury to him, be applied to men. But there is an appearance of
   excessive harshness, and even of absurdity, in this, since Christ does
   not now teach us in his own person, but appoints and ordains masters
   for us. Now it is absurd to take away the title from those on whom he
   bestows the office, and more especially since, while he was on earth,
   he appointed apostles to discharge the office of teaching in his name.

   If the question be about the title, Paul certainly did not intend to do
   any injury to Christ by sacrilegious usurpation or boasting, when he
   declared that. he was

   a master and teacher of the Gentiles, (1 Timothy. 2:7.)

   But as Christ had no other design than to bring all, from the least to
   the greatest, to obey him, so as to preserve his own authority
   unimpaired, we need not give ourselves much trouble about the word.
   Christ therefore does not attach importance to the title bestowed on
   those who discharge the office of teaching, but restrains them within
   proper limits, that they may not rule over the kith of brethren. We
   must always attend to the distinction, that Christ alone ought to be
   obeyed, because concerning him alone was the voice of the Father heard
   aloud from heaven, Hear him, (Matthew 17:5;) and that teachers are his
   ministers in such a manner that he ought to be heard in them, and that
   they are masters under him, so far as they represent his person. The
   general meaning is, that his authority must remain entire, and that no
   mortal man ought to claim the smallest portion of it. Thus he is the
   only Pastor; but yet he admits many pastors under him, provided that he
   hold the preeminence over them all, and that by them he alone govern
   the Church.

   And you are all brethren. This opposite clause must be observed. For,
   since we are brethren, he maintains that no man has a right to hold the
   place of a master over others; and hence it follows, that he does not
   condemn that authority of masters which does not violate brotherly
   intercourse among the godly. In short, nothing else is here enjoined
   than that all should depend on the mouth of Christ alone. Nearly to the
   same purpose does Paul argue, when he says that we have no right to
   judge one another, for all are brethren, and

   all must stand before the judgment seat of Christ,
   (Romans 14:10.)

   9. And call no man on earth your Father. He claims for God alone the
   honor of Father, in nearly the same sense as he lately asserted that he
   himself is the only Master; for this name was not assumed by men for
   themselves, but was given to them by God. And therefore it is not only
   lawful to call men on earth fathers, but it would be wicked to deprive
   them of that honor. Nor is there any importance in the distinction
   which some have brought forward, that men, by whom children have been
   begotten, are fathers according to the flesh, but that God alone is the
   Father of spirits. I readily acknowledge that in this manner God is
   sometimes distinguished from men, as in Hebrews 12:5, but as Paul more
   than once calls himself a spiritual father, (1 Corinthians 4:15;
   Philippians 2:22,) we must see how this agrees with the words of
   Christ. The true meaning therefore is, that the honor of a father is
   falsely ascribed to men, when it obscures the glory of God. Now this is
   done, whenever a mortal man, viewed apart from God, is accounted a
   father, since all the degrees of relationship depend on God alone
   through Christ, and are held together in such a manner that, strictly
   speaking, God alone is the Father of all.

   10. For one is your Master, even Christ. He repeats a second time the
   former statement about Christ's office as Master, in order to inform us
   that the lawful order is, that God alone rule over us, and possess the
   power and authority of a Father, and that Christ subject all to his
   doctrine, and have them as disciples; as it is elsewhere said, that
   Christ is the only

   head of the whole Church, (Ephesians 1:22)

   because the whole body ought to be subject to him and obey him.

   11. He who is greatest among you. By this conclusion he shows that he
   did not, after the manner of the sophists, dispute about words, but, on
   the contrary, looked to the fact, that no man, through forgetfulness of
   his rank, might claim more than was proper. He therefore declares that
   the highest honor in the Church is not government, but service. Whoever
   keeps himself within this limit, whatever may be the title which he
   bears, takes nothing away either from God or from Christ; as, on the
   other hand, it serves no good purpose to take the name of a servant for
   the purpose of cloaking that power which diminishes the authority of
   Christ as a Master. For of what avail is it that the Pope, when he is
   about to oppress wretched souls by tyrannical laws, begins with styling
   himself the servant of servants of God, but to insult God openly, and
   to practice shameful mockery on men? Now while Christ does not insist
   on words, he strictly forbids his followers to aspire or desire to rise
   any higher than to enjoy brotherly intercourse on an equal footing
   under the heavenly Father, and charges those who occupy places of honor
   to conduct themselves as the servants of others. He adds that
   remarkable statement which has been formerly explained, [92] he that
   humbleth himself shall be exalted.

   do not permit those who come to enter. 14. And woe to you, scribes and

   [94] you make him twice as much the child of hell as yourselves.

   40. Who devour widows' houses, and that under the disguise of a
   longprayer. These shall receive a severer condemnation.

   52. Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge:
   you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.


   Luke 20:47

   47. Who devour widows' houses, and by way of pretence make long prayers
   [95] . These shall receive greater condemnation.


   He breaks out into still stronger language of condemnation, and he does
   so not so much on their account, as for the purpose of withdrawing the
   common people and simple-minded men from their sect. [96] For though we
   see frequently in Scripture the judgment of God pronounced against the
   reprobate, so as to render them the more inexcusable, yet in their
   person the children of God receive a useful warning, not to involve
   themselves in the snares of the same crimes, but to guard against
   falling into similar destruction. Certainly, when the scribes, after
   overturning the worship of God and corrupting the doctrine of
   godliness, would endure no correction, and with desperate madness, to
   their own destruction and that of the whole nation, opposed the
   redemption which was offered to them, it was proper that they should be
   held up to the hatred and detestation of all. And yet Christ did not so
   much consider what they deserved, as what would be useful to the
   uneducated and ignorant; for he intended, towards the close of his
   life, to leave a solemn testimony, that no man might, except knowingly
   and willingly, be deceived by persons so base and wicked.

   We know how powerfully a foolish reverence for false teachers hinders
   simple people from getting clear of their erroneous views. The Jews
   were at that time deeply imbued with false doctrine, and had even
   imbibed from their earliest years many superstitions. While it was hard
   and difficult in itself to bring them back to the right path, the chief
   obstacle lay in the foolish opinion which they had formed about the
   false teachers, whom they regarded as the lawful prelates of the
   Church, the rulers of divine worship, and the pillars of religion.
   Besides, they were so strongly fascinated, that they could scarcely be
   drawn away from those teachers but by violent fear. It is not therefore
   for the purpose of cursing the scribes that Christ pronounces against
   them the dreadful vengeance of God, but to withdraw others from their
   impostures. In like manner, we are compelled at the present day to
   thunder loudly against the Popish clergy, for no other reason than that
   those who are tractable, and not quite desperate, may direct their
   minds to their salvation, and, moved by the judgment of God, may break
   the deadly snares of superstitions by which they are held captive.

   Hence we may infer how cruel is the mildness of those who dislike our
   vehemence. They are displeased to see harshness and severity used
   towards the wolves, which are constantly, with open mouth, tearing and
   devouring the sheep; and yet they see the poor sheep deceived by a vain
   disguise, freely throwing themselves into the jaws of the wolves,
   unless the pastor who desires to save them, and endeavors to rescue
   them from destruction, drive them away with a loud voice. We must
   therefore follow out the design of Christ, by copying out his example
   in severe threatenings against wicked despisers, and in boldly
   exclaiming against them, that those who are capable of being cured may
   be led by the fear of destruction to withdraw from them. For though we
   gain nothing by addressing the enemies of the truth, yet they must be
   summoned to the judgment-seat of God, and others must be warned, that
   they may know that the same destruction awaits themselves, if they do
   not speedily withdraw from a wicked league with them.

   Matthew 23:13. You shut up the kingdom of heaven. Christ pronounces a
   curse on them, because they pervert their office to the general
   destruction of the whole people; for since the government of the Church
   was in their hands, they ought to have been, as it were, porters for
   the kingdom of heaven. What purpose is served by religion and holy
   doctrine but to open heaven to us? For we know that all mankind are
   banished from God, and excluded from the inheritance of eternal
   salvation. Now the doctrine of religion may be said to be the door by
   which we enter into life, and therefore Scripture says metaphorically,
   that the keys of the kingdom of heaven are given to pastors, as I have
   explained more fully under Matthew 16:19. And we ought to abide by this
   definition, which appears still more strongly from the words of Luke,
   in which Christ reproaches the lawyers with having taken away the key
   of knowledge, which means that, though they were the guardians of the
   Law of God, they deprived the people of the true understanding of it.
   As, therefore, in the present day, the keys of the kingdom of heaven
   are committed to the custody of pastors, that they may admit believers
   into eternal life, and exclude unbelievers from all expectation of it,
   so the priests and scribes anciently under the Law held the same
   office.

   From the word knowledge we infer how absurdly the Papists forge false
   keys, as if they possessed some magical power apart from the word of
   God; for Christ declares that none but those who are ministers of
   doctrine have the use of keys. If it be objected, that the Pharisees,
   though they were perverse expounders of the Law still held the keys, I
   reply: Though, in respect of their office, the keys were entrusted to
   them, yet they were suppressed by malice and deceit, so that they no
   longer retained the use of them. And therefore Christ says, that they
   took away, or stole that key of knowledge, by which they ought to have
   opened the gate of heaven. In like manner, heaven is shut by Popery
   against the wretched people, while the very pastors--or, at least,
   those who hold that office--prevent them by their tyranny from being
   opened. If we are not excessively indifferent, we will not willingly
   enter into a league with wicked tyrants, who cruelly shut against us
   the entrance into life.

   14. For you devour widows' houses. He now proceeds farther, for he not
   only accuses them of open crimes which demand hatred and detestation,
   but even tears away the disguises of virtues, by which they deceived
   the common people. If it be objected, that there was no need of
   reproving those things which could do no harm by their example, we
   ought to recollect that it was impossible to promote the salvation of
   those who were held bound by the errors of the scribes, unless they
   turned away entirely from such persons. This reason, therefore,
   constrained Christ to expose the vain appearance of virtues, which
   nourishes superstitions.

   And that under the pretense of a long prayer. He says in general that,
   even when they appear to do what is right, they wickedly abuse the
   pretense of religion. Long prayers contained some evidence of
   remarkable piety; for the more holy a man is, the more eminently is he
   devoted to prayer. But Christ says that the Pharisees and scribes were
   so impure, that even the chief part of the worship of God was not used
   by them without committing sin, because constancy in prayer was with
   them, trap for base gain. For they sold their prayers in exactly the
   same manner as hirelings dispose of their daily labor. [97] Hence also
   we infer that our Lord does not exactly reprove long prayers, as if in
   itself it were an impropriety--particularly since pastors ought to be
   eminently devoted to prayer--but to condemn this abuse, because a thing
   laudable in itself was turned to a wicked purpose. For when men aim at
   gain by means of hired prayers, the more fervent the appearance of what
   they call devotion becomes, the more is the name of God profaned. And
   as this false conviction had been long and deeply seated in the minds
   of the common people, on this account Christ employs harsher
   threatenings; for the pollution of so sacred a thing was no light
   offense. That it was chiefly widows that were imposed on need not
   excite surprise, because silly women are more prone to superstition,
   and therefore it has always been customary for base men to make gain
   of. them. Thus Paul brings a charge against the false teachers of his
   age, that they

   lead captive silly women laden with sins, (2 Timothy 3:6.)

   15. For you compass sea and land. The scribes had also acquired
   celebrity by their zeal in laboring to bring over to the Jewish
   religion the strangers and uncircumcised. And so, if they had gained
   any one by their false appearances, or by any other stratagem, they
   gloried wonderfully over it as an increase of the Church. On this
   account also they received great applause from the common people, that
   by their diligence and ability they brought strangers into the Church
   of God. Christ declares, on the contrary, that so far is this zeal from
   deserving applause, that they more and more provoke the vengeance of
   God, because they bring under heavier condemnation those who devote
   themselves to their sect. We ought to observe how corrupt their
   condition at that time was, and what confusion existed in religion; for
   as it was a holy and excellent work to gain disciples to God, so to
   allure the Gentiles to the Jewish worship--which was at that time
   degenerate, and was even full of wicked profanation -- was nothing else
   than to hurry them from Scylla to Charybdis. [98] Besides, by a
   sacrilegious abuse of the name of God, they drew down upon themselves a
   heavier condemnation, because their religion allowed them grosser
   licentiousness of crime. An instance of the same kind may be seen at
   the present day among the monks; for they are diligent in culling
   proselytes from every quarter, but those proselytes, from being
   lascivious and debauched persons, they render altogether devils: for
   such is the filthiness of those puddles, within which they carry on
   their reveling, that it would corrupt even the heavenly angels. [99]
   Yet the monk's habit is a very suitable mantle for concealing
   enormities of every description.

   MATTHEW 23:16

   Matthew 23:16-22

   16. Woe to you, blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the
   temple, it is nothing; but he who shall swear by the gold of the temple
   is guilty. 17. Fools, and blind! for which is greater, the gold, or the
   temple which sanctifieth the gold? 18. And, Whosoever shall swear by
   the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift which
   is upon it is guilty. 19. Fools, and blind! for which is greater, the
   gilt, or the altar which sanctifieth the gift? 20. Whosoever therefore
   shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things that are on
   it. 21. And whosoever shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
   him that dwelleth in it. 22. And whosoever shall swear by heaven,
   sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth upon it.


   Matthew 23:16. Woe to you, blind guides, As ambition is almost always
   connected with hypocrisy, so the superstitions of the people are
   usually encouraged by the covetousness and rapacity of pastors. The
   world has, indeed, a natural propensity to errors, and even draws down
   upon itself, as if on purpose, every kind of deceit and imposture; but
   improper modes of worship come to gain a footing only when they are
   confirmed by the rulers [100] themselves. And it generally happens,
   that those who possess authority not only, by their connivance, fawn
   upon errors, because they perceive that they are a source of gain to
   them, but even assist in fanning the flame. Thus we see that the
   superstitions of Popery were heightened by innumerable expedients,
   while the priests opened their mouths for the prey; and even now they
   daily contrive many things by which they delude still more the foolish
   multitude. And when minds have once fallen under the darkening
   influence of the enchantments of Satan, nothing is so absurd or
   monstrous as not to be eagerly swallowed.

   It was on this account that the Jews had more reverence for the gold of
   the temple, and for the sacred offerings, than for the temple and the
   altar. But the sacredness of the offerings depended on the temple and
   the altar, and was only something inferior and accessory. It may
   readily be believed that this dream proceeded from the scribes and
   priests, because it was a scheme well fitted for collecting prey. And
   this was not only a foolish but a highly dangerous error, because it
   led the people into ridiculous fancies. There is nothing to which men
   are more prone than to fall away from the pure worship of God: and
   therefore, under the covering of this veil, it was easy for Satan to
   withdraw from the contemplation of God those who were too strongly
   inclined to foolish imaginations. This is the reason why Christ so
   severely chastises that error. And yet the Papists were not ashamed to
   prostitute the sacred name of God to a mockery still more detestable;
   for they reckon it of more importance to touch a morsel of a stinking
   carcass, than to peruse the sacred volume of the Old and New
   Testaments, or even to raise their hands towards heaven. And in this
   way arises a carnal worship of God, by which the proper fear of God is
   gradually obliterated.

   It is nothing. By this phrase he does not mean that they entirely took
   away the honor of the temple, but he speaks comparatively. For when
   they represented in extravagant terms the sacredness of offerings, the
   common people were led to entertain such veneration for them, that the
   majesty of the temple and of the altar was undervalued, and they
   reckoned it a less heinous crime to violate it by perjuries than to
   swear by the sacred offerings with too little reverence.

   18. And whosoever shall swear by the altar. Here our Lord does what
   ought to be done in correcting errors; for he leads us up to the
   source, and shows, by the very nature of an oath, that the temple is
   far more valuable than the gifts which are offered in it. He
   accordingly assumes this principle, that it is not lawful to swear but
   by the name of God alone. Hence it follows that, whatever forms men may
   employ in swearing, they must give to God the honor which is due to
   him; and hence also it follows in what manner and to what extent we are
   at liberty to swear by the temple, namely, because it is the residence
   or sanctuary of God; and by heaven, because there the glory of God
   shines. God permits himself to be called as a witness and judge, by
   means of such symbols of his presence, provided that he retain his
   authority unimpaired; for to ascribe any Divinity to heaven would be
   detestable idolatry. Now so far as God holds out to us a brighter
   mirror of his glory in the temple than in offerings, so much the
   greater reverence and sacredness is due to the name of the temple. We
   now perceive, therefore, in what sense Christ says that we swear by him
   who inhabits heaven, when we swear by heaven itself. His design is, to
   direct all forms of swearing to their lawful end and object.

   MATTHEW 23:23-28; LUKE 11:42, 44

   Matthew 23:23-28

   Luke 11:42, 44

   23. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of
   mint, and anise, and cumin and have omitted the more important points
   of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith. The latter you ought to
   have done, and not to have omitted the former. 24. Blind guides, who
   strain out the gnat, but swallow the camel. 25. Woe to you, scribes and
   Pharisees, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outer part of the cup and of
   the dish, but within they are full of extortion and intemperance.
   26. Blind Pharisee, cleanse first what is within the cup and dish, that
   the outer parts of them also may be made clean. 27. Woe to you, scribes
   and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitened sepulchers, which
   outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's
   bones, and of all filthiness. 28. So you also outwardly indeed appear
   righteous to men; but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

   42. But woe to you, Pharisees! for you pay tithe of mint, and rue, and
   every kind of herb, and pass by judgment and the love of God. The
   latter you ought to have done, and not to have omitted the former. (A
   little after.) 44. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for
   you are as tombs which do not appear, and the men who walk over them
   are not aware of them.


   Christ charges the scribes with a fault which is found in all
   hypocrites, that they are exceedingly diligent and careful in small
   matters, but disregard the principal points of the Law. This disease
   has prevailed in almost all ages, and among all nations; so that men
   have, in most cases, endeavored to please God by observing with
   exactness some trivial matters. Finding that they cannot entirely
   release themselves from all obedience to God, they have recourse to
   this second remedy of expiating any heinous offenses by satisfactions
   which are of no value. Thus we see that the Papists, while they
   transgress the chief commandments of God, are extremely zealous in the
   performance of trifling ceremonies. Hypocrisy of the same kind is now
   reproved by God in the scribes, who, while they were very diligent and
   careful in paying tithes, cared little about the principal points of
   the Law. To expose more fully to ridicule their offensive ostentation,
   he does not say generally that they paid tithes, but tithes of mint,
   and anise, and (as Luke has it) of every kind of herb, so as to make a
   display of extraordinary zeal for piety at the least possible expense.

   But as Christ makes the chief righteousness of the Law to consist in
   mercy, judgment, and faith, we must first, see what he means by these
   words; and, secondly, why he left out the commandments of the first
   table, which strictly relate to the worship of God, as if godliness
   were of less value than the duties of charity. Judgment is taken for
   equity, or uprightness, the effect of which is, that we render to every
   man what belongs to him, and that no man deceives or injures others.
   Mercy proceeds farther, and leads a man to endeavor to assist his
   brethren with his property, to relieve the wretched by advice or by
   money, to protect those who are unjustly oppressed, and to employ
   liberally for the common good the means which God has put into his
   hands. Faith is nothing else than strict integrity; not to attempt any
   thing by cunning, or malice, or deceit, but to cultivate towards all
   that mutual sincerity which every man wishes to be pursued towards
   himself. The sum of the Law, therefore, relates to charity.

   The word faith, I am aware, is interpreted by some persons differently,
   as including, by synecdoche, the whole worship of God; but Christ,
   according to his custom, here brings the true test of holiness to
   brotherly love, and therefore does not refer to the first table. Nor is
   it inconsistent with this view that, instead of faith, Luke uses the
   expression, the love of God; for the design of Christ was, to show what
   it is that the Lord chiefly requires of us in his Law. It is well known
   that the Law was divided into two tables, so as to point out, first,
   what we owe to God, and next, what we owe to men. Luke expresses both
   parts as if Christ had said, that the chief design of the Law is, that
   we should love God, and that we should be just and merciful towards our
   neighbors. Matthew satisfies himself with one part; and there is no
   absurdity in calling the duties of charity the principal points of the
   Law, since charity itself is pronounced by Paul to be the perfection of
   the Law; as he also says, that

   the Law is fulfilled if toe love our neighbors,
   (Romans 13:10.)

   And Christ, when formerly interrogated as to the commandments of the
   Law quoted none but those which belonged to the second table.

   If it be objected, that in this way men are preferred to God, because
   charity, which is performed towards them, is reckoned more valuable
   than religion, the answer is easy. Christ does not here contrast the
   second table of the Law with the first, but, on the contrary, draws
   from the manner in which the second table is kept the proof whether or
   not God is truly and sincerely worshipped. As piety lies within the
   heart, and as God does not dwell amongst us in order to make trial of
   our love towards Him, and does not even need our services, it is easy
   for hypocrites to lie, and falsely to pretend to love God. But the
   duties of brotherly love fall under the senses, and are placed before
   the eyes of all, and therefore in them the impudence of hypocrites is
   better ascertained. Christ, therefore, did not intend to enter into
   subtle inquiries about the particular parts of righteousness, or their
   order, but, so far as the ordinary capacity of men allowed, intended
   simply to show that the Law is kept only when men are just, and kind,
   and true, towards each other; for thus they testify that they love and
   fear God, and give proper and sufficient evidence of sincere piety. Not
   that it is enough to discharge our duties towards men, if we do not
   first render to God what we owe to him, but because he who regulates
   his life according to God's commandment must be a sincere worshipper of
   God.

   And yet the question is not fully answered; for tithes, which Christ
   places inferior to judgment and mercy, were a part of divine worship,
   and some part of them was usually bestowed on the poor, so that tithes
   contained a double sacrifice. I reply: Tithes are not simply compared
   to alms, and faith, and judgment, but the pretended holiness of the
   scribes is compared with the sincere and pure feeling of charity. Why
   were they so ready and willing to pay tithes, but in order to pacify
   God a, the least expense and trouble? For they did not regard the
   principal point; and therefore those light matters, by which they
   attempted to deceive God and men, ought not to be reckoned along the
   duties of charity.

   Matthew 23:23. The former you ought to have done. This is intended to
   anticipate their calumny; for they might have put an unfavorable
   interpretation on his discourse, and charged him with setting no value
   on what the Law of God had enjoined. He therefore acknowledges that
   whatever God has enjoined ought to be performed, and that no part of it
   ought to be omitted, but maintains that zeal for the whole Law is no
   reason why we ought not to insist chiefly on the principal points.
   Hence he infers that they overturn the natural order who employ
   themselves in the smallest matters, when they ought rather to have
   begun with the principal points; for tithes were only a kind of
   appendage. Christ therefore affirms that he has no intention to lessen
   the authority even of the smallest commandments, though he recommends
   and demands due order in keeping the Law. It is therefore our duty to
   preserve entire the whole Law, which cannot be violated in any part
   without contempt for its Author; for He who has forbidden us to commit
   adultery, and to kill, and to steal, has likewise condemned all impure
   desire. Hence we conclude that all the commandments are so interwoven
   with each other, that we have no right to detach one of them from the
   rest. Wherefore it is also written,

   Cursed is every one that performeth not all things that are written,
   (Deuteronomy 27:26; Galatians 3:10;)

   by which words the righteousness of the whole Law, without exception,
   is enforced. But this reverence, as we have said, does not take away
   the distinction between the commandments, or the true design of the
   Law, to which those who truly observe it direct their mind, that they
   may not merely amuse themselves on the surface.

   24. Blind guides. This is s proverbial saying, by which he beautifully
   describes the affected scrupulousness of hypocrites about trifling
   matters; for they utterly shrink from very small faults, as if a single
   transgression appeared to them more revolting than a hundred deaths,
   and yet they freely permit themselves and others to commit the most
   heinous crimes. They act as absurdly as if a man were to strain out a
   small crumb of bread, and to swallow a whole loaf.

   Straining out [101] a gnat, and swallowing a camel. We know that a gnat
   is a very small animal, and that a camel is a huge beast. Nothing
   therefore could be more ridiculous than to strain out the wine or the
   water, so as not to hurt the jaws by swallowing a gnat, and yet
   carelessly to gulp down a camel. [102] But it is evident that
   hypocrites amuse themselves with such distinctions; for while they pass
   by judgment, mercy, and faith, and even tear in pieces the whole Law,
   they are excessively rigid and severe in matters that are of no great
   importance; and while in this way they pretend to kiss the feet of God,
   they proudly spit in his face.

   25. For you cleanse the outer part. Our Lord follows out the same
   statement, and employs a figure for reproaching the scribes with being
   eagerly bent on this single object of making a brilliant appearance
   before men. For by the outer part of the dish he metaphorically
   expresses the outward appearance; as if he had said, "You give
   yourselves no concern about any cleanness but what appears outwardly,
   which is quite as if one were carefully to wash off the filth of the
   dish without, but to leave it filthy within." That the expression is
   metaphorical is evident from the second clause, in which the
   uncleanness within is condemned, because within they are full of
   intemperance and extortion. He therefore reproves their hypocrisy, in
   not endeavoring to regulate their life, except before the eyes of men,
   in order to procure for themselves an empty reputation for holiness.
   Thus he recalls them to the pure and sincere desire of a holy life.
   Cleanse first, he says, that which is within; for it would be
   ridiculous to feast your eyes with outward splendor, and yet to drink
   out of a cup full of dregs, or in other respects filthy. [103]

   27 You are like whitened sepulchers. This is a different metaphor, but
   the meaning is the same; for he compares them to sepulchers, which the
   men of the world ambitiously construct with great beauty and splendor.
   As a painting or engraving on sepulchers draws the eyes of men upon
   them, while inwardly they contain stinking carcasses; so Christ says
   that hypocrites deceive by their outward appearance, because they are
   full of deceit and iniquity. The words of Luke are somewhat different,
   that they deceive the eyes of men, like sepulchers, which frequently
   are not perceived by those who walk over them; but it amounts to the
   same meaning, that, under the garb of pretended holiness, there lurks
   hidden filth which they cherish in their hearts, like a marble
   sepulcher; for it wears the aspect of what is beautiful and lovely, but
   covers a stinking carcass, so as not to be offensive to those who pass
   by. Hence we infer what I have formerly said, that Christ, with a view
   to the advantage of the simple and ignorant, tore off the deceitful
   mask which the scribes held wrapped around them in empty hypocrisy; for
   this warning was advantageous to simple persons, that they might
   quickly withdraw from the jaws of wolves. Yet this passage contains a
   general doctrine, that the children of God ought to desire to be pure
   rather than to appear so.

   [101] In rendering the words, hoi diulizontes tou kunopa, Campbell
   resorts to a circumlocution, who strain your liquor, to avoid
   swallowing a gnat; and he adds the following note:-- E.T. Who strain at
   a gnat. I do not understand the import of this expression. Some have
   thought that it has sprung originally from a mere typographical error
   of some printer, who has made it strain at, instead of strain out." --
   The conjecture mentioned by Campbell is strongly confirmed by the
   earlier English versions. "Blinde leders; clensenge a gnat, but
   swolowynge a camel." -- (Wyclif, 1380.) "Ye blinde gydes, which strayne
   out a gnat, and swalowe a cammyll." -- (Tyndale, 1534.) "Ye blynde
   gydes, which strayne out a gnat, and swalowe a camell." -- (Cranmer,
   1539.) "Ye blynde gydes, which strayne out a gnate, and swalow a
   cammel." -- (Geneva, 1557.) "Blinde guides, that strain a gnat, and
   swallow a camel." -- (Rheims, 1582.) The coincidence of those versions
   in supporting the true reading is very remarkable, and the substitution
   of at for out is more likely to have been the effect of accident than
   of design. -- Ed.

   [102] "Et cependant ne faire point de difficulté d'engloutir un chameau
   tout entier;" -- "and yet make no difficulty about swallowing a whole

   Luke 11:47-51

   29. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the
   sepulchers of the prophets and embellish the monuments of the
   righteous, 30. And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we
   would not have been their associates in the blood of the prophets.
   31. Thus you testify against yourselves, that you are the children of
   those who killed the prophets. 32. Do you also fill up the measure of
   your fathers. 33. Serpents, offspring of vipers, how shall you escape
   the judgment of hell? 34. Therefore, lo, I send to you prophets, and
   wise men, and scribes, and some of them you will slay and crucify, and
   some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from
   city to city: 35. That upon you may come all the righteous blood which
   hath been shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the
   blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you slew between the temple
   and the altar. 36. Verily I say to you, All these things shall come on
   this generation. 37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who slayest the prophets,
   and stonest those who were sent to thee, how often would I have
   gathered together thy children, as a hen gathereth her chickens under
   her wings, and you would not! 38. Lo, your house is left to you
   desolate. 39. For I tell you, that you shall never see me henceforth,
   till you say, Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

   47. Woe to you, for you build the monuments [104] of the prophets, and
   your fathers slew them. [105] 48. Truly you testify that you approve of
   the actions of your fathers; [106] for they indeed slew them, and you
   build their sepulchers. 49. Therefore also the Wisdom of God hath said,
   I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will
   slay and persecute: 50. That the blood of all the prophets, which hath
   been shed since the creation of the world, may be demanded from this
   generation; 51. From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who
   perished between the altar and the temple. Assuredly I tell you, That
   it shall be demanded from this generation.


   Luke 13:34-35

   34. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who slayest the prophets, and stonest those
   who are sent to thee; how often would I have gathered thy children
   together, as a bird gathereth its brood under its wings, and you would
   not! 35. Lo, your house is left to you desolate. But I tell you, that
   you shall not see me, until the time come when you say Blessed be he
   that cometh in the name of the Lord.


   Luke 11:53-54

   53. And while he was saying these things to them, the lawyers and
   Pharisees began to press him closely, and cunningly to interrogate him
   about many things; 54. Laying snares for him, and seeking to catch
   something out of his mouth, to accuse him.


   Matthew 23:29. For you build the sepulchers of the prophets. An
   unfounded opinion is entertained by some, that the scribes are here
   reproved for superstition, in foolishly honoring the deceased prophets
   by splendid sepulchers, as the Papists now transfer the honor of God to
   departed saints, and even are so perverse as to adore their images.
   They had not yet arrived at such a pitch of blindness and madness, and
   therefore the design of Christ was different. The scribes endeavored to
   gain the favor of the ignorant multitude, and indeed of all the Jews,
   by this additional hypocrisy, that they cherished with reverence the
   memory of the prophets; for while in this manner they pretended to
   maintain their doctrine, any one would have supposed that they were
   faithful imitators of them, and very keen zealots for the worship of
   God. It was a proposal, therefore, which was likely to prove highly
   acceptable, to erect monuments for the prophets, because in this way
   religion might be said to be drawn out of darkness, that it might
   receive the honor which it deserved. And yet nothing was farther from
   their design than to restore doctrine, which might appear to have been
   extinguished by the death of the prophets. But though they were not
   only averse to the doctrine of the prophets, but most inveterate
   enemies to it, yet they honored them--when dead--with sepulchers, as if
   they had made common cause with them.

   It is customary, indeed, with hypocrites thus to honor, after their
   death, good teachers and holy ministers of God, whom they cannot endure
   while they are alive. Nor does this arise merely from the common fault,
   which Horace thus describes: "We hate virtue while it is in safety, but
   when it has been removed from our eyes, we seek it with envy;" [107]
   but as the ashes of the dead no longer give annoyance by harsh and
   severe reproofs, they who are driven to madness by the living voices of
   those men are not unwilling, by adoring them, to make an empty display
   of religion. It is a hypocrisy which costs little to profess warm
   regard for those who are now silent. [108] Thus each of the prophets,
   in his own age, was contemptuously rejected, and wickedly tormented, by
   the Jews, and, in many instances, cruelly put to death; while
   posterity, though not a whit better than their fathers, pretended to
   venerate their memory, instead of embracing their doctrine; for they
   too were actuated by equal hostility towards their own teachers. [109]
   As the world--not venturing altogether to despise God, or at least to
   rise openly against him--contrives this stratagem of adoring the shadow
   of God instead of God, so a similar game is played in reference to the
   prophets.

   A proof of this--far too striking--may be seen in Popery. Not satisfied
   with paying just veneration to Apostles and Martyrs, they render to
   them divine worship, and think that they cannot go too far in the
   honors which they heap upon them; and yet, by their rage against
   believers, they show what sort of respect they would have manifested
   towards Apostles and Martyrs, if they had been still alive to discharge
   the same office which they anciently held. For why are they inflamed
   with such rage against us, but because we desire that doctrine to be
   received, and to be successful, which the Apostles and Martyrs sealed
   with their blood? While the holy servants of God valued that doctrine
   more highly than their own life, would their life have been spared by
   those who so outrageously persecute the doctrine? Let them adorn the
   images of the saints as they may think fit, by perfumes, candles,
   flowers, and every sort of gaudy ornament. If Peter were now alive,
   they would tear him in pieces; they would stone Paul; and if Christ
   himself were still in the world, they would burn him with a slow fire.

   Our Lord, perceiving that the scribes and priests of his age were eager
   to obtain the applause of the people, on the ground of their being
   devout worshippers of the prophets, reproves them for deceit and
   mockery, because they not only reject, but even cruelly persecute, the
   prophets that are now present, [110] and whom God has sent to them. But
   it is a display of base hypocrisy, and shameful impudence, to desire to
   be thought religious on account of worshipping the dead, while they
   endeavor to murder the living.

   30. If we had been in the days of our fathers. Not without good reason
   did Christ introduce this sentiment; for though he does not blame them
   for the conduct of their fathers, and does not make it the chief ground
   of accusation that they are the children of murderers: yet he takes a
   passing glance of their foolish boasting, in being accustomed to glory
   in their ancestors, while they were descended from the bloody enemies
   of God. The appeal may be thus stated: "You look upon the veneration
   which you pay to the deceased prophets as some sort of expiation for
   the wickedness of your fathers. Now then I have this to urge, that it
   is in vain for you to boast of a sacred ancestry, since you are
   descended from wicked and ungodly parents. Go now, and screen your
   crimes by the piety of those whose hands, you acknowledge, were stained
   with innocent blood. But it is an additional and far more heinous
   crime, that the sacrilegious fury of the fathers, which you condemn by
   raising sepulchers for the dead, is imitated by you in the murder of
   the living."

   32. Do you then fill up the measure of your fathers. He at length
   concludes that they are not, in this respect, degenerate from their
   fathers; as if he had said, "It is not now that your nation begins to
   treat with cruelty the prophets of God; for this is the ancient
   discipline, this is the custom handed down from the fathers, and, in
   short, this way of acting is almost natural to you." And yet he does
   not bid them do what they are doing, to put to death holy teachers, but
   states figuratively that they have a hereditary right to rise against
   the servants of God, and that they must be permitted to oppose
   religion, because in this way they fill up what is wanting in the
   crimes of their fathers, and finish the web which they had begun. By
   these words he not only pronounces themselves to be desperate, and
   incapable of being brought to a sound mind, but warns simple people
   that there is no reason to wonder, if the prophets of God are
   ill-treated by the children of murderers.

   33. Offspring of vipers. After having demonstrated that the scribes are
   not only base enemies of sound doctrine, and wicked corrupters of the
   worship of God, but likewise deadly plagues of the Church, Christ,
   being about to close his discourse, kindles into more vehement
   indignation against them; as it is necessary to shake off by violence
   the flatteries in which hypocrites indulge, and to drag them, as it
   were, to the judgment seat of God, that they may be filled with alarm.
   And yet Christ did not keep them alone in his eye, but intended to
   strike terror into the whole people, that all might guard against a
   similar destruction. How harsh and intolerable this roughness of
   language must have been to these reverend instructors may easily be
   inferred from the long period during which they had held a peaceful
   dominion, so that no one dared to mutter against them. And there can be
   no doubt that many were displeased with the great freedom and sharpness
   which Christ used, and, above all, that he was looked upon as
   immoderate and outrageous in venturing to apply such reproachful
   epithets to the order of the scribes; as many fastidious persons of the
   present day cannot endure any harsh word to be spoken against the
   Popish clergy. But as Christ had to deal with the worst of hypocrites,
   who not only were swelled with proud contempt of God, and intoxicated
   with careless security, but had captivated the multitude by their
   enchantments, he found it necessary to exclaim against them with
   vehemence. He calls them serpents both in nature and in habits, and
   then threatens them with a punishment, which it will be in vain for
   them to attempt to escape, if they do not speedily repent.

   34. Therefore, lo, I send to you. Luke introduces it in a still more
   emphatic manner, Wherefore also the Wisdom of God hath said; which some
   commentators explain thus: "I, who am the eternal Wisdom of God,
   declare this concerning you." But I am more inclined to believe that,
   according to the ordinary custom of Scripture, God is here represented
   as speaking in the person of his Wisdom; so that the meaning is, "God
   foretold long ago, by the prophetic Spirit, what would happen with
   regard to you." This sentence, I acknowledge, is nowhere to be found
   literally: but as God denounces the incorrigible obstinacy of that
   people in many places of Scripture, Christ draws up a kind of summary
   of them, and by this personification [111] expresses more clearly what
   was the judgment of God as to the incurable wickedness of that nation.
   For if those teachers would have no success, it might have appeared
   strange that Christ should have desired them to weary themselves to no
   purpose. Men argue thus: "God labors in vain, when he sends his word to
   the reprobate, who, he knows, will continue obstinate." And hypocrites,
   as if it were sufficient of itself to have preachers of the heavenly
   doctrine continually with them, though they show themselves to be
   disobedient, entertain the conviction that God is reconciled and
   favorable to them, provided that the outward word be heard amongst
   them.

   Thus the Jews fiercely boasted that, in comparison of other nations,
   they had always enjoyed the best prophets and teachers, and, as if they
   had deserved so great an honor, they considered this to be an undoubted
   proof of their own excellence. [112] To put down this foolish boasting,
   Christ not only affirms that they do not excel other nations on the
   ground of having received from God distinguished prophets and
   expounders of his Wisdom, but maintains that this ilk requited favor is
   a greater reproach, and will bring upon them a heavier condemnation,
   because the purpose of God was different from what they supposed,
   namely, to render them more inexcusable, and to bring their wicked
   malice to the highest pitch; as if he had said, "Though prophets have
   been appointed to you by heaven in close succession, it is idly and
   foolishly that you claim this as an honor; for God had quite a
   different object in his secret judgment, which was, to lay open, by an
   uninterrupted succession of gracious invitations, your wicked
   obstinacy, and, on your being convicted of it, to involve the children
   in the same condemnation with the fathers."

   With regard to the words, the discourse as related by Matthew is
   defective, but its meaning must be supplied from the words of Luke. The
   mention of scribes and wise men along with prophets tends to magnify
   the grace of God; by which their ingratitude becomes more apparent,
   since, though God left nothing undone for their instruction, they made
   no proficiency. Instead of wise men and scribes, Luke mentions
   apostles, but the meaning is the same. This passage shows that God does
   not always bestow salvation on men when he sends his word to them, but
   that he sometimes intends to have it proclaimed to the reprobate, who,
   he knows, will continue obstinate, that it may be to them

   the savior of death unto death, (2 Corinthians 2:16.)

   The word of God, indeed, in itself and by its own nature, brings
   salvation, and invites all men indiscriminately to the hope of eternal
   life; but as all are not inwardly drawn, and as God does not pierce the
   ears of ally--in short, as they are not renewed to repentance or bent
   to obedience, those who reject the word of God render it, by their
   unbelief, deadly and destructive.

   While God foresees that this will be the result, he purposely sends his
   prophets to them, that he may involve the reprobate in severer
   condemnation, as is more fully explained by Isaiah, (6:10.) This, I
   acknowledge, is very far from being agreeable to the reason of the
   flesh, as we see that unholy despisers of God seize on it as a
   plausible excuse for barking, that God, like some cruel tyrant, takes
   pleasure in inflicting more severe punishment on men whom, without any
   expectation of advantage, he knowingly and willingly hardens more and
   more. But by such examples God exercises the modesty of believers. Let
   us maintain such sobriety as to tremble and adore what exceeds our
   senses. Those who say, that God's foreknowledge does not hinder
   unbelievers from being saved, foolishly make use of an idle defense for
   excusing God. I admit that the reprobate, in bringing death upon
   themselves, have no intention of doing what God foresaw would happen,
   and therefore that the fault of their perishing cannot be ascribed to
   His foreknowledge; but I assert that it is improper to employ this
   sophistry in defending the justice of God, because it may be
   immediately objected that it lies with God to make them repent, for the
   gift of faith and repentance is in his power.

   We shall next be met by this objection, What is the reason why God, by
   a fixed and deliberate purpose, appoints the light of his word to blind
   men? When they have been devoted to eternal death, why is he not
   satisfied with their simple ruin? and why does he wish that they should
   perish twice or three times? There is nothing left for us but to
   ascribe glory to the judgments of God, by exclaiming with Paul, that
   they are a deep and unfathomable abyss, (Romans 11:33.) But it is
   asked, How does he declare that the prophecies will turn to the
   destruction of the Jews, while his adoption still continued to be in
   force towards that nation? I reply, As but a small portion embraced the
   word by faith for salvation, this passage relates to the greater number
   or the whole body; as Isaiah, after having predicted the general
   destruction of the nation, is commanded

   to seal the law of God among the disciples, (Isaiah 8:16.)

   Let us know then that, wherever the Scripture denounces eternal death
   against the Jews, it excepts a remnant, (Isaiah 1:9; Romans 11:5;) that
   is, those in whom the Lord preserves some seed on account of his free
   election

   35. That upon you may come. He not only takes away from them their
   false boasting, but shows that they had received prophets for a totally
   different purpose, that no age might be free from the criminality of
   wicked rebellion; for the pronoun you embraces generally the whole
   nation from its very commencement. If it be objected, that it is not
   consistent with the judgment of God that punishment should be inflicted
   on the children for the sins of the parents, the answer is easy. Since
   they are all involved in a wicked conspiracy, we ought not to think it
   strange if God, in punishing all without reserve, make the punishment
   due to the fathers to fall upon the children. Justly then is the whole
   nation -- in whatever age individuals may have lived -- called to
   account, and likewise punished, for this unceasing contempt. For as
   God, by an uninterrupted course of patience, has unceasingly contended
   with the malice of the whole people, so the whole people is justly held
   guilty of the inflexible obstinacy which continued to the very last;
   and as every age had conspired to put to death its own prophets, so it
   is right that a general sentence should be pronounced upon them, and
   that all the murders, which have been perpetrated with one consent,
   should be avenged on all.

   From the blood of Abel. Though Abel (Genesis 4:8) was not slain by the
   Jews, yet the murder of Abel is imputed to them by Christ, because
   there is an affinity of wickedness between them and Cain; otherwise
   there would have been no propriety in saying that righteous blood had
   been shed by that nation from the beginning of the world. Cain is
   therefore declared to be the head, and leader, and instigator of the
   Jewish people, because, ever since they began to slay prophets, they
   succeeded in the room of him whose imitators they were.

   To the blood of Zechariah. He does not speak of Zechariah as the latest
   martyr; for the Jews did not then put an end to the murder of the
   prophets, but, on the contrary, their insolence and madness increased
   from that period; and posterity, who followed them, satiated themselves
   with the blood which their fathers only tasted. Nor is it because his
   death was better known, though it is recorded in Scripture. But there
   is another reason, which, though it deserves attention, has escaped the
   notice of commentators; in consequence of which they have not only
   fallen into a mistake, but have likewise involved their readers in a
   troublesome question. We might suppose it to have arisen from
   forgetfulness on the part of Christ, that, while he mentions one
   ancient murder, he passes by a prodigious slaughter which afterwards
   took place under Manasseh. For until the Jews were carried to Babylon,
   their wicked persecutions of holy men did not cease; and even while
   they were still under affliction, we know with what cruelty and rage
   they pursued Jeremiah, (32:2.) But our Lord on purpose abstains from
   reproaching them with recent murders, and selects this murder, which
   was more ancient--which was also the commencement and source of base
   licentiousness, and afterwards led them to break out into unbounded
   cruelty--because it was more suitable to his design. For I have lately
   explained, that his leading object was to show that this nation, as it
   did not desist from impiety, must be held guilty of all the murders
   which had been perpetrated during a long period. Not only, therefore,
   does he denounce the punishment of their present cruelty, but says that
   they must be called to account for the murder of Zechariah, as if their
   own hands had been imbrued in his blood.

   There is no probability in the opinion of those who refer this passage
   to that Zechariah who exhorted the people, after their return from the
   Babylonish captivity, to build the temple, (Zechariah 8:9,) and whose
   prophecies are still in existence. For though the title of the book
   informs us that he was the son of Barachiah, (Zechariah 1:1,) yet we
   nowhere read that he was slain; and it is, forced exposition to say,
   that he was slain during the period that intervened between the
   building of the altar and of the temple. But as to the other Zechariah,
   son of Jehoiada, the sacred history relates what agrees perfectly with
   this passage; that when true religion had fallen into decay, after the
   death of his father, through the wicked revolt of the king and of the
   people, the Spirit of God came upon him, to reprove severely the public
   idolatry, and that on this account he was stoned in the porch of the
   temple, (2 Chronicles 24:20, 21.) There is no absurdity in supposing
   that his father Jehoiada received, in token of respect, the surname of
   Barachiah, because, having throughout his whole life defended the true
   worship, he might justly be pronounced to be the Blessed of God. But
   whether Jehoiada had two names, or whether (as Jerome thinks) there is
   a mistake in the word, there can be no doubt as to the fact, that
   Christ refers to that impious stoning of Zechariah which is recorded in
   2 Chronicles 24:21, 22

   Whom you slew between the temple and the altar. The crime is rendered
   still more heinous by the circumstance of the place, since they did not
   revere the sacredness of the temple. Here the temple is put for the
   outer court, as in other passages. Near it was the altar of burnt
   offerings, (1 Kings 8:64; 18:30,) so that the priest offered the
   sacrifices in presence of the people. It is evident, therefore, that
   there must have been furious rage, when the sight of the altar and of
   the temple could not restrain the Jews from profaning that sacred place
   by a detestable murder.

   37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem. By these words, Christ shows more clearly
   what good reason he had for indignation, that Jerusalem, which God had
   chosen to be his sacred, and -- as we might say -- heavenly abode, not
   only had shown itself to be unworthy of so great an honor, but, as if
   it had been a den of robbers, (Jeremiah 7:11,) had been long accustomed
   to suck the blood of the prophets. Christ therefore utters a pathetic
   exclamation at a sight so monstrous, as that the holy city of God
   should have arrived at such a pitch of madness, that it had long
   endeavored to extinguish the saving doctrine of God by shedding the
   blood of the prophets. This is also implied in the repetition of the
   name, because impiety so monstrous and incredible deserves no ordinary
   detestation.

   Thou who killest the prophets. Christ does not reproach them with
   merely one or another murder, but says that this custom was so deeply
   rooted, that the city did not care to slay every one of the prophets
   that were sent to it. For the participle, (apokteinousa tous
   prophetas), (killing the prophets,) is put for an epithet; as if Christ
   had said, "Thou who oughtest to have been a faithful guardian of the
   word of God, a teacher of heavenly wisdom, the light of the world, the
   fountain of sound doctrine, the seat of divine worship, a pattern of
   faith and obedience, art a murderer of the prophets, so that thou hast
   acquired a certain habit of sucking their blood." [113] Hence it is
   evident, that they who had so basely profaned the sanctuary of God
   deserved every kind of reproaches. Yet Christ had likewise the
   intention to obviate the scandal which soon after arose, that
   believers, when they saw him basely put to death at Jerusalem, might
   not be confounded by the novelty of such an exhibition. For by these
   words they were already warned that it was not wonderful if a city,
   which had been accustomed to strangle or stone the prophets, should
   cruelly put to death its own Redeemer. This shows us what value we
   should attach to places. There never certainly was a city in the world
   on which God bestowed such magnificent titles, or such distinguished
   honor; and yet we see how deeply it was sunk by its ingratitude.

   Let the Pope now compare the abode of his robbery with that holy city;
   what will he find worthy of equal honor? His hired flatterers boast to
   us that the faith flourished there in ancient times. But admitting this
   to be true, if it is evident that it has now, by wicked rebellion,
   revolted from Christ, and is full of innumerable deeds of sacrilege,
   what folly is it in them to maintain that the honor of primacy belongs
   to it? Let us, on the contrary, learn from this memorable example, that
   when any place has been exalted by uncommon instances of the favor of
   God, and thus has been removed from the ordinary rank, if it
   degenerate, it will not only be stripped of its ornaments, but will
   become so much the more hateful and detestable, because it has basely
   profaned the glow of God by staining the beauty of his favors.

   How often would I have gathered together thy children. This is
   expressive of indignation rather than of compassion. The city itself,
   indeed, over which he had lately wept, (Luke 19:41,) is still an object
   of his compassion; but towards the scribes, who were the authors of its
   destruction, he uses harshness and severity, as they deserved. And yet
   he does not spare the rest, who were all guilty of approving and
   partaking of the same crime, but, including all in the same
   condemnation, he inveighs chiefly against the leaders themselves, who
   were the cause of all the evils. We must now observe the vehemence of
   the discourse. If in Jerusalem the grace of God had been merely
   rejected, there would have been inexcusable ingratitude; but since God
   attempted to draw the Jews to himself by mild and gentle methods, and
   gained nothing by such kindness, the criminality of such haughty
   disdain was far more aggravated. There was likewise added unconquerable
   obstinacy; for not once and again did God wish to gather them together,
   but, by constant and uninterrupted advances, he sent to them the
   prophets, one after another, almost all of whom were rejected by the
   great body of the people.

   As a hen collecteth her brood under her wings. We now perceive the
   reason why Christ, speaking in the person of God, compares himself to a
   hen. It is to inflict deeper disgrace on this wicked nation, which had
   treated with disdain invitations so gentle, and proceeding from more
   than maternal kindness. It is an amazing and unparalleled instance of
   love, that he did not disdain to stoop to those blandishments, by which
   he might tame rebels into subjection. A reproof nearly similar is
   employed by Moses, that God, like

   an eagle with outspread wings, (Deuteronomy 32:11,)

   embraced that people. And though in more than one way God spread out
   his wings to cherish that people, yet this form of expression is
   applied by Christ, in a peculiar manner, to one class, namely, that
   prophets were sent to gather together the wandering and dispersed into
   the bosom of God. By this he means that, whenever the word of God is
   exhibited to us, he opens his bosom to us with maternal kindness, and,
   not satisfied with this, condescends to the humble affection of a hen
   watching over her chickens. Hence it follows, that our obstinacy is
   truly monstrous, if we do not permit him to gather us together. And,
   indeed, if we consider, on the one hand, the dreadful majesty of God,
   and, on the other, our mean and low condition, we cannot but be ashamed
   and astonished at such amazing goodness. For what object can God have
   in view in abasing himself so low on our account? When he compares
   himself to a mother, he descends very far below his glory; how much
   more when he takes the form of a hen, and deigns to treat us as his
   chickens?

   Besides, if this charge was justly brought against the ancient people,
   who lived under the Law, it is far more applicable to us. For though
   the statement--which I quoted a little ago from Moses--was always true,
   and though the complaints which we find in Isaiah are just, that

   in vain did God spread out his hands every day to embrace a
   hard-hearted and rebellious people, (Isaiah 65:2)

   that, though he rose up early, (Jeremiah 7:13) he gained nothing by his
   incessant care of them; yet now, with far greater familiarity and
   kindness, he invites us to himself by his Son. And, therefore, whenever
   he exhibits to us the doctrine of the Gospel, dreadful vengeance awaits
   us, if we do not quietly hide ourselves under his wings, by which he is
   ready to receive and shelter us. Christ teaches us, at the same time,
   that all enjoy safety and rest who, by the obedience of faith, are
   gathered together to God; because under his wings they have an
   impregnable refuge. [114]

   We must attend likewise to the other part of this accusation, that God,
   notwithstanding the obstinate rebellion of his ancient people, was not
   all at once so much offended by it, as to lay aside a father's love and
   a mother's anxiety, since he did not cease to send prophets after
   prophets in uninterrupted succession; as in our own day, though he has
   experienced a marvelous depravity in the world, he still continues to
   dispense his grace. But these words contain still deeper instruction,
   namely, that the Jews, as soon as the Lord gathered them together,
   immediately left him. Hence came dispersions so frequent, that they
   scarcely remained at rest for a single moment under the wings of God,
   as we see in the present day a certain wildness in the world, which has
   indeed existed in all ages; and, therefore, it is necessary that God
   should recall to himself those who are wandering and going astray. But
   this is the crowning point of desperate and final depravity, when men
   obstinately reject the goodness of God, and refuse to come under his
   wings.

   I said formerly that Christ speaks here in the person of God, and my
   meaning is, that this discourse belongs properly to his eternal
   Godhead; for he does not now speak of what he began to do since he was
   manifested in the flesh, (1 Timothy 3:16,) but of the care which he
   exercised about the salvation of his people from the beginning. Now we
   know that the Church was governed by God in such a manner that Christ,
   as the Eternal Wisdom of God, presided over it. In this sense Paul
   says, not that God the Father was tempted in the wilderness, but that
   Christ himself was tempted, [115] (1 Corinthians 10:9.)

   Again, when the sophists seize on this passage, to prove free will, and
   to set aside the secret predestination of God, the answer is easy. "God
   wills to gather all men," say they; "and therefore all are at liberty
   to come, and their will does not depend on the election of God." I
   reply: The will of God, which is here mentioned, must be judged from
   the result. For since by his word he calls all men indiscriminately to
   salvation, and since the end of preaching is, that all should betake
   themselves to his guardianship and protection, it may justly be said
   that he wills to gather all to himself. It is not, therefore, the
   secret purpose of God, but his will, which is manifested by the nature
   of the word, that is here described; for, undoubtedly, whomsoever he
   efficaciously wills to gather, he inwardly draws by his Spirit, and
   does not merely invite by the outward voice of man.

   If it be objected, that it is absurd to suppose the existence of two
   wills in God, I reply, we fully believe that his will is simple and
   one; but as our minds do not fathom the deep abyss of secret election,
   in accommodation to the capacity of our weakness, the will of God is
   exhibited to us in two ways. And I am astonished at the obstinacy of
   some people, who, when in many passages of Scripture they meet with
   that figure of speech [116] (anthropopatheia) which attributes to God
   human feelings, take no offense, but in this case alone refuse to admit
   it. But as I have elsewhere treated this subject fully, that I may not
   be unnecessarily tedious, I only state briefly that, whenever the
   doctrine, which is the standard of union, [117] is brought forward, God
   wills to gather all, that all who do not come may be inexcusable.

   And you would not. This may be supposed to refer to the whole nation,
   as well as to the scribes; but I rather interpret it in reference to
   the latter, by whom the gathering together, [118] was chiefly
   prevented. For it was against them that Christ inveighed throughout the
   whole of the passage; and now, after having addressed Jerusalem in the
   singular number, it appears not without reason that he immediately used
   the plural number. There is an emphatic contrast between God's willing
   and their not willing; [119] for it expresses the diabolical rage of
   men, who do not hesitate to contradict God.

   38 Lo, your house is left to you desolate. He threatens the destruction
   of the temple, and the dissolution of the whole frame of civil
   government. Though they were disfigured by irreligion, crimes, and
   every kind of infamy, yet they were so blinded by a foolish confidence
   in the temple, and its outward service, that they thought that God was
   bound to them; and this was the shield which they had always at hand:
   "What? Could God depart from that place which he has chosen to be his
   only habitation in the world? And since he dwells in the midst of us,
   we must one day be restored." In short, they looked upon the temple as
   their invincible fortress, as if they dwelt in the bosom of God. But
   Christ maintains that it is in vain for them to boast of the presence
   of God, whom they had driven away by their crimes, and, by calling it
   their house, (lo, your house is left to you,) he indirectly intimates
   to them that it is no longer the house of God. The temple had indeed
   been built on the condition, that at the coming of Christ it would
   cease to be the abode and residence of Deity; but it would have
   remained as a remarkable demonstration of the continued grace of God,
   if its destruction had not been occasioned by the wickedness of the
   people. It was therefore a dreadful vengeance of God, that the place
   which Himself had so magnificently adorned was not only forsaken by
   Him, and ordered to be razed to the foundation, but consigned to the
   lowest infamy to the end of the world. Let the Romanists now go, and
   let them proceed, in opposition to the will of God, to build their
   Tower of Babylon, while they see that the temple of God, which had been
   built by his authority and at his command, was laid low on account of
   the crimes of the people.

   39. For I tell you. He confirms what he had said about the approaching
   vengeance of God, by saying that the only method of avoiding
   destruction will be taken from them. For that was the accepted time,
   the day of salvation, (Isaiah 49:8; 2 Corinthians 6:2,) so long as that
   very person who had come to be their Redeemer, attested and proclaimed
   the redemption which he had brought. But at his departure, as at the
   setting of the sun, the light of life vanished; and therefore this
   dreadful calamity, which he threatens, must of necessity fall upon
   them.

   Until you say. We come now to inquire what period is denoted by this
   phrase. Some restrict it to the last day of judgment. Others think that
   it is a prediction, which was soon afterwards fulfilled, when some of
   the Jews humbly adored Christ. But I do not approve of either of these
   interpretations. And I am certainly astonished that learned men should
   have stumbled at so small an obstacle, by taking great pains to inquire
   how unbelievers can say concerning Christ, Blessed be he that cometh in
   the name of the Lord; for he does not declare what they will be, but
   what he himself will do. And even the adverb until extends no farther
   than to the time which goes before. Joseph did not know his wife until
   she brought forth Christ, (Matthew 1:25.) By these words Scripture does
   not mean, that after Christ had been born they lived together as
   husband and wife, but only shows that Mary, before the birth of her
   son, was a virgin that had not known man.

   So then the true meaning of the present passage, in my opinion, is
   this: "Hitherto I have lived among you in humility and kindness, and
   have discharged the office of a teacher; and now having finished the
   course of my calling, I shall depart, and it will not be possible for
   you any longer to enjoy my presence, but him whom you now despise as a
   Redeemer and a minister of salvation, you will find to be your Judge."
   In this manner the passage agrees with the words of Zechariah, They
   shall look on him whom they pierced, (Zechariah 12:10; John 19:37.) But
   Christ appears also to make an indirect allusion to their vain
   hypocrisy, because, as if they ardently longed for the promised
   salvation, they sung daily the words of the psalm,

   Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord,
   (Psalm 118:26;)

   while they treated with scorn the Redeemer that was offered to them. In
   short, he declares that he will not come to them until, trembling at
   the sight of his dreadful majesty, they shall exclaim--when it is too
   late--that truly he is the Son of God. And this threatening is
   addressed to all despisers of the Gospel, more especially to those who
   falsely profess his name, while they reject his doctrine; for they will
   one day acknowledge that they cannot escape the hands of him whom they
   now mock by their hypocritical pretensions. For the same song is now
   sung by the Papists, who, after all, care nothing about Christ, until,
   armed with vengeance, he ascends his tribunal. We are also reminded,
   that so long as Christ exhibits himself to us in the name of the Father
   as the herald of salvation and Mediator, we ought not only to honor him
   with our lips, but sincerely to wish that he would make us and the
   whole world subject to himself.

   Luke 11:53. And while he was saying these things to them. I have
   formerly mentioned that the preceding sentences were not inserted by
   Luke in their proper place. For while he was relating that Christ at a
   dinner reproved the scribes, he introduced also the latest discourses
   by which, a little before his death, he reproved their wicked courses;
   and in like manner, the reproof which we have just now examined is
   inserted by Luke, in connection with a different narrative. If any one
   prefer to follow the opinion of those who conjecture that Christ
   repeated the same discourses on various occasions, I have no great
   objection. After pronouncing the curses which have been now explained,
   he concludes by saying that all the scribes became more inveterate
   against Christ, so that they did not cease to entrap him by ensnaring
   questions; which ought to be referred to the conversation held at the
   table, rather than to his latest discourse. But I have not thought it a
   matter of great importance to be very exact about the time -- a matter
   which the Evangelist has disregarded.

   MARK 12:41-44; LUKE 21:1-4

   Mark 12:41-44

   Luke 21:1-4

   41. And while Jesus was sitting opposite to the treasury, he perceived
   how the multitude threw money into the treasury, and many rich persons
   put in much. 42. And a poor widow came, and threw in two mites, which
   make a farthing. 43. And having called his disciples to him, he said,
   Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath thrown in more than all
   who have thrown into the treasury: 44. For they all have thrown in out
   of their abundance; but she out of her poverty hath thrown in all that
   she had, all her living. [120]

   1. And, lifting up his eyes, he saw those rich men who were throwing
   their gifts into the treasury. 2. And he saw also a certain poor widow
   throwing into it two mites. 3. And he said, Verily I say to you, that
   this poor widow hath thrown in more than all: 4. For all these, out of
   their abundance, have thrown into the offering of God; but she out of
   her poverty hath thrown in all the living which she had. [121]


   Mark 12:43. Verily I say to you. This reply of Christ contains a highly
   useful doctrine that whatever men offer to God ought to be estimated
   not by its apparent value, [122] but only by the feeling of the heart,
   and that the holy affection of him who according to his small means,
   offers to God the little that he has, is more worthy of esteem than
   that of him who offers a hundred times more out of his abundance. In
   two ways this doctrine is useful, for the poor who appear not to have
   the power of doing good, are encouraged by our Lord not to hesitate to
   express their affection cheerfully out of their slender means; for if
   they consecrate themselves, their offering, which appears to be mean
   and worthless, will not be less valuable than if they had presented all
   the treasures of Croesus. [123] On the other hand, those who possess
   greater abundance, and who have received from God larger
   communications, are reminded that it is not enough if in the amount of
   their beneficence they greatly surpass the poor and common people;
   because it is of less value in the sight of God that a rich man, out of
   a vast heap, should bestow a moderate sum, than that a poor man, by
   giving very little, should exhaust his store. This widow must have been
   a person of no ordinary piety, who, rather than come empty into the
   presence of God, chose to part with her own living. And our Lord
   applauds this sincerity, because, forgetting herself, she wished to
   testify that she and all that she possessed belonged to God. In like
   manner, the chief sacrifice which God requires from us is self-denial.
   As to the sacred offerings, it is probable that they were not at that
   time applied properly, or to lawful purposes; but as the service of the
   Law was still in force, Christ does not reject them. And certainly the
   abuses of men could not prevent the sincere worshippers of God from
   doing what was holy, and in accordance with the command of God, when
   they offered for sacrifices and other pious uses.

   MATTHEW 24:1-8; MARK 13:1-8; LUKE 21:5-11

   Matthew 24:1-8

   Mark 13:1-8

   Luke 21:5-11

   1. And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple, and his disciples
   came to him, to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2. And
   Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? Verily I say to
   you, There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be
   thrown down. 3. And while he was sitting on the mountain of Olives, the
   disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these
   things be? and what is the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the
   world? 4. And Jesus answering said to them, Take heed that no man
   deceive you. 5. For many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and
   will deceive many. 6. For you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see
   that you be not troubled; for all these things must happen, but the end
   is not yet. 7. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
   kingdom, and there will be pestilences, and famines, and earthquakes in
   various places. 8. But all these things are the beginnings of sorrows.

   1. And while he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith
   to him, Master, see what stones and what buildings! 2. And Jesus
   answering saith to him, Seest thou these vast, buildings? There shall
   not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.
   3. And while he was sitting on the mountain of Olives, opposite to the
   temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, asked him privately,
   4. Tell us, when will these things be, and what is the sign when all
   these things shall be accomplished? 5. And Jesus answering began to say
   to them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 6. For many will come in my
   name, saying, I am Christ, and will deceive many. 7. And when you shall
   hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled; for these things must
   be, but the end is not yet. 8. For nation will rise against nation, and
   kingdom against kingdom; and there will be earthquakes in various
   places. These things are the beginnings of sorrows.

   5. And while some were saying concerning the temple, that it was
   adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said, 6. The days will
   come, when of those things which you see there shall not be left one
   stone upon another which shall not be thrown down. 7. And they asked
   him, saying, Master, when shall these things be? and what is the sign
   when those things shall begin to take place? 8. And he said, Take heed
   that you be not deceived; for many will come in my name, saying, It is
   I; and the time approaches: do not therefore follow them. 9. But when
   you shall hear of wars and seditions, be not terrified: for these
   things must first take place; but the end is not immediately. [124]
   10. Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom
   against kingdom; 11. And there will be great earthquakes in various
   places, and famines, and pestilences; and there will be frightful
   appearances and great signs from heaven.


   Matthew 24:1. And Jesus went out. The disciples undoubtedly perceived
   that Christ was paying, as it were, his last adieu to the temple. It
   remained, therefor that he should erect a new temple far more
   magnificent, and that he should produce a more flourishing condition of
   the kingdom, as had been foretold by the Prophets; for he had nothing
   to do with that temple, in which every thing was opposed to him. But
   again, the disciples could not believe that the magnificent splendor of
   the temple would give way to Christ. And it ought to be carefully
   observed that, owing to the prodigious costliness of the temple, their
   eyes were so dazzled by the splendor of its present aspect, that they
   could scarcely entertain the hope that the kingdom of Christ would
   arise. They do not, indeed, in express terms acknowledge their
   hesitation, but they tacitly throw out a suggestion of it, when they
   allege, in opposition to Christ, the mass of stones which must be got
   out of the way, and which must indeed be utterly laid low if he
   intended to reign. Many simple persons of our own day are carried away
   by a similar admiration of Popery; for, perceiving it to be supported
   by very great wealth and by immense power, they are filled with
   absolute amazement, so as to despise a Church of mean and slovenly
   aspect. Many even think that we are mad in laboring to effect its
   destruction, as if this were nothing less than an attempt to draw down
   the sun out of heaven. And yet, there is no reason to wonder that a
   spectacle so imposing held the disciples of Christ in astonishment; for
   how great expense that building cost Herod, may be concluded from the
   single fact, that he kept ten thousand workmen employed on it for eight
   successive years. Nor is it without reason that they admire the stones
   which, Josephus tells us, were superlatively beautiful, and were
   fifteen [125] cubits in length, twelve in height, and eight in breadth.
   Besides, so great was the reverence entertained for the temple even in
   remote districts, that scarcely any person would venture to suppose
   that it could ever be destroyed.

   2. Verily I say to you. As the vast size and wealth of the temple, like
   a veil hung before the eyes of the disciples, did not permit them to
   elevate their faith to the true reign of Christ, which was still
   future, so he affirms with an oath, that those things which occupy
   their attention will quickly perish. This prediction of the destruction
   of the temple, therefore, opened up a path for the ignorant and weak.
   [126] Now, though it was advantageous that the temple should be
   destroyed, lest its services and shadows might exercise an undue
   influence on the Jews, who were already too much attached to earthly
   elements, yet the chief reason was, that God determined, by this
   dreadful example, to take vengeance on that nation, for having rejected
   his Son, and despised the grace which was brought by him. And,
   therefore, this threatening must have intimidated the disciples from
   taking part with a rebellious people; as the punishments which
   Scripture denounces against the wicked ought now to deter us from those
   crimes which provoke the wrath of God. Every thing that it tells us,
   even about the fading and transitory aspect of the world, ought to
   correct the vanity of our senses, which too eagerly follow pomp, and
   luxury, and pleasure. But more especially, what it declares respecting
   the fearful destruction of Antichrist and his followers, ought to
   remove every obstacle which hinders us from pursuing the right course
   of faith.

   3. And while he was sitting. Mark mentions four disciples, Peter,
   James, John, and Andrew But neither he nor Luke states the matter so
   fully as Matthew; for they only say that the disciples inquired about
   the time of the destruction of the temple, and -- as it was a thing
   difficult to be believed -- what outward sign of it God would give from
   heaven. Matthew tells us that they inquired about the time of Christ's
   coming, and of the end of the world. But it must be observed that,
   having believed from their infancy that the temple would stand till the
   end of time, and having this opinion deeply rooted in their minds, they
   did not suppose that, while the building of the world stood, the temple
   could fall to ruins. Accordingly, as soon as Christ said that the
   temple would be destroyed, their thoughts immediately turned to the end
   of the world; and--as one error leads to another--having been convinced
   that, as soon as the reign of Christ should commence, they would be in
   every respect happy, they leave warfare out of the account, and fly all
   at once to a triumph. They associate the coming of Christ and the end
   of the world as things inseparable from each other; and by the end of
   the world they mean the restoration of all things, so that nothing may
   be wanting to complete the happiness of the godly.

   We now perceive that they leap at once to various questions, because
   they had given way to these foolish imaginations, that the temple could
   not fall without shaking the whole world; that the termination of the
   shadows of the Law, and of the whole world, would be the same; that it
   would be immediately followed by the exhibition of the glory of
   Christ's kingdom, which would make the children of God perfectly happy;
   that a visible renovation of the world was at hand, which would
   instantly bring order out of a state of confusion. But above all, a
   foolish hope which they entertained, as to the immediate reign of
   Christ, drove them to hasten to the attainment of happiness and rest,
   without attending to the means. Just as, when they see that Christ is
   risen from the dead, (Acts 1:6,) they rush forward to grasp at that
   happiness, which is laid up for us in heaven, and which must be
   attained through faith and patience.

   Now though our condition is different, because we have not been
   educated among the shadows of the Law, so as to be infatuated by that
   superstition of an earthly kingdom of Christ, yet scarcely one person
   in a hundred is to be found who does not labor under a very similar
   disease. For since all men naturally shrink from annoyances, combats,
   and every kind of cross, the dislike of these things urges them,
   without moderation and without hope, to rush forward unseasonably to
   the fruit of hope. Thus no man wishes to sow the seed, but all wish to
   reap the harvest before the season arrives. To return to the disciples,
   they had indeed formed in their minds some good seed of faith, but they
   do not wait till it arrive at maturity; and holding, at the same time,
   erroneous views, they confound the perfection of Christ's reign with
   the commencement of it, and wish to enjoy on earth what they ought to
   seek for in heaven.

   4. And Jesus answering said to them. They received an answer very
   different from what they had expected; for whereas they were eager for
   a triumph, as if they had already finished their warfare, Christ
   exhorts them to long patience. As if he had said, "You wish to seize
   the prize at the very outset, but you must first finish the course. You
   would draw down to earth the kingdom of God, which no man can obtain
   till he ascend to heaven." Now while this chapter contains admonitions
   highly useful for regulating the course of our life, we see that, by a
   wonderful purpose of God, the mistake into which the apostles fell is
   made to turn to our advantage. The amount of the present instruction
   is, that the preaching of the Gospel is like sowing the seed, and
   therefore we ought to wait patiently for the time of reaping; and that
   it arises from improper delicacy or effeminacy, if we lose courage on
   account of the frost, or snow, or clouds of winter or other unpleasant
   seasons.

   Take heed lest any man deceive you. There are two charges which Christ
   expressly gives to the disciples, to beware of false teachers, and not
   to be terrified by scandals. By these words he gives warning that his
   Church, so long as its pilgrimage in the world shall last, will be
   exposed to these evils. But they might be apt to think that this was
   inconsistent, since the prophets gave a widely different description of
   the future reign of Christ. Isaiah predicts that all will then be
   taught of God, (54:13.) The words of God are:

   I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;
   and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy;
   your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams,
   (Joel 2:28.)

   A still more abundant light of understanding is promised by Jeremiah.

   No longer shall any man teach his neighbor, nor a man his brother,
   saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the
   greatest, (Jeremiah 31:34.)

   And, therefore, we need not wonder if the Jews expected, that when the
   Sun of righteousness had arisen, as Malachi (4:2) had predicted, they
   would be entirely free from every cloud of error. Hence, also, the
   woman of Samaria said,

   When the Messiah cometh, he will teach us all things,
   (John 4:25.)

   Now we know what splendid promises of peace, righteousness, joy, and
   abundance of all blessings, are to be found everywhere in Scripture. We
   need not, therefore, wonder if they expected that, at the coming of
   Christ, they would be delivered from commotions of war, from extortions
   and every kind of injustice, and, in short, from famine and pestilence.

   But Christ warns them, that false teachers will henceforth give no less
   annoyance to the godly than false prophets gave to the ancient people;
   and that disturbances will be not less frequent under the Gospel than
   they formerly were under the Law. Not that those prophecies which I
   have just mentioned will fail to be accomplished, but because the full
   accomplishment of them does not immediately appear in one day; for it
   is enough that believers now obtain a taste of those blessings, so as
   to cherish the hope of the full enjoyment of them at a future period.
   And, therefore, they were greatly mistaken, who wished to hay at the
   commencement of the Gospel, an immediate and perfect exhibition of
   those things which we see accomplished from day to day. Besides, that
   happiness which the prophets ascribe to the reign of Christ, though it
   cannot be altogether annihilated by the depravity of man, is retarded
   or delayed by it. It is true that the Lord, in contending with the
   malice of men, opens up a way for his blessings through every obstacle;
   and, indeed, it would be unreasonable to suppose that what is founded
   on the undeserved goodness of God, and does not depend on the will of
   man, should be set aside through their fault.

   Yet, that they may receive some punishment for their ingratitude he
   drops upon them in small measure his favors, which would otherwise flow
   on them in the richest abundance. Hence arises a labyrinth of evils,
   through which believers wander all their life, though they are pursuing
   the straight road to salvation, having Christ for their guide, who
   holds out to them the torch of his Gospel. Hence arises a multitude of
   combats, so that they have a hard warfare, though there is no danger of
   their being vanquished. Hence arise disturbances so numerous and so
   sudden, that they are kept in perpetual uneasiness, though, resting on
   Christ, they remain firm to the end. And since Christ enjoins his
   disciples to beware of impostures, let us know that the means of
   defense will not be wanting, provided that they are not wanting to
   themselves. [127] And therefore, whatever arts Satan may employ, let us
   entertain no doubt that we shall be safe from them, if every one of us
   keep diligent watch on his own station.

   5. For many shall come in my name. He does not as yet speak generally
   of false and perverse doctrines, but refers to one class which was sort
   of introduction to all errors, by which Satan has attempted, in various
   ways, to corrupt the pure doctrine of the Gospel. For shortly after
   Christ's resurrection, there arose impostors, every one of whom
   professed to be the Christ. And as the true Redeemer had not only been
   removed from the world, but oppressed by the ignominy of the cross, and
   yet the minds of all were excited by the hope and inflamed with the
   desire of redemption, those men had in their power a plausible
   opportunity of deceiving. Nor can it be doubted, that God permitted
   such reveries to impose on the Jews, who had so basely rejected his
   Son. Though those mad attempts speedily disappeared, yet God determined
   that disturbances of this kind should arise among the Jews; first, that
   they might be exposed to infamy and hatred; secondly, that they might
   altogether abandon the hope of salvation; and, lastly, that having been
   so frequently disappointed, they might rush to their destruction with
   brutal stupidity. For when the world turned away from the Son of God,
   to whom it belonged to collect them into holy union, it was right that
   it should be driven hither and thither by tempests; and by the same
   vengeance of God it was brought about, that more were carried away by a
   foolish credulity, than were brought by a right faith to obey God. This
   circumstance, too, was expressly stated by Christ, that believers might
   not faint at perceiving the crowd of madmen; for we know how prone we
   are to follow a multitude, especially when we are few in number.

   6 For you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. He describes here those
   commotions only which arose in Judea, for we shall find him soon
   afterwards saying that the flame will spread much wider. As he had
   formerly enjoined them to beware lest any man deceived them, so now he
   bids them meet with courage rumors of wars and wars themselves; for
   they would be in danger of giving way when surrounded by calamities,
   especially if they had promised to themselves ease and pleasure.

   For all these things must take place. He adds this, not for the purpose
   of assigning a reason, but of warning them that none of these things
   happened accidentally, or without the providence of God, that they may
   not uselessly kick against the spur; for nothing has a more powerful
   efficacy to bring us into subjection, than when we acknowledge that
   those things which appear to be confused are regulated by the good
   pleasure of God. True, indeed, God himself never wants proper causes
   and the best reasons for allowing the world to be disturbed; but as
   believers ought to acquiesce in his mere good pleasure, Christ reckoned
   it enough to exhort the disciples to prepare their minds for endurance,
   and to remain firm, because such is the will of God.

   But the end is not yet. He now states in plainer terms the threatening
   which I have already mentioned, that those events which were in
   themselves truly distressing would be only a sort of preparation for
   greater calamities; because, when the flame of war has been kindled in
   Judea, it will spread more widely; for ever since the doctrine of the
   Gospel was published, a similar ingratitude prevailing among other
   nations has aroused the wrath of God against them. Hence it happened
   that, having broken the bond of peace with God, they tore themselves by
   mutual contentions; having refused to obey the government of God, they
   yielded to the violence of their enemies; not having permitted
   themselves to be reconciled to God, they broke out into quarrels with
   one another; in short, having shut themselves out from the heavenly
   salvation, they raged against each other, and filled the earth with
   murders. Knowing how obstinate the malice of the world would be, he
   again adds,

   8. But all these things are the beginnings of sorrows. Not that
   believers, who always have abundant consolations in calamities, should
   consume themselves with grief, but that they should lay their account
   with a long exercise of patience. Luke adds likewise earthquakes, and
   signs from heaven, with respect to which, though we have no authentic
   history of them, yet it is enough that they were predicted by Christ.
   The reader will find the rest in Josephus, (Wars of the Jews, VI. 5:3.)

   Mark 13:9-13

   Luke 21:12-19

   9. Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted, and will kill you;
   and you will be hated by all nations on account of my name. 10. And
   then will many be offended, and will deliver up one another, and will
   hate one another. 11. And many false prophets will arise, and will
   deceive many. 12. And because iniquity will abound, the love of many
   will be cooled. 13. But he who shall persevere to the end will be
   saved. 14. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout
   the whole world for a testimony to all nations; and then the end will
   come.

   9. But take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to
   councils and synagogues; you will be scourged and will be brought
   before rulers and kings on my account, for a testimony to them. 10. And
   the gospel must first be preached among all nations. 11. And when they
   shall lead you away to deliver you up, do not think beforehand what you
   shall say, nor premeditate, but whatever shall be given to you at that
   hour, speak; for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost. 12. And
   the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the
   son; and the children will rise up against their parents and will cause
   them to be put to death. 13. And you will be hated by all men on
   account of my name. But he that still endures to the end will be saved.

   12. But before all these things they will lay hands upon you, and will
   persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, and
   dragging you before kings and rulers on account of my name. 13. But it
   will happen [128] to you for a testimony. 14. Settle it therefore in
   your hearts, that you must not premeditate your defense. [129] 15. For
   will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all who oppose you will not be
   a le to contradict or oppose. 16. And you will also be delivered up by
   parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and some of you they
   will put to death. 17. And you will be hated by all on account of my
   name. 18. And not a hair of your head will be lost. 19. In patience
   possess your souls. [130]


   Matthew 24:9. Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted. Christ now
   foretells to the disciples another kind of temptation, by which, in
   addition to ordinary afflictions, their faith must be tried; and that
   is, that they will be hated and detested by the whole world. It is
   painful and distressing enough in itself that the children of God
   should be afflicted in such a manner as not to be distinguished from
   the reprobate and the despisers of God, and should be subjected to the
   same punishments which those men endure on account of their crimes; and
   it appears to be still more unjust that they should be severely
   oppressed by grievous calamities from which the ungodly are exempted.
   But as wheat, after having been beaten by the flail along with the
   chaff, is pressed down and bruised by the millstone, so God not only
   afflicts his children in common with the ungodly, but subdues them by
   the cross even beyond others, so that we might be apt to think them
   more unhappy than the rest of mankind.

   But Christ treats here strictly of the afflictions which the disciples
   had to endure on account of the gospel. For, though what Paul stays is
   true, that those whom God hath elected are likewise appointed by him to
   bear the cross,

   that they may be conformed to the image of his Son,
   (Romans 8:29,)

   yet he does not distinguish all by this special Mark of enduring
   persecution from the enemies of the gospel. It is of this species of
   the cross that Christ now speaks, when it becomes necessary that
   believers should incur the hatred, meet the reproaches, and provoke the
   fury, of the ungodly for the testimony of the gospel. For he intended
   to warn his disciples that the doctrine of the gospel, of which they
   were to be witnesses and messengers, would never be pleasant or
   agreeable to the world, as he had formerly explained to them. He
   foretells not only that they will have to contend with a few enemies,
   but that, wherever they come, all nations will oppose them.

   But it was monstrous and incredible, and was fitted to astonish and
   shake even the strongest minds, that the name of the Son of God should
   be so infamous and hateful, that all who professed it would be
   everywhere disliked. Accordingly, the words of Mark are, take heed to
   yourselves. By this expression he points out the end and use of the
   warning, which is, that they ought to be prepared for endurance, lest,
   through want of caution, they might be overwhelmed by temptation. The
   same Mark adds, that this will be for a testimony to kings and rulers,
   when the disciples of Christ shall be brought before their tribunal.
   Luke expresses it a little differently, this will happen to you for a
   testimony, but the sense is quite the same; for Christ means that his
   gospel will be so much the more fully attested, when they have defended
   it at the risk of their lives.

   If the apostles had only given their attention to preaching the gospel,
   and had not stood so firmly in defending it against the furious attacks
   of enemies, the confirmation of it would not have been so complete. But
   when they did not hesitate to expose their lives, and were not driven
   from their purpose by any terrors of death, their unshaken constancy
   made it manifest, how firmly they were convinced of the goodness of
   their cause. It was therefore an authentic seal of the gospel, when the
   apostles advanced without terror to the tribunals of kings, and there
   made an open profession of the name of Christ. Accordingly, Peter calls
   himself

   a witness of the sufferings of Christ, (1 Peter 5:1,)

   whose badges he wore; and Paul boasts that he was

   placed for the defense of the gospel, (Philippians 1:17.)

   This is eminently worthy of attention, that those on whom God bestows
   so great an honor as to make them defenders of his truth, may not
   through base treachery fall from the faith.

   Mark 13:11. Neither premeditate. This sentence, as well as the one
   which immediately follows, we have explained [131] under Matthew 10:19
   Our Lord's design in these words is, to relieve the disciples from that
   anxiety which interferes with the cheerful discharge of our duty, when
   we doubt our inability to sustain the burden. Not that he wishes us to
   fall asleep in indolent security, for nothing is more advantageous than
   to have such a consciousness of our weakness as produces humility and
   excites to prayer. But Christ advises us to cast all our cares into the
   bosom of our Father, so that, relying on his promised aid, we may
   pursue our course with cheerfulness. The promise is stated in different
   words by Luke; not that Christ will deliver his people from death, (for
   this must not always be expected,) but that he will give them a mouth
   and wisdom, to confound their adversaries. Now though Christ supplies
   them both with presence of mind and with ability to speak, yet I look
   upon these two words as connected by that figure of speech which is
   called hypallage; as if Christ had promised that he would guide their
   tongues, so as to enable them to make a wise and suitable reply.

   He adds, that this wisdom will be victorious against all their enemies,
   because they will not be able to contradict, or to oppose it. Not that
   their impudence will yield the palm to truth, but because that truth,
   which they in vain strive to oppose, will triumph over their mad
   presumption. Would that all who are called upon to make a confession of
   their faith would rely on that assurance; for the power and majesty of
   the Spirit would be displayed in a different manner for overthrowing
   the ministers of Satan. Now that we are partly carried away by our own
   feelings, and, swelled with pride, rush on heedlessly, or advance
   farther than is proper, and partly confine ourselves within the limits
   of improper timidity, sad experience shows that we are deprived of the
   grace of God and the assistance of the Spirit. As Christ affirms,
   according to Matthew and Mark, that it is the Spirit of the Father that
   speaketh in us, (Matthew 10:10; Mark 13:11,) and here declares that he
   will give a mouth, we infer that it is His prerogative to fortify us by
   the Spirit.

   Luke 21:19. In your patience. Here Christ enjoins on his followers a
   different method of defending their life from what is dictated by
   carnal reason. For naturally every man desires to place his life in
   safety; we collect from every quarter those aids which we think will be
   best, and avoid all danger; and, in short, we do not think that we are
   alive, if we are not properly defended. But Christ prescribes to us
   this defense of our life, that we should be always exposed to death,
   and walk

   through fire, and water, and sword, (Psalm 66:12.)

   And, indeed, no man will commit his soul into the hands of God in a
   right manner, unless he have learned to live from day to day constantly
   prepared to die. [132] In a word, Christ orders us to possess our life
   both under the cross, and amidst the constant terrors of death.

   Matthew 24:10. Then will many be offended. He now enumerates the
   temptations which will arise from bad examples. Now this is an
   exceedingly violent temptation, and difficult to overcome; for Christ
   is to many a stone of offense, (1 Peter 2:8,) on which some dash
   themselves, or by meeting which some are thrown back, and others fall
   away. In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of
   troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course
   fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful
   of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane,
   and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which
   prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes.

   11. And many false prophets will arise. This warning differs from the
   former, in which Christ foretold that many would come in his name. For
   there he spoke only of impostors, who, shortly after the commencement
   of the Gospel, gave out that they were the Christ; but now he threatens
   that in all ages false teachers will arise, to corrupt sound doctrine,
   as Peter tells us (2 Peter 2:1) that the Church will be no less exposed
   to this evil under the Gospel than it anciently was under the Law.
   There is therefore no reason why error, and certain impostures of the
   devil and corruptions of piety, should strike pious minds with dismay;
   since no man is properly founded on Christ, who has not learned that we
   must stand firm against such attacks; for this is the undoubted trial
   of our faith, when it is in no degree shaken by the false doctrines
   which arise, or does he only say that false prophets will come, but
   likewise that they will be so crafty as to deceive and draw away sects
   after them. [133] No ordinary caution is necessary here; for the
   multitude of those who are going astray is like a violent tempest,
   which compels us to leave the course, if we are not firmly fixed on
   God. On this subject something was said but lately.

   12 Because iniquity will abound. How far and wide this evil extends
   every person ought to know, but there are very few who observe it. For
   in consequence of the superior clearness with which the light of the
   gospel discovers the malice of men, even good and properly regulated
   minds grow cool, and almost lose the desire to exercise benevolence.
   Each of them reasons thus with himself, that the duties which they
   perform to one person, or to another, are thrown away, because
   experience and daily practice show that almost all are ungrateful, or
   treacherous, or wicked. This is unquestionably a weighty and dangerous
   temptation; for what could be more unreasonable than to approve of a
   doctrine, by which the desire of doing good, and the rigor of charity,
   appear to be diminished? And yet when the gospel makes its appearance,
   charity, which ought to kindle the hearts of all men with its warmth,
   rather grows cool. But we must observe the source of this evil, which
   Christ points out, namely, that many lose courage, because through
   their weakness they are unable to stem the flood of iniquity which
   flows on every hand. Christ requires from his followers, on the other
   hand, such courage as to persist in striving against it; as Paul also
   enjoins us not to be weary of performing deeds of kindness and
   beneficence, (2 Thessalonians 3:13.) Although, then, the charity of
   many, overwhelmed by the mass of iniquities, should give way, Christ
   warns believers that they must surmount this obstacle, lest, overcome
   by bad examples, they apostatize. And therefore he repeats the
   statement, that no man can be saved, unless he strive lawfully, (2
   Timothy 2:5,) so as to persevere to the end

   14. And the gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole
   world. Our Lord, having delivered a discourse which gave no small
   occasion for sorrow, seasonably adds this consolation, to raise up
   minds that were cast down, or to uphold those which were falling.
   Whatever may be the contrivances of Satan, and how numerous soever may
   be the multitudes which he carries away, yet the gospel will maintain
   its ground till it be spread through the whole world. This might indeed
   appear to be incredible; but it was the duty of the apostles, relying
   on this testimony of their Master, to cherish hope against hope, and,
   in the meantime, to strive vigorously to discharge their office. As to
   the objection brought by some, that to this day not even the slightest
   report concerning Christ has reached the Antipodes and other very
   distant nations, this difficulty may be speedily resolved; for Christ
   does not absolutely refer to every portion of the world, and does not
   fix a particular time, but only affirms that the gospel--which, all
   would have thought, was immediately to be banished from Judea, its
   native habitation would be spread to the farthest bounds of the world
   before the day of his last coming.

   For a testimony to all nations. He describes this to be the end of
   preaching; for although

   God has never left himself (amarturon) without witness,
   (Acts 14:17,)

   and although in special manner he testified to the Jews concerning
   himself, yet it was a testimony remarkable beyond all others when he
   revealed himself in Christ; and therefore Paul says, that he was
   manifested in due time, (1 Timothy 2:6,) because this was the proper
   season for calling the whole world to God. Let us, therefore, learn
   that, wherever the gospel is preached, it is as if God himself came
   into the midst of us, and solemnly and expressly besought us, that we
   may not wander in darkness, as if we knew not where to go, and that
   those who refuse to obey may be rendered inexcusable.

   And then will the end come. This is improperly restricted by some to
   the destruction of the temple, and the abolition of the service of the
   Law; for it ought to be understood as referring to the end and
   renovation of the world. Those two things having been blended by the
   disciples, as if the temple could not be overthrown without the
   destruction of the whole world, Christ, in replying to the whole
   question which had been put to him, reminded them that a long and
   melancholy succession of calamities was at hand, and that they must not
   hasten to seize the prize, before they had passed through many contests
   and dangers. In this manner, therefore, we ought to explain this latter
   clause: "The end of the world will not come before I have tried my
   Church, for a long period, by severe and painful temptations," for it
   is contrasted with the false imagination which the apostles had formed
   in their minds. Hence, too, we ought to learn that no particular time
   is here fixed, as if the last day were to follow in immediate
   succession those events which were just now foretold; for the believers
   long ago experienced the fulfillment of those predictions which we have
   now examined, and yet Christ did not immediately appear. But Christ had
   no other design than to restrain the apostles, who were disposed to fly
   with excessive eagerness to the possession of the heavenly glory, and
   to show them the necessity of patience; as if he had said, that
   redemption was not so close at hand as they had imagined it to be, but
   that they must pass through long windings.

   Luke 21:20-24

   15. When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation, which
   is described by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let
   him that readeth understand,) 16. Then let them who are in Judea flee
   to the mountains. 17. Let not him who is on the housetop go down to
   carry anything out of his house; 18. And let not him who is in the
   field return to carry away his clothes. 19. But woe to the women with
   child, and to them that give suck in those days. 20. And pray that your
   flight may not be in the winter, nor on the sabbath. [134] 21. For
   there will then be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the
   beginning of the world till this time, nor will be. 22. And unless
   those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved, but on
   account of the elect those days shall be shortened. 23. If anyone shall
   then say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, do not believe it.
   24. For false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall perform
   great signs and wonders, so that even the elect (if it were possible)
   will be led into error. 25. Lo, I have foretold it to you. 26. If then
   they shall say to you, Lo, he is in the desert, go not out; lo, he is
   in the secret chamber, do not believe it. 27. For as the lightning
   goeth out of the east, and shineth even to the west, so shall also be
   the coming of the Son of man. 28. For wherever the carcass is, there
   will the eagles also be gathered together.

   14. But when you shall see the abomination of desolation, which is
   described by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him
   that readeth understand,) then let them that are in Judea flee to the
   mountains; 15. And let not him who is on the housetop go down into the
   house, or enter into it, to carry away anything out of his house.
   16. And let not him that is in the field return back to bring away his
   cloak. 17. But woe to the women with child, and to them that give suck
   in those days. 18. But pray that your flight may not be in the winter.
   19. For in those days there shall be tribulation, such as hath not been
   from the beginning of the creation which God created till this time,
   nor will be. 20. And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh
   would have been saved, but on account of the elect whom he hath chosen,
   he hath shortened the days. 21. And if anyone shall then say to you,
   Lo, here is Christ, or, lo, there, do not believe it. 22. For false
   Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall perform signs and
   wonders to deceive (if it were possible) even the elect. 23. But take
   heed; lo, I have foretold to you all things.

   20. And when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know
   that its desolation is at hand. 21. Then let them who are in Judea flee
   to the mountains; and let them who are in the midst of it withdraw; and
   let not those who are in the fields enter into it. 22. For these are
   days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
   23. But woe to women with child, and to them that give suck in those
   days; for there shall be great tribulation on the earth, and wrath on
   this people. 24. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and
   shall be led captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden
   down by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.


   Luke 17:22-25

   22. And he said to the disciples, The days will come when you shall
   desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.
   23. And they will say to you, Lo, he is here, or, lo, he is here; do
   not go, nor follow them. [135] 24. For as the lightning, flashing from
   one side which is under heaven, shineth to the other side which is
   under heaven, so shall be also the Son of man in his day. 25. But he
   must first suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.


   Matthew 24:15. When you shall see the abomination of desolation.
   Because the destruction of the temple and city of Jerusalem, together
   with the overthrow of the whole Jewish government, was (as we have
   already said) a thing incredible, and because it might be thought
   strange, that the disciples could not be saved without being torn from
   that nation, to which had been committed the adoption and the covenant
   (Romans 9:4) of eternal salvation, Christ confirms both by the
   testimony of Daniel As if he had said, That you may not be too strongly
   attached to the temple and to the ceremonies of the Law, God has
   limited them to a fixed time, [136] and has long ago declared, that
   when the Redeemer should come, sacrifices would cease; and that it may
   not give you uneasiness to be cut off from your own nation, God has
   also forewarned his people, that in due time it would be rejected. Such
   a prediction was not only well adapted for removing ground of offense,
   but likewise for animating the minds of the godly, that amidst the
   sorest calamities--knowing that God was looking upon them, and was
   taking care of their salvation--they might betake themselves to the
   sacred anchor, where, amidst the most dreadful heavings of the billows,
   their condition would be firm and secure.

   But before I proceed farther, I must examine the passage which is
   quoted by Christ. Those commentators are, I think, mistaken, who think
   that this quotation is made from the ninth chapter of the Book of
   Daniel [137] For there we do not literally find the words, abomination,
   of desolation; and it is certain that the angel does not there speak of
   the final destruction which Christ now mentions, but of the temporary
   dispersion which was brought about by the tyranny of Antiochus. [138]
   But in the twelfth chapter the angel predicts what is called the final
   abrogation of the services of the Law, [139] which was to take place at
   the coming of Christ. For, after having exhorted believers to unshaken
   constancy, he fixes absolutely the time both of the ruin and of the
   restoration. [140]

   From the time, says he, that the daily sacrifices shall be taken away,
   and the abomination of desolation set up, there will be a thousand two
   hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he who shall wait till he come to
   the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days, (Daniel 12:11, 12.)

   I am aware that this passage is tortured in a variety of ways on
   account of its obscurity; but I consider the natural meaning of it to
   be, that the angel declares that, after the temple has been once
   purified from the pollutions and idols of Antiochus, another period
   will arrive when it will be exposed to a new profanation, and when all
   its sacredness and majesty will be for ever lost. [141] And as that
   message was sad and melancholy, he again recalls the prophet to one
   year, and two years, and six months. These words denote both the
   duration and the close of the calamities; for, in an interrupted
   succession of calamities, the course of one year appears to us very
   long, but when that space of time is doubled, the distress is greatly
   increased. The Spirit therefore exhorts believers to prepare themselves
   for the exercise of patience, not only for a single year, that is, for
   a long period, but to lay their account with enduring tribulations
   through an uninterrupted succession of many ages. There is no small
   consolation also in the phrase, half a time, (Daniel 12:7) for though
   the tribulations be of long continuance, yet the Spirit shows that they
   will not be perpetual. And, indeed, he had formerly used this form of
   expression: The calamity of the Church shall last through a time,
   times, and half a time, (Daniel 7:25.) But now he reckons the period of
   three years and six months by days, that believers may be more and more
   hardened by a very long continuance of calamities; for it is customary
   with men in adversity to compute time, not by years or months, but by
   days, a single day being, in their estimation, equal to a year [142] He
   says that those will be happy who bear up to the end of that period;
   that is, who with invincible patience persevere to the end.

   Now Christ selects only what suited his purpose, namely, that the
   termination of sacrifices was at hand, and that the abomination, which
   was the sign of the final desolation, would be placed in the temple.
   But as the Jews were too strongly attached to their present condition,
   and therefore paid little attention to the prophecies which foretold
   the abolition of it, Christ, as if endeavoring to gain their ear, bids
   them read attentively that passage, where they would learn that what
   appeared to them difficult to be believed was plainly declared by the
   Prophets. [143] Abomination means profanation; for this word denotes
   uncleanness, [144] which corrupts or overturns the pure worship of God.
   It is called desolation, because it drew along with it the destruction
   of the temple and of the government; as he had formerly said, (Daniel
   9:27,) that the pollution introduced by Antiochus was, as it were, the
   standard of temporary desolation; for such I conceive to be the meaning
   of the wing, or, "spreading out." [145] It is a mistake to suppose that
   this expression denotes the siege of Jerusalem, and the mistake
   receives no countenance from the words of Luke, who did not intend to
   say the same thing, but something quite different. For that city having
   been formerly delivered, when it appeared to be in the midst of
   destruction, lest believers should expect something of the same kind in
   future, Christ declares that, as soon as it would be surrounded by
   armies, it was utterly ruined, because it was wholly deprived of divine
   assistance. The meaning therefore is, that the issue of the war will
   not be doubtful, because that city is devoted to destruction, which it
   will not be able to escape any more than to rescind a decree of heaven.
   Accordingly, Luke shortly afterwards adds, that Jerusalem will be
   trodden down by the Gentiles, a mode of expression which denotes utter
   ruin. But as it might appear to be strange that the holy city should be
   thus given up to the Gentiles, to do with it as they pleased, he adds a
   consolation, [146] that it was only for a time that so much liberty was
   allowed to the Gentiles, till their iniquity was ripe, and the
   vengeance which had been reserved for them was fully displayed.

   16. Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Having shown
   by the testimony of the prophet that, when the temple had been
   profaned, the services of the Law would soon afterwards be abolished,
   he adds, that fearful and appalling calamities will soon overtake the
   whole of Judea, so that there will be nothing more desirable than to
   withdraw a distance from it; and, at the same time, he states that they
   will be so sudden, that time will scarcely be time allowed for the most
   rapid flight. For such is the import of the expressions, Let not him
   who is on the house-top enter into the house; let not him who is in the
   field turn back; that is, lest, by attempting to save their property,
   they themselves perish. Again, Woe to the women with child, and to them
   that give suck; for they will not be in a fit condition for flight.
   Again, Pray that your fight may not be in the winter; that is, that
   neither a regard to the sacredness of the day, nor the roughness of the
   roads, nor the shortness of the clays, may prevent or retard your
   flight. The design of Christ therefore was, first, to arouse his
   followers, that they might no longer indulge the hope of ease and
   repose, and the enjoyments of an earthly kingdom; and, secondly, to
   fortify their minds, that they might not give way under ordinary
   calamities. Such an admonition, no doubt, was fir from being agreeable,
   but, in consequence of their stupidity, and the great weight of the
   calamities, it was highly necessary.

   21 For there will then be great tribulation. Luke says also, that there
   will be days of vengeance, and of wrath on that people, that all things
   which are written may be fulfilled. For since the people, through
   obstinate malice, had then broken the covenant of God, it was proper
   that alarming changes should take place, by which the earth itself and
   the air would be shaken. True, indeed, the most destructive plague
   inflicted on the Jews was, that the light of heavenly doctrine was
   extinguished among them, and that they were rejected by God; but they
   were compelled--as the great hardness of their hearts made it necessary
   that they should be compelled--to feel the evil of their rejection by
   sharp and severe chastisements. Now the true cause of such an awful
   punishment was, that the desperate wickedness of that nation had
   reached its height. For not only had they haughtily despised, but even
   disdainfully rejected the medicine which was brought for their
   diseases; and, what was worse, like persons who were mad or possessed
   by the devil, they wreaked their cruelty on the Physician himself.
   [147] Since the Lord executed his vengeance on those men for their
   inveterate contempt of the Gospel, accompanied by incorrigible rage,
   let their punishment be always before our eyes; and let us learn from
   it, that no offense is more heinous in the sight of God, than obstinacy
   in despising his grace. But though all who in like manner despise the
   Gospel will receive the same punishment, God determined to make a very
   extraordinary demonstration in the case of the Jews, that the coming of
   Christ might be regarded by posterity with greater admiration and
   reverence. For no words can express the baseness of their criminality
   in putting to death the Son of God, who had been sent to them as the
   Author of life. Having committed this execrable sacrilege, they did not
   cease to incur the guilt of one crime after another, and thus to draw
   down upon themselves every ground of utter destruction. And, therefore,
   Christ declares that never afterwards will there be such tribulation in
   the world; for, as the rejection of Christ, viewed in itself, and
   especially as attended by so many circumstances of detestable obstinacy
   and ingratitude, was worthy of abhorrence above all the sins committed
   ill all ages, so also it was proper that, in the severity of punishment
   with which it was visited, it should go beyond all others.

   22 And unless those days had been shortened. He presents an appalling
   view of those calamities, but at the same time mingles it with this
   consolation, that they would be sufficient to exterminate the very name
   of the Jews, if God did not look to his elect, and on their account
   grant some alleviation. This passage agrees with that of Isaiah:

   Unless the Lord had left us a small seed, we would have been as Sodom,
   and we would have been like Gomorrah, (Isaiah 1:9.)

   For it was necessary, as Paul assures us, that the vengeance of God,
   which had been displayed in the Babylonish captivity, should be again
   fulfilled at the coming of Christ, (Romans 9:29.) Nay more, in
   proportion as our wickedness was greater, it deserved a greater
   severity of punishment. And therefore Christ says that, unless God put
   a period to those calamities, the Jews will utterly perish, so that not
   a single individual will be left; but that God will remember his
   gracious covenant, and will spare his elect, according to that other
   prediction of Isaiah,

   Though thy people were like the sand of the sea,
   a remnant only shall be saved, (Isaiah 10:22.)

   This affords us a striking proof of the judgment of God, when he
   afflicts his visible Church to such a degree, that we would be ready to
   conclude that it had altogether perished; and yet, in order to preserve
   some seed, he miraculously rescues from destruction his elect, though
   few in number, that, contrary to expectation, they may escape from the
   jaws of death. For, on the one hand, it is fitted to alarm hypocrites,
   that they may not, through reliance on the title and outward appearance
   of a Church, cherish the vain hope that they will pass unpunished, for
   the Lord will find some means of delivering his Church, when those men
   have been given up to destruction; and, on the other hand, it conveys a
   wonderful consolation to the godly, that God will never allow his wrath
   to proceed so far as not to provide for their safety. Thus, in
   punishing the Jews, the wrath of God burned to an extent which was
   truly awful, and yet, contrary to the expectation of men, he restrained
   it in such a manner, that not one of the elect perished. And it was a
   miracle which almost exceeded belief; that, as salvation was to proceed
   from Judea, out of a few drops of a fountain which was dried up God
   formed rivers to water the whole world; for, in consequence of the
   hatred of all nations which they had drawn upon themselves, they
   narrowly escaped from being murdered in all places, by a preconcerted
   signal, in one day. Nor can it be doubted, that when many persons
   entreated that they should be slaughtered in this manner, Titus was
   restrained by God from giving permission to his soldiers and to others
   who were excessively desirous to carry such a design into execution;
   and, therefore, when the Roman Emperor at that time prevented the utter
   destruction of the whole nation, that was the shortening here
   mentioned, for preserving some seed, (Isaiah 1:9.)

   Yet it ought to be observed, that it was on account of the elect that
   God restrained the fierceness of his anger, that he might not consume
   them all. For why did he determine that a few should remain out of a
   vast multitude? and what reason had he for giving them a preference
   above others? It was because his grace dwelt in the people whom he had
   adopted; and, that his covenant might not fail, some were elected and
   appointed to salvation by his eternal purpose. Hence Paul ascribes to
   free election (Romans 11:5) the reason why out of an immense nation a
   remnant only was saved. Away then with human merits, when our attention
   is directed exclusively to the good pleasure of God, that the
   distinction between some persons and others may depend solely on this,
   that those who have been elected must be saved. To state the matter
   more clearly and fully, Mark uses a superfluity of words, [148]
   expressing it thus, on account of the elect, whom he hath chosen, he
   hath shortened the days. Certainly the use of the word elect might have
   been sufficient, if he had not intended to state expressly that God is
   not induced by external causes to bestow his favor on some rather than
   on others; but that, because he has elected those whom he will save, he
   ratifies the secret purpose of his grace in their salvation.

   But a question arises, how was it on account of the elect that God set
   a limit to these calamities, so as not utterly to destroy the Jews,
   when many of those who were saved were reprobate and desperate? The
   reply is easy. A part of the nation was preserved, that out of them God
   might bring his elect, who were mixed with them, like the seed after
   the chaff has been blown off. So then, though temporal safety was
   bestowed equally on the reprobate and on the elect, yet, as it was of
   no advantage to the reprobate, it is justly ascribed to the elect
   alone, for it was to their benefit that the wonderful providence of God
   was directed.

   23. If any one shall then say to you. He again repeats what he had said
   about impostors, and not without reason; for there was great danger
   arising from this temptation, that wretched men, while their affairs
   were in a troubled and desperate condition, would be deceived by false
   pretenses, would seek phantoms instead of Christ, and would embrace the
   delusions of Satan, as if they were assistance from God. As the Jews,
   when they were so severely oppressed on account of having despised
   redemption, needed, at least, violent remedies to restrain them from
   treachery, Satan cunningly held out to them new hopes, which would
   withdraw them still farther from God. And certainly, when we are left
   without direction in adversity, nothing is more pernicious than to be
   deceived, under the disguise of the name of God, by falsehoods which
   not only shut against us the door of repentance, but increase the
   darkness of infidelity, and at length overwhelm us with despair, and
   drive us to madness. The repetition of the statement, therefore, was
   far from being superfluous, when the danger was so great; and
   especially when Christ warns them that false prophets will come
   prepared with no ordinary instruments of deception, with signs and
   wonders fitted to confound weak minds. For since it is by miracles that
   God attests the presence of his power, and since they are therefore
   seals of the true doctrine, we need not wonder if impostors gain credit
   by them. By this kind of delusion God revenges the ingratitude of men,
   that they who rejected the truth may believe a lie, and that they who
   shut their eyes against the light which was offered to them may be
   plunged deeper and deeper in darkness. He exercises, at the same time,
   the constancy of his followers, which comes to shine with greater
   brightness, when they give way to no kind of impostures.

   Again, since our Lord declares that antichrists and false prophets
   would be armed with miracles, there is no reason why the Papists should
   talk so haughtily on this ground, or why we should be terrified by
   their boasting. In support of their superstitions they plead miracles,
   -- those very miracles which, the Son of God predicted, would corrupt
   the faith of many, and which, therefore, wise men ought not to hold in
   such estimation as to be sufficient of themselves to prove either one
   or another kind of doctrine. If it be objected, that such reasoning
   would overthrow and set aside the miracles by which both the Law and
   the Gospel were ratified, I reply, that the Spirit engraved on them an
   undoubted mark, which removed from believers all doubt and fear of
   being mistaken. For when God displayed his power for the purpose of
   confirming his people, he did not act in so confused a manner as not to
   manifest the true and infallible distinction. Besides, the manner in
   which miracles seal doctrine is such, that the doctrine itself mutually
   shines before them, and dispels all the clouds by which Satan darkens
   the minds of the simple. In short, if we wish to guard against
   impostures, let us preserve the connection between miracles and
   doctrine unbroken.

   24. So that even the elect (if it were possible) will be led into
   error. This was added for the purpose of exciting alarm, that believers
   may be more careful to be on their guard; for when such unbounded
   freedom of action is allowed to false prophets, and when they are
   permitted to exert such powers of deceiving, those who are careless and
   inattentive would easily be entangled by their snares. Christ therefore
   exhorts and arouses his disciples to keep watch, and at the same time
   reminds them that there is no reason for being troubled at the
   strangeness of the sight, if they see many persons on every hand led
   away into error. While he excites them to solicitude, that Satan may
   not overtake them in a state of sloth, he gives them abundant ground of
   confidence on which they may calmly rely, when he promises that they
   will be safe under the defense and protection of God against all the
   snares of Satan. And thus, however frail and slippery the condition of
   the godly may be, yet here is a firm footing on which they may stand;
   for it is not possible for them to fall away from salvation, to whom
   the Son of God is a faithful guardian. For they have not sufficient
   energy to resist the attacks of Satan, unless in consequence of their
   being

   the sheep of Christ, which none can pluck out of his hand,
   (John 10:28.)

   It must therefore be observed, that the permanency of our salvation
   does not depend on us, but on the secret election of God; for though
   our salvation is kept through faith, as Peter tells us, (1 Peter 1:5,)
   yet we ought to ascend higher, and assure ourselves that we are in
   safety, because the Father hath given us to the Son, and the Son
   himself declares, that

   none who have been given to him shall perish (John 17:12.).

   25. Lo, I have foretold it to you. Mark expresses our Lord's meaning
   more fully. But take heed: lo, I have foretold you all things. By these
   words we are taught that they who are dismayed by the stumbling-blocks
   which Christ predicted are altogether inexcusable; for since the will
   of God ought to be our rule, it is sufficient that we have received
   timely warning that such is his pleasure. Again, as he declares that

   he is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted beyond
   what we are able to bear, (1 Corinthians 10:13,)

   we shall never be in want of strength to resist, provided that our
   weakness be not nourished by indifference.

   26. Lo, he is in the desert. Luke connects this discourse with another
   reply of Christ; for, having been interrogated by the Pharisees about
   the coming of the kingdom of God, he replied, that it would not come
   with observation; and then follows in Luke's narrative that, turning to
   his disciples, he informed them that the days would come when they
   would no longer see a day of the Son of man. By these words he intended
   to charge them

   to walls in the light before the darkness of the night overtook them,
   (John 12:35;)

   for this ought to have been a very powerful excitement to endeavor to
   make progress, so long as they enjoyed the presence of Christ, when
   they 1earned that very serious disturbances were at hand. Whether or
   not Christ admonished his disciples twice on this subject is uncertain;
   but I think it. probable that Luke, while he was speaking of the coming
   of the kingdom of God introduced sentences taken from a different
   occasion, which he frequently does, as we have seen in other instances.

   But as this passage has been, through ignorance, tortured in various
   ways, that the reader may ascertain the true meaning, he must attend to
   the contrast between a state of concealment and that extension of the
   kingdom of Christ far and wide, and which would be sudden and
   unexpected, as the lightning dashes from the east to the west. For we
   know that the false Christs--in accordance with the gross and foolish
   hope of that nation--drew along with them as large bodies of men as
   they could collect into the recesses of the desert, or into caverns, or
   other places of retirement, in order to throw off the yoke of the Roman
   government by force and by arms. The meaning therefore is, that every
   one who collects his forces into a secret place, in order to regain the
   freedom of the nation by arms, falsely pretends to be the Christ; for
   the Redeemer is sent to diffuse his grace suddenly and unexpectedly
   through every quarter of the world. But these two things are quite
   contrary, to shut up redemption within some corner, and to spread it
   through the whole world. The disciples were thus reminded that they
   must no longer seek a Redeemer within the small enclosure of Judea,
   because he will suddenly extend the limits of his kingdom to the
   uttermost ends of the world. And, indeed, this astonishing rapidity,
   with which the gospel flew through every part of the world, was a
   manifest testimony of divine power. For it could not be the result of
   human industry, that the light of the gospel, as soon as it appear,
   darted from one side of the world to the opposite side like lightning;
   and therefore it is not without reason that Christ introduces this
   circumstance for demonstrating and magnifying his heavenly glory.
   Besides, by holding out this vast extent of his kingdom, he intended to
   show that the desolation of Judea would not hinder him from reigning.

   28 Wheresoever the carcass is. The meaning is, that by whatever methods
   Satan endeavors to scatter the children of God in various directions,
   still in Christ himself is the sacred bond of union, by which they must
   be kept united. For whence comes the dispersion, but that many depart
   from Christ, in whom alone our strength lies? Here then is a method
   laid down for promoting a holy union, that the separations produced by
   errors may not tear in pieces the body of the Church; and that method
   is, when we remain united to Christ. This ought to be carefully
   observed; for Christ does not restrict us either to the primacy of the
   Roman See, or to any other foolery, but employs this method alone for
   binding his Church together, that all in every quarter should look to
   him as the only head. Hence it follows, that those who are united to
   him by pure faith are beyond the risk of schism. Let the adherents of
   Rome now go, and exclaim that all are schismatics who do not allow
   themselves to be separated from Christ, that they may transfer their
   allegiance to a robber.

   There also will the eagles be gathered together. When the Papists
   interpret the word carcass to denote the company of those who profess
   the same faith, and allegorically explain the eagles to represent acute
   and sagacious men, [149] it is excessively absurd, [150] for Christ had
   manifestly no other design than to call to himself, and to retain in
   union to him, the children of God, wherever they were scattered. Nor
   does Christ simply employ the word body, but (ptoma) carcass; [151] and
   he ascribes nothing to eagles but what we might apply to crows or
   vultures, according to the nature of the country which we inhabit. I
   attach as little value to the ingenuity of other commentators, who say
   that the death of Christ had a sweet savor, to draw the elect to God;
   for, in my opinion, Christ intended to argue from the less to the
   greater, that if birds have so great sagacity as to flock in great
   numbers from distant places to a single carcass, it would be
   disgraceful in believers not to assemble to the Author of life, from
   whom alone they derive their actual nourishment.

   29. And immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun

   then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall

   shall send his angels with a loud sound of a trumpet; and they shall
   gather together his elect from the four winds, from one extremity of
   heaven to the other.

   24. But in those days, after that tribulation, shall the sun be
   darkened, and the moon shall not give her light. 25. And the stars of
   heaven shall fall, and the powers which are in heaven shall be shaken.
   26. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with

   25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
   stars, and on the earth the anguish of nations in despair, the sea and
   the waves roaring: 26. Men fainting through fear, [152] and expectation
   of those things which shall come on the world; for the powers of heaven
   shall be shaken. 27. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a
   cloud with great power and glory. 28. But when these things begin to
   take place, look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption is at
   hand.


   Matthew 24:29. And immediately after the tribulation of those days.
   Christ comes now to speak of the full manifestation of his kingdom,
   about which he was at first interrogated by the disciples, and promises
   that, after they have been tried by so many distressing events, the
   redemption will arrive in due time. The principal object of his reply
   was, to confirm his disciples in good hope, that they might not be
   dismayed on account of the troubles and confusion that would arise. For
   this reason, he does not speak of his coming in simple terms, but
   employs those modes of expression which were common among the prophets,
   by which, the more attentively they were considered, so much the more
   severe would be the contest of temptation experienced by the reader, in
   consequence of the opposite character of the event. For what could be
   more strange than to see the kingdom of Christ not only despised, but
   oppressed by the cross, loaded with many reproaches, and overwhelmed by
   every kind of tribulation, that kingdom which the prophets had
   frequently described in such magnificent language? Might it not be
   asked, where was that majesty which would darken the sun, and moon, and
   stars, shake the whole frame of the world, and change the ordinary
   course of nature? Our Lord now meets these temptations, declaring that,
   though these predictions are not immediately fulfilled, they will at
   length be fully justified by the event. The meaning therefore is, that
   the predictions which had been formerly made about the miraculous
   shaking of heaven and earth, ought not to be restricted to the
   commencement of redemption, because the prophets had embraced the whole
   course of it, till it should arrive at perfection.

   Having now ascertained Christ's intention, we shall have no difficulty
   in perceiving the meaning of the words to be, that heaven will not be
   darkened immediately, but after that the Church shall have passed
   through the whole course of its tribulations. Not that the glory and
   majesty of the kingdom of Christ will not appear till his last coming,
   but because till that time is delayed the accomplishment of those
   things which began to take place after his resurrection, and of which
   God gave to his people nothing more than a taste, that he might lead
   them farther on in the path of hope and patience. According to this
   argument, Christ keeps the minds of believers in a state of suspense
   till the last day, that they may not imagine those declarations which
   the prophets made, about the future restoration, to have failed of
   their accomplishment, because they lie buried for a long period under
   the thick darkness of tribulations.

   The tribulation of those days is improperly interpreted by some
   commentators to mean the destruction of Jerusalem; for, on the
   contrary, it is a general recapitulation (anakephalaiosis) of all the
   evils of which Christ had previously spoken. To encourage his followers
   to patience, he employs this argument, that the tribulations will at
   length have a happy and joyful result. As if he had said, "So long as
   the Church shall continue its pilgrimage in the world, there will be
   dark and cloudy weather; but as soon as an end shall have been put to
   those distresses, a day will arrive when the majesty of the Church
   shall be illustriously displayed." In what manner the sun will be
   darkened we cannot now conjecture, but the event will show. He does not
   indeed mean that the stars will actually fall, but according to the
   apprehension of men; and accordingly Luke only predicts that there will
   be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars. The meaning
   therefore is, that there will be such a violent commotion of the
   firmament of heaven, that the stars themselves will be supposed to
   fall. Luke also adds that there will be a dreadful commotion of the
   sea, the sea and the waves roaring, so that men will faint through fear
   and alarm. In a word, all the creatures above and below will be, as it
   were, heralds to summon men to that tribunal, which they will continue
   to treat with ungodly and wanton contempt till the last day.

   30. Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man. By this term Christ
   points out more clearly the difference between the present condition of
   his kingdom and its future glory; for it is a sort of admission that,
   amidst the darkness of tribulations, the majesty of Christ will not
   fully appear, and men will not perceive the redemption which he has
   brought. The confused mixture of things which we now perceive does
   certainly, on the one hand, darken our minds, and, on the other hand,
   bury the grace of Christ, and make it almost vanish from our sight, so
   that the salvation obtained by him, so far as relates to the perception
   of the flesh, is not comprehended. And therefore he declares that he
   will appear openly at his last coming and, surrounded by the heavenly
   power, which will be a sign erected on an elevated spot, he will turn
   the eyes of the whole world upon himself. [153]

   Perceiving that the greater part of men would despise his doctrine and
   oppose his reign, he threatens also against all nations mourning and
   lamentation; because it is proper, that by his presence he should crush
   and destroy the rebels, who, while he was absent, despised his
   authority. He says this, partly to bring the haughty and refractory to
   repentance, by striking them with terror; and partly to confirm the
   minds of his followers amidst so great obstinacy existing in the world.
   For it is no slight ground of offense to see the ungodly living without
   concern, because they think that their mockery of God will remain
   unpunished; and again, there is nothing to which we are more prone than
   to be captivated by the allurements of the prosperity which they enjoy,
   so as to lose the fear of God. That the joy by which they are
   intoxicated may not excite the envy of believers, Christ declares that
   it will at length be turned into mourning and gnashing of teeth.

   He alludes, I think, to Zechariah 12:11-14, where God, informing them
   that a striking display of his judgment will soon be made, declares
   that there will be lamentation in every family, such as is not usually
   seen at the funeral of a first-born son. There is no reason, therefore,
   why any person should expect the conversion of the world, for at
   length--when it will be too late, and will yield them no advantage--

   they shall look on him whom they pierced,
   (Zechariah 12:10.)

   Next follows the explanation of that sin, that they shall see the Son
   of man coming in the clouds, who at that time was living on earth in
   the garb of a despised servant. And thus he warns them that the glory
   of his kingdom will be heavenly, and not earthly, as the disciples had
   falsely imagined.

   And he shall send his angels. He describes the effect of his power,
   that he will send his angels to gather his elect from the most distant
   parts of the world; for by the extremity of heaven is meant the most
   distant region. But Christ speaks hyperbolically, in order to show that
   the elect, even though they were carried away from the earth and
   scattered in the air, will again be gathered, so to be united in the
   enjoyment of eternal life under Him as their head, and enjoy the
   expected inheritance; for Christ intended to console his disciples,
   that they might not be altogether discouraged by the lamentable
   dispersion of the Church. Whenever, therefore, we perceive the Church
   scattered by the wiles of Satan, or torn in pieces by the cruelty of
   the ungodly, or disturbed by false doctrines, or tossed about by
   storms, let us learn to turn our eyes to this gathering of the elect.
   And if it appear to us a thing difficult to be believed, let us call to
   remembrance the power of the angels, which Christ holds out to us for
   the express purpose of raising our views above human means. For, though
   the Church be now tormented by the malice of men, or even broken by the
   violence of the billows, and miserably torn in pieces, so as to have no
   stability in the world, yet we ought always to cherish confident hope,
   because it will not be by human means, but by heavenly power, which
   will be far superior to every obstacle, that the Lord will gather his
   Church.

   Luke 21:28. And when these things begin to take place. Luke expresses
   more clearly the consolation by which Christ animates the minds of his
   followers; for, though this sentence contains nothing different from
   the words of Matthew, which we have just now explained, yet it shows
   better for what purpose the angels will come, as we are told, to gather
   the elect. For it was necessary to contrast the joy of the godly with
   the general sorrow and distress of the world, and to point out the
   difference between them and the reprobate, that they might not view
   with horror the coming of Christ. We know that Scripture, when it
   speaks not only of the last judgment, but of all the judgments which
   God executes every day, describes them in a variety of ways, according
   as the discourse is addressed to believers or to unbelievers.

   To what purpose is the day of the Lord to you?
   says the prophet Amos, (5:18.)

   It is a day of darkness and gloominess, [154] not of light; of sorrow,
   not of joy; of destruction, not of salvation. On the other hand,
   Zechariah (9:9) bids the daughter of Zion rejoice on account of the
   coming of her King; and justly, for--as Isaiah (35:4) tells us--the
   same day which brings wrath and vengeance to the reprobate brings
   good-will and redemption to believers.

   Christ therefore shows that, at his coming, the light of joy will arise
   on his disciples, that they may rejoice in the approaching salvation,
   while the wicked are overwhelmed with terror. Accordingly, Paul
   distinguishes them by this mark, that they wait for the day or coming
   of the Lord, (1 Corinthians 1:7) for that which is their crown, and
   perfect happiness, and solace, is delayed till that day, (2 Timothy
   4:8.) It is therefore called here (as in Romans 8:23) redemption;
   because we shall then obtain truly and perfectly the consequences of
   the deliverance obtained through Christ. Let our ears therefore be
   awake to the sound of the angel's trumpet, which will then sound, not
   only to strike the reprobate with the dread of death, but to arouse the
   elect to a second life; that is, to call to the enjoyment of life those
   whom the Lord now quickens by the voice of his Gospel; for it is a sign
   of infidelity, to be afraid when the Son of God comes in person for our
   salvation.

   shall not pass before all these things are done. 33. Heaven and earth

   Matthew 24:32. Now learn a similitude from the fig-tree. I do not
   suppose the meaning of this to be merely that, during the state of
   confusion which has been mentioned, there will be as evident a sign
   that the coming of Christ is nigh, as that by which we know with
   certainty that the summer is at hand, when the trees begin to grow
   green; but, in my opinion, Christ expresses something else. For as in
   winter the trees, contracted by the severity of the cold, show greater
   vigor, but in spring lose their toughness, and appear more feeble, and
   are even cleft asunder to open up passage for fresh twigs, so the
   afflictions by which, according to the perception of the flesh, the
   Church is softened, do not in any way impair its vigor. As the inward
   sap diffused through the whole tree, after having produced this
   softness, collects strength to throw itself out for renovating what was
   dead, so the Lord draws from the corruption of the outward man the
   perfect restoration of his people. The general instruction conveyed is,
   that the weak and frail condition of the Church ought not to lead us to
   conclude that it is dying, but rather to expect the immortal glory for
   which the Lord prepares his people by the cross and by afflictions; for
   what Paul maintains in reference to each of the members must be
   fulfilled in the whole body, that

   if the outward man is decayed the inward man is renewed day by day, (2
   Corinthians 4:16.)

   What Matthew and Mark had stated more obscurely, know you that it is
   nigh at the door, is more fully explained by Luke, know you that the
   kingdom of God is at hand; and in this passage the kingdom of God is
   not represented--as in many other passages--at its commencement, but at
   its perfection, and that according to the views of those whom Christ
   was teaching. For they did not view the kingdom of God in the Gospel as
   consisting in the peace and joy of faith and in spiritual
   righteousness, (Romans 14:17,) but sought that blessed rest and glory
   which is concealed under hope till the last day.

   34. This generation shall not pass away. Though Christ employs a
   general expression, yet he does not extend the discourses to all the
   miseries which would befall the Church, but merely informs them, that
   before a single generation shall have been completed, they will learn
   by experience the truth of what he has said. For within fifty years the
   city was destroyed and the temple was razed, the whole country was
   reduced to a hideous desert, and the obstinacy of the world rose up
   against God. Nay more, their rage was inflamed to exterminate the
   doctrine of salvation, false teachers arose to corrupt the pure gospel
   by their impostures, religion sustained amazing shocks, and the whole
   company of the godly was miserably distressed. Now though the same
   evils were perpetrated in uninterrupted succession for many ages
   afterwards, yet what Christ said was true, that, before the close of a
   single generation, believers would feel in reality, and by undoubted
   experience, the truth of his prediction; for the apostles endured the
   same things which we see in the present day. [155] And yet it was not
   the design of Christ to promise to his followers that their calamities
   would be terminated within a short time, (for then he would have
   contradicted himself, having previously warned them that the end was
   not yet;) but, in order to encourage them to perseverance, he expressly
   foretold that those things related to their own age. The meaning
   therefore is: "This prophecy does not relate to evils that are distant,
   and which posterity will see after the lapse of many centuries, but
   which are now hanging over you, and ready to fall in one mass, so that
   there is no part of it which the present generation will not
   experience." So then, while our Lord heaps upon a, single generation
   every kind of calamities, he does not by any means exempt future ages
   from the same kind of sufferings, but only enjoins the disciples to be
   prepared for enduring them all with firmness.

   35 Heaven and earth shall pass away. In order to secure greater
   confidence in his statements, he illustrates their certainty by this
   comparison, that it is more firm and stable than the entire structure
   of the world. [156] But this form of expression is explained by
   commentators in a variety of ways. Some refer it as the passing away of
   heaven and earth at the last day, by which their frail constitution
   will be brought to an end; while others explain it to mean, that sooner
   shall the entire structure of the world perish than the prophecy which
   we have just heard shall fail to be accomplished. But as there can be
   no doubt that Christ expressly intended to raise the minds of his
   followers above the contemplation of the world, I think that he refers
   to the continual changes which we see in the world, and affirms, that
   we ought not to judge of his sayings by the changeful character of the
   world, which resembles the billows of the sea; for we know how easily
   our minds are carried away by the affairs of the world, when it is
   undergoing incessant change. For this reason, Christ enjoins his
   disciples not to allow their attention to be occupied by the world, but
   to look down, from what may be called the lofty watch-tower of divine
   providence, on all that he foretold would happen. Yet from this passage
   we draw a useful doctrine, that our salvation, because it is founded on
   the promises of Christ, does not fluctuate according to the various
   agitations of the world, but remains unshaken, provided only that our
   faith rises above heaven and earth, and ascends to Christ himself.

   36. But of that day and hour. By this sentence, Christ intended to hold
   the minds of believers in suspense that they might not, by a false
   imagination, fix any time for the final redemption. We know how fickle
   our minds are, and how much we are tickled by a vain curiosity to know
   more than is proper. Christ likewise perceived that the disciples were
   pushing forward with excessive haste to enjoy a triumph. He therefore
   wishes the day of his coming to be the object of such expectation and
   desire, that none shall dare to inquire when it will happen. In short,
   he wishes his disciples so to walk in the light of faith, that while
   they are uncertain as to the time, they may patiently wait for the
   revelation of him. We ought therefore to be on our guard, lest our
   anxiety about the time be carried farther than the Lord allows; for the
   chief part of our wisdom lies in confining ourselves soberly within the
   limits of God's word. That men may not feel uneasy at not knowing that
   day, Christ represents angels as their associates in this matter; for
   it would be a proof of excessive pride and wicked covetousness, to
   desire that we who creep on the earth should know more than is
   permitted to the angels in heaven. [157]

   Mark adds, nor the Son himself. And surely that man must be singularly
   mad, who would hesitate to submit to the ignorance which even the Son
   of God himself did not hesitate to endure on our account. But many
   persons, thinking that this was unworthy of Christ, have endeavored to
   mitigate the harshness of this opinion by a contrivance of their own;
   and perhaps they were driven to employ a subterfuge by the malice of
   the Arians, who attempted to prove from it that Christ is not the true
   and only God. So then, according to those men, Christ did not know the
   last day, because he did not choose to reveal it to men. But since it
   is manifest that the same kind of ignorance is ascribed to Christ as is
   ascribed to the angels, we must endeavor to find some other meaning
   which is more suitable. Before stating it, however, I shall briefly
   dispose of the objections of those who think that it is an insult
   offered to the Son of God, if it be said that any kind of ignorance can
   properly apply to him.

   As to the first objection, that nothing is unknown to God, the answer
   is easy. For we know that in Christ the two natures were united into
   one person in such a manner that each retained its own properties; and
   more especially the Divine nature was in a state of repose, and did not
   at all exert itself, [158] whenever it was necessary that the human
   nature should act separately, according to what was peculiar to itself,
   in discharging the office of Mediator. There would be no impropriety,
   therefor in saying that Christ, who knew all things, (John 21:17) was
   ignorant of something in respect of his perception as a man; for
   otherwise he could not have been liable to grief and anxiety, and could
   not have been like us, (Hebrews 2:17.) Again, the objection urged by
   some--that ignorance cannot apply to Christ, because it is the
   punishment of sin -- is beyond measure ridiculous. For, first, it is
   prodigious folly to assert that the ignorance which is ascribed to
   angels proceeds from sin; but they discover themselves to be equally
   foolish on another ground, by not perceiving that Christ clothed
   himself with our flesh, for the purpose of enduring the punishment due
   to our sins. And if Christ, as man, did not know the last day, that
   does not any more derogate from his Divine nature than to have been
   mortal.

   I have no doubt that he refers to the office appointed to him by the
   Father as in a former instance, when he said that it did not belong to
   him to place this or that person at his right or left hand, (Matthew
   20:23; Mark 5:40.) For (as I explained under that passage [159] ) he
   did not absolutely say that this was not in his power, but the meaning
   was, that he had not been sent by the Father with this commission, so
   long as he lived among mortals. So now I understand that, so far as he
   had come down to us to be Mediator, until he had fully discharged his
   office that information was not given to him which he received after
   his resurrection; for then he expressly declared that power over all
   things had been given to him, (Matthew 28:18.)

   Luke 17:26-37

   37. But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son
   of man be. 38. For as in the days that came before the deluge, they
   were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till the day
   when Noah entered into the ark, 39. And knew not until the deluge came,
   [160] and took them all away: so shall also the coming of the Son of
   man be. 40. Two men shall then be in the field; one is taken, and the
   other is left. 41. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is
   taken, and the other is left. 42. Watch therefore, for you know not at
   what hour your Lord will come.

   33. Take heed, watch and pray; for you know not when the time is.

   26. And as it happened in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the
   days of the Son of man. 27. They ate, they drank, they married wives,
   and were given in marriage, till that day when Noah entered into the
   ark; and the deluge came, and destroyed them all. 28. In like manner
   also, as it happened in the days of Lot, they ate, they drank, they
   bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 29. But on the day that
   Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and
   destroyed them all. 30. In all these respects shall the day be when the
   Son of man shall be revealed. 31. In that day, let not him who shall be
   on the housetop, and his furniture in the house, go down to take them
   away; and in like manner, let not him who shall be in the field return
   to what he hath left behind. 32. Remember Lot's wife. 33. Whosoever
   shall seek to save his soul, shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose
   it, will beget it to life. [161] 34. I tell you, in that night two men
   shall be in one bed; one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
   35. Two women shall be grinding together; one shall be taken, and the
   other shall be left. 36. Two men shall be in the field; one shall be
   taken, and the other shall be left. 37. Then they answering say to him,
   Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the carcass is, there will
   the eagles also be gathered together.


   Luke 21:34-36

   34. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this
   life, and that day come upon you suddenly. 35. For as a snare shall it
   come [162] on all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. 36. Watch
   therefore, praying at all times that you may be permitted to escape all
   those things which shall happen, and to stand before the Son of man.


   Matthew 24:37. But as the days of Noah were. Although Christ lately
   expressed his desire to keep the minds of his followers in suspense,
   that they might not inquire too anxiously about the last day; yet, lest
   the indifference arising out of the enjoyments of the world should lull
   them to sleep, he now exhorts them to solicitude. He wished them to be
   uncertain as to his coming, but yet to be prepared to expect him every
   day, or rather every moment. [163] To shake off their sloth, and to
   excite them more powerfully to be on their guard, he foretells that the
   end will come, while the world is sunk in brutal indifference; just as
   in the days of Noah all the nations were swallowed up by the deluge,
   when they had no expectation of it, but rioted in gluttony and
   voluptuousness, and shortly afterwards, the inhabitants of Sodom, while
   they were abandoning themselves without fear to sensuality, were
   consumed by fire from heaven. Since indifference of this sort will
   exist about the time of the last day, believers ought not to indulge
   themselves after the example of the multitude.

   We have now ascertained the design of Christ, which was, to inform
   believers that, in order to prevent themselves from being suddenly
   overtaken, they ought always to keep watch, because the day of the last
   judgment will come when it is not expected. Luke alone mentions Sodom,
   and that in the seventeenth chapter, where he takes occasion, without
   attending to the order of time, to relate this discourse of Christ. But
   it would not have been improper that the two Evangelists should have
   satisfied themselves with a single example, though Christ mentioned
   two, more especially when those examples perfectly agreed with each
   other in this respect, that at one time the whole human race, in the
   midst of unbroken indolence and pleasure, was suddenly swallowed up,
   [164] with the exception of a few individuals. When he says that men
   were giving their whole attention to eating, drinking, marriage, and
   other worldly employments, at the time when God destroyed the whole
   world by a deluge, and Sodom by thunder; these words mean that they
   were as fully occupied with the conveniences and enjoyments of the
   present life, as if there had been no reason to dread any change. And
   though we shall immediately find him commanding the disciples to guard
   against surfeiting and earthly cares, yet in this passage he does not
   directly condemn the intemperance, but rather the obstinacy, of those
   times, in consequence of which, they despised the threatenings of God,
   and awaited with indifference their awful destruction. Promising to
   themselves that the condition in which they then were would remain
   unchanged, they did not scruple to follow without concern their
   ordinary pursuits. And in itself it would not have been improper, or
   worthy of condemnation, to make provision for their wants, if they had
   not with gross stupidity opposed the judgment of God, and rushed, with
   closed eyes, to unbridled iniquity, as if there had been no Judge in
   heaven. So now Christ declares that the last age of the world will be
   in a state of stupid indifference, so that men will think of nothing
   but the present life, and will extend their cares to a long period,
   pursuing their ordinary course of life, as if the world were always to
   remain in the same condition. The comparisons are highly appropriate;
   for if we consider what then happened, we shall no longer be deceived
   by the belief that the uniform order of events which we see in the
   world will always continue. For within three days of the time, when
   every man was conducting his affairs in the utmost tranquillity, the
   world was swallowed up by a deluge, and five cities were consumed by
   fire.

   39. And knew not until the deluge came. The source and cause of their
   ignorance was, that unbelief had blinded their minds; as, on the other
   hand, we are informed by the Apostle, that Noah beheld at a distance,
   by the eyes of faith, the vengeance of God which was still concealed,
   so as to entertain an early dread of it, (Hebrews 11:7.) And here
   Christ compares Noah with the rest of the world, and Lot with the
   inhabitants of Sodom, that believers may learn to withdraw, lest they
   wander and be cut off along with others. But it must be observed that
   the reprobate, at that time, were hardened in their wickedness, because
   the Lord did not show his grace to any but his servants, by giving them
   a salutary warning to beware in proper time. Not that information of
   the future deluge was altogether withheld from the inhabitants of the
   world--before whose eyes Noah, in building the ark for more than a
   hundred years, presented a warning of the approaching calamity--but
   because one man was specially warned, by divine revelation, of the
   future destruction of the whole world, and raised up to cherish the
   hope of salvation. Though the report of the last judgment is now widely
   circulated, and though there are a few persons who have been taught by
   God to perceive that Christ will come as a Judge in due time, yet it is
   proper that those persons should be aroused by this extraordinary
   kindness of God, and that their senses should be sharpened, lest they
   give themselves up to the indifference which so generally prevails. For
   Peter compares the ark of Noah with our baptism on this ground, that a
   small company of men, separated from the multitude, is saved amidst the
   waters, (1 Peter 3:20, 21.) To this small number, therefore, our minds
   must be directed, if we desire to escape in safety.

   40. Two men shall then be in the field. Before mentioning this, Luke
   inserts some sentences; the first of which is presented by Matthew as
   belonging to the destruction of Jerusalem, Let not him who shall be on
   the house-top go down into his house to carry away his furniture. But
   it is possible that Christ applied the same words to various subjects.
   Luke states also a warning, that the disciples should remember Lot's
   wife; that is, that they should forget those things which are behind,
   (Philippians 3:13) and advance towards the end of the heavenly calling.
   For Lot's wife was changed into a pillar of salt, (Genesis 19:26,)
   because, hesitating whether there were good reasons for departing from
   the city, she looked behind her, by which she gave the lie to the
   heavenly oracle. Perhaps, too, regret at leaving her nest, in which she
   had dwelt with comfort, induced her to turn her head. Since, therefore,
   God intended that she should remain as an everlasting demonstration,
   our minds ought to be strengthened by the constancy of faith, that they
   may not hesitate and give way in the middle of the course; and they
   ought also to be trained to perseverance, in order that, bidding adieu
   to the fascinations of a transitory life, they may rise cheerfully and
   willingly towards heaven.

   Luke adds a third sentence, whosoever shall seek to save his soul will
   lose it, that the desire of an earthly life may not prevent believers
   from passing rapidly through the midst of death, to the salvation laid
   up for them in heaven. And Christ employs a strong expression to denote
   the frailty of the present life, when he says that souls
   (Zoogonountai), -- that is, are begotten into life -- when they are
   lost. His meaning is the same as if he had declared that inch do not
   live in the world, because the commencement of that life which is real,
   and which is worthy of the name, is, to leave the world. Luke
   afterwards adds what we find also in Matthew, that husbands and wives
   will then be separated, that the tics by which human beings are bound
   to each other in the world may not hinder or retard the godly; for it
   frequently happens that, while men are paying attention to each other,
   not one of them advances a step. In order, therefor that every man in
   his own department, freed from every bond and impediment, may run with
   cheerfulness, Christ informs us that, out of a single couple, one
   partner will be taken, while the other is left. Not that all who are
   united must of necessity be thus separated; for the sacred bond of
   piety will cause a believing wife to cleave to a believing husband, and
   will cause children to accompany their father. But Christ only
   intended, in order to cut off every occasion of delay, to enjoin every
   one to make haste, that those who already prepared may not waste their
   time in waiting for their companions. Immediately afterwards Luke adds,
   where the carcass is, there will the eagles also be gathered together;
   which must not, however, be restricted to the last day, but as the
   disciples had asked, Where, Lord? that is, "How shall we stand erect
   amidst so great shaking? and how shall we remain safe amidst such
   dangerous storms? and to what places of concealment shall we resort for
   protection, when we are united?" Christ declares, as we find in
   Matthew--that he is the banner of solid union, and in which all the
   children of God must be gathered.

   42. Watch therefore. In Luke the exhortation is more pointed, or, at
   least, more special, Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
   hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and the cares
   of this life. And certainly he who, by living in intemperance, has his
   senses overloaded with food and wine, will never elevate his mind to
   meditation on the heavenly life. But as there is no desire of the flesh
   that does not intoxicate a man, they ought to take care, in all these
   respects, not to satiate themselves with the world, if they wish to
   advance with speed to the kingdom of Christ. The single word watch --
   which we find in Matthew -- denotes that uninterrupted attention which
   keeps our minds in full activity, and makes us pass through the world
   like pilgrims.

   In the account given by Mark, the disciples are first enjoined to take
   heed lest, through carelessness or indolence, ruin overtake them; and
   next are commanded to watch, because various allurements of the flesh
   are continually creeping upon us, and lulling our minds to sleep. Next
   follows an exhortation to prayer, because it is necessary to seek
   elsewhere the supplies that are necessary for supporting our weakness.
   Luke dictates the very form of prayer; first, that God may be pleased
   to rescue us from so deep and intricate a labyrinth; and next, that he
   may present us safe and sound in presence of his Son; for we shall
   never be able to reach it but by miraculously escaping innumerable
   deaths. And as it was not enough to pass through the course of the
   present life by rising superior to all dangers, Christ places this as
   the most important, that we may be permitted to stand before his
   tribunal.

   For you know not at what hour your Lord will come. It ought to be
   observed, that the uncertainty as to the time of Christ's coming --
   which almost all treat as an encouragement to sloth -- ought to be felt
   by us to be an excitement to attention and watchfulness. God intended
   that it should be hidden from us, for the express purpose that we may
   keep diligent watch without the relaxation of a single hour. For what
   would be the trial of faith and patience, if believers, after spending
   their whole life in ease, and indolence, and pleasure, were to prepare
   themselves within the space of three days for meeting Christ?

   43. But know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the
   thief would come, he would certainly have watched, and would not have
   permitted his house to be broken into. 44. Therefore, be you also
   ready; because the Son of man will come at an hour when you are not
   aware. 45. Who is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master hath
   appointed over his household, to give them food in due season?
   46. Blessed is that servant, whom his master, when he cometh, shall
   find acting in this manner. 47. Verily I say to you, He will appoint
   him [165] over all his property. 48. But if that wicked servant shall
   say in his heart, My master delayeth to come; 49. And shall begin to
   beat his fellow-servants, and even to eat and drink with drunkards;
   50. The master of that servant will come on a day when he doth not look
   for him, and at an hour when he is not aware; 51. And shall cut him
   off; and assign his portion with hypocrites: weeping and gnashing of
   teeth shall be there.

   34. As a man [166] who is going abroad, and hath left his house, and
   hath given it in charge to his servants, and hath assigned to every man
   his work, and hath commanded the porter to watch. 35. Watch, therefore;
   (for you know not when your Lord will come, [167] whether in the
   evening, or at midnight, or at the cock crowing, or in the morning;)
   36. Lest, when he shall come suddenly, he will find you sleeping.
   37. But what I say to you I say to all, Watch.

   35. Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning; 36. And yourselves
   like men who wait for their master, till he shall return from the
   marriage, that, when he shall come and knock, [168] they may open to
   him immediately. 37. Blessed are those servants whom their lord, when
   he cometh shall find watching. Verily I tell you, that he will gird
   himself, and make them sit down at table, and will come forward and
   serve them. 38. And if he shall come in the second watch, or if he
   shall come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those
   servants. 39. But know this, that if the householder had known at what
   hour the thief would come, he would certainly have watched, and would
   not have permitted his house to be broken into. 40. And therefore be
   you also ready; for the Son of man will come at an hour when you are
   not expecting him. 41. And Peter saith to him, Lord, sayest thou this
   parable to us, or likewise to all? 42. And the Lord said, Who is a
   faithful and wise steward, whom his master will appoint over his
   household, to give them their allowance of food at the proper time?
   43. Blessed is that servant, whom his master, when he cometh, shall
   find acting in this manner. 44. Verily I tell you, that he will appoint
   him over all that he possesses. 45. But if that servant shall say in
   his heart, My master delayeth his coming, and shall begin to beat the
   men-servants, and maids, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
   46. The master of that servant will come on a day when he doth not
   expect him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him off,
   and assign his portion with the unfaithful. 47. But that servant, who
   knew his master's will, and did not make himself ready, nor did
   according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. 48. But he
   who knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
   few stripes. And to whomsoever much hath been given, much will be
   demanded from him, and to whom men have entrusted much, from him they
   will exact more. 49. I came to send a fire on the earth, and what do I
   wish if it be already be kindled? [169] 50. But I have to be baptized
   with a baptism, and how am I distressed till it be accomplished!


   Matthew 24:43. If the householder had known. Luke relates this
   discourse of Christ at a different place from Matthew; and we need not
   wonder at this, for in the twelfth chapter, where (as we have formerly
   explained) he collects out of various discourses a summary of doctrine,
   he inserts also this parable. Besides, he introduces a general preface
   that the disciples should wait for their master, with their loins girt,
   and carrying burning lamps in their hands. To this statement
   corresponds the parable, which we shall soon afterwards find in Matthew
   25:1-12 about the wise and foolish virgins.

   In a few words Christ glances rapidly at the manner in which believers
   ought to conduct their pilgrimage in the world; for first he contrasts
   the girding of the loins with sloth, and burning lamps with the
   darkness of ignorance. First, then, Christ enjoins the disciples to be
   ready and equipped for the journey, that they may pass rapidly through
   the world, and may seek no fixed abode or resting-place but in heaven.
   The warning is highly useful; for though ungodly men have likewise in
   their mouth this form of expression, "the course of life," yet we see
   how they lay themselves down in the world, and remain unmoved in their
   attachment to it. But God does not bestow the honorable title of his
   children on any but those who acknowledge that they are strangers on
   the earth, and who not only are at all times prepared to leave it, but
   likewise move forward, in an uninterrupted "course," towards the
   heavenly life. Again, as they are surrounded on all sides by darkness,
   so long as they remain in the world, he furnishes them with lamps, as
   persons who are to perform a journey during the night. The first
   recommendation is, to run vigorously; and the next is, to have clear
   information as to the road, that believers may not weary themselves to
   no purpose by going astray; for otherwise it would be better to stumble
   in the way, than to perform a journey in uncertainty and mistake. As to
   the expression, girding the loins, it is borrowed from the ordinary
   custom of Eastern nations in wearing long garments.

   Luke 12:36. And you yourselves like men that wait for their master. He
   uses another parable not mentioned by Matthew, who writes more briefly
   on this subject; for he compares himself to a householder who, while he
   is joining in the festivities of the marriage feast, or in other
   respects indulging in pleasure, out of his own house, wishes his
   servants to conduct themselves with modesty and sobriety at home,
   attending to their lawful occupations, and diligently waiting for his
   return. Now though the Son of God has departed to the blessed rest of
   heaven, and is absent from us, yet as he has assigned to every one his
   duty, it would be improper for us to give way to indolent repose.
   Besides, as he has promised that he will return to us, we ought to hold
   ourselves prepared, at every moment, to receive him, that he may not
   find us sleeping. For if a mortal man looks upon it as a duty which his
   servants owe him, that, at whatever hour he returns home, they shall be
   prepared to receive him, how much more has he a right to demand from
   his followers that they shall be sober and vigilant, and always wait
   for his coming? To excite them to greater alacrity, he mentions that
   earthly masters are so delighted with such promptitude on the part of
   their servants, that they even serve them; not that all masters are
   accustomed to act in this manner, but because it does sometimes happen
   that a master, who is kind and gentle, admits his servants to his own
   table, as if they were his companions.

   Yet it may be asked, Since Scripture calls us in many passages children
   of light, (Ephesians 5:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:5,) and since the Lord also
   shines upon us by his word, so that we walk as at noon, how does the
   Lord compare our life to the watches of tire night? But we ought to
   seek the solution of this difficulty from the words of Peter, who tells
   us, that the word of God shines like a burning lamp, to enable us
   distinctly to see our road in a dark place. We ought therefore to
   attend. to both statements, that our journey must be performed amidst
   the thick darkness of the world, and yet we are protected from the risk
   of going astray, while the torch of heavenly doctrine goes before us,
   more especially when we have Christ himself for a sun.

   Matthew 24:44. But know this. Another similitude is now employed by
   Christ, in exhorting his disciples to keep diligent watch; for if any
   person shall hear that robbers are prowling in the night, fear and
   suspicion will not allow him to sleep. Since, therefore, we are
   informed that Christ's coming will be sudden and unexpected, like that
   of a robber, and since we are expressly forewarned that we must always
   watch, lest he come upon us when asleep, and we be swallowed up with
   the ungodly, there is no excuse for our indolence; more especially
   since there is reason to dread not only a breach of the wall, and a
   loss of our property, but a deadly wound to ruin our soul, unless we
   are on our guard. The tendency of these words therefore is, that the
   warning of Christ should arouse us; for, though the last judgment be
   delayed for a long time, yet it hangs over us every hour; and,
   therefore, when there is ground for alarm, and when danger is near, it
   is unreasonable that we should be sluggish.

   45. Who is the faithful and wise servant? This passage is more
   distinctly explained by Luke, who inserts Peter's question, which gave
   rise to a new parable. Christ having declared that the suddenness and
   uncertainty of his coming led to such danger as left no room for sloth,
   Peter asked, if this doctrine was general, or if it belonged to the
   twelve alone. For the disciples--as we have formerly seen--were always
   in the habit of thinking that they were unjustly treated, unless they
   were exempted from the common lot, and greatly excelled all others.
   When our Lord now represents to them a condition which is far from
   being pleasant or desirable, they look around them on every hand, like
   persons astonished. But the object of Christ's reply is, to show that,
   if each of the common people ought to watch, much less ought it to be
   endured that the apostles should be asleep. As Christ had formerly
   exhorted the whole family in general to watch for his coming, so now he
   demands extraordinary care from the principal servants, who had been
   appointed over others for the purpose of pointing out, by their
   example, the path of sobriety, watchfulness, and strict temperance. By
   these words he reminds them that they were not elevated to high rank
   for the purpose of indulging in ease, indolence, and pleasure; but
   that, the higher the rank of honor which they had obtained, the heavier
   was the burden which was laid on them; and therefore he declares that
   it is especially demanded from such persons that they exercise fidelity
   and wisdom.

   Let all who are called to an honorable office learn from this, that
   they are so much the more strongly bound, not only to bestow their
   labor faithfully, but to strive with their utmost zeal and industry to
   discharge their duty. For while it is enough for ordinary servants to
   go through their daily toil, stewards, whose office embraces the care
   of the whole family, ought to go much farther. Otherwise Christ charges
   them with ingratitude, because, while they have been chosen before
   others, they do not answer to their honor; for why does our Lord prefer
   them to the rest, but in order that they may excel all by extraordinary
   fidelity and wisdom? True, indeed, all are enjoined, without exception,
   to be sober, and to give earnest attention, but drowsiness would be
   peculiarly disgraceful and inexcusable in pastors. He next holds out
   even the hope of a reward to encourage them to diligence.

   48. But if that wicked servant shall say in his heart. By these words,
   Christ briefly points out the source of that carelessness which creeps
   upon wicked servants. It is because they trust to a longer delay, and
   thus of their own accord involve themselves in darkness. They imagine
   that the day when they must render an account will never come; and,
   under the pretext of Christ's absence, they promise themselves that
   they will remain unpunished. For it is impossible but that the
   expectation of him, when it does occur to our minds, shall shake off
   sleep, and still more, that it shall restrain us from being carried
   away by wicked sensuality. No excitement of exhortation, therefore, can
   be more powerful or efficacious, than to represent to us that rigid
   tribunal which no man will be able to escape. That each of us may be
   careful to discharge his duty earnestly, and keep himself strictly and
   modestly within his own limits, let us constantly make our minds
   familiar with the thought of that last and sudden coming of the Lord,
   the neglect of which leads the reprobate to indulge in wickedness.

   At the same time, Christ takes a passing glance at the ease with which
   insolence grows, when a man has once shaken off the bridle, and given
   himself up to sinning. For Christ does not represent to us a servant
   who is merely dissolute and worthless, but one who rises up in an
   outrageous manner to disturb the whole house, who wickedly abuses the
   power committed to him, exercises cruelty on his fellow-servants, and
   wastefully spends the property of his master, whom he treats with open
   ridicule. Lastly, to excite terror, he adds the punishment, which is of
   no ordinary degree; for severe punishment is due to such unbounded
   wickedness.

   Luke 12:47. But that servant. There is great weight in this
   circumstance, which is mentioned by Luke alone, that, in proportion as
   any man knowingly and willingly takes pleasure in despising the Lord,
   he deserves severer punishment. A comparison is made between the
   greater and the less to this effect: If punishment does not fail to be
   inflicted on a servant who errs through mistake, what shall become of
   the wicked and rebellious servant, who purposely, as it were, tramples
   under foot the authority of his master? It ought to be remembered,
   however, that those who are appointed to govern the Church do not err
   through ignorance, but basely and wickedly defraud their Master of his
   right.

   Yet we ought to gather from this passage a general doctrine, that it is
   in vain for men to betake themselves to the plea of ignorance, in order
   to be freed from condemnation. For if a mortal man claims the right of
   demanding from his servants that they shall inquire into his will, so
   that nothing may be done in his house in a heedless or confused manner;
   how much greater authority belongs to the Son of God, that they who
   serve him should be earnestly desirous to be informed about his
   injunctions, and not rush forward, at their own pleasure, to act in a
   state of uncertainty, but depend wholly on the intimations of his will;
   particularly when he has prescribed what we ought to do, and always
   gives us a gracious answer, when we ask his direction? It is certain,
   that our ignorance is always accompanied by gross and shameful
   negligence. We see, indeed, that it is in vain to resort to this
   subterfuge, that he who has gone wrong through ignorance is not in
   fault; for, on the contrary, the Heavenly Judge declares, that though
   such offenders are visited by lighter chastisement, yet they will not
   be altogether unpunished. And if even ignorance does not excuse men,
   how dreadful is the vengeance that awaits deliberate transgressors, who
   with outrageous violence provoke God, in opposition to the dictates of
   their conscience? The more abundant the instruction, therefore, which
   any man has received, so much the greater is the ground for punishment,
   if he be not obedient and submissive. Hence it appears how trifling and
   worthless is the excuse of those who, now rejecting the plain doctrine
   of the Gospel, endeavor to screen such obstinacy by the ignorance of
   their fathers; as if ignorance were an adequate shield to ward off the
   judgment of God. But granting that faults committed through mistake
   were pardoned, it would be highly unreasonable that the same favor
   should be extended to those who sin willfully, since with deliberate
   malice they rage against God.

   48. To whomsoever much hath been given. Christ shows by another
   circumstance, that the more highly favored disciples ought to be
   visited with severer punishment, if they despise their calling, and
   abandon themselves without reserve to every kind of licentiousness;
   because the more eminent a man is, he ought to consider that so much
   the more has been entrusted to him, and on the express condition that
   he shall one day render an account of it. In the same proportion,
   therefore, as any of us is endued with higher gifts, if he does not,
   like a field which has been cultivated at greater expense, yield to the
   Lord more abundant produce, the abuse of that grace which he has
   profaned, or uselessly withheld, will cost him dear.

   49. I am come to send fire on the earth. From these concluding words it
   may easily be inferred, that this was one of Christ's latest
   discourses, and is not related by Luke at the proper place. But the
   meaning is, that Christ has introduced into the world the utmost
   confusion, as if he had intended to mingle heaven and earth. The gospel
   is metaphorically compared to fire, because it violently changes the
   face of things. The disciples having falsely imagined that, while they
   were at ease and asleep, the kingdom of God would come, Christ
   declares, on the contrary, that there must first be a dreadful
   conflagration to kindle the world. And as some beginnings of it were
   even then making their appearance, Christ encourages the disciples by
   this very consideration, that they already feel the power of the
   gospel. "When great commotions," says he, "shall already begin to
   kindle, this is so far from being a reason why you should tremble, that
   it is rather a ground of strong confidence; and, for my own part, I
   rejoice that this fruit of my labors is visible." In like manner, all
   the ministers of the gospel ought to apply this to themselves, that,
   when there are troubles in the world, they may be more diligently
   employed in their duty. It is proper to observe, also, that the same
   fire of doctrine, when it burns on all sides, consumes chaff and straw,
   but purifies silver and gold.

   50. But I have a baptism to be baptized with. By these words our Lord
   asserts that there remains nothing but his last act, that by his death
   he may consecrate the renovation of the world. For since the shaking
   which he mentioned was appalling, and since that conflagration of the
   human race was terrific, he is about to show that the first-fruits must
   be offered in his own person, after which the disciples ought not to be
   displeased at feeling some portion of it. He compares death--as in
   other passages--to baptism, (Romans 6:4,) because the children of God,
   after having been immersed for a time by the death of the body, shortly
   afterwards rise again to life, so that death is nothing else than a
   passage through the midst of the waters. He says that he is sorely
   pressed till that baptism has been accomplished, that he may encourage
   every one of us, by his example, both to bear the cross and to prefer
   death. Not that any man can have a natural preference for death, or for
   any abatement of present happiness, but because, when we contemplate on
   the farther bank the glory, and the blessed and immortal rest of
   heaven, we not only suffer death with patience, but are even carried
   forward by eager desire where faith and hope lead us.

   MATTHEW 25:1-13

   Matthew 25:1-13

   1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who took their
   lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2. And five of them were
   foolish, and five were wise. 3. They that were foolish, while they took
   their lamps, took no oil with them: 4. But the wise took oil in their
   vessels along with their lamps. 5. And while the bridegroom tarried,
   they all slumbered and slept. 6. And at midnight a cry arose, Behold,
   the bridegroom cometh; go you out to meet him. 7. Then all those
   virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 8. And the foolish said to the
   wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. 9. But the wise
   answered, saying, By no means, lest there be not enough for you and for
   us; [170] but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
   10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were
   ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. 11. And
   afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
   12. But he answering said, Verily I tell you, I know you not.
   13. Watch, therefore, for you know not the day nor the hour in which
   the Son of man shall come.


   Though this exhortation -- as will appear from the conclusion of
   it--has nearly the same object with the former, yet it is properly
   added, in order to confirm believers in perseverance. Our Lord knew how
   strongly the nature of men is inclined to idleness, and how, for the
   most part, they not only grow weary after a great lapse of time, but
   give way through sudden dislike. To remedy this disease, he taught his
   disciples that they were not duly fortified, unless they had sufficient
   perseverance for a long period. When this is ascertained to be the
   design of the parable, we ought not to trouble ourselves much with
   minute investigations, which have nothing to do with what Christ
   intended. Some people give themselves a good deal of uneasiness about
   the lamps, the vessels, and the oil; but the plain and natural meaning
   of the whole is, that it is not enough to have ardent zeal for a short
   time, if we have not also a constancy that never tires. And Christ
   employs a very appropriate parable to express this. A little before, he
   had exhorted the disciples, that as they had a journey to perform
   through dark and dreary places, they should provide themselves with
   lamps; but as the wick of the lamp, if it be not supplied with oil,
   gradually dries up, and loses its brightness, Christ now says, that
   believers need to have incessant supplies of courage, to support the
   flame which is kindled in their hearts, otherwise their zeal will fail
   ere they have completed the journey.

   Matthew 25:1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven. By this term is meant
   the condition of the future Church, which was to be collected by the
   authority and direction of Christ. He employs this remarkable title,
   that believers may not deceive themselves by an erroneous opinion that
   they have arrived at absolute perfection. The parable is borrowed from
   the ordinary custom of life; for it was a childish speculation of
   Jerome and others, to adduce this passage in praise of virginity; while
   Christ had no other object in view than to lessen the uneasiness which
   they might be apt to feel in consequence of the delay of his coming. He
   says, therefore, that he asks nothing more from us than is usually done
   for friends at a marriage-feast. The custom was, that virgins, who are
   tender and delicate--should, by way of respect, accompany the
   bridegroom to his chamber. But the general instruction of the parable
   consists in this, that it is not enough to have been once ready and
   prepared for the discharge of duty, if we do not persevere to the end.

   2. Five were wise. Towards the close of the former chapter, our Lord
   specially required steward to be wise, (Matthew 24:45) for it is
   reasonable, that the heavier the charge which any man sustains, and the
   more important the matters in which he is employed, the wisdom with
   which he conducts himself should be the greater. But now he demands
   wisdom from all the children of God in general, that they may not,
   through inconsiderate rashness, expose themselves to be the prey of
   Satan. Now this kind of wisdom he describes by saying, that they are to
   provide themselves with the supplies necessary for completing the
   course of their life. For the warmth of our impatience makes us look
   upon the time, however short, as far too long protracted; and next, our
   poverty is such, that we need supplies for every hour.

   5. And while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. Some
   interpret this slumbering in a bad sense, as if believers, along with
   others, abandoned themselves to sloth, and were asleep amidst the
   vanities of the world; but this is altogether inconsistent with the
   intention of Christ, and with the structure of the parable. There would
   be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which
   overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that
   time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left
   the world and are sleeping in Christ. But I take it more simply as
   denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so
   long as they dwell in the body; and, though forgetfulness of the
   kingdom of God ought never to steal upon them, yet the distracting
   influence of the occupations of this world is not inappropriately
   compared to sleep. For they cannot be so constantly occupied with the
   thought of meeting Christ, as not to be distracted, or retarded, or
   entangled by a variety of cares, in consequence of which, while they
   watch, they are partly asleep.

   6. At midnight a cry arose. With respect to the cry I view it as taken
   metaphorically for his sudden arrival; for we know, that when any thing
   new and unexpected happens, men are wont to make a loud noise. True,
   indeed, our Lord cries daily, that he will come quickly, (Revelation
   22:20;) but at that, time, the whole frame of the world will resound
   with the cry, and his dreadful majesty will fill heaven and earth in
   such a manner, as not only to awaken those who are asleep, but to bring
   the dead out of their graves, (John 5:28.)

   8. And the foolish said to the wise. This is a reproof of the late
   repentance of those who never think of what they are in want of, till
   the door is shut against every remedy. For those who do not make
   provision for a long period are charged with folly, because they are
   careless, and flatter themselves amidst their poverty, and allow the
   season of mutual intercourse to pass in such a way as to despise the
   aids which were offered to them. As they do not, in proper time,
   bethink themselves about procuring oil, Christ, mocking the knowledge
   which they have acquired when it is too late, shows how their stupidity
   will be punished, when they shall see themselves to be empty and
   unprovided, while there is no remedy.

   9. Lest there be not enough for you and us. We know that the Lord
   distributes his gifts so variously to each, according to his measure,
   in order that they may give mutual aid to each other, and may employ
   for the general advantage what has been entrusted to each individual;
   and that in this way is preserved the sacred connection which exists
   among the members of the Church. But Christ here points out the time
   when he shall summon all men to his tribunal, each carrying his bundle,
   that he may bring with him according as he has done in his body. That
   portion of grace received, which every man has laid up for himself, is,
   therefore, justly compared to a stock of provisions for a journey,
   which would not be enough for a greater number of persons.

   But rather go to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. These words
   immediately follow, and are not intended as an admonition, but a
   reproof; and the meaning is: "There once was a time for buying, which
   you ought not to have neglected; for oil was at that time offered for
   sale, but the means of obtaining it are now withdrawn." And yet it is
   foolish in the Papists to infer from this, that by our own virtues or
   industry we obtain the gift of perseverance. For the word buy does not
   at all imply that a price has been given; as appears clearly from the
   passage in Isaiah, (55:1) where the Lord, while he invites us to buy,
   demands no price, but informs us, that he has wine and milk in
   abundance, to be gratuitously bestowed. There is no other way of
   obtaining it, therefore, but to receive by faith what is offered to us.

   10. And the door was shut. At length it follows that the door of the
   heavenly kingdom will be shut against all who have not made provision,
   because they failed in the middle of the course. We must not enter here
   into minute inquiries, how it is that Christ says that the foolish
   virgins went to buy for it means nothing else than that all who shall
   not be ready at the very moment when they shall be called will be shut
   out from entering into heaven.

   MATTHEW 25:31-46; LUKE 21:37-38

   Matthew 25:31-46

   Luke 21:37-38

   31. Now when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
   angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
   32. And all the nations shall be assembled before him; and he shall
   separate them from one another, as a shepherd separateth the sheep from
   the goats. 33. And he shall place the sheep on his right hand, and the
   goats on the left. 34. Then will the King say to those who shall be on
   his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
   prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35. For I was
   hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to
   drink; I was a stranger, and you received me kindly; 36. I was naked,
   and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison,
   and you came to me. 37. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying,
   Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave
   thee drink? 38. And when did e see thee a stranger, and received thee
   kindly? or naked, and clothed thee? 39. Or when did we see thee sick,
   or in prison, and came to thee? 40. And the King answering will say to
   them, Verily I tell you, So far as you did it to one of these my
   brethren, you did it to me. 41. Then will he say also to those who
   shall be on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting
   fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels: 42. For I was
   hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no
   drink. 43. I was a stranger, and you did not receive me kindly; I was
   naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick, and in prison, and you
   did not visit me. 44. Then will they also answer him, saying, Lord,
   when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or
   sick, or in prison, and did not assist thee? 45. Then will he answer
   them, saying, Verily I tell you, So far as you did it not to any of the
   least of these, you did it not to me. 46. And these shall go away into
   everlasting punishment, and the righteous into everlasting life. [171]

   37. And he taught in the temple by day; but at night he went out, and
   lodged in the mountain, which is called the mountain of Olives. 38. And
   early in the morning all the people came to him, to hear him in the
   temple.


   Matthew 25:31. Now when the Son of man shall come in his glory. Christ
   follows out the same doctrine, and what he formerly described under
   parables, he now explains clearly and without figures. The sum of what
   is said is, that believers, in order to encourage themselves to a holy
   and upright conduct, ought to contemplate with the eyes of faith the
   heavenly life, which, though it is now concealed, will at length be
   manifested at the last coming of Christ. For, when he declares that,
   when he shall come with the angels, then will he sit on the throne of
   his glory, he contrasts this last revelation with the disorders and
   agitations of earthly warfare; as if he had said, that he did not
   appear for the purpose of immediately setting up his kingdom, and
   therefore that there was need of hope and patience, lest the disciples
   might be discouraged by long delay. Hence we infer that this was again
   added, in order that the disciples, being freed from mistake about
   immediate and sudden happiness, might keep their minds in warfare till
   Christ's second coming, and might not give way, or be discouraged, on
   account of his absence.

   This is the reason why he says that he will then assume the title of
   King; for though he commenced his reign on the earth, and now sits at
   the right hand of the Father, so as to exercise the supreme government
   of heaven and earth; yet he has not yet erected before the eyes of men
   that throne, from which his divine majesty will be far more fully
   displayed than it now is at the last day; for that, of which we now
   obtain by faith nothing more than a taste, will then have its full
   effect. So then Christ now sits on his heavenly throne, as fir as it is
   necessary that he shall reign for restraining his enemies and
   protecting the Church; but then he will appear openly, to establish
   perfect order in heaven and earth, to crush his enemies under his feet,
   to assemble his believing people to partake of an everlasting and
   blessed life, to ascend his judgment-seat; and, in a word, there will
   be a visible manifestation of the reason why the kingdom was given to
   him by the Father. He says that he will come in his glory; because,
   while he dwelt in this world as a mortal man, he appeared in the
   despised form of a servant. And he calls it his glory, though he
   elsewhere ascribes it to his Father, but the meaning is the same; for
   he means simply the divine glory, which at that time shone in the
   Father only, for in himself it was concealed. [172]

   32. And all nations shall be assembled before him. He employs large and
   splendid titles for extolling his kingdom, that the disciples may learn
   to expect a different kind of happiness from what they had imagined.
   For they were satisfied with this single consideration, that their
   nation was delivered from the miseries with which it was then
   oppressed, so that it would be manifest that God had not in vain
   established his covenant with Abraham and his posterity. But Christ
   extends much farther the benefit of the redemption brought by him, for
   he will be the Judge of the whole world. Again, in order to persuade
   believers to holiness of life, he assures them that the good and the
   bad will not share alike; because he will bring with him the reward
   which is laid up for both. In short, he declares that his kingdom will
   be fully established, when the righteous shall have obtained a crown of
   glory, and when the wicked shall have received the reward which they
   deserved.

   As a shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats. When our Lord says
   that the separation of the sheep from the goats is delayed till that
   day, he means that the wicked are now mixed with the good and holy, so
   that they live together in the same flock of God. The comparison
   appears to be borrowed from Ezekiel 34:18, where the Lord complains of
   the fierceness of the goats, which attack with their horns the poor
   sheep, and destroy the pastures, and pollute the water; and where the
   Lord expressly declares that he will take vengeance. And therefore
   Christ's discourse amounts to this, that believers ought not to think
   their condition too hard, if they are now compelled to live with the
   goats, and even to sustain many serious attacks and annoyances from
   them; secondly, that they ought to beware of being themselves infected
   by the contagion of their vices; and, thirdly, to inform them that in a
   holy and innocent life their labor is not thrown away, for the
   difference will one day appear.

   34. Come, you blessed of my Father. We must remember Christ's design;
   for he bids his disciples rest satisfied now with hope, that they may
   with patience and tranquillity of mind look for the enjoyment of the
   heavenly kingdom; and next, he bids them strive earnestly, and not
   become wearied in the right course. To this latter clause he refers,
   when he promises the inheritance of the heavens to none but those who
   by good works aim at the prize of the heavenly calling. But before
   speaking of the reward of good works, he points out, in passing, that
   the commencement of salvation flows from a higher source; for by
   calling them blessed of the Father, he reminds them, that their
   salvation proceeded from the undeserved favor of God. Among the Hebrews
   the phrase blessed of God means one who is dear to God, or beloved by
   God. Besides, this form of expression was not only employed by
   believers to extol the grace of God towards men, but those who had
   degenerated from true godliness still held this principle. Enter, thou
   blessed of God, said Laban to Abraham's servant, (Genesis 24:31.) We
   see that nature suggested to them this expression, by which they
   ascribed to God the praise of all that they possessed. There can be no
   doubt, therefore, that Christ, in describing the salvation of the
   godly, begins with the undeserved love of God, by which those who,
   under the guidance of the Spirit in this life, aim at righteousness,
   were predestined to life.

   To this also relates what he says shortly afterwards, that the kingdom,
   to the possession of which they will be appointed at the last day, had
   been prepared for them from the beginning of the world. For though it
   may be easy to object, that the reward was laid up with a view to their
   future merits, any person who will candidly examine the words must
   acknowledge that there is an implied commendation of the grace of God.
   Nay more, Christ does not simply invite believers to possess the
   kingdom, as if they had obtained it by their merits, but expressly says
   that it is bestowed on them as heirs.

   Yet we must observe another object which our Lord had in view. For
   though the life of the godly be nothing else than a sad and wretched
   banishment, so that the earth scarcely bears them; though they groan
   under hard poverty, and reproaches, and other afflictions; yet, that
   they may with fortitude and cheerfulness surmount these obstacles, the
   Lord declares that a kingdom is elsewhere prepared for them. It is no
   slight persuasive to patience, when men are fully convinced that they
   do not run in vain; and therefore, lest our minds should be east, down
   by the pride of the ungodly, in which they give themselves unrestrained
   indulgences--lest our hope should even be weakened by our own
   afflictions, let us always remember the inheritance which awaits us in
   heaven; for it depends on no uncertain event, but was prepared for us
   by God before we were born,--prepared, I say, for each of the elect,
   for the persons here addressed by Christ are the blessed of the Father.

   When it is here said only that the kingdom was prepared from the
   beginning of the world, while it is said, in another passage, that it
   was prepared before the creation of heaven and of earth, (Ephesians
   1:4) this involves no inconsistency. For Christ does not here fix the
   precise time when the inheritance of eternal life was appointed for the
   sons of God, but only reminds us of God's fatherly care, with which he
   embraced us before we were born; and confirms the certainty of our hope
   by this consideration, that our life can sustain no injury from the
   commotions and agitations of the world.

   35. For I was hungry. If Christ were now speaking of the cause of our
   salvation, the Papists could not be blamed for inferring that we merit
   eternal life by good works; but as Christ had no other design than to
   exhort his people to holy and upright conduct, it is improper to
   conclude from his words what is the value of the merits of works. With
   regard to the stress which they lay on the word for, as if it pointed
   out the cause, it is a weak argument; for we know that, when eternal
   life is promised to the righteous, the word for does not always denote
   a cause, but rather the order of procedure. [173] But we have another
   reply to offer, which is still more clear; for we do not deny that a
   reward is promised to good works, but maintain that it is a reward of
   grace, because it depends on adoption. Paul boasts (2 Timothy 4:8) that
   a crown of righteousness is laid up for him; but whence did he derive
   that confidence but because he was a member of Christ, who alone is
   heir of the heavenly kingdom? He openly avows that the righteous Judge
   will give to him that crown; but whence did he obtain that prize but
   because by grace he was adopted, and received that justification of
   which we are all destitute? We must therefore hold these two
   principles, first, that believers are called to the possession of the
   kingdom of heaven, so far as relates to good works, not because they
   deserved them through the righteousness of works, or because their own
   minds prompted them to obtain that righteousness, but because God
   justifies those whom he previously elected, (Romans 8:30.) Secondly,
   although by the guidance of the Spirit they aim at the practice of
   righteousness, yet as they never fulfill the law of God, no reward is
   due to them, but the term reward is applied to that which is bestowed
   by grace.

   Christ does not here specify every thing that belongs to a pious and
   holy life, but only, by way of example, refers to some of the duties of
   charity, by which we give evidence that we fear God. For though the
   worship of God is more important than charity towards men, and though,
   in like manner, faith and supplication are more valuable than alms, yet
   Christ had good reasons for bringing forward those evidences of true
   righteousness which are more obvious. If a man were to take no thought
   about God, and were only to be beneficent towards men, such compassion
   would be of no avail to him for appeasing God, who had all the while
   been defrauded of his right. Accordingly, Christ does not make the
   chief part of righteousness to consist in alms, but, by means of what
   may be called more evident signs, shows what it is to live a holy and
   righteous life; as unquestionably believers not only profess with the
   mouth, but prove by actual performances, that they serve God.

   Most improperly, therefore, do fanatics, under the pretext of this
   passage, withdraw from hearing the word, and from observing the Holy
   Supper, and from other spiritual exercises; for with equal plausibility
   might they set aside faith, and bearing the cross, and prayer, and
   chastity. But nothing was farther from the design of Christ than to
   confine to a portion of the second table of the Law that rule of life
   which is contained in the two tables. The monks and other noisy talkers
   had as little reason to imagine that there are only six works of mercy,
   because Christ does not mention any more; as if it were not obvious,
   even to children, that he commends, by means of a synacdoche, all the
   duties of charity. For to comfort mourners, to relieve those who are
   unjustly oppressed, to aid simple-minded men by advice, to deliver
   wretched persons from the jaws of wolves, are deeds of mercy not less
   worthy of commendation than to clothe the naked or to feed the hungry.

   But while Christ, in recommending to us the exercise of charity, does
   not exclude those duties which belong to the worship of God, he reminds
   his disciples that it will be an authentic evidence of a holy life, if
   they practice charity, agreeably to those words of the prophet,

   I choose mercy, and not sacrifice, (Hosea 6:6;)

   the import of which is, that hypocrites, while they are avaricious, and
   cruel, and deceitful, and extortioners, and haughty, still counterfeit
   holiness by an imposing array of ceremonies. Hence also we infer, that
   if we desire to have our life approved by the Supreme Judge, we must
   not go astray after our own inventions, but must rather consider what
   it is that He chiefly requires from us. For all who shall depart from
   his commandments, though they toil and wear themselves out in works of
   their own contrivance, will hear it said to them at the last day, Who

   hath required those things at your hands? (Isaiah 1:12.)

   37. Then wilt the righteous answer him. Christ represents the righteous
   as doubting--what they know well--his willingness to form a just
   estimate of what is done to men. [174] But as this was not so deeply
   impressed on their minds as it ought to have been, he holds out to them
   this lively representation. [175] For how comes it that we are so slow
   and reluctant to acts of beneficence, but because that promise is not
   truly engraven on our hearts, that God will one day repay with usury
   what we bestow on the poor? The admiration which Christ here expresses
   is intended to instruct us to rise above the apprehension of our flesh,
   whenever afflicted brethren ask our confidence and aid, that the aspect
   of a despised man may not hinder us from treating him with kindness.

   40. Verily I tell you. As Christ has just now told us, by a figure,
   that our senses do not yet comprehend how highly he values deeds of
   charity, so now he openly declares, that he will reckon as done to
   himself whatever we have bestowed on his people. We must be
   prodigiously sluggish, if compassion be not drawn from our bowels by
   this statement, that Christ is either neglected or honored in the
   person of those who need our assistance. So then, whenever we are
   reluctant to assist the poor, let us place before our eyes the Son of
   God, to whom it would be base sacrilege to refuse any thing. By these
   words he likewise shows, that he acknowledges those acts of kindness
   which have been performed gratuitously, and without any expectation of
   a reward. And certainly, when he enjoins us to do good to the hungry
   and naked, to strangers and prisoners, from whom nothing can be
   expected in return, we must look to him, who freely lays himself under
   obligation to us, and allows us to place to his account what might
   otherwise appear to have been lost.

   So far as you have done it to one of the least of my brethren.
   Believers only are expressly recommended to our notice; not that he
   bids us altogether despise others, but because the more nearly a man
   approaches to God, he ought to be the more highly esteemed by us; for
   though there is a common tie that binds all the children of Adam, there
   is a still more sacred union among the children of God. So then, as
   those, who belong to the household of faith ought to be preferred to
   strangers, Christ makes special mention of them. And though his design
   was, to encourage those whose wealth and resources are abundant to
   relieve the poverty of brethren, yet it affords no ordinary consolation
   to the poor and distressed, that, though shame and contempt follow them
   in the eyes of the world, yet the Son of God holds them as dear as his
   own members. And certainly, by calling them brethren, he confers on
   them inestimable honor.

   41. Depart from me, you cursed. He now comes to the reprobate, who are
   so intoxicated by their fading prosperity, that they imagine they will
   always be happy. He threatens, therefore, that he will come as their
   Judge, and that he will make them forget those luxurious enjoyments to
   which they are now so entirely devoted; not that the coming of Christ
   will strike them with terror--for they think that they

   have made a covenant with death, (Isaiah 28:15,)

   and harden themselves in wicked indifference--but that believers,
   warned of their dreadful ruin, may not envy their present lot. For as
   promises are necessary for us, to excite and encourage us to holiness
   of life, so threatenings are likewise necessary to restrain us by
   anxiety and fear. We are therefore taught how desirable it is to be
   united to the Son of God; because everlasting destruction and the
   torment of the flesh await all those whom he will drive from his
   presence at the last day. He will then order the wicked to depart from
   him, because many hypocrites are now mixed with the righteous, as if
   they were closely allied to Christ.

   Into everlasting fire. We have stated formerly, that the term fire
   represents metaphorically that dreadful punishment which our senses are
   unable to comprehend. It is therefore unnecessary to enter into subtle
   inquiries, as the sophists do, into the materials or form of this fire;
   for there would be equally good reason to inquire about the worm, which
   Isaiah connects with the

   fire for their worm shall not die,
   either shall their fire be quenched, (Isaiah 66:24.)

   Besides, the same prophet shows plainly enough in another passage that
   the expression is metaphorical; for he compares the Spirit of God to a
   blast by which the fire is kindled, and adds a mixture of brimstone,
   (Isaiah 30:33.) Under these words, therefore, we ought to represent to
   our minds the future vengeance of God against the wicked, which, being
   more grievous than all earthly torments, ought rather to excite horror
   than a desire to know it. But we must observe the eternity of this
   fire, as well as of the glory which, a little before, was promised to
   believers.

   Which is prepared for the devil. Christ contrasts with himself the
   devil, as the head of all the reprobate. For though all the devils are
   apostate angels, yet many passages of Scripture assign thee highest
   authority to one who assembles under him, as in one body, all the
   wicked to perdition; in the same manner as believers assemble to life
   under Christ, and grow under him, till, having reached perfection, they
   are entirely united by him to God, (Ephesians 4:13; Colossians 2:19.)
   But now Christ says, that hell is prepared for the devil, that wicked
   men may not entertain the belief that they will be able to escape it,
   when they hear that they are involved in the same punishment with the
   devil, who, it is certain, was long ago sentenced and condemned to
   hell, without any hope of deliverance.

   And his angels. By the devil's angels some understand wicked men, but
   it is more probable that Christ speaks only of devils. And so these
   words convey an indirect reproach, that men, who had been called to the
   hope of salvation through the Gospel, chose to perish with Satan, and,
   rejecting the Author of salvation, voluntarily threw themselves into
   this wretched condition; not that they were not appointed to
   destruction as well as the devil, but because in their crime is plainly
   seen the cause of their destruction, when they reject the grace of
   their calling. And thus, though the reprobate were devoted to death, by
   a secret judgment of God, before they were born, yet, so long as life
   is offered to them, they are not reckoned heirs of death or companions
   of Satan, but their perdition, which had been formerly concealed, is
   discovered and made evident by their unbelief.

   44. Then shall they also answer him. The same kind of striking
   delineation which Christ had formerly employed is now repeated, in
   order to inform the reprobate, that their vain excuses, by which they
   now deceive themselves, will be of no avail to them at the last day.
   For whence comes the great cruelty of their pride towards the poor, but
   because they think that they will not be punished for despising them?
   To destroy this self-complacency, our Lord gives them warning, that
   they will one day feel--but when it will be too late--what they do not
   now deign to consider, that those who are now so greatly despised are
   not less esteemed by Christ than his own members.

   Matthew 26:1-13

   Mark 14:1-9

   Luke 22:1-2

   1. And it happened when Jesus had finished all these discourses, he
   said to his disciples, 2. You know that after two days is the passover;
   and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. 3. Then were assembled
   the chief priests, and scribes, and elders of the people, in the palace
   of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 4. And entered into
   consultation how they would take Jesus by stratagem, and kill him.
   5. But they said, Not during the festival, lest there be a commotion
   among the people. 6. And when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of
   Simon the leper, 7. A woman came to him, having ointment, and poured it
   on his head, while he sat at table. 8. And his disciples, when they saw
   it, were angry, saying, Why is this waste? 9. For this ointment might
   have been sold for a great price, and given to the poor. 10. But Jesus,
   knowing this, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? for she hath
   performed a good action towards me. 11. For you have the poor always
   with you, but me you have not always. [176] 12. For as to this ointment
   which this woman hath poured on my body, she did it to bury me.
   13. Verily I tell you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
   throughout the whole world, this also which she hath done will be told
   in remembrance of her.

   1. And after two days was the passover, and the feast of unleavened
   bread; and the chief priests and scribes sought how they would seize
   him by craft, and kill him. 2. But they said, Not during the festival,
   lest there be a commotion among the people. 3. And while he was in
   Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, while he sat at table, a
   woman came, having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard, very
   precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head. 4. And
   there were some who were angry within themselves, and said, Why is this
   waste of the ointment? 5. For this might have been sold for more than
   three hundred denarii, [177] and given to the poor. And they murmured
   against her. 6. But Jesus said, Let her alone: why do you trouble her?
   she hath performed a good action towards me. 7. For you have the poor
   always with you, and whenever you choose, you may do good to them; but
   me you have not always. [178] 8. She hath done what she could; she hath
   come beforehand, to anoint my body to the burying. 9. Verily I tell
   you, Wheresoever this gospel hath been preached throughout the whole
   world, this also which she hath done shall be told in remembrance of
   her.

   1. Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was
   at hand. 2. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might
   kill him; for they dreaded the people.


   Christ now confirms again what we have seen that he had sometimes
   predicted to his disciples; but this last prediction clearly shows how
   willingly he offered himself to die; and it was necessary that he
   should do so, because God could not be appeased but by a sacrifice of
   obedience. He intended, at the same time, to prevent the disciples from
   taking offense, lest they might be altogether discouraged by the
   thought that he was dragged to death by necessity. Two purposes were
   thus served by this statement: to testify, first, that the Son of God
   willingly surrendered himself to die, in order to reconcile the world
   to the Father, (for in no other way could the guilt of sins have been
   expiated, or righteousness obtained for us;) and, secondly, that he did
   not die like one oppressed by violence which he could not escape, but
   because he voluntarily offered himself to die. He therefore declares
   that he comes to Jerusalem with the express intention of suffering
   death there; for while he was at liberty to withdraw and to dwell in a
   safe retreat till that time was come, he knowingly and willfully comes
   forward at the exact time. And though it was of no advantage to the
   disciples to be informed, at that time, of the obedience which he was
   rendering to the Father, yet afterwards this doctrine tended in no
   small degree to the edification of their faith. In like manner, it is
   of singular utility to us at the present day, because we behold, as in
   a bright mirror, the voluntary sacrifice, by which all the
   transgressions of the world were blotted out, and, contemplating the
   Son of God advancing with cheerfulness and courage to death, we already
   behold him victorious over death.

   Matthew 26:3. Then were assembled the chief priests. Matthew does not
   mean that they assembled during the two days, but introduces this
   narrative to show, that Christ was not led by any opinion of man to fix
   the day of his death; for by what conjectures could he have been led to
   it, since his enemies themselves had resolved to delay for a time? The
   meaning therefore is, that by the spirit of prophecy he spoke of his
   own death, which no man could have suspected to be so near at hand.
   John explains the reason why the scribes and priests held this meeting:
   it was because, from day to day, the people flocked to Christ in
   greater multitudes, (John 11:48.) And at that time it was decided, at
   the instigation of Caiaphas, that he should be put to death, because
   they could not succeed against him in any other way.

   5. But they said, Not during the festival. They did not think it a fit
   season, till the festival was past, and the crowd was dispersed. Hence
   we infer that, although those hungry dogs eagerly opened their mouths
   to devour Christ, or rather, rushed furiously upon him, still God
   withheld them, by a secret restraint, from doing any thing by their
   deliberation or at their pleasure. So far as lies in their power, they
   delay till another time; but, contrary to their wish, God hastens the
   hour. And it is of great importance for us to hold, that Christ was not
   unexpectedly dragged to death by the violence of his enemies, but was
   led to it by the providence of God; for our confidence in the
   propitiation is founded on the conviction that he was offered to God as
   that sacrifice which God had appointed from the beginning. And
   therefore he determined that; his Son should be sacrificed on the very
   day of the passover, that the ancient figure might give place to the
   only sacrifice of eternal redemption. Those who had no other design in
   view than to ruin Christ thought that another time would be more
   appropriate; but God, who had appointed him to be a sacrifice for the
   expiation of sins, selected a suitable day for contrasting the body
   with its shadow, by placing them together. Hence also we obtain a
   brighter display of the fruit of Christ's suffering.

   6. And when Jesus was in Bethany. What the Evangelist now relates had
   happened a little before Christ came to Jerusalem, but is here
   introduced seasonably, in order to inform us what was the occasion that
   suddenly drove the priests to make haste. They did not venture to
   attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no
   easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they
   had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a
   different opinion. As to some slight diversity between John's narrative
   and that of Matthew and Mark, it is easy to remove the apparent
   inconsistency, which has led some commentators erroneously to imagine
   that it is a different narrative. John 12:3 expresses the name of the
   woman who anointed Christ, which is omitted by the other two
   Evangelists; but he does not mention the person who received Christ as
   a guest, while Matthew 26:6 and Mark 14:3 expressly state that he was
   then at supper in the house of Simon the leper. As to its being said by
   John that his feet were anointed, while the other two Evangelists say
   that she anointed his head, this involves no contradiction.
   Unquestionably we know that anointments were not poured on the feet;
   but as it was then poured in greater abundance than usual, John, by way
   of amplification, informs us that Christ's very feet were moistened
   with the oil. Mark too relates, that she broke the alabaster-box, and
   poured the whole of the ointment on his head; and it agrees very well
   with this to say that it flowed down to his feet. Let us therefore hold
   it to be a settled point, that all the three Evangelists relate the
   same narrative.

   8. And when the disciples saw it. This also is not unusual with the
   Evangelists, when a thing has been done by one, to attribute it to many
   persons, if they give their consent to it. John says that the murmur
   proceeded from Judas, who betrayed Christ, (John 12:4.) Matthew and
   Mark include all the disciples along with him. The reason is, that none
   of the others would ever have dared to murmur if the wicked slander of
   Judas had not served for a torch to kindle them. But when he began,
   under a plausible pretext, to condemn the expense as superfluous, all
   of them easily caught the contagion. And this example shows what danger
   arises from malignant and envenomed tongues; for even those who are
   naturally reasonable, and candid, and modest, if they do not exercise
   prudence and caution, are easily deceived by unfavorable speeches, and
   led to adopt false judgments. But if light and foolish credulity
   induced the disciples of Christ to take part with Judas, what shall
   become of us, if we are too easy in admitting murmurers, who are in the
   habit of carping wickedly at the best actions?

   We ought to draw from it another warning, not to pronounce rashly on a
   matter which is not sufficiently known. The disciples seize on what
   Judas said, and, as it has some show of plausibility, they are too
   harsh in forming a judgment. They ought, on the contrary, to have
   inquired more fully if the action deserved reproof; more especially
   when their Master was present, by whose decision it was their duty to
   abide. Let us know, therefore, that we act improperly, when we form our
   opinion without paying regard to the word of God; for, as Paul informs
   us,

   None of us liveth or dieth to himself, but all must stand before the
   judgment-seat of Christ, where we must give our account,
   (Romans 14:7, 10; 2 Corinthians 5:10.)

   And though there was a wide difference between Judas and the others --
   because he wickedly held out a plausible cloak for his theft, while the
   rest were actuated by foolish simplicity -- still we see how their
   imprudence withdrew them from Christ, and made them the companions of
   Judas.

   10. Why do you trouble the woman? It is wonderful that Christ, whose
   whole life was a rule and pattern of temperance and frugality, now
   approves of immoderate expense, which appears to have been closely
   allied to luxury and superfluous indulgence. But we must observe the
   kind of defense which he employs; for he does not maintain that the
   woman did right, in such a manner as if he wished that the same thing
   should be done every day, but maintains that what she had done in a
   single instance was agreeable to God, because it must have been done
   for a good reason. Though Christ had no desire for the use of the
   ointment, yet this anointing pleased him on account of the
   circumstances in which it happened. Hence we infer that certain
   extraordinary ways of acting are sometimes approved by God, and yet
   that it would be improper to make them an example. Nor have we any
   reason to doubt that Mary was led by a secret movement of the Spirit to
   anoint Christ; as it is certain that, whenever the saints were called
   to any extraordinary performance, they were led by an unusual movement,
   so as not to attempt any thing without the guidance and authority of
   God. There was no precept in existence enjoining on Mary this
   anointing, nor was it necessary that a law should be laid down for
   every single action; but as the heavenly calling is the only origin and
   principle of proper conduct, and as God rejects every thing which men
   undertake at their own suggestion, Mary was directed by the inspiration
   of the Spirit, so that this duty, which she performed to Christ, was
   founded on assured confidence.

   For she hath performed a good action towards me. By this reply, Christ
   not merely defended the cause of one woman, but likewise maintained the
   holy boasting of all who rest satisfied with having themselves and
   their works approved by God. It will often happen that not only
   censure, but open condemnation, is pronounced on godly men, who are
   convinced in their own consciences that what they do is agreeable to
   the command of God; and it is ascribed to pride, if they set at naught
   the false judgments of the world, and rest satisfied with being
   approved by God alone. Since this is a hard temptation, and since it is
   scarcely possible not to be shaken by the agreement of many people
   against us, even when they are in the wrong, we ought to hold this
   doctrine, that none will ever be courageous and steady in acting
   properly, unless they depend solely on the will of God. And therefore
   Christ settles here the distinction between what is good and evil by
   his own solitary decision: for by affirming that what the woman has
   done is a good action, when that action had been already condemned by
   the disciples, he represses by this word the rashness of men, who
   freely allow themselves to pronounce judgment.

   Relying on this testimony, let us learn to set little value on any
   reports concerning us that are spread abroad in the world, provided we
   know that what men condemn God approves. In this manner Isaiah, when
   oppressed by wicked calumnies, makes reference to God as his voucher,
   (Isaiah 50:7,) and Paul likewise appeals to the day of the Lord, (1
   Corinthians 4:3, 4.) Let us therefore learn to pay no deference to the
   opinions of men farther than that they may be edified by our example in
   obedience to God, and when the world rises against us with a loud
   noise, let us satisfy ourselves with this consolation, that what is
   reckoned bad on earth is pronounced to be good in heaven.

   11. For you have the poor always with you. Christ does not simply
   defend the anointing, so that we may imitate it, but assures us that it
   pleases God on some particular account. This must be carefully weighed,
   that we may not fall into the error of contriving expensive modes of
   worshipping God, as the Papists do; for, hearing it said that Christ
   was pleased with being anointed by Mary, they supposed that he took
   delight in incense, wax-tapers, splendid decorations, and pompous
   exhibitions of that nature. Hence arises the great display which is to
   be found in their ceremonies; and they do not believe that they will
   worship God in a proper manner, if they are not immoderate in expense.
   But Christ plainly makes this exception, that what he wished to be done
   once would not be agreeable to him in future. For by saying that the
   poor will always be in the world, he distinguishes between the ordinary
   service, which ought to be maintained among believers, and that
   extraordinary service, which ceased after his ascension to heaven.

   Do we wish to lay out our money properly on true sacrifices? Let us
   bestow it on the poor, for Christ says that he is not with us, to be
   served by outward display. True, indeed, we know and fed by the
   experience of faith, that he is present with us by power and spiritual
   grace; but he is not visibly with us, so as to receive from us earthly
   honors. How utterly mad, therefore, is the obstinacy of those who press
   upon him foolish expenses which he does not choose, and which he
   absolutely refuses! Again, when he says that the poor will always be
   with us, we infer from it, that if many are in poverty, this does not
   arise from accident, but that, by a fixed purpose, God presents to us
   those on whom our charity may be exercised. In short, this passage
   teaches us that, though the Lord commands us to dedicate to him
   ourselves and all our property, yet, with respect to himself, lie
   demands no worship but that which is spiritual, and which is attended
   by no expense, but rather desires us to bestow on the poor what
   superstition foolishly expends on the worship of God.

   12 She hath done it to bury me. By these words Christ confirms what we
   have said, that the precious ointment was not valued by him on account
   of its odor, but solely in reference to his burial. It was because he
   wished to testify by this symbol, that his grave would yield a sweet
   odor, as it breathed life and salvation through the whole world.
   Accordingly, we are told by John (12:7) that Christ praised Mary for
   having reserved that anointing till the day of his burial. But since
   the truth of this figure has been made fully apparent, and since
   Christ, in departing from the sepulcher, perfumed not one house, but
   the whole world, by the quickening odor of his death, it would be
   childish to repeat an action for which no reason and no advantage could
   be assigned.

   13. Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached. He says that this action
   will do honor to Mary, because it will be praised by the doctrine of
   the gospel. Hence we infer, that we ought to estimate our works not by
   the opinion of men, but by the testimony of the word of God. When he
   says that she will be held in honorable remembrance throughout the
   whole world, by this comparison he indirectly censures his disciples;
   for among strangers, and in distant parts of the world, all nations,
   with one consent, will applaud this action, which the members of his
   own household condemned with such bitterness. Christ gently reproves
   the disciples also, for not entertaining sufficiently honorable views
   of his future reign; but at the same time, by this expression he bears
   testimony to the calling of the Gentiles, on which our salvation is
   founded. In what sense the gospel must be preached throughout the whole
   world, we have explained under Matthew 24:14

   14. Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the
   chief priests, 15. And said to them, What will you give me, and I will
   deliver him to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.
   16. And from that time he sought an opportunity to betray him. 17. Now
   on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus,
   saying to him, Where dost thou wish us to prepare for you to eat the
   passover? 18. And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to
   him, The Master saith, My time is near; I keep the passover at thy
   house with my disciples. 19. And the disciples did as Jesus commanded
   them, and prepared the passover. [179] 20. And when the evening was
   come, he sat down at table with the twelve.

   10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests,
   to betray him to them. 11. And when they heard it, they were glad, and
   promised that they would give him money; and he sought how he might
   betray him at a convenient time. 12. And on the first day of unleavened
   bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say to him,
   Where dost thou wish us to go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the
   passover? 13. And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them,
   Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher full of
   water: follow him. 14. And wherever he shall enter, say to the master
   of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may
   eat the passover with my disciples? 15. And he will show you a large
   room furnished; there make ready for us. 16. And his disciples went
   away, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them, and
   made ready the passover. 17. And when the evening was come, he arrived
   with the twelve.

   3. But Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.
   4. And he went away, and talked with the chief priests and magistrates,
   how he would betray him to them. 5. And they were glad, and agreed that
   they would give him money. 6. And he promised, and sought an
   opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.
   7. And the day of unleavened bread came, when the passover must be
   sacrificed. 8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for
   us the passover, that we may eat. 9. And they said to him, Where dost
   thou wish us to prepare? 10. And he said to them, Lo, when you are
   going into the city, you will meet a man carrying an earthen pitcher of
   water; follow him into the house which he shall enter. 11. And you
   shall say to the master of the house, The Master saith, Where is the
   guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples? 12. And
   he will show you a large room furnished; there make ready. 13. And they
   went, and found as he had said to them, and made ready the passover.
   14. And when the hour was come, he sat down at table, and the twelve
   apostles with him.


   Matthew 26:14. Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot.
   Christ's admonition was so far from being of any avail for softening
   the heart of Judas, or producing any change in it for the better, that
   he immediately went away, without any concern, to transact an infamous
   bargain with his enemies. It was amazing and prodigious stupidity, that
   he considered himself to have found, in the expense of the ointment, a
   fair excuse for so heinous a crime; and next, that, after having been
   warned by the words of Christ, he did not perceive what he was doing.
   [180] The bare mention of the burying ought to have softened a heart of
   iron; for it would have been easy to infer from it, that Christ offered
   himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of the human race. But we see
   in this mirror how great is the blindness of wicked desires, and how
   powerfully they fascinate the mind. Judas was inflamed with the desire
   to steal; long practice had hardened him in wickedness; and now when he
   meets with no other prey, he does not scruple to betray basely to death
   the Son of God, the Author of life, and, though restrained by a holy
   admonition, rushes violently forward.

   With good reason, therefore, does Luke expressly say that Satan entered
   into him; not that the Spirit of God formerly directed him, for he
   would not have been addicted to theft and robbery, if he had not been
   the slave of Satan. But Luke means, that he was at that time wholly
   given up to Satan, so that, like a desperate man, he violently sought
   his destruction. For though Satan drives us every day to crimes, and
   reigns in us, when he hurries us into a course of extraordinary
   wickedness; yet he is said to enter into the reprobate, when he takes
   possession of all their senses, overthrows the fear of God,
   extinguishes the light of reason, and destroys every feeling of shame.
   This extremity of vengeance God does not execute on any but those who
   are already devoted to destruction. Let us therefore learn to repent
   early, lest our long-continued harshness should confirm the reign of
   Satan within us; for as soon as we have been abandoned to this tyranny,
   his rage will have no bounds. It is particularly worthy of notice, that
   the cause and source of so great blindness in Judas was avarice, which
   makes it evident that it is justly denominated by Paul the root of all
   evils, (1 Timothy 6:10.) To inquire here whether or not Satan entered
   into Judas bodily is an idle speculation. We ought rather to consider
   how fearfully monstrous it is, that men formed after the image of God,
   and appointed to be temples for the Holy Spirit, should not only be
   turned into filthy stables or sinks, but should become the wretched
   abodes of Satan.

   17. Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to
   Jesus. It is first inquired, Why does the day which preceded the
   sacrificing of the lamb receive the name of the day of unleavened
   bread? For the Law did not forbid the use of leaven till the lamb was
   eaten, (Exodus 12:18.) But this difficulty may be speedily removed, for
   the phrase refers to the following day, as is sufficiently evident from
   Mark and Luke. Since, therefore, the day of killing and eating the
   passover was at hand, the disciples ask Christ where he wishes them to
   eat the passover.

   But hence arises a more difficult question. How did Christ observe that
   ceremony on the day before the whole nation celebrated the public
   passover? For John plainly affirms that the day on which Christ was
   crucified was, among the Jews, the preparation, not of the Sabbath, but
   of the passover, (John 19:14;) and that

   they did not enter into the hall of judgment, lest they should be
   defiled, because next day they were to eat the passover,
   (John 18:28.)

   I am aware that there are some who resort to evasions, which do not,
   however, give them any relief; for no sophistry can set aside the fact;
   that, on the day they crucified Christ, they did not keep the feast,
   (when it would not have been lawful to have any public executions) and
   that they had, at that the a solemn preparation, so that they ate the
   passover after that Christ had been buried.

   It comes now to be inquired, Why did Christ anticipate? For it must not
   be supposed that, in this ceremony, he took any liberty which was at
   variance with the prescriptions of the Law. As to the notion
   entertained by some, that the Jews, through their eagerness to put
   Christ to death, delayed the passover, it is ably refuted by Bucer,
   and, indeed, falls to the ground by its own absurdity. I have no doubt,
   therefore, that Christ observed the day appointed by the Law, and that
   the Jews followed a custom which had been long in use. First, it is
   beyond a doubt that Christ was put to death on the day before the
   Sabbath; for he was hastily buried before sunset in a sepulcher which
   was at hand, (John 19:42,) because it was necessary to abstain from
   work after the commencement of the evening. Now it is universally
   admitted that, by an ancient custom, when the passover and other
   festivals happened on Friday, they were delayed till the following day,
   because the people would have reckoned it hard to abstain from work on
   two successive days. The Jews maintain that this law was laid down
   immediately after the return of the people from the Babylonish
   captivity, and that it was done by a revelation from heaven, that they
   may not be thought to have made any change, of their own accord, in the
   commandments of God.

   Now if it was the custom, at that time, to join two festivals in one,
   (as the Jews themselves admit, and as their ancient writings prove,) it
   is a highly probable conjecture that Christ, who celebrated the
   passover on the day before the Sabbath, observed the day prescribed by
   the Law; for we know how careful he was not to depart from a single
   iota of the Law. Having determined to be subject to the Law, that he
   might deliver us from its yoke, he did not forget this subjection at
   his latest hour; and therefore he would rather have chosen to omit an
   outward ceremony, than to transgress the ordinance which God had
   appointed, and thus lay himself open to the slanders of wicked men.
   Even the Jews themselves unquestionably will not deny that, whenever
   the Sabbath immediately followed the passover, it was on one day,
   instead of both, that they abstained from work, and that this was
   enjoined by the Rabbins. Hence it follows that Christ, in departing
   from the ordinary custom, attempted nothing contrary to the Law.

   18. Go into the city to such a man. Matthew specifies a certain man;
   the other two Evangelists relate that the disciples were sent as to an
   unknown individual, because a sign was given to them of a man carrying
   a pitcher of water. But this difference is easily reconciled; for
   Matthew passing by the miracle, describes that man who was then unknown
   to the disciples; for it cannot be doubted that, when they came to the
   house, they found that it was one of their acquaintances. Christ
   enjoins him authoritatively to make ready a lodging for himself and his
   disciples, calling him master; and the man immediately complies But
   though he might have expressly pointed out the man by name, he chose
   rather to direct his disciples to him by a miracle, that, when they
   shortly afterwards saw him reduced to a state of weakness, their faith
   might remain firm, being supported by this evidence. It was no slight
   confirmation that, a few hours before he was put to death, he had given
   an undoubted proof that he was God, that they might know that he was
   not constrained by necessity, but yielded of his own accord. And though
   at the very time when the weariness occurred, this was perhaps of no
   advantage to them, yet the recollection of it was afterwards useful; as
   even in the present day, in order to rise above the offense of the
   cross, it is of great importance to us to know that, along with the
   weakness of the flesh, the glory of divinity appeared in Christ about
   the very time of his death.

   My time is near. Though he celebrated the passover correctly according
   to the injunction of the Law, yet he appears to assign this reason for
   the express purpose of avoiding the blame of self-will. He says,
   therefore, that there are reasons why he must make haste, and not
   comply with a received custom, because he is called to a greater
   sacrifice. And yet, as we have said, he introduces no change in the
   ceremony, but repeats once and again, that the time of his death is
   near, in order to inform them that he hastens cheerfully to do what the
   Father had appointed. And as to his connecting the figure of the
   sacrifice with the reality, in this way he exhorted believers to
   compare with the ancient figures what he accomplished in reality. This
   comparison is highly fitted to illustrate the power and efficacy of his
   death; for the passover was enjoined on the Jews, not merely to remind
   them of an ancient deliverance, but also that they might expect future
   and more excellent deliverance from Christ. Such is the import of what
   Paul says, that

   Christ our passover is sacrificed for us, (1 Corinthians 5:7.)

   19. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them. The readiness
   with which the disciples comply ought to be observed as a proof of
   their holy submission; for a doubt might naturally arise, when in
   search of an unknown man, whether they would obtain from the master of
   the house what they asked by their Master's command, while they were
   aware that everywhere he was not only despised but even hated. Yet they
   make no anxious inquiry about the result, but peaceably obey the
   injunction. And if we are desirous to have our faith approved, we ought
   to abide by this rule, to be satisfied with the command alone and go
   forward wherever God commands, and, expecting the success which he
   promises, not to indulge in excessive anxiety.

   20. When the evening was come, he sat down at table. Not to eat the
   passover, which they were bound to do standing, as travelers, when they
   are in haste, are wont to take food hastily,

   with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hand,
   (Exodus 12:11;)

   but I consider the meaning to be, that after having observed the solemn
   rite, he sat down at table to supper. Accordingly, the Evangelists say,
   when the evening was come: for, at the commencement of the evening,
   they killed the lamb, and ate the flesh of it roasted.

   21. And while they were eating, he said, Verily I tell you, That one of
   you will betray me. 22. And they became exceedingly sorrowful, and
   began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I? 23. But he
   answering said, He who hath dipped his hand with me in the dish will
   betray me. 24. The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him;
   but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have
   been good for that man if he had not been born. 25. And Judas, who
   betrayed him, answering, said, Rabbi is it I? [181] He said to him,
   Thou hast said it.

   18. And while they were sitting at table and eating, Jesus said, Verily
   I tell you, [182] One of you that eateth with me will betray me.
   19. And they began to be sorrowful, and every one of them to say to
   him, Is it I? And another said, Is it I? 20. And he answering said to
   them, It is one of the twelve, who dippeth with me in the dish. 21. The
   Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him; but woe to that man
   by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he
   had not been born.

   15. And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this
   passover with you before I suffer. 16. For I tell you, henceforth I
   will not eat of it anymore, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of
   God. (And a little after.) 21. But yet, lo, the hand of him that
   betrayeth me is with me at the table. 22. And the Son of man indeed
   goeth, according to what hath been determined; but woe to that man by
   whom he is betrayed! 23. And they began to inquire among themselves,
   [183] which of them it was that would do this.


   Matthew 26:21. One of you will betray me. To render the treachery of
   Judas more detestable, he points out the aggravated baseness of it by
   this circumstance, that he was meditating the act of betraying him
   while he sat with him at the holy table. For if a stranger had done
   this, it would have been more easily endured; but that one of his
   intimate friends should form such a design, and -- what is more --
   that, after having entered into an infamous bargain, he should be
   present at the sacred banquet, was incredibly monstrous. And therefore
   Luke employs a connecting particle which marks a contrast: but yet,
   (plen) lo, the hand of him that betrayeth me. And though Luke adds this
   saying of Christ after the supper was finished, we cannot obtain from
   it any certainty as to the order of time, which, we know, was often
   disregarded by the Evangelists. Yet I do not deny that it is probable
   that Judas was present, when Christ distributed to his disciples the
   symbols of his flesh and blood.

   22. They began every one of them to say to him. I do not think that the
   disciples were alarmed, as persons struck with terror are wont to give
   themselves uneasiness without any reason; but, abhorring the crime,
   they are desirous to clear themselves from the suspicion of it. It is,
   indeed, a mark of reverence, that when indirectly blamed, they do not
   reply angrily to their Master, but each person constitutes himself his
   own judge, (as the object which we ought chiefly to aim at is, to be
   acquitted by his own mouth;) but, relying on a good conscience, they
   wish to declare frankly how far they are from meditating such a crime.

   23. But he answering said. Christ, by his reply, neither removes their
   doubt, nor points out the person of Judas, but only confirms what he
   said a little before, that one of his friends sitting at the table is
   the traitor. And though they thought it hard to be left in suspense and
   perplexity for a time, that they might employ themselves in
   contemplating the atrocity of the crime, it was afterwards followed by
   another advantage, when they perceived that the prediction of the psalm
   was fulfilled,

   He that ate pleasant food with me [184]
   hath lifted up his heel against me, (Psalm 41:10.)

   Besides, in the person of Judas, our Lord intended to admonish his
   followers in all ages, not to be discouraged or faint on account of
   intimate friends proving to be traitors; because the same thing that
   was experienced by Him who is the Head of the whole Church, must happen
   to us who are members of it.

   24. The Son of man indeed goeth. Here Christ meets an offense, which
   might otherwise have greatly shaken pious minds. For what could be more
   unreasonable than that the Son of God should be infamously betrayed by
   a disciple, and abandoned to the rage of enemies, in order to be
   dragged to an ignominious death? But Christ declares that all this
   takes place only by the will of God; and he proves this decree by the
   testimony of Scripture, because God formerly revealed, by the mouth of
   his Prophet, what he had determined.

   We now perceive what is intended by the words of Christ. It was, that
   the disciples, knowing that what was done was regulated by the
   providence of God, might not imagine that his life or death was
   determined by chance. But the usefulness of this doctrine extends much
   farther; for never are we fully confirmed in the result of the death of
   Christ, till we are convinced that he was not accidentally dragged by
   men to the cross, but that the sacrifice had been appointed by an
   eternal decree of God for expiating the sins of the world. For whence
   do we obtain reconciliation, but because Christ has appeased the Father
   by his obedience? Wherefore let us always place before our minds the
   providence of God, which Judas himself, and all wicked men -- though it
   is contrary to their wish, and though they have another end in view --
   are compelled to obey. Let us always hold this to be a fixed principle,
   that Christ suffered, because it pleased God to have such an expiation.

   And yet Christ does not affirm that Judas was freed from blame, on the
   ground that he did nothing but what God had appointed. For though God,
   by his righteous judgment, appointed for the price of our redemption
   the death of his Son, yet nevertheless, Judas, in betraying Christ,
   brought upon himself righteous condemnation, because he was full of
   treachery and avarice. In short, God's determination that the world
   should be redeemed, does not at all interfere with Judas being a wicked
   traitor. Hence we perceive, that though men can do nothing but what God
   has appointed, still this does not free them from condemnation, when
   they are led by a wicked desire to sin. For though God directs them, by
   an unseen bridle, to an end which is unknown to them, nothing is
   farther from their intention than to obey his decrees. Those two
   principles, no doubt, appear to human reason Lo be inconsistent with
   each other, that God regulates the affairs of men by his Providence in
   such a manner, that nothing is done but by his will and command, and
   yet he damns the reprobate, by whom he has carried into execution what
   he intended. But we see how Christ, in this passage, reconciles both,
   by pronouncing a curse on Judas, though what he contrived against God
   had been appointed by God; not that Judas's act of betraying ought
   strictly to be called the work of God, but because God turned the
   treachery of Judas so as to accomplish His own purpose.

   I am aware of the manner in which some commentators endeavor to avoid
   this rock. They acknowledge that what had been written was accomplished
   through the agency of Judas, because God testified by predictions what
   He fore-knew. By way of softening the doctrine, which appears to them
   to be somewhat harsh, they substitute the foreknowledge of God in place
   of the decree, as if God merely beheld from a distance future events,
   and did not arrange them according to his pleasure. But very
   differently does the Spirit settle this question; for not only does he
   assign as the reason why Christ was delivered up, that it was so
   written, but also that it was so determined. For where Matthew and Mark
   quote Scripture, Luke leads us direct to the heavenly decree, saying,
   according to what was determined; as also in the Acts of the Apostles,
   he shows that Christ was delivered not only by the foreknowledge, but
   likewise by the fixed purpose of God, (Acts 2:25) and a little
   afterwards, that Herod and Pilate, with other wicked men,

   did those things which had been fore-ordained by the hand and purpose
   of God, (Acts 4:27, 28.)

   Hence it is evident that it is but an ignorant subterfuge which is
   employed by those who betake themselves to bare foreknowledge.

   It had been good for that man. By this expression we are taught what a
   dreadful vengeance awaits the wicked, for whom it would have been
   better that they had never been born. And yet this life, though
   transitory, and full of innumerable distresses, is an invaluable gift
   of God. Again, we also infer from it, how detestable is their
   wickedness, which not only extinguishes the precious gifts of God, and
   turns them to their destruction, but makes it to have been better for
   them that they had never tasted the goodness of God. But this phrase is
   worthy of observation, it would have been good for that man if he had
   never been born; for though the condition of Judas was wretched, yet to
   have created hint was good in God, who, appointing the reprobate to the
   day of destruction, illustrates also in this way his own glory, as
   Solomon tells us:

   The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea,
   even the wicked for the day of evil, (Proverbs 16:4.)

   The secret government of God, which provides even the schemes and works
   of men, is thus vindicated, as I lately noticed, from all blame and
   suspicion.

   25. And Judas who betrayed him. Though we often see persons trembling,
   who are conscious of doing wrong, yet along with dread and secret
   torments there is mingled such stupidity, that they boldly make a fiat
   denial; but in the end they gain nothing by their impudence but to
   expose their hidden wickedness. Thus Judas, while he is restrained by
   an evil conscience, cannot remain silent; so dreadfully is he
   tormented, and, at the same time, overwhelmed with fear and anxiety, by
   that internal executioner. Christ, by indirectly glancing, in his
   reply, at the foolish rashness of Judas, entreats him to consider the
   crime which he wished to conceal; but his mind, already seized with
   diabolical rage, could not admit such a sentiment. Let us learn from
   this example, that the wicked, by bold apologies, do nothing more than
   draw down upon themselves a more sudden judgment.

   had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is
   shed for you.


   As Luke mentions that the cup was twice presented by Christ, we must
   inquire, in the first place, if it be a repetition, (as the Evangelists
   are wont frequently to say the same thing twice,) or if Christ, after
   having tasted the cup, repeated the same thing a second time. This
   latter conjecture appears to me to be probable; for we know that the
   holy fathers, during sacrifices, observed the solemn rite of tasting
   the cup; [188] and hence those words of the Psalmist,

   I will take the cup of salvation,
   and will call on the name of the Lord, (Psalm 116:13.)

   I have no doubt, therefore, that Christ, according to the ancient
   custom, tasted the cup in the holy feast, which otherwise could not
   have been correctly observed; and Luke expressly mentions this, before
   coming to give an account of the new mystery, which was a totally
   different institution from the paschal lamb. It was in compliance also
   with received and ordinary custom, that he is expressly said to have
   given thanks, after having taken the cup. For at the commencement of
   the supper, I have no doubt, he prayed, as he was accustomed never to
   sit down at table without calling on God; but now he wished to
   discharge once more the same duty, that he might not leave out a
   ceremony which, I have just now shown, was connected with the sacred
   act of taking the cup and tasting it. [189]

   Matthew 26:26. And while they were eating, Jesus took bread. I do not
   understand these words to mean that with the paschal supper was mixed
   this new and more excellent supper, but rather that an end was then put
   to the former banquet. This is still more clearly expressed by Luke,
   when he says that, Christ gave the cup after that he had supped; for it
   would have been absurd that one and the same mystery should be broken
   off by an interval of time. And therefore I have no doubt that, in
   immediate succession, after having distributed the bread, he added the
   cup; and what Luke relates particularly respecting the cup, I regard as
   including also the bread. While they were eating, therefore, Christ
   took bread, to invite them to partake of a new supper. [190] The
   thanksgiving was a sort of preparation and transition to consider the
   mystery. Thus when the supper was ended, they tasted the sacred bread
   and wine; because Christ had previously aroused them from their
   indifference, that they might be all alive to so lofty a mystery. And,
   indeed, the nature of the case demands that this clear testimony of the
   spiritual life should be distinguished from the ancient shadow.

   Jesus took bread. It is uncertain if the custom which is now observed
   among the Jews was at that time in use: for the master of the house
   breaks off a portion of a common loaf, hides it under the table-cloth,
   and afterwards distributes a part of it to, each member of the family.
   But as this is a human tradition not founded on any commandment of God,
   we need not toil with excessive eagerness to investigate its origin;
   and it is possible that it may have been afterwards contrived, by a
   trick of Satan, for the purpose of obscuring the mystery of the Lord's
   Supper. And even if this ceremony was at that time in use among the
   Jews, Christ followed the ordinary custom in such a manner as to draw
   away the minds of his followers to another object, by changing the use
   of the bread for a different purpose. This, at least, ought to be
   considered as beyond all controversy, that Christ, at this time,
   abolished the figures of the Law, and instituted a new Sacrament.

   When he had given thanks. Matthew and Mark employ the word eulogesas
   [191] (having blessed;) but as Luke employs, instead of it, the word
   eucharistesas (having given thanks,) there can be no doubt as to the
   meaning; and as they afterwards use the word thanksgiving in reference
   to the cup, they expound with sufficient clearness the former term. So
   much the more ridiculous is the ignorance of the Papists, who express
   the blessing by the sign of the cross, as if Christ had practiced some
   kind of exorcising. But we must recollect what I lately noticed, that
   this thanksgiving is connected with a spiritual mystery. While it is
   true that believers are commanded to give thanks to God, because he
   supports them in this fading life, Christ did not merely refer to
   ordinary eating, but directed his view to the holy action, in order to
   thank God for the eternal salvation of the human race. For if the food
   which descends into the belly ought to persuade and arouse us to praise
   the fatherly kindness of God, how much more powerfully does it excite
   and even inflame, us to this act of piety, when he feeds our souls
   spiritually?

   Take, eat. That I may not be too tedious, I shall only explain briefly
   what is the nature of our Lord's institution, and what it contains;
   and, next, what is its end and us so far as it may be learned from the
   Evangelists. And, first of all, it strikes us, that Christ instituted a
   supper, which the disciples partake in company with each other. Hence
   it follows, that it is a diabolical invention, that a man, separating
   himself from the rest of the company, eats his supper apart. For what
   two things could be more inconsistent than that the bread should be
   distributed among them all, and that a single individual should swallow
   it alone? Although then the Papists boast, that in their masses they
   have the substance of the Lord's Supper, yet it is evident from the
   nature of the case, that whenever they celebrate private masses, they
   are so many trophies erected by the devil for burying the Lord's
   Supper.

   The same words teach us what sort of sacrifice it is that Christ
   recommends to us in the Supper. He bids his disciples take; and
   therefore it is himself alone that offers. What the Papists contrive,
   as to Christ's offering himself in the Supper, proceeded from an
   opposite author. And certainly it is a strange inversion, (anastrophe,)
   when a mortal man, who is commanded to take the body of Christ, claims
   the office of offering it; and thus a priest, who has been appointed by
   himself, sacrifices to God his own Son. I do not at present inquire
   with how many acts of sacrilege their pretended offering abounds. It is
   sufficient for my purpose, that it is so far from approaching to
   Christ's institution, that it is directly opposed to it.

   This is my body. As to the opinion entertained by some, that by those
   words the bread was consecrated, so as to become the symbol of the
   flesh of Christ, I do not find fault with it, provided that the word
   consecrated be understood aright, and in a proper sense. So then, the
   bread, which had been appointed for the nourishment of the body, is
   chosen and sanctified by Christ to a different use, so as to begin to
   be spiritual food. And this is the conversion [192] which is spoken of
   by the ancient doctors [193] of the Church. But we must at the same
   time hold, that bread is not consecrated by whispering and breathing,
   but by the clear doctrine of faith. And certainly it is a piece of
   magic and sorcery, when the consecration is addressed to the dead
   element; for the bread is made not to itself, but to us, a symbol of
   the body of Christ. In short, consecration is nothing else than a
   solemn testimony, by which the Lord appoints to us for a spiritual use
   an earthly and corruptible sign; which cannot take place, unless his
   command and promise are distinctly heard for the edification of faith;
   from which again it is evident, that the low whispering and breathing
   of the Papists are a wicked profanation of the mystery. Now if Christ
   consecrates the bread, when he declares to us that it is his body, we
   must not suppose that there is any change of the substance, but must
   only believe that it is applied to a new purpose. And if the world had
   not been long ago so bewitched by the subtlety of the devil, that, when
   the monster of transubstantiation had once been introduced, it will not
   now admit any light of true interpretation on these words, it would be
   superfluous to spend any more time in investigating their meaning.

   Christ declares that the bread is his body. These words relate to a
   sacrament; and it must be acknowledged, that a sacrament consists of a
   visible sign, with which is connected the thing signified, which is the
   reality of it. It must be well known, on the other hand, that the name
   of the thing signified is transferred to the sign; and therefore, no
   person who is tolerably well acquainted with Scripture will deny that a
   sacramental mode of expression ought to be taken metonymically. [194] I
   pass by general figures, which occur frequently in Scripture, and only
   say this: whenever an outward sign is said to be that which it
   represents, it is universally agreed to be an instance of metonymy. If
   baptism be called the laver of regeneration, (Titus in. 5;) if the
   rock, from which water flowed to the Fathers in the wilderness, be
   called Christ, (1 Corinthians 10:4;) if a dove be called the Holy
   Spirit, (John 1:32;) no man will question but the signs receive the
   name of the things which they represent. How comes it, then, that
   persons who profess to entertain a veneration for the words of the Lord
   will not permit us to apply to the Lord's Supper what is common to all
   the sacraments?

   They are delighted with the plain and literal sense. Why then shall not
   the same rule apply to all the sacraments? Certainly, if they do not
   admit that the Rock was actually Christ, the calumny with which they
   load us is mere affectation. If we explain that the bread is called his
   body, because it is the symbol of his body, they allege that the whole
   doctrine of Scripture is overturned. For this principle of language has
   not been recently forged by us, but has been handed down by Augustine
   on the authority of the ancients, and embraced by all, that the names
   of spiritual things are improperly ascribed to signs, and that all the
   passages of Scripture, in which the sacraments are mentioned, ought to
   be explained in this manner. When we bring forward a principle which
   has been universally admitted, what purpose does it serve to raise a
   loud clamor, as if it were something new and strange? But let obstinate
   people cry out as they please, all men of sound judgment and modesty
   will admit, that in these words of Christ there is a sacramental form
   of expression. Hence it follows, that the bread is called his body,
   because it is a symbol of the body of Christ.

   Now there are two classes of men that rise up against us. The Papists,
   deceived by their transubstantiation, maintain that what we see is not
   bread, because it is only the appearance that remains without the
   reality. But their absurd fancy is refuted by Paul, who asserts that

   the bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ,
   (1 Corinthians 10:16.)

   Besides, their notion is at variance with the very nature of a
   sacrament, which will not possess all that is essential to it, if there
   be not a true outward symbol. For whence shall we learn that our souls
   feed on the flesh of Christ, if what is placed before our eyes be not
   bread, but an empty form? Besides, what will they say about the other
   symbol? For Christ does not say, This is my blood, but, this cup is the
   new testament in my blood. According to their view, therefore, not only
   the wine, but also the materials of which the cup is composed, must be
   transubstantiated into blood. Again, the words related by Matthew -- I
   will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine -- plainly show
   that what he delivered to the disciples to drink was wine; so that in
   every way the ignorance of the Papists is fully exposed.

   But there are others who reject the figure, and, like madmen, unsay
   what they had just said. According to them, bread is truly and properly
   body; for they disapprove of transubstantiation, as wholly devoid of
   reason and plausibility. But when the question is put to them, if
   Christ be bread and wine, they reply that the bread is called body,
   because under it and along with it the body is received in the Lord's
   Supper. But from this reply it may be readily concluded, that the word
   body is improperly applied to the bread, which is a sign of it. And
   since those men have constantly in their mouth, that Christ spoke thus
   in reference to a sacramental union, it is strange that they do not
   consider what they say. For what is the nature of a sacramental union
   between a thing and its sign? Is it not because the Lord, by the secret
   power of his Spirit, fulfills what he promises? So then those later
   instructions about the letter are not less absurd than the Papists.

   Hitherto I have pointed out the simple exposition of the words of our
   Lord. But now I must add, that it is not an empty or unmeaning sign
   which is held out to us, but those who receive this promise by faith
   are actually made partakers of his flesh and blood. For in vain would
   the Lord command his people to eat bread, declaring that it is his
   body, if the effect were not truly added to the figure. Nor must it be
   supposed that we dispute this point, whether it is in reality, or only
   by signification, that Christ presents himself to be enjoyed by us in
   the Lord's Supper; for, though we perceive nothing in it but bread, yet
   he does not disappoint or mock us, when he undertakes to nourish our
   souls by his flesh. The true eating of the flesh of Christ, therefore,
   is not only pointed out by the sign, but is likewise exhibited in
   reality.

   But there are three mistakes against which it is here necessary to be
   on our guard; first, not to confound the spiritual blessing with the
   sign; secondly, not to seek Christ on earth, or under earthly elements;
   thirdly, not to imagine any other kind of eating than that which draws
   into us the life of Christ by the secret power of the Spirit, and which
   we obtain by faith alone. First, as I have said, let us always keep in
   view the distinction between the sign and the thing signified, if we do
   not wish to overturn every thing; for otherwise we shall derive no
   advantage from the sacrament, if it do not, according to the measure of
   our small capacity, lead us from the contemplation of the earthly
   element to the heavenly mystery. And therefore, whoever will not
   distinguish the body of Christ from the bread, and the blood from the
   wine, will never understand what is meant by the Lord's Supper, or for
   what purpose believers use these symbols.

   Secondly, we must attend to the proper method of seeking Christ; that
   is, our minds must not be fixed on the earth, but must ascend upwards
   to the heavenly glory in which he dwells. For the body of Christ did
   not, by clothing itself with an incorruptible life, lay aside its own
   nature; and hence it follows that it is finite. [195] But he has now
   ascended above the heavens, that no gross imagination may keep us
   occupied with earthly things. And certainly, if this mystery is
   heavenly, nothing could be more unreasonable than to draw down Christ
   to the earth, when, on the contrary, he calls us upwards to himself.

   The last point which, I said, claimed our attention, is the kind of
   eating. We must not dream that his substance passes, in a natural
   manner, into our souls; but we cat his flesh, when, by means of it, we
   receive life. For we must attend to the analogy or resemblance between
   bread and flesh, which teaches us, that our souls feed on Christ's own
   flesh in precisely the same manner as bread imparts vigor to our
   bodies. The flesh of Christ, therefore, is spiritual nourishment,
   because it gives life to us. Now it gives life, because the Holy Spirit
   pours into us the life which dwells in it. And though the act of eating
   the flesh of Christ is different from believing on him, yet we ought to
   know that it is impossible to feed on Christ in any other way than by
   faith, because the eating itself is a consequence of faith.

   29. But I tell you. This sentence is put by Matthew and Mark
   immediately after the Holy Supper, when Christ had given the symbol of
   his blood in the cup; from which some infer that Luke relates here the
   same thing which we shall find him repeating shortly afterwards. But
   this difficulty is easily obviated, because it is of little importance
   in itself at what precise moment Christ said this. All that the
   Evangelists intend to state by it is, that the disciples were warned
   both of their Master's approaching death, and of the new and heavenly
   life: for the more nearly the hour of his death approached, there was
   the greater necessity for them to be confirmed, that they might not
   altogether fall away. Again, as he intended to place his death before
   their eyes in the Holy Supper, as in a mirror, it was not without
   reason that he again declared that he was now leaving the world. But as
   this intelligence was full of sadness, a consolation is immediately
   added, that they have no occasion for shrinking from the thought of his
   death, which will be followed by a better life. As if he had said: "It
   is true, indeed, that I am now hastening to my death, but it is in
   order that I may pass from it to a blessed immortality, not to live
   alone without you in the kingdom of God, but to have you associated
   with me in the same life." Thus we see how Christ leads his disciples
   by the hand to the cross, and thence raises them to. the hope of the
   resurrection. And as it was necessary that they should be directed to
   the cross of Christ, that by that ladder they might ascend to heaven;
   so now, since Christ has died and been received into heaven, we ought
   to be led from the contemplation of the cross to heaven, that death and
   the restoration of life may be found to agree.

   Till that day when I shall drink it new with you. It is plain from
   these words that he promises to them a glory which they will share with
   himself. The objection made by some --that meat and drink are not
   applicable to the kingdom of God--is frivolous; for Christ means
   nothing more than that his disciples will soon be deprived of his
   presence, and that he will not henceforth eat with them, until they
   enjoy together the heavenly life. As he points out their being
   associated in that life, which needs not the aids of meat and drink, he
   says that there will then be a new kind of drinking; by which term we
   are taught that he is speaking allegorically. Accordingly, Luke simply
   says, until the kingdom of God come. In short, Christ recommends to us
   the fruit and effect of the redemption which he procured by his death.

   The opinion entertained by some--that these words were fulfilled, when
   Christ ate with his disciples after his resurrection is foreign to his
   meaning; for, since that was an intermediate condition between the
   course of a mortal life and the end of a heavenly life, the kingdom of
   God had not, at that time, been fully revealed; and therefore Christ
   said to Mary,

   Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father,
   (John 20:17.)

   Besides, the disciples had not yet entered into the kingdom of God, so
   as to drink new wine with Christ, being partakers of the same glory.
   And when we read that Christ drank after his resurrection, though he
   declared that he would not do so until he had assembled his disciples
   in the kingdom of God, the apparent contradiction is easily removed.
   For it is not exactly of meat and drink that he speaks, but of the
   intercourse of the present life. Now we know that Christ did not at
   that time drink for the purpose of invigorating his body by food, or of
   holding intercourse with his disciples, but only to prove his
   resurrection--of which they were still doubtful--and thus to raise
   their minds on high. Let us therefore rest satisfied with the natural
   meaning, that our Lord promises to his disciples that, having hitherto
   lived with them on earth as a mortal man, he will hereafter make them
   his associates in a blessed and immortal life.

   Luke 22:19. Which is given for you. The other two Evangelists leave out
   this clause, which, however, is far from being superfluous; for the
   reason why the flesh of Christ becomes bread to us is, that by it
   salvation was once procured for us. And as the crucified flesh itself
   is of no advantage but to those who eat it by faith, so, on the other
   hand, the eating of it would be unmeaning, and of hardly any value,
   were it not in reference to the sacrifice which was once offered.
   Whoever then desires that the flesh of Christ should afford nourishment
   to him, let him look at it as having been offered on the cross, that it
   might be the price of our reconciliation with God. But what Matthew and
   Mark leave out in reference to the symbol of bread, they express in
   reference to the cup, saying, that the blood was to be shed for the
   remission of sins; and this observation must be extended to both
   clauses. So then, in order that we may feed aright on the flesh of
   Christ, we must contemplate the sacrifice of it, because it was
   necessary that it should have been once given for our salvation, that
   it might every day be given to us.

   Matthew 26:27. Drink you all of it. As it was the design of Christ to
   keep our faith wholly fixed on himself, that we may not seek any thing
   apart from him, he employed two symbols to show that our life is shut
   up in him. This body needs to be nourished and supported by meat and
   drink. Christ, in order to show that he alone is able to discharge
   perfectly all that is necessary for salvation, says that he supplies
   the place of meat and drink; by which he gives an astonishing display
   of his condescension, in thus letting himself down to the feeble
   capacity of our flesh for the purpose of invigorating our faith. So
   much the more detestable is the insolence and sacrilege of the Pope,
   who has not scrupled to break asunder this sacred tie. We learn that
   the Son of God employed two symbols together, to testify the fullness
   of life which he bestows on his followers. What right had a mortal man
   to separate those things which God had joined together?

   But it would even appear that the express reason why our Lord commanded
   all to drink of the cup was in order to prevent this sacrilege from
   entering into the Church. As to the bread, we read that he simply said,
   Take, eat. Why does he expressly command them all to drink, and why
   does Mark explicitly say that they all drank of it, if it were not to
   guard believers against this wicked novelty? And yet this severe
   prohibition has not deterred the Pope from venturing to change and
   violate a law established by the Lord; for he has withheld all the
   people from using the cup. And to prove that his rage has reason on its
   side, he alleges that one of the kinds is sufficient, because the flesh
   includes the blood by concomitancy. [196] On the same pretext they
   would be at liberty to set aside the whole of the sacrament, because
   Christ might equally well make us partakers of himself without any
   external aid. But those childish cavils yield no support to their
   impiety; for nothing can be more absurd than that believers should, of
   their own accord, part with the aids which the Lord has given, or allow
   themselves to be deprived of them; and, therefore, nothing can be more
   intolerable than this wicked mangling of the mystery.

   Mark 14:24. This is my blood. I have already remarked that, when we are
   told that the blood is to be shed -- according to the narrative of
   Matthew -- for the remission of sins, these words direct us to the
   sacrifice of the death of Christ, without the remembrance of which the
   Lord's Supper is never observed in a proper manner. And, indeed, it is
   impossible for believing souls to be satisfied in any other way than by
   being assured that God is pacified towards them.

   Which is shed for many. By the word many he means not a part of the
   world only, but the whole human race; for he contrasts many with one;
   as if he had said, that he will not be the Redeemer of one man only,
   but will die in order to deliver many from the condemnation of the
   curse. It must at the same time be observed, however, that by the words
   for you, as related by Luke -- Christ directly addresses the disciples,
   and exhorts every believer to apply to his own advantage the shedding
   of blood Therefore, when we approach to the holy table, let us not only
   remember in general that the world has been redeemed by the blood of
   Christ, but let every one consider for himself that his own sins have
   been expiated. [197]

   Of the new testament. Luke and Paul (1 Corinthians 11:25) express it
   differently, the new testament in my blood, but the meaning is the
   same; for it is only by a spiritual drinking of blood that this
   covenant is ratified, so as to be firm and stable. Yet it may easily be
   inferred from it, how foolishly superstitious the Papists and others of
   the same stamp are in rigidly adhering to the words; for, with all
   their bluster, they cannot set aside this exposition of the Holy
   Spirit, that the cup is called blood, because it is the new testament
   in blood. But the same argument applies to the bread; from which it
   will follow that it is called the body; because it is the testament in
   the body They have no right now to contend that we ought to rely on the
   simple words of Christ, and shut our ears against expositions from
   without. It is Christ himself that speaks, and surely they will not
   deny that he is well qualified to interpret his own words. Now Christ
   openly declares that he called the bread his body, for no other reason
   than because he has made with us an everlasting covenant, that, the
   sacrifice having been once offered, we may now be spiritually fed.

   There are two things here which deserve our attention; for from the
   word testament, or covenant, (diatheke,) we infer that a promise is
   included in the Holy Supper. This refutes the error of those who
   maintain that faith is not aided, nourished, supported, or increased by
   the sacraments; for there is always a mutual relation between the
   covenant of God and the faith of men. By the epithet New he intended to
   show that the ancient figures now cease, and give way to a firm and
   everlasting covenant. There is an indirect contrast, therefore, between
   this mystery and the shadows of the law; from which it is evident how
   much better our condition is than that of our fathers, since, in
   consequence of the sacrifice which was completed on the cross, we
   possess the truth in perfection.

   Mark 14:26. When they had sung a hymn. Our three Evangelists leave out
   those divine discourses, [198] which John relates to have been
   delivered by our Lord, both in the house and on the road. For, as we
   have elsewhere stated, their object was rather to embrace the history
   of our Lord's actions than his doctrine. They glance only at the fact,
   that he went out of his own accord where Judas was to come; and their
   object is to inform us that he made such an arrangement of his time, as
   willingly to meet him who betrayed him.

   before you into Galilee. 33. And Peter answering said to him, Though
   all should be offended at thee, yet I will never be offended. 34. Jesus
   said to him, Verily I tell thee, That this night, before the cock crow,
   thou wilt thrice deny me. 35. Peter saith to him, Though I should die
   with thee, I will not deny thee. In like manner also all the disciples
   spoke.

   27. And Jesus saith to them, You will all be offended at me this night;
   for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be
   scattered. 28. But after I have risen, I will go before you into
   Galilee. 29. And Peter saith to him, Though all should be offended, yet
   I will not. 30. Then Jesus said to him, Verily I tell thee, that today,
   this night, before the cock crow twice, thou wilt thrice deny me.
   31. But he spoke still more strongly, Though I should die with thee, I
   will not deny thee. In like manner also they all spoke.

   31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, lo, Satan has asked that he may
   sift you as wheat. 32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may
   not fail; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 33. And
   he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both to prison and to
   death. 34. But he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock will not crow
   today, before thou thrice deny that you knowest me.


   Matthew 26:31. You will all be offended at me. What Matthew and Mark
   extend to all the disciples alike is related by Luke as having been
   spoken to Peter only. But though the statement was equally addressed to
   all, yet it is probable that Christ spoke to them in the person of one
   man, who was to be admonished more than all the rest, and who needed
   extraordinary consolation, that, after having denied Christ, he might
   not be altogether overwhelmed with despair.

   Luke 22:31. Lo, Satan hath desired. The other two Evangelists relate
   more briefly and simply, that our Lord foretold to his disciples their
   fall. But the words of Luke contain more abundant instruction; for
   Christ does not speak of the future trouble in the way of narrative,
   but expressly declares, that they will have a contest with Satan, and,
   at the same time, promises to them victory. It is a highly useful
   admonition, whenever we meet with any thing that gives us offense, to
   have always before our eyes the snares of Satan; as Paul also teaches,
   that

   we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual armies,
   (Ephesians 6:12.)

   The meaning of the words therefore is: "When, a short time hence, you
   shall see me oppressed, know that Satan employs these arms to fight
   against you, and that this is a convenient opportunity for destroying
   your faith." I have said that this is a useful doctrine, because it
   frequently happens that, from want of consideration, we are overcome by
   disregarding temptations, which we would regard as formidable, if we
   reflected that they are the fiery darts (Ephesians 6:16) of a vigorous
   and powerful enemy. And though he now speaks of that singularly fierce
   attack, by which the disciples, at one time, received dreadful shocks,
   so that their faith was well nigh extinguished, yet he manifestly
   conveys a more extensive doctrine, that Satan continually goes about,
   roaring for his prey. As he is impelled by such furious madness to
   destroy us, nothing is more unreasonable than that we should give
   ourselves up to drowsiness. Before there is apparent necessity for
   fighting, let us already prepare ourselves; for we know that Satan
   desires our destruction, and with great skill and assiduity seizes on
   every method of injuring us. And when we come to the conflict, let us
   know that all temptations, from whatever quarter they come, were forged
   in the workshop of that enemy.

   That he may sift you as wheat. The metaphor of sifting is not in every
   respect applicable; for we have elsewhere seen that the Gospel is
   compared to a winnowing-fan or sieve, by which the wheat is purified
   from the chaff (Matthew 3:12;) but here it simply means to toss up and
   down, or to shake with violence, because the apostles were driven about
   with unusual severity by the death of Christ. This ought to be
   understood, because there is nothing in which Satan takes less delight
   than the purification of believers. Yet though it be for a different
   purpose that he shakes them, it is nevertheless true, that they are
   driven and tossed about in every direction, just as the wheat is shaken
   by the winnowing-fan. But we shall shortly afterwards see that a still
   more disastrous fulfillment of these words was experienced by the
   disciples. And this is what is meant by the words of our Lord, as
   related by Matthew and Mark: you will all be offended at me. They mean
   that the disciples will not only be attacked, but will nearly give way;
   because the ignominious treatment of Christ will quite overpower their
   minds. For whereas it was their duty to advance steadily with their
   Master to the cross, fear kept them back. Their infirmity is thus
   exhibited to them, that by prayers and groans they may betake
   themselves to God's holy protection.

   Matthew 26:31. For it is written. By this prediction he encourages them
   to rise above the offense, because God does not cease to recognize as
   his sheep those who are driven out and scattered in every direction for
   a time. After having treated of the restoration of the Church, the
   prophet, in order to prevent the minds of the godly from being
   overwhelmed with despair by the extreme distresses which were already
   at hand, declares, that when the government has been brought into a
   state of confusion, or even completely overturned, there will be a sad
   and miserable dispersion, but yet the grace of God will be victorious.
   And though almost all commentators confine the passage in Zechariah
   13:7 to the person of Christ alone, yet I extend it farther, as meaning
   that a government, on which the salvation of the people depends, will
   no longer exist, because the shepherds will be driven from the midst of
   them. I have no doubt that the Lord intended to include that whole
   period during which, after the tyranny of Antiochus, the Church was
   deprived of good shepherds, and reduced to a state of desolation; for
   at that time God permitted the sword to commit fearful devastation,
   and, by slaying the shepherds, to throw the people into a state of
   wretched confusion. And yet this scattering did not prevent the Lord
   from gathering his sheep at length, by stretching out his hand towards
   them.

   But though the prophet utters a general threatening that the Church
   will be deprived of shepherds, still this is justly and properly
   applied to Christ. For since he was the prince of all the shepherds, on
   whom alone the salvation of the Church depended, when he was dead, it
   might be thought that all hope was utterly gone. And, indeed, it was an
   extremity of temptation, when the Redeemer, who was the breath and life
   of his people, after having begun to collect the flock of God, was
   suddenly dragged to death. But so much the more strikingly was the
   grace of God displayed, when out of dispersion and death the remaining
   flock was again assembled in a wonderful manner.

   Thus we see, that Christ quoted this passage appropriately, that the
   disciples might not be too much alarmed by the future dispersion, and
   yet that, aware of their own weakness, they might rely on their
   Shepherd. The meaning therefore is: "Not having yet felt your weakness,
   you imagine that you are sufficiently vigorous and powerful; but it
   will soon be apparent that the prediction of Zechariah is true, that,
   when the shepherd is slain, the flock will be scattered. But yet let
   the promise which is added exhilarate and support you, that God will
   stretch out his hand, to bring back to Him the scattered sheep." We are
   here taught, that there is no unity that brings salvation but that
   which keeps the sheep united under Christ's crook.

   32 But after I have risen. He now expresses more clearly -- what I
   lately hinted -- that the disciples, struck with dread, will resemble
   for a short time scattered and wandering sheep, but will at length be
   brought back to the fold. For Christ does not simply say that he will
   rise again, but promises to be their leader, and takes them for his
   companions, as if they had never swerved from their allegiance to him;
   and, to impart to them greater confidence, he mentions the place where
   they will again meet; as if he had said, "You, who are scattered at
   Jerusalem, will be again assembled by me in Galilee."

   33. Peter answering. Though Peter uses no hypocrisy, but speaks with
   sincere affection, yet as a false confidence in his virtue carries him
   away into foolish boasting, he is justly reproved by Christ, and
   shortly afterwards is severely punished for his rashness. Thus the
   event showed, that Peter promised more for himself than he was able to
   accomplish, because he had not been sufficiently careful to examine
   himself. Hence too we see more clearly, how stupid is the intoxication
   of human presumption, that, when he is again reminded of his weakness
   by the Son of God, and that with the solemnity of an oath, he is so far
   from yielding, or even from making any abatement of his foolish
   confidence, that he goes on to show those lofty pretensions with more
   fierceness than ever.

   But it is asked, Had not Peter a right to hope what he promises for
   himself? and was he not even bound, relying on the promise of Christ,
   to make this promise for himself? I answer, When Christ formerly
   promised to his disciples the spirit of unshaken fortitude, he referred
   to a new state of things which followed the resurrection; and,
   therefore, as they were not yet endued with heavenly power, Peter,
   forming confident expectations from himself, goes beyond the limits of
   faith. He erred in two respects. First, by anticipating the time he
   made a rash engagement, and did not rely on the promise of the Lord.
   Secondly, shutting his eyes on his own weakness, and under the
   influence of thoughtlessness rather than of courage, he undertook more
   than the case, warranted.

   This claims our attention, that every man, remembering his own
   weakness, may earnestly resort to the assistance of the Holy Spirit;
   and next, that no man may venture to take more upon himself than what
   the Lord promises. Believers ought, indeed, to be prepared for the
   contest in such a manner that, entertaining no doubt or uncertainty
   about the result and the victory, they may resist fear; for trembling
   and excessive anxiety are marks of distrust. But, on the other hand,
   they ought to guard against that stupidity which shakes off all
   anxiety, and fills their minds with pride, and extinguishes the desire
   to pray. This middle course between two faulty extremes [199] is very
   beautifully expressed by Paul, when he enjoins us to


   work out our salvation with fear and trembling, because it is God that
   worketh in us to will and perform,
   (Philippians 2:12, 13.)

   For, on the one hand, having humbled us, he entreats us to seek
   supplies elsewhere; and, on the other hand, lest anxiety should induce
   sloth, he exhorts us to strenuous exertions. And, therefore, whenever
   any temptation is presented to us, let us first remember our weakness,
   that, being entirely thrown down, we may learn to seek elsewhere what
   we need; and, next, let us remember the grace which is promised, that
   it may free us from doubt. For those who, forgetting their weakness,
   and not calling on God, feel assured that they are strong, act entirely
   like drunken soldiers, who throw themselves rashly into the field, but,
   as soon as the effects of strong drink are worn off, think of nothing
   else than flight.

   It is wonderful that the other disciples, after Peter had been
   reproved, still break out into the same rashness; and hence it is
   evident how little they knew themselves. We are taught by this example,
   that we ought to attempt nothing, except so far as God stretches out
   his hand; for nothing is more fading or transitory than inconsiderate
   zeal. The disciples perceive that nothing is more base or unreasonable
   than to forsake their Master; and, therefore, they justly detest so
   infamous an action: but, having no reliance on the promise, and
   neglecting prayer, they advance with inconsiderate haste to boast of a
   constancy which they did not possess.

   LUKE 22:35-38

   Luke 22:35-38

   35. And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or
   shoes, did you want any thing? And they said, Nothing. 36. He therefore
   said to them, But now let him who hath a purse take it, and, in like
   manner, a scrip; and let him who hath not a sword sell his garment and
   buy one. 37. For I tell you, that this also which is written must be
   accomplished in me, And he was reckoned with the transgressors. For
   those things which relate to me have an end. [200] 38. And they said,
   Lord, lo, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.


   Luke 22:35. And he said to them. The whole object of this discourse of
   Christ is to show, that hitherto he spared his disciples, so as to lay
   on them no heavier burden than they were able to bear. He reminds them
   of the indulgence exercised during the past time, that they may now
   prepare themselves with greater alacrity for severer warfare. For why
   did he, while they were altogether destitute of skill and training,
   keep them in the shade and in repose, at a distance from the darts of
   the enemy, except that, by gradually gathering courage and strength
   during the interval of leisure, they might be better prepared for
   fighting? The meaning is: "Hitherto you have had an easy and prosperous
   condition, because I wished to treat you gently, like children; the
   full time is now come, when I must employ you in labor, like men." But
   the comparison which he makes between the two periods is still more
   extensive; for if they wanted nothing, when they proceeded to discharge
   their office without taking with them a stock of provisions, when a
   state of peace allowed them leisure to provide for their necessities,
   much more now, in the midst of tumult and excitement, ought they to lay
   aside anxiety about the present life, and run wherever necessity calls
   them. And although Christ makes special mention of what he had done in
   reference to the twelve apostles, he shows likewise, that while we are
   still beginners and weak in faith, he continues to indulge us till we
   grow up to be men; and, therefore, that they act improperly who devote
   their leisure to the pursuit of luxuries, which abate the rigor of
   their faith. And let us not doubt that Christ has regard to us in the
   present day, since he does not hurry us into the battle while we are
   still untrained and inexperienced, but, before sending us to the field,
   supplies us with arms and courage.

   36. But now let him who hath a purse take it. In metaphorical language
   he threatens that they will soon meet with great troubles and fierce
   attacks; just as when a general, intending to lead the soldiers into
   the field of battle, calls them to arms, and orders them to lay aside
   every other care, and think of nothing else than fighting, not even to
   take any thought about procuring food. For he shows them--as is usually
   done in cases of extreme danger--that every thing must be sold, even to
   the scrip and the purse, in order to supply them with arms. And yet he
   does not call them to an outward conflict, but only, under the
   comparison of fighting, he warns them of the severe struggles of
   temptations which they must undergo, and of the fierce attacks which
   they must sustain in spiritual contests. That they might more willingly
   throw themselves on the providence of God, he first reminded them, as I
   have said, that God took care to supply them with what was necessary,
   even when they carried with them no supplies of food and raiment.
   Having experienced so large and seasonable supplies from God, they
   ought not, for the future, to entertain any doubt that he would provide
   for every one of their necessities.

   37. That this also which is written must be accomplished in me. This
   adverb also is emphatic; for Christ means, that he had not yet
   discharged every part of his office, till he had been ranked with
   ungodly and wicked men, as if he had been one of their class. But that
   their minds might not be too much disturbed by the baseness of such a
   transaction, he quotes a prediction of Isaiah, (53:12) which, it is
   certain, cannot be explained but as referring to the Messiah. Now since
   it is there said that he was to be reckoned among transgressors, such a
   spectacle, however atrocious, ought not to alarm believers, or to
   alienate them from Christ, who could not have been their Redeemer in
   any other way than by taking upon himself the shame and disgrace of a
   wicked man. For nothing is better adapted to remove grounds of offense,
   when we are alarmed by any strange occurrence, than to acknowledge that
   it so pleases God, and that whatever takes place by his appointment is
   not done rashly, or without a good reason; more especially when that
   which is made evident by the event itself was anciently predicted.
   Since, then, the disciples ought to expect a Redeemer such as God had
   formerly promised, and since Isaiah had expressly declared, that in
   order that he might deliver us from the guilt of offenses the
   punishment must be laid on him, (Isaiah 53:5, 6,) this ought to be
   sufficient for abating the horror of the disciples, and for preventing
   them from entertaining less esteem for Christ.

   For those things which relate to me have an end. By these words,
   immediately added, he means that the prophets spoke nothing in vain.
   For this Greek phrase, telos echei, have an end; means that they are
   accomplished, or put in effect. Now when every thing that the prophets
   spoke is verified by the event, it ought rather to contribute to
   strengthen our faith, than to strike us with alarm or anxiety. But
   while Christ encourages and comforts the disciples by this single
   argument, that all the predictions must be accomplished, the very
   procedure of the divine purpose contains within itself no ordinary
   ground of confidence, which is, that Christ was subjected to the
   condemnation which we deserved, and was reconciled among transgressors,
   that we, who are transgressors, and loaded with crimes, might be
   presented by him to the Father as righteous. For we are reckoned pure
   and free from sins before God, because the Lamb, who was pure and free
   from every blemish, was placed in our room, as we shall have occasion
   to state again under the next chapter.

   38. Lord, lo, here are two swords. It was truly shameful and stupid
   ignorance, that the disciples, after having been so often informed
   about bearing the cross, imagine that they must fight with swords of
   iron. When they say that they have two swords, it is uncertain whether
   they mean that they are well prepared against their enemies, or
   complain that they are ill provided with arms. It is evident, at least,
   that they were so stupid as not to think of a spiritual enemy. As to
   the inference which the Doctors of Canon Law draw from these words --
   that their mitered bishops have a double jurisdiction -- it is not only
   an offensive allegory, but a detestable mockery, by which they ridicule
   the word of God. And it was necessary that the slaves of Antichrist
   should fall into such madness, of openly trampling under feet, by
   sacrilegious contempt, the sacred oracles of God.

   Matthew 26:36-44

   Mark 14:32-40

   Luke 22:39-46

   36. Then Jesus cometh with them to a place which is called Gethsemane,
   and saith to the disciples, Sit here until I go yonder and pray.
   37. And, having taken with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he
   began to be affected with grief and sorrow. 38. Then Jesus saith to
   them, My soul is sorrowful, even to death: remain here, and watch with
   me. 39. And proceeding a little farther, he fell on his face, praying,
   and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
   but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt. 40. And he came to the
   disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Couldst not thou
   watch with me one hour? 41. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into
   temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 42. He
   went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this
   cup cannot pass from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 43. And
   he came, and found them sleeping again; for their eyes were heavy.
   44. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time,
   saying the same words.

   32. And they come to a place which is called Gethsemane; and he saith
   to his disciples, Sit here until I have prayed. 33. And he taketh with
   him Peter, and James, and John. And he began to be afraid, and to be
   very sorrowful. 34. And he saith to them, My soul is sorrowful, even to
   death: remain here and watch. 35. And he went forward a little, and
   fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour
   might pass from him; 36. And said, Abba, Father, all things are
   possible to thee; remove this cup from me: but yet not what I will, but
   what thou wilt. 37. And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith
   to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour?
   38. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation: the spirit
   indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 39. And he went away again,
   and prayed, saying the same words. 40. And he returned, and found them
   sleeping again; for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what
   to answer him.

   39. And he came out, and went (as he was wont) to the mountain of
   Olives; and his disciples also followed him. 40. And when he came to
   the place, he said to then, pray that you may not enter into
   temptation. 41. And he withdrew from them about a stone's cast, and
   kneeled down, and prayed, 42. Saying, Father, if thou wilt, remove this
   cup from me; but yet not my will, but thine be done. 43. And there
   appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 44. And, being
   in agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was like drops of
   blood falling to the ground. 45. And when he had risen from prayer, and
   come to his disciples, he found them sleeping through sorrow. 46. And
   he saith to them, Why do you sleep? Arise; and pray, that you may not
   enter into temptation.


   Matthew 26:36. Then Jesus cometh with them. Luke mentions the mountain
   of Olives only. Mark and Matthew add a more minute description of the
   place. But Luke expresses what is still more to the purpose, that
   Christ came there according to his custom. Hence we infer, that he did
   not seek retirement for the purpose of concealing himself, but, as if
   he had made an assignation with his enemies, he presented himself to
   death. On this account John says (18:2) that the place was known to the
   traitor, because Jesus was wont to come there frequently. In this
   passage, therefore, his obedience is again described to us, because he
   could not have appeased the Father but by a voluntary death.

   Sit here. By leaving the disciples at a distance, he spares their
   weakness; as if a man, perceiving that he would soon be in extreme
   danger in battle, were to leave his wife and children in a situation of
   safety. But though he intended to place them all beyond arrow-shot, yet
   he took three of them who accompanied him more closely than the rest,
   and these were the flower and choice, in which there was greater rigor.
   And yet he did not take them, as if he believed that they would be able
   to sustain the attack, but that they might afford a proof of the defect
   which was common to them all.

   37. He began to be affected with grief. We have seen that our Lord
   formerly contended with the fear of death; but as he now fights face to
   face with temptation, such an attack is called the beginning of grief
   and sorrow. Hence we infer that the true test of virtue is only to be
   found when the contest begins; for then the weakness of the flesh,
   which was formerly concealed, shows itself, and the secret feelings are
   abundantly displayed. Thus, though God had already tried his Son by
   certain preparatory exercises, he now wounds him more sharply by a
   nearer prospect of death, and strikes his mind with a terror to which
   he had not been accustomed. But as it appears to be inconsistent with
   the divine glory of Christ, that he was seized with trembling and
   sadness, many commentators have labored with toil and anxiety to find
   some way of evading the difficulty. But their labor has been ill-judged
   and of no use; for if we are ashamed that Christ should experience fear
   and sorrow, our redemption will perish and be lost.

   Ambrose justly says: "I not only do not think that there is any need of
   excuse, but there is no instance in which I admire more his kindness
   and his majesty; for he would not have done so much for me, if he had
   not taken upon him my feelings. He grieved for me, who had no cause of
   grief for himself; and, laying aside the delights of the eternal
   Godhead, he experiences the affliction of my weakness. I boldly call it
   sorrow, because I preach the cross. For he took upon him not the
   appearance, but the reality, of incarnation. It was therefore necessary
   that he should experience grief, that he might overcome sorrow, and not
   shut it out; for the praise of fortitude is not bestowed on those who
   are rather stupefied than pained by wounds." Thus far Ambrose.

   Certainly those who imagine that the Son of God was exempt from human
   passions do not truly and sincerely acknowledge him to be a man. And
   when it is even said that the divine power of Christ rested and was
   concealed for a time, that by his sufferings he might discharge all
   that belonged to the Redeemer, this was so far from being absurd, that
   in no other way could the mystery of our salvation have been
   accomplished. For Cyril has properly said: "That the suffering of
   Christ on the cross was not in every respect voluntary, but that it was
   voluntary on account of the will of the Father, and on account of our
   salvation, you may easily learn from his prayer, Father, if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me. For the same reason that the Word
   of God is God, (John 1:1,) and is naturally life itself, (John 11:25,)
   nobody doubts that he had no dread of death; but, having been made
   flesh, (John 1:14,) he allows the flesh to feel what belongs to it,
   and, therefore, being truly a man, he trembles at death, when it is now
   at the door, and says, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
   from me; but since it cannot be otherwise, let it be not as I will, but
   as thou wilt. You see how human nature, even in Christ himself, has the
   sufferings and fears which belong to it, but that the Word, who is
   united to it, raises it to a fortitude which is worthy of God." He at
   length concludes: "You perceive that it was not for the sake of the
   flesh that the death of Christ was voluntary, but that it was
   voluntary, because, on account of it, according to the will of the
   Father, salvation and life were bestowed on men." Such are the views of
   Cyril.

   Still the weakness which Christ took upon himself must be distinguished
   from ours, for there is a great difference. In us there is no affection
   unaccompanied by sin, because they all exceed due bounds and proper
   restraint; but when Christ was distressed by grief and fear, he did not
   rise against God, but continued to be regulated by the true rule of
   moderation. We need not wonder that, since he was innocent, and pure
   from every stain, the affections which flowed from him were pure and
   stainless; but that nothing proceeds from the corrupt nature of men
   which is not impure and filthy. Let us, therefore, attend to this
   distinction, that Christ, amidst fear and sadness, was weak without any
   taint of sin; but that all our affections are sinful, because they rise
   to an extravagant height.

   The kind of feelings, by which Christ was tempted, is also worthy of
   notice. Matthew says that he was affected by grief and sorrow (or
   anxiety;)Luke says that he was seized with anguish; and Mark adds that
   he trembled. And whence came his sorrow and anguish, and fear, but
   because he felt that death had something in it more sad and more
   dreadful than the separation of the soul and body? And certainly he
   underwent death, not merely that he might depart from earth to heaven,
   but rather that, by taking upon himself the curse to which we were
   liable, he might deliver us from it. He had no horror at death,
   therefore, simply as a passage out of the world, but because he had
   before his eyes the dreadful tribunal of God, and the Judge himself
   armed with inconceivable vengeance; and because our sins, the load of
   which was laid upon him, pressed him down with their enormous weight.
   There is no reason to wonder, therefore, if the dreadful abyss of
   destruction tormented him grievously with fear and anguish.

   38. My soul is sorrowful. He communicates to them his sorrow, in order
   to arouse them to sympathy; not that he was unacquainted with their
   weakness, but in order that they might afterwards be more ashamed of
   their carelessness. This phrase expresses a deadly wound of grief; as
   if he had said, that he fainted, or was half-dead, with sorrow. Jonah
   (4:9) makes use of a similar phrase in replying to the Lord; I am angry
   even to death. I advert to this, because some of the ancient writers,
   in handling this passage with a misapplication of ingenuity,
   philosophize in this way, that the soul of Christ was not sorrowful in
   death but only even to death. And here again we ought to remember the
   cause of so great sorrow; for death in itself would not have so
   grievously tormented the mind of the Son of God, if he had not felt
   that he had to deal with the judgment of God.

   39. And he went forward a little. We have seen in other passages, that
   in order to excite himself to greater earnestness of prayer, the Lord
   prayed in the absence of witnesses; for when we are withdrawn from the
   gaze of men, we succeed better in collecting our senses, so as to
   attend more closely to what we are doing. It is not, indeed, necessary
   -- nay more, it is not always proper -- that we should retire to
   distant corners whenever we pray; but when some great necessity urges
   us, because the fervor of prayer is more freely indulged when we are
   alone, it is useful to us to pray apart. And if the Son of God did not
   disregard this aid, it would be the greatest madness of pride in us not
   to apply it for our own advantage. Add to this, that when God alone is
   witness, as there is nothing then to be feared from ambition, the
   believing soul unfolds itself with greater familiarity, and with
   greater simplicity pours its wishes, and groans, and anxieties, and
   fears, and hopes, and joys, into the bosom of God. God allows his
   people to make use of many little modes of speaking, when they pray
   alone, which, in the presence of men, would savor of ostentation.

   And fell on his face. By the very gesture of falling on the earth,
   Christ manifested his deep earnestness in prayer. For though kneeling,
   as our expression of respect and reverence, is commonly used in prayer,
   Christ, by throwing himself on the ground as a suppliant, placed
   himself in a pitiable attitude on account of the vehemence of his
   grief.

   My Father, if it be possible. In vain do some persons labor to show
   that what is here described is not a prayer, but only a complaint. For
   my own part, while I own that it is abrupt, I have no doubt that Christ
   offered a prayer. Nor is it inconsistent with this, that he asks a
   thing that is impossible to be granted to him; for the prayers of
   believers do not always flow on with uninterrupted progress to the end,
   do not always maintain a uniform measure, are not always arranged even
   in a distinct order, but, on the contrary, are involved and confused,
   and either oppose each other, or stop in the middle of the course; like
   a vessel tossed by tempests, which, though it advances towards the
   harbor, cannot always keep a straight and uniform course, as in a calm
   sea. We must remember, indeed, what I lately mentioned, that Christ had
   not confused emotions, like those to which we are accustomed, to
   withdraw his mind from pure moderation; but, so far as the pure and
   innocent nature of man could admit, he was struck with fear and seized
   with anguish, so that, amidst the violent shocks of temptation, he
   vacillated--as it were--from one wish to another. This is the reason
   why, after having prayed to be freed from death, he immediately
   restrains himself, and, submitting to the authority of the Father,
   corrects and recalls that wish which had suddenly escaped him.

   But it may be asked, How did he pray that the eternal decree of the
   Father, of which he was not ignorant, should be revoked? or though he
   states a condition, if it be possible, yet it wears an aspect of
   absurdity to make the purpose of God changeable. We must hold it to be
   utterly impossible for God to revoke his decree. According to Mark,
   too, Christ would seem to contrast the power of God with his decree.
   All things, says he, are possible to thee. But it would be improper to
   extend the power of God so far as to lessen his truth, by making him
   liable to variety and change. I answer, There would be no absurdity in
   supposing that Christ, agreeably to the custom of the godly, leaving
   out of view the divine purpose, committed to the bosom of the Father
   his desire which troubled him. For believers, in pouring out their
   prayers, do not always ascend to the contemplation of the secrets of
   God, or deliberately inquire what is possible to be done, but are
   sometimes carried away hastily by the earnestness of their wishes. Thus
   Moses prays that he may be blotted out of the book of life, (Exodus
   32:33;) thus Paul wished to be made an anathema, [201] (Romans 9:3.)
   This, therefore, was not a premeditated prayer of Christ; but the
   strength and violence of grief suddenly drew this word from his mouth,
   to which he immediately added a correction. The same vehemence of
   desire took away from him the immediate recollection of the heavenly
   decree, so that he did not at that moment reflect, that it was on this
   condition, [202] that he was sent to be the Redeemer of mankind; as
   distressing anxiety often brings darkness over our eyes, so that we do
   not at once remember the whole state of the matter. In short, there is
   no impropriety, if in prayer we do not always direct our immediate
   attention to every thing, so as to preserve a distinct order. When
   Christ says, in the Gospel by Matthew, that all things are possible to
   God, he does not intend by these words to bring the power of God into
   conflict with unchangeable truth and firmness; but as there was no
   hope--which is usually the case when affairs are desperate--he throws
   himself on the power of God. The word (poterion) cup or chalice -- as
   we have mentioned elsewhere -- denotes the providence of God, which
   assigns to each his measure of the cross and of affliction, just as the
   master of a house gives an allowance to each servant, and distributes
   portions among the children.

   But yet not as I will, but as thou wilt. We see how Christ restrains
   his feelings at the very outset, and quickly brings himself into a
   state of obedience. But here it may first be inquired, How was his will
   pure from all vice, while it did not agree with the will of God? For if
   the will of God is the only rule of what is good and right, it follows,
   that all the feelings which are at variance with it are vicious. I
   reply: Though it be true rectitude to regulate all our feelings by the
   good pleasure of God, yet there is a certain kind of indirect
   disagreement with it which is not faulty, and is not reckoned as sin;
   if, for example, a person desire to see the Church in a calm and
   flourishing condition, if he wish that the children of God were
   delivered from afflictions, that all superstitions were removed out of
   the world, and that the rage of wicked men were so restrained as to do
   no injury. These things, being in themselves right, may properly be
   desired by believers, though it may please God to order a different
   state of matters: for he chooses that his Son should reign among
   enemies; that his people should be trained under the cross; and that
   the triumph of faith and of the Gospel should be rendered more
   illustrious by the opposing machinations of Satan. We see how those
   prayers are holy, which appear to be contrary to the will of God; for
   God does not desire us to be always exact or scrupulous in inquiring
   what he has appointed, but allows us to ask what is desirable according
   to the capacity of our senses.

   But the question has not yet been fully answered: for since we have
   just now said that all the feelings of Christ were properly regulated,
   how does he now correct himself? For he brings his feelings into
   obedience to God in such a manner as if he had exceeded what was
   proper. Certainly in the first prayer we do not perceive that calm
   moderation which I have described; for, as far as lies in his power, he
   refuses and shrinks from discharging the office of Mediator. I reply:
   When the dread of death was presented to his mind, and brought along
   with it such darkness, that he left out of view every thing else, and
   eagerly presented that prayer, there was no fault in this. Nor is it
   necessary to enter into any subtle controversy whether or not it was
   possible for him to forget our salvation. We ought to be satisfied with
   this single consideration, that at the time when he uttered a prayer to
   be delivered from death, he was not thinking of other things which
   would have shut the door against such a wish.

   If it be objected, that the first movement, which needed to be
   restrained before it proceeded farther, was not so well regulated as it
   ought to have been, I reply: In the present corruption of our nature it
   is impossible to find ardor of affections accompanied by moderation,
   such as existed in Christ; but we ought to give such honor to the Son
   of God, as not to judge of him by what we find in ourselves. For in us
   all the affections of the flesh, when strongly excited, break out into
   rebellion, or, at least, have some mixture of pollution; but Christ,
   amidst the utmost vehemence of grief or fear, restrained himself within
   proper bounds. Nay more, as musical sounds, though various and
   differing from each other, are so far from being discordant, that they
   produce sweet melody and fine harmony; so in Christ there was a
   remarkable example of adaptation between the two wills, [203] the will
   of God and the will of man, so that they differed from each other
   without any conflict or opposition.

   This passage shows plainly enough the gross folly of those ancient
   heretics, who were called Monothelites, [204] because they imagined
   that the will of Christ was but one and simple; for Christ, as he was
   God, willed nothing different from the Father; and therefore it
   follows, that his human soul had affections distinct from the secret
   purpose of God. But if even Christ was under the necessity of holding
   his will captive, in order to subject it to the government of God,
   though it was properly regulated, how carefully ought we to repress the
   violence of our feelings, which are always inconsiderate, and rash, and
   full of rebellion? And though the Spirit of God governs us, so that we
   wish nothing but what is agreeable to reason, still we owe to God such
   obedience as to endure patiently that our wishes should not be granted;
   [205] For the modesty of faith consists in permitting God to appoint
   differently from what we desire. Above all, when we have no certain and
   special promise, we ought to abide by this rule, not to ask any thing
   but on the condition that God shall fulfill what he has decreed; which
   cannot be done, unless we give up our wishes to his disposal.

   It comes now to be inquired, what advantage did Christ gain by praying?
   The apostle, in writing to the Hebrews, says that he was heard (apo tos
   eulabeias) on account of his fear: for so ought that passage to be
   explained, and not, as it is usually explained, on account of his
   reverence, (Hebrews 5:7.) That would not have been consistent, if
   Christ had simply feared death; for he was not delivered from it. Hence
   it follows, that what led him to pray to be delivered from death was
   the dread of a greater evil. When he saw the wrath of God exhibited to
   him, as he stood at the tribunal of God charged with the sins of the
   whole world, he unavoidably shrunk with horror from the deep abyss of
   death. And, therefore, though he suffered death, yet since its pains
   were loosed--as Peter tells us, (Acts 2:24,)--and he was victorious in
   the conflict, the Apostle justly says, that he was heard on account of
   his fear. Here ignorant people rise up and exclaim, that it would have
   been unworthy of Christ to be afraid of being swallowed up by death.
   But I should wish them to answer this question, What kind of fear do
   they suppose it to have been which drew from Christ drops of blood?
   (Luke 22:44.) For that mortal sweat could only have proceeded from
   fearful and unusual horror. If any person, in the present day, were to
   sweat blood, and in such a quantity that the drops should fall to the
   ground, it would be reckoned an astonishing miracle; and if this
   happened to any man through fear of death, we would say that he had a
   cowardly and effeminate mind. Those men, therefore, who deny that
   Christ prayed that the Father would rescue him from the gulf of death,
   ascribe to him a cowardice that would be disgraceful even in an
   ordinary man.

   If it be objected, that the fear which I am describing arises from
   unbelief, the answer is easy. When Christ was struck with horror at the
   divine curse, the feeling of the flesh affected him in such a manner,
   that faith still remained firm and unshaken. For such was the purity of
   his nature, that he felt, without being wounded by them, those
   temptations which pierce us with their stings. And yet those persons,
   by representing him not to have felt temptations, foolishly imagine
   that he was victorious without fighting. And, indeed, we have no right
   to suppose that he used any hypocrisy, when he complained of a mortal
   sadness in his soul; nor do the Evangelists speak falsely, when they
   say that he was exceedingly sorrowful, and that he trembled

   40. And he came to his disciples. Though he was neither delivered from
   fear, nor freed from anxiety, yet he interrupted the ardor of prayer,
   and administered this consolation. For believers are not required to be
   so constant in prayer as never to cease from conversing with God; but
   on the contrary, following the example of Christ, they continue their
   prayers till they have proceeded as far as their infirmity allows, then
   cease for a short time, and immediately after drawing breath return to
   God. It would have been no slight alleviation of his grief, if his
   disciples had accompanied him, and taken part in it; and on the other
   hand, it was a bitter aggravation of his sufferings, that even they
   forsook him. For though he did not need the assistance of any one, yet
   as he had voluntarily taken upon him our infirmities, and as it was
   chiefly in this struggle that he intended to give a proof of that
   emptying of himself, of which Paul speaks, (Philippians 2:7,) we need
   not wonder if the indifference of those whom he had selected to be his
   companions added a heavy and distressing burden to his grief. For his
   expostulation is not feigned, but, out of the true feeling of his mind,
   he declares that he is grieved at having been forsaken. And, indeed, he
   had good grounds for reproaching them with indifference, since, amidst
   the extremity of his anguish, they did not watch at least one hour.

   41. Watch and pray. As the disciples were unmoved by their Master's
   danger, their attention is directed to themselves, that a conviction of
   their own danger may arouse them. Christ therefore threatens that, if
   they do not watch and pray, they may be soon overwhelmed by temptation.
   As if he had said, "Though you take no concern about me, do not fail,
   at least, to think of yourselves; for your own interests are involved
   in it, and if you do not take care, temptation will immediately swallow
   you up." For to enter into temptation means to yield to it. [206] And
   let us observe, that the manner of resistance which is here enjoined
   is, not to draw courage from reliance on our own strength and
   perseverance, but, on the contrary, from a conviction of our weakness,
   to ask arms and strength from the Lord. Our watching, therefore, will
   be of no avail without prayer.

   The spirit indeed is willing. That he may not terrify and discourage
   his disciples, he gently reproves their slothfulness, and adds
   consolation and good ground of hope. And, first, he reminds them, that
   though they are earnestly desirous to do what is right, still they must
   contend with the weakness of the flesh, and, therefore, that prayer is
   never unnecessary. We see, then, that he gives them the praise of
   willingness, in order that their weakness may not throw them into
   despair, and yet urges them to prayer, because they are not
   sufficiently endued with the power of the Spirit. Wherefore, this
   admonition relates properly to believers, who, being regenerated by the
   Spirit of God, are desirous to do what is right, but still labor under
   the weakness of the flesh; for though the grace of the Spirit is
   vigorous in them, they are weak according to the flesh. And though the
   disciples alone have their weakness here pointed out to them, yet,
   since what Christ says of them applies equally to all, we ought to draw
   from it a general rule, that it is our duty to keep diligent watch by
   praying; for we do not yet possess the power of the Spirit in such a
   measure as not to fall frequently through the weakness of the flesh,
   unless the Lord grant his assistance to raise up and uphold us. But
   there is no reason why we should tremble with excessive anxiety; for an
   undoubted remedy is held out to us, which we will neither have nor to
   seek nor to seek in vain; for Christ promises that all who, being
   earnest in prayer, shall perseveringly oppose the slothfulness of the
   flesh, will be victorious.

   42. Again he went away a second time. By these words Christ seems as
   if, having subdued fear, he came with greater freedom and courage to
   submit to the will of the Father; for he no longer asks to have the cup
   removed from him, but, leaving out this prayer, insists rather on
   obeying the purpose of God. But according to Mark, this progress is not
   described; and even when Christ returned a second time, we are told
   that he repeated the same prayer; and, indeed, I have no doubt, that at
   each of the times when he prayed, fear and horror impelled him to ask
   that he might be delivered from death. [207] Yet it is probable that,
   at the second time, he labored more to yield obedience to the Father,
   and that the first encounter with temptation animated him to approach
   death with greater confidence.Luke does not expressly relate that he
   prayed three several times, but only says that, when he was pressed
   with anguish, he prayed with greater copiousness and earnestness, as if
   he had continued to pray without any intermission. But we know that the
   Evangelists sometimes leave out circumstances, and only glance rapidly
   at the substance of what took place. Accordingly, when he says towards
   the close, that Christ came to his disciples, it is a hysteron
   proteton; [208] just as, in another clause, he relates that an angel
   from heaven appeared, before he speaks of Christ's anguish. But the
   inversion of the order carries no absurdity; for, in order to inform us
   that the angel was not sent without a good reason, the necessity for it
   is afterwards stated; and thus the latter part of the narrative is, in
   some sort, a reason assigned for the former. Now though it is the
   Spirit of God alone that imparts fortitude, that does not hinder God
   from employing angels as his ministers. And hence we may conclude what
   excruciating distresses the Son of God must have endured, since it was
   necessary that the assistance of God should be granted to him in a
   visible manner.

   43. And found them sleeping again. This drowsiness arose neither from
   excessive eating and drinking, nor from gross stupidity, nor even from
   effeminate indulgence of the flesh, but rather--as Luke tells us--from
   immoderate sorrow. Hence we perceive more clearly how strong is the
   tendency of our flesh to indifference; since even dangers lead us to
   forgetfulness of God. Thus on every hand Satan finds suitable and ready
   opportunities of spreading his snares for us. For if we dread no
   danger, he intoxicates and drowns us in sleep; and if we experience
   fear and sorrow, which ought to arouse us to pray, he overwhelms our
   senses, so that they do not rise to God; and thus, in every respect,
   men fall away and forsake God, till he restores them. We must observe
   also this circumstance, that the disciples, after having been sharply
   reproved, almost at that very moment fall again asleep. Nor is this
   said of the whole body, but of the three whom Christ had selected to be
   his chief companions; and what shall we say of the greater number, when
   this happened to the flower of them? Now the repetition of the same
   words was not a vain repetition, (battalogia) which Christ formerly
   condemned in hypocrites, (Matthew 6:7) who hope that they will obtain
   by idle talking what they do not ask honestly and sincerely. [209] But
   Christ intended to show by his example, that we must not be discouraged
   or grow weary in praying, if we do not immediately obtain our wishes.
   So then, it is not a superfluous repetition of the words, if a repulse
   which we have experienced is so far from extinguishing the ardor of
   prayer, that we ask a third and fourth time what God appears to have
   denied.

   45. Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep on now,

   delivered into the hands of sinners. 46. Arise, let us go: lo, he who

   Judas, one of the twelve, cometh, and with him a great multitude with
   swords and clubs, [210] from the chief priests and elders of the
   people. 48. Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying,
   Whomsoever I shall kiss, it is he: take him. 49. And immediately
   approaching, he said to Jesus, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him. 50. And
   Jesus said to him, Friend for what purpose comest thou? Then they
   approached, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.

   41. And he cometh the third time, and saith to the, Sleep on now, and
   take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; lo, the Son of man is
   betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42. Arise, let us go: lo, he who
   betrayeth me is approaching. 43. And immediately, while he was still
   speaking, Judas, who was one of the twelve, cometh, and with him a
   great multitude with swords and clubs, [211] from the chief priests,
   and scribes, and elders. 44. Now he who betrayed him had given them a
   sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, it is he: take him, and lead him
   away cautiously. 45. And having come, he immediately approacheth him,
   and saith, Rabbi, Rabbi, [212] and kissed him. 46. And they laid hands
   on him, and took him.

   47. And while he was still speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who was
   called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and approached Jesus
   to kiss him. 48. And Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son
   of man with a kiss?


   Matthew 26:45. Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is plain enough,
   that Christ now speaks ironically, but we must, at the same time,
   attend to the object of the irony. For Christ, having gained nothing by
   warning his disciples, not only gives an indirect reproof of their
   indifference, but threatens, that how indolent so ever they may choose
   to be, no longer delay will be allowed them. The meaning therefore is,
   "Having hitherto wasted my words on you, I shall now come to exhort
   you; but whatever permission I may give you to sleep, the enemies will
   not allow it to you, but will compel you to watch against your will."
   In Mark, it is accordingly added, It is enough; as if he had said, that
   there is no more time for sleeping. And this is the way in which the
   Lord usually chastises the indolence of men, that those who wax deaf to
   words may at length be compelled, by their sufferings, to arouse
   themselves. Let us, therefore, learn to give immediate attention to the
   words of the Lord, lest what he wishes to draw from us voluntarily may
   be too late forced from us by necessity.

   46. Arise, let us go. By these words he declares that, after having
   prayed, he was furnished with new arms. He had formerly, indeed, been
   sufficiently voluntary as to dying; but, when he came to the point, he
   had a hard struggle with the weakness of the flesh, so that he would
   willingly have withdrawn from dying, provided that he had been
   permitted to do so with the good-will of his Father. He, therefore,
   obtained by prayers and tears (Hebrews 5:7) new strength from heaven;
   not that he ever hesitated through want of strength, but because under
   the weakness of the flesh, which he had voluntarily undertaken, he
   wished to labor anxiously, and with painful and difficult exertion, to
   gain a victory for us in his own person. But now, when the trembling is
   allayed, and the fear is subdued, that he may again present a voluntary
   sacrifice to the Father, he not only does not retire or conceal
   himself, but cheerfully advances to death.

   47. While he was still speaking. The Evangelists are careful to state
   that our Lord foresaw what happened; from which it might be inferred,
   that he was not dragged to death by external violence, except so far as
   wicked men carried into execution the secret purpose of God. Although,
   therefore, a melancholy and frightful spectacle was exhibited to the
   disciples, yet they received, at the same time, grounds of confidence
   to confirm them, since the event itself showed that nothing occurred by
   chance; and since Christ's prediction directed them to contemplate the
   glory of his divinity. The circumstance of an armed multitude having
   been sent by the chief priests, and of a captain and band having been
   obtained by request from Pilate, makes it evident, that an evil
   conscience wounded and tormented them, so that they did every thing in
   a state of terror. For what need was there for so great a force to take
   Christ, who, they were aware, was not provided with any defensive arms?
   The reason for such careful preparation was, that the divine power of
   Christ, which they had been compelled to feel by numerous proofs,
   inwardly tormented them; but, on the other hand, it is a display of
   amazing rage, that, relying on the power of arms, they do not hesitate
   to rise up against God.

   48. Now he who betrayed him. I have no doubt that Judas was restrained,
   either by reverence for our Lord, or by shame for his crime, from
   venturing openly to avow himself as one of the enemies; and the warning
   which, Mark tells us, he gave the soldiers -- to lead the away
   cautiously, was given, I conjecture, for this reason, that he
   recollected the numerous-proofs by which Christ had formerly attested
   his divine power. But it was, at the same time, astonishing madness,
   either to attempt to conceal himself by frivolous hypocrisy, when he
   came into the presence of the Son of God, or to oppose the tricks and
   dexterity of men to his boundless power.

   49. Hail, Rabbi. I have no doubt that Judas, as if trembling for his
   Master's danger, pretended by these words to have some feeling of
   compassion; and, accordingly, in Mark a pathetic repetition is
   expressed, [213] Rabbi, Rabbi. For though he was impressed with the
   majesty of Christ, still the devil so fascinated his mind, that he felt
   assured that his treachery was concealed by a kiss, and by soothing
   words. This salutation, or exclamation, therefore, was a pretense of
   compassion. I offer the same opinion about the kiss; for though it was
   a very common practice among the Jews to welcome friends with a kiss,
   yet as Judas had left Christ but a little before, he seems now -- as if
   he had become suddenly alarmed at his danger -- to give the last kiss
   to his Master. Thus he excels the rest in the appearance of affection,
   when he appears to be deeply grieved at being separated from his
   Master; but how little he gained by his deception is evident from
   Christ's reply.

   50. Friend, for what purpose comest thou? Luke expresses it more fully:
   Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? except that there is
   greater force in this reproof, that the benevolence of his Master, and
   the very high honor conferred on him, are wickedly abused for the
   purpose of the basest treachery. For Christ does not employ an ironical
   address when he calls him friend, but charges him with ingratitude,
   that, from being an intimate friend, who sat at his table, he had
   become a traitor, as had been predicted in the psalm: If a stranger had
   done this, I could have endured it; but now my private and familiar
   friend, with whom I took food pleasantly, who accompanied me to the
   temple of the Lord, hath prepared snares against me. [214] This shows
   clearly--what I hinted a little ago--that, whatever may be the
   artifices by which hypocrites conceal themselves, and whatever may be
   the pretenses which they hold out, when they come into the presence of
   the Lord, their crimes become manifest; and it even becomes the ground
   of a severer sentence against them, that, having been admitted into the
   bosom of Christ, they treacherously rise up against him. For the word
   friend, as we have stated, contains within itself a sharp sting.

   Let us know that this evil, which Christ once sustained in his own
   person, is an evil to which the Church will always be exposed--that of
   cherishing traitors in her bosom; and, therefore, it was said a little
   before, The traitor approached, who was one of the twelve, that we may
   not be immediately distressed by such instances; for the Lord intends
   to try our faith in both ways, when, without, Satan opposes us and the
   Church by open enemies, and, within, he attempts secret destruction by
   means of hypocrites. We are taught, at the same time, that we who are
   his disciples ought to worship God with sincerity; for the apostasies,
   which we see every day, excite us to fear, and to the cultivation of
   true godliness, as Paul says,

   Let every one that calleth on the name of God depart from iniquity,
   (2 Timothy 2:19.)

   We are all commanded to kiss the Son of God, (Psalm 2:12;) and we
   ought, therefore, to see that no one give him a traitor's kiss,
   otherwise it will cost us dear to have been elevated to so great an
   honor.

   51. And, lo, one of those who were with Jesus, stretching out his hand,
   drew his sword, and, striking the servant of the high priest, cut off
   his ear. 52. Then Jesus said to him, Put thy sword again into its
   place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.
   53. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he will
   grant to me more than twelve legions of angels? 54. How then shall the
   scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 55. At that hour [215]
   Jesus said to the multitudes, You are come out, as against a robber,
   with swords and clubs to seize me. I sat daily with you, teaching in
   the temple, and you did not take me. 56. But all this was done, that
   the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the
   disciples forsook him, and fled.

   47. But one of those who were present drew his sword, and struck the
   servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 48. And Jesus
   answering said to them, Are you come out, as against a robber, with
   swords and clubs to seize me? 49. I was daily with you in the temple
   teaching, and you did not seize me. But (this was done,) that the
   scriptures might be fulfilled. [216] 50. And they all forsook him, and
   fled. 51. And a young man followed him, having a linen cloth wrapped
   about his naked body; and the young men seized him. 52. And he left the
   linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

   49. And those who were around him, seeing what would happen, said to
   him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? 50. And one of them struck a
   servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 51. And Jesus
   answering said, Permit it to be thus far; and, having touched his ear,
   he healed him. 52. And Jesus said to those who had come to him, the
   chief priests, and rulers of the temple, and elders, Are you come out,
   as against a robber, with swords and clubs? 53. When I was daily with
   you in the temple, you did not lay hands on me; but this is your hour,
   and the power of darkness.


   Matthew 26:51. And, lo, one of those who were with Jesus. Luke says,
   that all the disciples made an agreement together to fight for their
   Master. Hence it is again evident, that we are much more courageous and
   ready for fighting than for bearing the cross; and, therefore, we ought
   always to deliberate wisely what the Lord commands, and what he
   requires from every one of us, lest the fervor of our zeal exceed the
   bounds of reason and moderation. When the disciples asked Christ, Shall
   we strike with the sword? they did so, not with the intention of
   obeying his injunction; but by these words they declared that they were
   prepared and ready to repel the violence of enemies. And, indeed, Peter
   did not wait till he was commanded or permitted to strike, but
   inconsiderately proceeded to unlawful violence. It appears, at first
   view, to be praiseworthy valor in the disciples, that, forgetting their
   own weakness, though they are unable to make resistance, they do not
   hesitate to present their bodies before their Master, and to encounter
   certain death; for they choose rather to perish with the Lord than to
   survive and look on while he is oppressed. But as they improperly
   attempt more than the calling of God commands or permits, their
   rashness is justly condemned; and therefore let us learn, that in order
   that our obedience may be acceptable to the Lord, we must depend on his
   will, so that no man shall move a finger, except so far as God
   commands. One reason ought, above all, to lead us to be zealous in
   cultivating this modesty; which is, that instead of a proper and
   well-regulated zeal, confused irregularity for the most part reigns in
   us.

   Peter's name is not mentioned here by the Evangelists; but John (18:10)
   assures us--and from what occurs shortly afterwards in the narrative it
   is evident -- that it was Peter who is here described, though the name
   is suppressed. Yet Luke enables us easily to infer that there were
   others also who took part in the same outrage; for Christ does not
   speak to one person only, but says to all alike, Permit [217] it to be
   thus far.

   52. Put thy sword again into its place. By these words, Christ confirms
   the precept of the Law, which forbids private individuals to use the
   sword. And above all, we ought to attend to the threatening of
   punishment which is immediately added; for men did not, at their own
   pleasure, appoint this punishment for avenging their own blood; but God
   himself, by severely prohibiting murder, has declared how dearly he
   loves mankind. First, then, he does not choose to be defended by force
   and violence, because God in the Law forbade men to strike. This is a
   general reason; and he immediately descends to a special reason.

   But here a question arises. Is it never lawful to use violence in
   repelling unjust violence? For though Peter had to deal with wicked and
   base robbers, still he is condemned for having drawn his sword. If, in
   such a case of moderate defense, an exception was not allowed, Christ
   appears to tie up the hands of all. Though we have treated this
   question more copiously [218] under Matthew 5:39, yet I shall now state
   my opinion again in a few words. First, we must make a distinction
   between a civil court and the court of conscience; [219] for if any man
   resist a robber, [220] he will not be liable to public punishment,
   because the laws arm him against one who is the common enemy of
   mankind. Thus, in every case when defense is made against unjust
   violence, the punishment which God enjoins earthly judges to carry into
   execution ceases. And yet it is not the mere goodness of the cause that
   acquits the conscience from guilt, unless there be also pure affection.
   So then, in order that a man may properly and lawfully defend himself,
   he must first lay aside excessive wrath, and hatred, and desire of
   revenge, and all irregular sallies of passion, that nothing tempestuous
   may mingle with the defense. As this is of rare occurrence, or rather,
   as it scarcely ever happens, Christ properly reminds his people of the
   general rule, that they should entirely abstain from using the sword.

   But there are fanatics who have foolishly misapplied this passage, so
   as to wrest the sword out of the hands of judges. They contend that it
   is unlawful to strike with the sword. This I acknowledge to be true,
   for no man is at liberty to take the sword at his own pleasure, so as
   to commit murder; but I deny that magistrates--who are God's ministers,
   and by whom he executes his judgments--ought to be viewed as belonging
   to the ordinary rank. And not only so, but by these words of Christ,
   this very power is expressly ascribed to them: for when he declares
   that murderers must be put to death, it follows, that the sword is put
   into the hands of judges, that they may take vengeance for unjust
   murders. It will sometimes happen, indeed, that men addicted to the
   shedding of blood are punished by other means; but this is the ordinary
   way in which the Lord determined that the fierce cruelty of wicked men
   should be restrained from rioting with impunity. Certain doctors of
   what is called Canon Law have ventured to proceed to such a pitch of
   impudence as to teach, that the sword was not taken from Peter, but he
   was commanded to keep it sheathed until the time came for drawing it;
   and hence we perceive how grossly and shamefully those dogs have
   sported with the word of God.

   53. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father? Now follows that
   special reason which I mentioned a little ago; for Christ reminds them,
   that he would have at his command a better and more legitimate kind of
   defense, were it not that he must obey the decree of the Father. The
   substance of what he says is this. "As he has been appointed by the
   eternal purpose of God to be a sacrifice, and as this has been declared
   by the predictions of Scripture, he must not fight against it." Thus
   Peter's rashness is condemned on another ground, that he not only
   endeavors to overturn a heavenly decree, but also to obstruct the path
   of the redemption of mankind. Not only did Peter draw his sword
   unlawfully, but the disciples were foolish and mad; for--though they
   were few in number, and feeble--they attempted to make some resistance
   to a band of soldiers and a very great multitude. On this account, the
   Lord, in order to make their folly more manifest, employs this
   comparison. "If he wished to have a guard to defend his life, he would
   immediately obtain not eleven angels, but a large and invincible army,
   and since he does not implore that angels may be sent to assist him,
   much less would he resort to ill-considered means, from which no
   advantage was to be expected; for the utmost that could be effected by
   the disciples would be of no more service than if a few rooks were to
   make a noise."

   But here some commentators labor to no purpose in inquiring how Christ
   could have obtained a commission of angels from his Father, by whose
   decree it was that he had to suffer death. For the two things are
   inconsistent: that he exposed his Son to death naked and defenseless,
   because it was necessary that it should be so, and because it had been
   appointed; and yet, that he might have been prevailed on by prayer to
   send him relief. But Christ speaks conditionally, that he has a far
   better method of defending his life, were it not that the will of the
   Father was opposed to it. This takes away all contradiction, for Christ
   refrained from presenting such a request to his Father, because he knew
   that it was contrary to his decree. Yet from this we draw a useful
   doctrine, that those who resort to unlawful means on the plea of
   necessity pour dishonor on God. If a man is destitute of lawful aid and
   support, he runs headlong to wicked schemes and sinful undertakings;
   and the reason is, that few look for the secret protection of God,
   which alone ought to be sufficient to set our minds at rest. Are we
   threatened with danger? Because no remedy can be discovered according
   to the flesh, we make this or the other contrivance, as if there were
   no angels in heaven, who -- Scripture frequently tells us -- are placed
   as guardians for our salvation, (Hebrews 1:14.) In this way we deprive
   ourselves of their assistance; for all who are impelled, by their
   restlessness and excessive anxiety, to stretch out their hands to
   forbidden remedies for evils, do unquestionably renounce the providence
   of God.

   54. How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled? By this expression
   Christ means, that he ought not to attempt any method of escaping
   death, to which he knew that he was called by the Father. For himself,
   indeed, he had no need of the Scriptures to inform him that God had
   appointed that he should die at that time; but because mortals do not
   know what God has determined to do until it be revealed by his word,
   Christ, with a view to his disciples, properly refers to the testimony
   which God gave of his will. We know that whatever affliction happens to
   us, it is inflicted by God himself; but since we are uncertain as to
   the result, when we seek remedies which he allows, we do not rise
   against his government; but when his will has been ascertained, nothing
   more remains for us than to acquiesce. Though in this passage Christ
   teaches nothing more than that he ought patiently to suffer death,
   because the Scriptures have declared that it must be so, yet the use of
   this doctrine is evidently more extensive, namely, that Scripture is a
   sufficient bridle for subduing the rebellion of the flesh; because God
   points out to us what is his. will for the very purpose of keeping us
   in subjection to his will. Accordingly, Paul ascribes to Scripture this
   office, that it trains us to patience, (Romans 15:4,) and supplies us
   with all the comfort that we need in adversity. His reproof of the
   disciples, as given by Luke, is more brief, Permit them to do thus far;
   but still he severely condemns their presumption, in having gone so far
   as to perform an unlawful action, though at the same time he holds out
   a hope of pardon, if they suppress their improper zeal, and proceed no
   farther.

   Luke 22:51. And having touched his ear, he healed him. By his foolish
   zeal Peter had brought grievous reproach on his Master and his
   doctrine; and there can be no doubt, that this was a contrivance by
   which Satan attempted to involve the Gospel in eternal disgrace, as if
   Christ had kept company with assassins and seditious persons for
   revolutionary purposes. This, I think, was the reason why Christ healed
   the wound which Peter had inflicted. But a fearful and amazing
   stupidity must have seized his adversaries, who were not at all
   affected by having seen such a miracle. And yet there is the less
   reason to wonder that they did not see the power of Christ displayed in
   the person of another, when, after having themselves been laid
   prostrate by his voice, they still continued to rage, (John 18:6.) Such
   is the spirit of giddiness by which Satan maddens the reprobate, when
   the Lord has given them over to blindness. Above all, in the person
   himself who was healed, there is a striking instance of ingratitude;
   for neither did the divine power of Christ subdue him to repentance for
   his hardness, nor was he overcome by kindness so as to be changed from
   an enemy into a disciple. For it is a foolish imagination of the monks
   that he was also healed in his soul, that the work of Christ might not
   be left incomplete; as if the goodness of God were not every day poured
   out on those who are unworthy.

   Matthew 26:55. Are you come out, as against a robber? By these words
   Christ expostulates with his enemies for having intended to bring odium
   upon him, by coming provided with a great body of soldiers; for the
   meaning is this, "What necessity was there for making such a display of
   arms against me, as if your object had been to overcome some robber?
   But I have always lived peaceably amongst you, and without using arms;
   and when I was teaching in the temple, you might easily have seized me
   without any military force." Yet, while he complains of their malice in
   violently rushing upon him, as if he were a seditious man, he again
   wounds their evil conscience by reminding them, that though they had a
   traitor for their leader, they approached him with trembling, and with
   many marks of distrust.

   56. Now all this was done. The other two Evangelists express it
   somewhat differently; for what Matthew relates in his own person, Mark
   appears to attribute to Christ.Luke employs even different words: this
   is your hour, and the power of darkness. But the design of the Holy
   Spirit is, beyond all doubt, that whatever may be the contrivances of
   wicked men, nothing whatever has been done but by the will and
   providence of God; for as he had said a little before, God has
   testified nothing by the prophets but what he had determined with
   himself, (Luke 22:3.) First, therefore, we are here informed, that
   whatever may be the unbridled rage by which Satan and all ungodly men
   are actuated, still the hand of God always prevails, so as to draw them
   reluctantly wherever he pleases. Secondly, we are informed, that though
   wicked men fulfill what was predicted in the Scriptures; yet, since God
   does not employ them as his lawful ministers, but directs them, by a
   secret movement, to that which was farthest from their wish, they are
   not excusable; and that, while God makes a righteous use of their
   malice, blame still attaches to them. At the same time, let us observe
   that Christ said this in order to remove the offense, which would
   otherwise have greatly disturbed weak minds, when they saw him so
   reproached and outraged.

   Still Christ intended not only to promote the advantage of his
   disciples, but also to repress the pride of his adversaries, that they
   might not triumph as if they had achieved victory. For this reason, in
   Luke's narrative he says, this is your hour; by which he means that the
   Lord grants them this liberty for a short time. The power of darkness
   denotes the power of the devil, and this term had also a strong
   tendency to abase their glory; for though they exalt themselves ever so
   much, Christ shows that they are still nothing more than the slaves of
   the devil. While all things are mingled in confusion, and while the
   devil, by spreading darkness abroad, appears to overturn the whole
   order of the world, let us know that the providence of God shines above
   in heaven, to bring at length to order what is confused; and let us,
   therefore, learn to raise the eyes of faith to that calm sky. Then all
   the disciples forsook him, and fled. Hence we may again infer how much
   more ready they were to fight rashly than to follow their Master.

   Mark 14:51. And a young man. How some persons have come to dream that
   this was John [221] I know not, nor is it of much importance to
   inquire. The chief point is, to ascertain for what purpose Mark has
   related this transaction. I think that his object was, to inform us
   that those wicked men -- as usually happens in riotous assemblies
   stormed and raved without shame or modesty; which appeared from their
   seizing a young man who was unknown to them, and not suspected of any
   crime, so that he had difficulty in escaping out of their hands naked.
   For it is probable that the young man, who is mentioned, had some
   attachment to Christ, and, on hearing the tumult by night, without
   stopping to put on his clothes, and covered only with a linen garment,
   came either to discover their traps, or, at least, that he might not be
   wanting in a duty of friendship. [222] We certainly perceive -- as I
   just now said -- that those wicked men raged with cruel violence, when
   they did not even spare a poor young man, who had left his bed, almost
   naked, and run, on hearing the noise.

   followed him at a distance, as far as to the court of the high priest,
   and having gone in, he sat with the servants to see the end. 59. And
   the chief priests and elders, and the whole council, sought false

   two false witnesses, 61. Who said, This man said, I can destroy the

   along with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. 55. And the

   put him to death, and found none. 56. For many bore false witness
   against him, but their declarations did not agree. 57. Then some arose,
   and bore false witness against him, saying, 58. We have heard him say,
   I will destroy this temple, which was made with hands, and within three
   days I will build another, made without hands. 59. But even here their
   testimony did not agree.

   54. And, having seized him, they led and brought him to the house of
   the high priest; and Peter followed at a distance.


   Luke follows a different order from Matthew and Mark in the narrative;
   but when we come to the proper place, we will endeavor to reconcile the
   points in which they differ. It will be proper, in the meantime, to
   glance briefly at those things which claim our attention in the words
   of Matthew and Mark. First, in order to remove the offense of the
   cross, we ought to consider the advantage which we have derived from
   Christ's emptying of himself, (Philippians 2:7;) for thus will the
   inestimable goodness of God, and the efficacy of his grace, be found to
   remove by its brightness every thing in it that was disagreeable or
   shameful. According to the flesh, it was disgraceful that the Son of
   God should be seized, bound, and made a prisoner; but when we reflect
   that by his chains we are loosed from the tyranny of the devil, and
   from the condemnation in which we were involved before God, not only is
   the stumbling-block, on which our faith might have struck, removed out
   of the way, but in place of it there comes an admiration of the
   boundless grace of God, who set so high a value on our deliverance, as
   to give up his only-begotten Son to be bound by wicked men. This will
   also be a pledge of the astonishing love of Christ towards us, that he
   spared not himself, but willingly submitted to wear fetters on his
   flesh, that our souls might be freed from fetters of a far worse
   description.

   Matthew 26:57. But they who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas.
   Though the Jews had been deprived of what is called, the higher
   jurisdiction, there still lingered among them some vestiges of that
   judicial authority which the Law confers on the high priest,
   (Deuteronomy 1:8;) so that, while they had lost the absolute authority,
   [223] they retained the power of administering moderate correction.
   This is the reason why Christ is brought before the high priest to be
   interrogated; not that a final sentence may be pronounced on him by
   theft tribunal, but that the priests may afterwards present him before
   the governor, under the aggravating influence of their decision. [224]
   Caiaphas the high priest was also named Joseph, and this man--as we are
   told by the historian Josephus--was appointed to be high priest by
   Valerius Gratus, governor of Judea, when Simon, the son of Camithus,
   was deposed from that office. [225] The Evangelists give his surname
   only, [226] perhaps because he was more generally named, and better
   known, by it.

   Matthew says that the priests assembled in the house of Caiaphas; and
   that they were already assembled at midnight, before Christ was
   brought, but because the place of meeting had been appointed, that, as
   soon as the information reached them, they might meet hastily at an
   early hour in the morning; though we have lately seen that some who
   belonged to the order of the priesthood went out by night, along with
   the soldiers, to seize Christ. But we have frequently seen, in other
   passages, that the Evangelists were not very exact in adhering to the
   order of time. In this passage, certainly, they had no other object in
   view than to show that the Son of God was oppressed by a wicked
   conspiracy of the whole council. And here a frightful and hideous
   spectacle is placed before our eyes; for nowhere else than at Jerusalem
   was there at that time either a temple of God, or lawful worship, or
   the face of a Church. The high priest was a figure of the only Mediator
   between God and men; those who sat along with him in the council
   represented the whole Church of God; and yet all of them unite in
   conspiring to extinguish the only hope Of salvation. But as it had been
   declared by prediction of David, that

   the stone which the builders rejected would nevertheless become the
   head-stone of the corner, (Psalm 118:22;)

   and as Isaiah had foretold that

   the God of armies would be to the whole people of Israel a stone of
   stumbling, on which they would dash themselves,
   (Isaiah 8:14)

   the Lord wisely made provision that such wickedness of men should not
   perplex believing souls.

   59. Sought false witness. By these words the Evangelists remark, that
   nothing was farther from the design of the priests than to inquire into
   the cause, so that, when the matter was thoroughly understood, they
   might decide what was proper. For they had previously resolved to put
   Christ to death, and now they only seek a pretense for oppressing him.
   Now it is impossible that equity can have any place where an
   examination of the cause is not the first step. In seeking false
   witnesses, their treacherous cruelty is manifested; and when, after
   being disappointed of their expectation, they still do not desist, this
   affords a still more striking display of their blinded obstinacy. Thus,
   amidst the darkness of their rage, the innocence of the Son of God
   shone so brightly, that the devils themselves might know that he died
   innocent.

   It ought to be observed, also, that the appellation of false witnesses
   is applied not to those who contrive a lie which had no foundation, but
   to those who calumniously pervert what was justly said, and turn it
   into a crime; an instance of which is here expressly related as to the
   destruction and rebuilding of the temple. Christ had indeed said, that
   when

   the temple of his body was destroyed,
   he would raise it up within three days, (John 2:19.)

   The false witnesses do not now resort to some new contrivance, but they
   put a wrong interpretation on his words, as if he boasted that he would
   practice some juggling in building the temple. Now as the calumny was
   trivial and worthless, we may readily infer from it how greatly the
   priests and scribes were blinded by their fury, since, without any
   pretext, they demand that Christ shall be put to death.

   62. And the high priest, rising up, said to him, [227] Answerest thou
   nothing? What is it that those men testify against thee? 63. And Jesus
   was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by
   the living God, that thou tell us if thou art the Christ, the Son of
   God. 64. Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said it; but yet I tell you,
   hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of
   power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 65. Then the high priest
   rent his clothes, saying, He hath blasphemed; what further need have we
   of witnesses? lo now you have heard his blasphemy. 66. What think you?
   And they answering said, He is worthy of death. 67. Then they spat in
   his face, and gave him blows; [228] and others struck him on the face
   with the palms of their hands, 68. Saying, Prophesy to us Christ, Who
   was it that smote thee?

   60. And the high priest, rising up in the midst, interrogated Jesus,
   saying, Answerest thou nothing? What is it that those men testify
   against thee? 61. But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the
   high priest interrogated, and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son
   of the Blessed? [229] 62. And Jesus said, I am; and you shall see the
   Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds
   of heaven. 63. And the high priest rent his garments, and said, What
   further need have we of witnesses? 64. You have heard the blasphemy:
   what think you? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
   65. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face with a veil,
   and to give him blows, and to say to him, Divine. [230] And the
   servants gave him blows.

   63. And the men who held Jesus mocked him, and struck him; 64. And,
   having blindfolded him, struck him on the face. And they interrogated
   him, saying, Prophesy, Who is it that struck thee? 65. And many other
   abusive things they spoke against him. 66. And as soon as it was day,
   the elders of the people, and chief priests, and scribes, assembled,
   and led him into their council, 67. Saying, Art thou the Christ? Tell
   us. And he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe. 68. And
   if I also put a question, you will not answer me, nor let me go.
   69. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit at the right hand of the power
   of God. 70. And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? He said,
   [231] You say that I am. 71. And they said, What further testimony do
   we need? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.


   Matthew 26:62. And the high priest, rising up. It is certain that
   Christ was silent when false witnesses pressed hard upon him, not only
   because they did not deserve a reply, but because he did not seek to be
   now acquitted, knowing that his hour was come. But Caiaphas triumphs
   over him on account of his silence, as if he was struck dumb by being
   vanquished; which is usually the case with men who are conscious of
   having done wrong. But it is an instance of extreme wickedness that he
   insinuates that Christ is not free from blame, because witnesses speak
   against him. The question, What is it that those men testify against
   thee? amounts to this: "How comes it that those men oppose thee, but
   because they are urged by conscientious views? For they would not have
   appeared against thee without a good reason." As if he did not know
   that those witnesses had been procured by fraud: but this is the way in
   which wicked men, when they find themselves in the possession of
   authority and power, throw off sham and indulge in arrogance. Christ
   was again silent, not only because the objection was frivolous, but
   because, having been appointed to be a sacrifice, he had thrown aside
   all anxiety about defending himself.

   63. I adjure thee by the living God. The high priest thought that this
   alone was a crime sufficient to condemn Christ, if he professed that he
   was the Christ. But since they all boasted of expecting redemption from
   Christ, he ought first to have inquired if such was the fact. That
   there would be a Christ, by whose hands the people were to be
   delivered, they would not have ventured to deny. Jesus came publicly
   forward, bearing the title of the Christ. Why do they not consider the
   fact itself? Why do they not examine the signs, by means of which a
   correct decision might have been formed? But, having already determined
   to put Christ to death, they are satisfied with this pretense of
   sacrilege, that he claimed for himself the glory of Divinity. And yet
   Caiaphas examines the matter on oath, as if he had been prepared to
   yield as soon as it was fully ascertained; but all the while his whole
   mind is filled with a malicious hatred and contempt of Christ, and is
   so blinded by pride and ambition, that he takes for granted, that as
   soon as the fact has been ascertained, without inquiring whether it is
   right or wrong, he will have just grounds for condemning him.

   If thou art the Christ, the Son of God. From the words of Caiaphas we
   may infer, that it was at that time common among the Jews to bestow on
   the Messiah the title of the Son of God; for this form of interrogation
   could not have originated in any other way than from the ordinary
   custom; and, indeed, they had learned from the predictions of Scripture
   that he was not less the Son of God than the Son of David. It appears,
   too, that Caiaphas employed this epithet, with the view either of
   terrifying Christ, or of exciting a prejudice against him; as if he had
   said, "See where you are going; for you cannot call yourself the
   Christ, without claiming, at the same time, the appellation of Son of
   God, with which Scripture honors him." Such is also his reason for
   using the word Blessed, which Mark gives instead of God; for this
   pretended reverence [232] for God was intended to bring a heavier
   charge against Christ than that of profaning the holy name of God.

   64. Thou hast said it. Luke inserts another reply, by which Christ
   reproves the malice of the priests, in not inquiring with a desire to
   know. If I tell you, says he, you will not believe: by which words he
   means, that though he were to prove to them a hundred times that he was
   the Christ, it would be of no avail with obstinate men. For they had
   not only heard, but had beheld with their eyes miracles, which, though
   Christ had been silent, would have confirmed his heavenly and divine
   power, and would even have cried aloud, that he was the promised
   Redeemer.

   He next adds a confession, which, though it is related in many words by
   Matthew, does not convey a different meaning. Jesus affirms that he is
   the Christ, not for the purpose of avoiding death, but rather of
   inflaming the rage of his enemies against him. Though at that time he
   was exposed to contempt, and almost annihilated, by his mean garb, he
   announces, that at the proper time he will at length come with royal
   majesty, that they may tremble before the Judge, whom they now refuse
   to acknowledge as the Author of salvation. The meaning therefore is,
   that they are widely mistaken, if from his present appearance they form
   a judgment of what he is; because it is necessary that he should be
   humbled, and almost reduced to nothing, before he appear adorned with
   the emblems of his royal power, and with magnificent splendor. For by
   this word hereafter he distinguishes between his first and second
   coming.

   We may draw from this a useful doctrine, which is still more extensive.
   For how comes it that wicked men are so much at their ease? How comes
   it that they are so insolent in rebellion, but because they do not set
   a high value on the crucified Jesus? It is therefore necessary to
   remind them of a dreadful judgment, which, with all their stupidity,
   they will not be able to avoid. And though they ridicule as a fable
   what is said about the future coming of Christ, still it is not in vain
   that the Judge summons them to his tribunal and orders them to be
   summoned by the preaching of the Gospel, that they may be rendered the
   more inexcusable. But this announcement is fitted to be of very great
   use even to believers, that they may now with the eyes of hope look for
   Christ sitting at the right hand of the father, and patiently wait till
   he comes, and may likewise believe that the rage of wicked men against
   him, while absent, will not be without its consequences; for they will
   be compelled to behold him on high coming from heaven, whom now they
   not only despise, but even trample upon in their pride.

   Sitting at the right hand of power. The metaphor contained in the term
   right hand must be well known, for it frequently occurs in Scripture.
   Christ then sits at the right hand of the Father, because he is his
   deputy; and it is called the right hand or power, a, because it is only
   through the agency of his Son that God now displays his power, and will
   execute judgment at the last day.

   65. Then the high priest rent his garments. By this we see how little
   advantage was derived by wicked men from the miracles by which Christ
   had proved his Divinity. But we need not wonder, that under the mean
   garb of a servant, the Son of God was despised by those who were
   unmoved by any anxiety about the promised salvation. For if they had
   not entirely laid aside every pious feeling, their deplorable condition
   ought to have led them to look anxiously for the Redeemer; but when
   they now, without making any inquiry, reject him when offered to them,
   do they not as far as lies in their power, destroy all the promises of
   God? The high priest first pronounces Christ to be a blasphemer, to
   which the others afterwards assent. The rending of the clothes plainly
   shows how boldly and wickedly those who profanely despise God make
   false pretensions of zeal. It would indeed have been praiseworthy in
   the high priest, if he heard the name of God shamefully profaned, not
   only to feel inward resentment and excruciating pain, but to make an
   open display of his detestation; but while he refused to make inquiry,
   he contrived an unfounded charge of blasphemy. And yet, this
   treacherous hypocrite, while he assumed a character which did not
   belong to him, taught the servants of God with what severity of
   displeasure they ought to regard blasphemies, and condemned by his
   example the shameful cowardice of those who are no more affected by an
   outrage on religion, than if they heard buffoons uttering their silly
   jokes.

   Then they spat in his face. Either Luke has inverted the order of the
   narrative, or our Lord twice endured this highly contemptuous
   treatment. The latter supposition appears to me to be probable. And
   yet, I have no doubt that the servants were emboldened to spit on
   Christ, and to strike him with greater insolence, after they had seen
   that the council, so far as their decision had influence, condemned him
   to death. The object of all these expressions of contempt was, to show
   that nothing was more unlikely than that he should be a prince of
   prophets, who, in consequence of being blindfolded, [233] was not able
   even to ward off blows. But this insolence was turned by the providence
   of God to a very different purpose; for the face of Christ, dishonored
   by spitting and blows, has restored to us that image which had been
   disfigured, and almost effaced, by sin.

   69. Now Peter was sitting without in the court. And a maid cam to him,
   saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean. 70. But he denied
   before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 71. And as he was
   going out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to those who
   were there, This man also was with Jesus the Nazarene. 72. And again he
   denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 73. After a little came
   those who were standing by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one
   of them; for thou are convicted by thy speech. 74. Then he began to
   curse and to swear, that he did not know the man. And immediately the
   cock crew. 75. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, who had told
   him, Before the cock crow, thou wilt thrice deny me. And he went out,
   and wept bitterly.

   66. And while Peter was below in the court, one of the maids of the
   high priest came; 67. And when she saw peter warming himself, she
   looked at him, and said, Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene.
   68. But he denied, saying, I know him not, [234] nor do I understand
   what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.
   69. And the maid, when she saw him again, began to say to those that
   stood by, This is one of them 70. But he denied it again. And a little
   after, those that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of
   them; for thou art also a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth with it.
   71. But he began to curse and to swear, (saying) I know not that man of
   whom you speak. 72. And the second time the cock crew; and Peter
   remembered the word which Jesus had spoken to him, Before the cock crow
   twice, thou wilt thrice deny me; and he began to weep. [235]

   55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and had
   sat down together, Peter also sat down and amongst them. 56. And when a
   certain maid saw him sitting near the fire, she fixed her eyes upon
   him, and said, This man also was with him. 57. But he denied him,
   saying, Woman, I do not know him. 58. And after a little while, another
   person, seeing him, said, Thou also wast one of them. But Peter said,
   Man, I am not. 59. And after the lapse of about an hour, another
   affirmed, saying, Undoubtedly this man was also with him; for he is a
   Galilean. 60. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
   immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crew. 61. And the
   Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the
   Lord, how he said to him, Before the cock crow, thou wilt thrice deny
   me. 62. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.


   Peter's fall, which is here related, is a bright mirror of our
   weakness. In his repentance, also, a striking instance of the goodness
   and mercy of God is held out to us. This narrative, therefore, which
   relates to a single individual, contains a doctrine which may be
   applied to the whole Church, and which indeed is highly useful, both to
   instruct those who are standing to cherish anxiety and fear, and to
   comfort those who have fallen, by holding out to them the hope of
   pardon. And first it ought to be observed, that Peter acted
   inconsiderately, when he entered into the hall of the high priest. It
   was his duty, no doubt, to follow his Master; but having been warned
   that he would revolt, he ought rather to have concealed himself in some
   corner, so as not to expose himself to an occasion of sinning. Thus it
   frequently happens that believers, under an appearance of virtue, throw
   themselves within the reach of temptation.

   It is therefore our duty to pray to the Lord to restrain and keep us by
   his Spirit, lest, going beyond our measure, we be immediately punished.
   We ought also to pray, whenever we commence any undertaking, that he
   may not permit us to fail in the midst of our efforts, or at the
   beginning of the work, but may supply us with strength from heaven till
   the end. Conviction of our weakness ought not, indeed, to be a reason
   for indolence, to prevent us from going wherever God calls us; but it
   ought to restrain our rashness, that we may not attempt any thing
   beyond our calling; and it ought also to stimulate us to prayer, that
   God, who has given us grace to begin well, may also continue to give us
   grace to persevere.

   Matthew 26:69. A maid came to him. Here we see that there is no
   necessity for a severe contest, or for many forces or implements of
   war, to overpower a man; for any man, who is not supported by the hand
   of God, will instantly fall by a slight gale or the rustling of a
   falling leaf. Peter undoubtedly was not less courageous than any of us,
   and he had already given no ordinary proof of his valor, though it was
   exercised in a rash and improper manner; and yet he does not wait until
   he is dragged before the tribunal of the high priest, or until his
   enemies attempt to put him to death by violence, but, terrified by a
   woman's voice, immediately denies his Master. And yet but lately he
   thought himself a valiant soldier even to death. Let us therefore
   remember that our strength is so far from being sufficient to resist
   powerful attacks, that it will give way, when there is the mere shadow
   of a battle. But in this way God gives us the just reward of our
   treachery, when he disarms and strips us of all power, so that, when we
   have thrown off the fear of him, we tremble for a mere nothing. For if
   a deep fear of God had dwelt in Peter's heart, it would have been an
   invincible fortress; but now, naked and defenseless, he trembles while
   he is still far from danger.

   70. But he denied before them all. This circumstance aggravates the
   criminality of Peter, that, in denying his Master, he did not even
   dread a multitude of witnesses. [236] And the Spirit intended expressly
   to state this, that even the presence of men may excite us to hold fast
   the confession of faith. For if we deny Christ before the weak, they
   are shaken by our example, and give way; and thus we destroy as many
   souls as we can; but if, in presence of those who wickedly despise God
   and oppose the Gospel, we withhold from Christ the testimony which is
   due to him, we expose his sacred name to the ridicule of all. In short,
   as a bold and open confession edifies all the godly, [237] and puts
   unbelievers to shame, so apostasy draws along with it the public ruin
   of faith in the Church, and the reproach of sound doctrine. The more
   eminent a man is, therefore, he ought to be the more careful to be on
   his guard; for his elevation makes it impossible for him to fall from
   it without doing greater harm.

   I know not what thou sayest. The form of denial, which is here set
   down, shows sufficiently that the wretched sophists, who endeavor to
   escape by ambiguous expressions, which they turn to a. variety of
   meanings, when they are called to give an account of their faith, gain
   nothing by their dexterity in fraud. Peter does not absolutely deny the
   whole doctrine of the Gospel; he only denies that he knew the man; but,
   because in the person of Christ he indirectly buries the light of the
   promised redemption, he is charged with base and shameful treachery.
   But lately he had heard from the mouth of the Lord, that the confession
   of faith is a sacrifice acceptable to God; and therefore a mode of
   denying, which withholds from God his lawful worship, and from Christ
   the honor that is due to him, admits of no excuse. Let us therefore
   hold:, that as soon as we depart from a plain and candid profession of
   Christ, we deprive him of the testimony to which he has a lawful claim.

   71. Another maid saw him. From the words of Mark we are rather led to
   conjecture that it was the same maid; at least he doesn't state that it
   was a different maid from the former one. But there is no contradiction
   here; for it is probable that the statement which proceeded from one
   maid, flew from the lips of one to those of another, so that the first
   maid pointed him out to many persons and at several times, and others
   joined her in asserting that he was the person, and in spreading the
   discovery of him more widely. John even relates (18:25) that, at the
   second time, the question was put to Peter, not by a maid, but by a
   multitude of men; from which it is evident that the word, which had
   been pronounced by the maid, was caught by the men standing by, who
   attacked Peter.

   There is another difference between Mark and the other three
   Evangelists; for he mentions that the cock crew twice, while they say
   that the cock crew not until after Peter had thrice denied our Lord.
   But this difficulty is easily obviated; for Mark says nothing that is
   inconsistent with the narrative of the other Evangelists, but explains
   more fully what they pass by in silence. Indeed, I have no doubt that,
   when Christ said to Peter, before the cock crow, he meant the
   cock-crowing, [238] which includes many crowings; for cocks do not
   merely crow once, but repeat their crowings many times; and yet all the
   crowings of a single watch are called but one cock-crowing. So then,
   Matthew, Luke, and John, say that Peter thrice denied our Lord before
   the cock-crowing was ended. Mark states more distinctly one
   circumstance, that within a short space of time Peter was brought even
   to the third denial, and that, though he had been warned by the first
   crowing, he did not repent. None of us will say that profane historians
   are inconsistent with each other, when some one of them relates what
   the others have not touched; and, therefore, though Mark's narrative is
   different, still it does not contradict the others.

   72. And the second time he denied with an oath. It deserves attention,
   that Peter, after finding that he could not escape by a simple denial,
   doubles his crime by adding an oath; and a little after, when he is
   still more vehemently pressed, he proceeds even to cursing. Hence we
   infer that a sinner, after having once fallen, is always hurried on
   from bad to worse; so that those who begin with ordinary offenses
   afterwards rush headlong into the basest crimes, from which at first
   they would have recoiled with horror. And this is the just vengeance of
   God, after we have deprived ourselves of the assistance of the Holy
   Spirit, to allow Satan a violent exercise of power over us, that,
   having subdued and made us his slaves, he may drive us wherever he
   pleases. But this happens chiefly in a denial of the faith; for when a
   man, through fear of the cross, has turned aside from a pure profession
   of the gospel, if he perceive that his enemies are not yet satisfied,
   will proceed farther, and what he had not ventured fully to acknowledge
   he denies flatly with an oath, and without any ambiguity of words.

   We ought also to observe, that almost in a single moment Peter thrice
   gave way; for this shows how unsteady we are, and how liable to fall,
   whenever Satan drives us. Certainly we shall never cease to fall, if
   the Lord do not stretch out his hand to uphold us. When the rigor of
   the grace of Christ was extinguished in Peter, whoever might afterwards
   meet hit and interrogate him about Christ, he would have been ready to
   deny a hundred or a thousand times. Although, then, it was very base in
   him to fall thrice, yet the Lord spared him by restraining the tongues
   of enemies from making additional attacks upon him. Thus, also, it is
   every day necessary for the Lord to bridle Satan, lest he overwhelm us
   with innumerable temptations; for though he does not cease to employ
   many instruments in assailing us, were it not that the Lord, paying
   regard to our weakness, restrains the violence of his rage, we would
   have to contend against a prodigious amount of temptations. In this
   respect, therefore, we ought to praise the mercy of the Lord, who does
   not permit our enemy to make advances against us, almost the hundredth
   part of what he would desire.

   74. Then he began to curse and to swear. In this third denial, Peter's
   unfaithfulness to his Master reached its utmost height. Not satisfied
   with swearing, he breaks out into cursing, by which he abandons his
   body and soul to destruction; for he prays that the curse of God may
   fall upon him, if he knows Christ. It is as much as if he had said, May
   I perish miserably, if I have any thing in common with the salvation of
   God! So much the more ought we to admire the goodness of Christ, who
   rescued his disciple from such fatal ruin, and healed him. Now this
   passage shows, that when a man falling through weakness of the flesh,
   denies the truth though he knows it, this does not amount to "blasphemy
   against the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 12:31, 32.) Peter had unquestionably
   heard from the mouth of the Lord how detestable treachery it is to deny
   him before men; and what dreadful vengeance, before God and before his
   angels, (Matthew 10:39 Luke 12:9) awaits those who, through a cowardly
   dread of the cross, abandon the confession of faith; and not without
   reason had he, a little before, preferred death and every kind of
   torment to denying Christ. Now, therefore, he throws himself down
   knowingly, and after previous warning; but afterwards he obtains
   pardon; from which it follows that he sinned through weakness and not
   through incurable malice. For he would willingly have rendered to
   Christ the duties of friendship which he owed him, had not fear
   extinguished the sparks of proper affection.

   75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus. To the voice of the cock,
   Luke informs us, there was also added the look of Christ; for
   previously -- as we learn from Mark -- he had paid no attention to the
   cock when crowing. He must, therefore, have received the look from
   Christ, in order that he might come to himself. We all have experience
   of the same thing in ourselves; for which of us does not pass by with
   indifference and with deaf ears -- I do not say the varied and numerous
   songs of birds which however, excite us to glorify God -- but even the
   voice of God, which is heard clearly and distinctly in the doctrine of
   the Law and of the Gospel? Nor is it for a single day only that our
   minds are held by such brutal stupidity, but it is perpetual until he
   who alone turns the hearts of men deigns to look upon us. It is proper
   to observe, however that this was no ordinary look, for he had formerly
   looked at Judas who, after all, became no better by it. But in looking
   at Peter, he added to his eyes the secret efficacy of the Spirit, and
   thus by the rays of his grace, penetrated into his heart. Let us
   therefore know, that whenever any one has fallen, his repentance will
   never begin, until the Lord has looked at him.

   And he went out and wept bitterly. It is probable that Peter went out
   through fear, for he did not venture to weep in presence of witnesses;
   and here he gave another proof of his weakness. Hence we infer that he
   did not deserve pardon by satisfaction, but that he obtained it by the
   fatherly kindness of God. And by this example we are taught that we
   ought to entertain confident hope, though our repentance be lame; for
   God does not despise even weak repentance, provided that it be sincere.
   Yet Peter's tears, which he shed in secret, testified before God and
   the angels that his repentance was true; for, having withdrawn from the
   eyes of men, he places before him God and the angels; and, therefore,
   those tears flow from the deep feelings of his heart. This deserves our
   attention; for we see many who shed tears purposely, so long as they
   are beheld by others, but who have no sooner retired than they have dry
   eyes. Now there is no room to doubt that tears, which do not flow on
   account of the judgment of God, are often drawn forth by ambition and
   hypocrisy.

   But it may be asked, Is weeping requisite in true repentance? I reply,
   Believers often with dry eyes groan before the Lord without hypocrisy,
   and confess their fault to obtain pardon; but in more aggravated
   offenses they must be in no ordinary degree stupid and hardened, whose
   hearts are not pained by grief and sorrow, and who do not feel ashamed
   even so far as to shed tears. And, therefore Scripture, after having
   convicted men of their crimes, exhorts them to sackcloth and ashes,
   (Daniel 9:3; Jonah 3:6; Matthew 11:21.)

   MATTHEW 27:1-10; MARK 15:1; LUKE 23:1

   Matthew 27:1-10

   Mark 15:1

   Luke 23:1

   1. But when it was morning, all the chief priests and elders of the
   people took counsel against Jesus, to put him to death. 2. And they led
   him away bound, and delivered him to Pointius Pilate the governor.
   3. Then Judas, who had betrayed him, perceiving that he was condemned,
   repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief
   priests and elders, 4. Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent
   blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. 5. And
   having thrown down the pieces of silver in the temple, he retired, and
   went away, and strangled himself. 6. And the chief priests, having
   taken the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful for us to throw them
   into the treasury, for they are the price of blood. 7. And having taken
   counsel, they bought with them the potter's field for a burying-place
   to strangers; 8. For which reason that field is called, The field of
   blood, to this day. 9. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah
   the prophet, saying, And they took thirty pieces of silver, the price
   of him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued,
   10. And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

   1. And immediately on the break of day, the chief priests, with the
   elders and scribes, and the whole council, after having deliberated,
   led Jesus away bound and delivered him to Pilate.

   1. And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him away to Pilate.


   Matthew 27:1. But when it was morning. The high priest, with his
   council, after having examined him at an unseasonable hour of the
   night, finally resolve, at sunrise, to place him at the bar of the
   governor. By so doing, they observe the form of judicial proceedings,
   that they may not be suspected of undue haste, when they run to Pilate
   at an unusually early hour, as usually happens in cases of tumult. But
   it is probable, that when Christ had been led away from their council,
   they immediately held a consultation, and, without long delay, resolved
   what they would do; for we have been already told at what time Christ
   went out from them and met Peter, which was after the cock-crowing, and
   just as day was breaking. The Evangelists, therefore, do not mean that
   they removed from the place, [239] but only relate, that as soon as it
   was daylight, they condemned Christ to death, and did not lose a moment
   in earnestly putting into execution their wicked design. What Luke
   formerly stated, (22:66,) that they assembled in the morning, ought not
   to be explained as referring to the very beginning, but to the last
   act, which is immediately added: as if he had said, that as soon as it
   was day, our Lord having acknowledged that he was the Son of God, they
   pronounced their sentence of his death. Now if they had been permitted
   to decide in taking away life, they would all have been eager, in their
   fury, to murder him with their own hands; but as Pilate had cognizance
   of capital crimes, they are constrained to refer the matter to his
   jurisdiction; only they entangle him by their own previous decision.
   [240] For the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:59) took place in a seditious
   manner, as happens in cases of tumult; but it was proper that the Son
   of God should be solemnly condemned by an earthly judge, that he might
   efface our condemnation in heaven.

   3. Then Judas, perceiving that he was condemned. By this adverb (tote)
   then, Matthew does not fix the exact point of time; for we shall find
   him shortly afterwards adding, that Judas, when he saw that the priests
   disdainfully refused to take back the reward of his treason, threw it
   down in the temple. But from the house of Caiaphas they came straight
   to the Pretorium, and stood there until Christ was condemned. It can
   scarcely be supposed that they were found in the temple on that day;
   but as the Evangelist was speaking of the rage and madness of the
   council, he inserted also the death of Judas, by which their blind
   obstinacy, and the hardness of their hearts like iron, were more fully
   displayed.

   He says that Judas repented; not that he reformed, but that the crime
   which he had committed gave him uneasiness; as God frequently opens the
   eyes of the reprobate, so as to begin to feel their miseries, and to be
   alarmed at them. For those who are sincerely grieved so as to reform,
   are said not only (metamelein), [241] but, also (metanoein), [242] from
   which is derived also (metanoia), [243] which is a true conversion of
   the soul to God. So then, Judas conceived disgust and horror, not so as
   to turn to God, but rather that, being overwhelmed with despair, he
   might serve as an example of a man entirely shut out from the grace of
   God. Justly, indeed, does Paul say, that the sorrow which leads to
   repentance is salutary, (2 Corinthians 7:10;) but if a man stumble at
   the very threshold, he will derive no advantage from a confused and
   mistaken grief. What is more, this is a just punishment with which God
   at length visits the wicked, who have obstinately despised his
   judgment, that he gives them up to Satan to be tormented without the
   hope of consolation.

   True repentance is displeasure at sin, arising out of fear and
   reverence for God, and producing, at the same time, a love and desire
   of righteousness. Wicked men are far from such a feeling; for they
   would desire to sin without intermission, and even, as far as lies in
   their power, they endeavor to deceive both God and their own
   conscience, [244] but notwithstanding their reluctance and opposition,
   they are tormented with blind horror by their conscience, so that,
   though they do not hate their sin, still they feel, with sorrow and
   distress, that it presses heavily and painfully upon them. This is the
   reason why their grief is useless; for they do not cheerfully turn to
   God, or even aim at doing better, but, being attached to their wicked
   desires, they pine away in torment, which they cannot escape. In this
   way, as I have just said, God punishes their obstinacy; for although
   his elect are drawn to him by severe chastisements, and as it were
   contrary to their will, yet he heals in due time the wounds which he
   has inflicted, so that they come cheerfully to him, by whose hand they
   acknowledge that they are struck, and by whose wrath they are alarmed.
   The former, therefore, while they have no hatred to sin, not only
   dread, but fly from the judgment of God, and thus, having received an
   incurable wound, they perish in the midst of their sorrows.

   If Judas had listened to the warning of Christ, there would still have
   been place for repentance; but since he despised so gracious an offer
   of salvation, he is given up to the dominion of Satan, that he may
   throw him into despair. But if the Papists were right in what they
   teach in their schools about repentance, we could find no defect in
   that of Judas, to which their definition of repentance fully applies;
   for we perceive in it contrition of heart, and confession of the mouth,
   and satisfaction of deed, as they talk. Hence we infer, that they take
   nothing more than the bark; for they leave out what was the chief
   point, the conversion of the man to God, when the sinner, broken down
   by shame and fear, denies himself so as to render obedience to
   righteousness.

   4. What is that to us? Here is described the stupidity and madness of
   the priests, since even after having been warned by the dreadful
   example of Judas, still they do not think about themselves. I do
   acknowledge that hypocrites, as they are accustomed to flatter
   themselves, had some plausible excuse at hand for distinguishing
   between their case and that of Judas; for they did not think that they
   were partakers of his crime, though they abused the treachery of Judas.
   But Judas not only confesses that he has sinned, but asserts the
   innocence of Christ; from which it follows, that they had meditated the
   death of a righteous man, and, therefore, that they were guilty of a
   detestable murder. Nor is there any room to doubt that God intended to
   sear their consciences with a hot iron, to discover the hidden
   corruption. Let us therefore learn, that when we see wicked persons,
   with whom we have any thing in common, filled with alarm, those are so
   many excitements to repentance, and that they who neglect such
   excitements aggravate their criminality. We ought also to believe, that
   the crime of one man can have no effect in acquitting all those who are
   in any way involved in it; and still more, that the leading
   perpetrators of a crime can gain no advantage by distinguishing between
   themselves and their agents, that they may not suffer the same
   punishment.

   5. And he went away, and strangled himself. This is the price for which
   Satan sells the allurements by which he flatters wicked men for a time.
   He throws them into a state of fury, so that, voluntarily cutting
   themselves off from the hope of salvation, they find no consolation but
   in death. Though others would have permitted Judas to enjoy the thirty
   pieces of silver, by which he had betrayed Christ and his own
   salvation, he throws them down, and not only deprives himself of the
   use of them, but, along with the base reward of the death of Christ, he
   throws away also his own life. Thus, though God does not put forth his
   hand, wicked men are disappointed of their desires, so that, when they
   have obtained their wishes, they not only deprive themselves of the
   enjoyment of unsatisfying benefits, but even make cords for themselves.
   But though they are their own executioners by punishing themselves,
   they do not in any respect alleviate or diminish the severity of the
   wrath of God.

   6. It is not lawful for us to throw it into the treasury. Hence it
   plainly appears that hypocrites, by attending to nothing more than the
   outward appearance, are guilty of gross trifling with God. Provided
   that they do not violate their Corban, (Mark 7:11,) they imagine that
   in other matters they are pure, and give themselves no concern about
   the infamous bargain, by which they, not less than Judas, had provoked
   against themselves the vengeance of God. But if it was unlawful to put
   into the sacred treasury the price of blood, why was it lawful for them
   to take the money out of it? for all their wealth was derived from the
   offerings of the temple, and from no other source did they take what
   they now scruple to mingle again with it as being polluted. Now, whence
   came the pollution but from themselves?

   8. For a burying-place to strangers. The more that wicked men endeavor
   to conceal their enormities, the more does the Lord watch over them to
   bring those enormities to light. They hoped that, by an honorable
   disguise, they would bury their crime, were they to purchase a barren
   field for burying strangers. But the wonderful providence of God turns
   this arrangement to an opposite result, so that this field became a
   perpetual memorial of that treason, which had formerly been little
   known. For it was not themselves that gave this name to the place, but
   after the occurrence was generally known, the field was called, by
   common consent, The field of blood; as if God had commanded that their
   disgrace should be in every man's mouth. It was a plausible design to
   provide a burying-place for strangers, if any of those who came up to
   Jerusalem from distant countries, for the purpose of sacrificing,
   should happen to die there. As some of them were of the Gentiles, I do
   not disapprove of the opinion of some ancient writers, that this symbol
   held out the hope of salvation to the Gentiles, because they were
   included in the price of the death of Christ; but as that opinion is
   more ingenious than solid, I leave it undetermined. The word corbana,
   (treasury,) is Chaldaic, and is derived from the Hebrew word (qrvn),
   (corban,) of which we have spoken elsewhere.

   9. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet. How the
   name of Jeremiah crept in, I confess that I do not know nor do I give
   myself much trouble to inquire. The passage itself plainly shows that
   the name of Jeremiah has been put down by mistake, instead of
   Zechariah, (11:13;) for in Jeremiah we find nothing of this sort, nor
   any thing that even approaches to it. Now that other passage, if some
   degree of skill be not used in applying it, might seem to have been
   improperly distorted to a wrong meaning; but if we attend to the rule
   which the apostles followed in quoting Scripture, we shall easily
   perceive that what we find there is highly applicable to Christ. The
   Lord, after having complained that his labors were of no avail, so long
   as he discharged the office of a shepherd, says that he is compelled by
   the troublesome and unpleasant nature of the employment to relinquish
   it altogether, and, therefore, declares that he will break his crook,
   and will be a shepherd no longer. He afterwards adds, that when he
   asked his salary, they gave him thirty pieces of silver. The import of
   these words is, that he was treated quite contemptuously as if he had
   been some mean and ordinary laborer. For the ceremonies and vain
   pretenses, by which the Jews recompensed his acts of kindness, are
   compared by him to thirty pieces of silver, as if they had been the
   unworthy and despicable hire of a cowherd or a day-laborer; and,
   therefore, he bids them throw it before a potter in the temple; as if
   he had said: "As for this fine present which they make to me, which
   would not be less dishonorable in me to accept than it is contemptuous
   in them to offer it, let them rather spend it in purchasing tiles or
   bricks for repairing the chinks of the temple." To make it still more
   evident that Christ is the God of armies, towards whom the people had
   been from the beginning malicious and ungrateful, when he

   was manifested in the flesh, (1 Timothy 3:16,)

   it became necessary that what had formerly been spoken figuratively
   should now be literally and visibly accomplished in his person. So,
   then, when he was compelled by their malice to take leave of them, and
   to withdraw his labors from them as unworthy of such a privilege, they
   valued him at thirty pieces of silver. And this disdain of the Son of
   God was the crowning act of their extreme impiety.

   The price of him that was valued. Matthew does not quote the words of
   Zechariah; for he merely alludes to the metaphor, under which the Lord
   then complains of the ingratitude of the people. But the meaning is the
   same, that while the Jews ought to have entirely devoted themselves,
   and all that they possessed, to the Lord, they contemptuously dismissed
   him with a mean hire; as if, by governing them for so many ages, he had
   deserved nothing more than any cowherd would have received for the
   labors of a single year. He complains, therefore, that though he is
   beyond all estimation, he was rated by them at so low a price.

   Whom they of the children of Israel did value. This expression, which
   he uses towards the close, must be taken in a general sense. Judas had
   struck a bargain with the priests, who were the avowed representatives
   of the whole people; so that it was the Jews who set up Christ for
   sale, and he was sold, as it were, by the voice of the public crier.
   The price was such as was fit to be given to a potter.

   10. As the Lord appointed me. By this clause Matthew confirms the
   statement, that this was not done without the providence of God;
   because, while they have a different object in view, they unconsciously
   fulfill an ancient prediction. For how could it have occurred to them
   to purchase a field from a potter, if the Lord had not turned their
   blameworthy conduct so as to carry into execution his own purpose?

   Matthew 27:11-14

   Mark 15:2-5

   Luke 23:2-12

   11. Now Jesus stood [245] before the governor. And the governor asked
   him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? Jesus saith to him, Thou
   sayest it. [246] 12. And when he was accused by the chief priests and
   elders, and he answered nothing. 13. Then Pilate saith to him, Hearest
   thou not how many things they testify against thee? [247] 14. And he
   did not answer him a single word, so that the governor was greatly
   astonished.

   2. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
   answering said to him, Thou sayest it. [248] 3. And the chief priests
   accused him of many things. 4. And Pilate again asked him, saying,
   Answerest thou nothing? Lo, how many things do they testify against
   thee? [249] 5. But Jesus again answered nothing, so that the governor
   wondered.

   2. And they began to accuse him saying, We have found this man
   subverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
   saying, that he is the Christ, a King. 3. And Pilate asked him, saying,
   Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him, Thou
   sayest it. [250] 4. And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the
   multitudes, I find no fault in this man. 5. But they persisted, saying,
   He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea,
   beginning from Galilee even to this place. 6. And when Pilate heard
   mention made of Galilee, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 7. And as
   soon as he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent
   him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at that time. 8. And when Herod
   saw Jesus, he was very glad; for he had long cherished a desire to see
   him, because had heard many things concerning him; and he hoped that he
   would see some miracle [251] wrought by him. 9. And he asked him in
   many words; but he made no reply to him. 10. And the chief priests and
   scribes stood, and vehemently accused him. 11. But Herod, with his
   attendants, despised him; and having mocked him, sent him back to
   Pilate clothed with a shining [252] robe. 12. And came friend; for
   previously they had been at enmity with each other.


   Matthew 27:11. Now Jesus stood before the governor. Though it was a
   shocking exhibition, and highly incompatible with the majesty of the
   Son of God, to be dragged before the judgment-seat of a profane man, to
   be tried on the charge of a capital offense, as a malefactor in chains;
   yet we ought to remember that; our salvation consists in the doctrine
   of the cross, which is

   folly to the Greeks, and an offense to the Jews,
   (1 Corinthians 1:23.)

   For the Son of God chose to stand bound before an earthly judge, and
   there to receive sentence of death, [253] in order that we, delivered
   from condemnation, may not fear to approach freely to the heavenly
   throne of God. If, therefore, we consider what advantage we reap from
   Christ having been tried before Pilate, the disgrace of so unworthy a
   subjection will be immediately washed away. And certainly none are
   offended at the condemnation of Christ, [254] but those who are either
   proud hypocrites, or stupid and gross despisers of God, who are not
   ashamed of their own iniquity.

   So then, the Son of God stood, as a criminal, before a mortal man, and
   there permitted himself to be accused and condemned, that we may stand
   boldly before God. His enemies, indeed, endeavored to fasten upon him
   everlasting infamy; but we ought rather to look at the end to which the
   providence of God directs us. For if we recollect how dreadful is the
   judgment-seat of God, and that we could never have been acquitted
   there, unless Christ had been pronounced to be guilty on earth, we
   shall never be ashamed of glorying in his chains. Again, whenever we
   hear that Christ stood before Pilate with a sad and dejected
   countenance, let us draw from it grounds of confidence, that, relying
   on him as our intercessor, we may come into the presence of God with
   joy and alacrity. To the same purpose is what immediately follows: he
   did not answer him a single word. Christ was silent, while the priests
   were pressing upon him on every hand; and it was, in order that he
   might open our mouth by his silence. For hence arises that
   distinguished privilege of which Paul speaks in such magnificent terms,
   (Romans 8:15,) that we can boldly cry, Abba, Father; to which I shall
   immediately refer again.

   Art thou the King of the Jews? Although they attempted to overwhelm
   Christ by many and various accusations, still it is probable that they
   maliciously seized on the title of King, in order to excite greater
   odium against him on the part of Pilate. For this reason Luke expressly
   represents them as saying, we have found him subverting the nation, and
   forbidding to give tribute to caesar, saying that he is the Christ, A
   King Nothing could have been more odious than this crime to Pilate,
   whose greatest anxiety was to preserve the kingdom in a state of
   quietness. From the Evangelist John we learn that he was accused on
   various grounds; but it is evident from the whole of the narrative that
   this was the chief ground of accusation. In like manner, even at the
   present day, Satan labors to expose the Gospel to hatred or suspicion
   on this plea, as if Christ, by erecting his kingdom, were overturning
   all the governments of the world, and destroying the authority of kings
   and magistrates. Kings too are, for the most part, so fiercely haughty,
   that they reckon it impossible for Christ to reign without some
   diminution of their own power; and, therefore, they always listen
   favorably to such an accusation as that which was once brought unjustly
   against Christ.

   On this account Pilate, laying aside all the other points, attends
   chiefly to the sedition; because, if he had ascertained that Christ had
   in any way disturbed the public peace, he would gladly have condemned
   him without delay. This is the reason why he asks him about the
   kingdom. According to the three Evangelists, the answer of Christ is
   ambiguous; but we learn from John (18:36) that Christ made an open
   acknowledgment of the fact which was alleged against him; but, at the
   same time, that he vindicated himself from all criminality by denying
   that he was an earthly king. But as he did not intend to take pains to
   vindicate himself, as is usually the case with criminals, the
   Evangelists put down a doubtful reply; as if they had said, that he did
   not deny that he was a king, but that he indirectly pointed out the
   calumny which his enemies unjustly brought against him.

   12 He answered nothing. If it be asked why the Evangelists say that
   Christ was silent, while we have just now heard his answer from their
   mouth, the reason is, that he had a defense at hand, but voluntarily
   abstained from producing it. And, indeed, what he formerly replied
   about the kingdom did not arise from a desire to be acquitted, but was
   only intended to maintain that he was the Redeemer anciently promised,

   before whom every knee ought to bow, (Isaiah 45:23.)

   Pilate wondered at this patience; for Christ, by his silence, allowed
   his innocence to be suspected, when he might easily have refuted
   frivolous and unfounded calumnies. The integrity of Christ was such
   that the judge saw it plainly without any defense. But Pilate wished
   that Christ might not neglect his own cause, and might thus be
   acquitted without giving offense to many people. And up to this point,
   the integrity of Pilate is worthy of commendation, because, from a
   favorable regard to the innocence of Christ, he urges him to defend
   himself.

   But that we may not, like Pilate, wonder at the silence of Christ, as
   if it had been unreasonable, we must attend to the purpose of God, who
   determined that his Son--whom he had appointed to be a sacrifice to
   atone for our sins--should be condemned as guilty in our room, though
   in himself he was pure. Christ therefore was at that time silent, that
   he may now be our advocate, and by his intercession may deliver us from
   condemnation. He was silent, that we may boast that by his grace we are
   righteous. And thus was fulfilled the prediction of Isaiah, (53:7,)
   that he was led as a sheep to the slaughter.

   And yet he gave, at the same time, that good confession, which Paul
   mentions, (1 Timothy 6:12,) a confession not by words, but by deeds;
   not that by which he consulted his own advantage, but that by which he
   obtained deliverance for the whole human race.

   Luke 23:4. And Pilate said to the chief priests and scribes. As Christ
   was come to bear the punishment of our sins, it was proper that he
   should first be condemned by the mouth of his judge, that it might
   afterwards be evident that he was condemned for the sake of others, and
   not for his own. But as Pilate, from a dread of exciting a tumult, did
   not venture absolutely to acquit him, he willingly availed himself of
   the opportunity which presented itself, of submitting him to the
   jurisdiction of Herod. This Herod was he who bears the surname of
   Antipas to whom was left the tetrarchy of Galilee, when Archelaus was a
   prisoner at Vienna, and when Judea had been annexed to the province of
   Syria. Now though we shall shortly afterwards find Luke relating that
   this mark of respect pacified Herod, who had formerly been enraged
   against Pilate, still his design was not so much to obtain Herod's
   favor, as to get quit of a disagreeable affair under an honorable
   excuse, and thus to avoid the necessity of condemning Christ.

   8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad. Hence it is evident how
   greatly wicked men are intoxicated, or rather bewitched, by their own
   pride; for though Herod did not acknowledge Christ to be the Son of
   God, he at least reckoned him to be a prophet. It was therefore most
   unreasonable cruelty to take pleasure in seeing him treated with
   contempt and disdain. But as if an injury had been done to him, so long
   as he had not obtained a sight of Christ, when he now sees him placed
   in his power, he triumphs as if he had obtained a victory. We see also
   what kind of love is cherished by wicked and irreligious men for
   prophets, in whom the power of God shines brightly. Herod had long
   wished to see Christ. Why then did he not wish to hear him, that he
   might profit by his doctrine? It was because he chose rather to amuse
   himself in beholding the divine power, than to view it, as he ought to
   have done, with devout and humble reverence. And this is the
   disposition of the flesh, so to desire to see God in his works, as not
   to submit to his authority; so to desire to see his servants, as to
   refuse to hear him speaking by them. And even Herod, though he hoped
   that some miracle would be performed by Christ, chose to have him
   placed at his feet as a malefactor rather than to receive him as a
   teacher. We need not wonder, therefore, if God conceal his glory from
   wicked men, who wished that he should contribute to their amusement,
   like some stage-player.

   11. And Herod despised him. It was impossible but that a haughty man,
   who valued himself on his luxuries and royal dignity and wealth, should
   despise Christ, who had at that time nothing but what was contemptible
   in his appearance. And yet the pride of Herod, which shut the door on
   the grace of God, admits of no excuse. Nor can it be doubted that God,
   in order to punish him for his former indifference, purposely hardened
   his heart by such a spectacle; for he was unworthy of beholding in
   Christ any ray of heavenly glory; since he had so long shut his eyes on
   the full brightness, by which his whole country had been illuminated
   and adorned Herod, with his attendants. Luke relates not only that
   Christ was despised by Herod, but that he was despised by the whole of
   his retinue; and this is intended to inform us, that the honor which is
   due to God is seldom rendered to him in the courts of kings. For almost
   all courtiers, being addicted to pompous display, have their senses
   pre-occupied by so great vanity, that they carelessly despise, or pass
   by with closed eyes, the spiritual favors of God. But by this contempt
   of Christ we have acquired new dignity, so that we are now held in
   estimation by God and by angels.

   12. Pilate and Herod became friends. From the fact that Christ was the
   occasion of reconciling two wicked men, let us learn how much the
   children of God, and religion itself, are disdained by the world. It is
   probable that, in consequence of their own ambition by which both were
   actuated, some dispute arose about their jurisdiction. But whatever may
   have been the origin of the quarrel, neither of them would have yielded
   to the other the smallest portion of his own rights in worldly matters;
   yet because Christ is set at naught, Pilate easily gives him up to
   Herod, and Herod, in his turn, sends him back to Pilate. [255] Thus in
   our own day we see, that when the judges enter into disputes with each
   other about robbers and other malefactors, the children of God are
   contemptuously thrown aside as if they were the merest refuse. [256]
   Hatred of religion often produces mutual harmony among wicked men, so
   that those who formerly had nothing in common unite together to
   extinguish the name of God. And yet when wicked men on both sides
   deliver up the children of God to death, it is not by what they
   consider to be a valuable price that they purchase mutual friendship,
   but what appears to them to be of no value whatever they not
   unwillingly surrender, just as if a person were to throw a crust of
   bread to a dog. But among us it is proper that Christ should produce a
   different kind of peace by putting an end to quarrels. Having first
   been reconciled to God, we ought to assist each other, by a devout and
   holy agreement, to follow righteousness, and to labor to discharge the
   duties of brotherly affection and of mutual humanity.

   Mark 15:6-14

   Luke 23:13-23

   15. Now the governor was wont at the festival to release to the
   multitude one prisoner, whomsoever they wished. 16. And they had at
   that time a notable prisoner, who was called Barabbas. 17. When they
   were assembled, therefore, Pilate said, Which of them do you wish that
   I should release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?
   18. For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy. 19. And
   while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him,
   saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have
   suffered many thing today in a dream on his account. 20. But the chief
   priests and the elders persuaded the multitude to ask Barabbas, and put
   Jesus to death. 21. And the governor, answering, said to the, Which of
   the two do you wish that I shall release to you? And they said
   Barabbas. 22. Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who
   is called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified. 23. And
   the governor said, But what evil hath he done? But they cried so much
   the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

   6. Now at the festival, he was wont to release to them one prisoner,
   whomsoever they demanded. 7. And there was one who was called Barabbas,
   who was a prisoner along with his accomplices in the insurrection, that
   had committed murder in the insurrection. 8. And the multitude, crying
   out, began to demand that he would do as he always had done to them.
   9. And Pilate answered them, saying, Do you wish me to release to you
   the King of the Jews? 10. For he knew that the chief priests had
   delivered him up through envy. 11. And the chief priests stirred up the
   multitude, that he would rather release to them Barabbas. 12. And
   Pilate answering again, said to them, What then do you wish me to do
   with him whom you call King of the Jews? 13. But they cried out again,
   Crucify him. 14. And Pilate said to them, But what evil hath he done?
   And they cried out the more vehemently, Crucify him.

   13. And Pilate, having assembled the chief priests, and magistrates,
   and the people, 14. Said to them, You have brought before me this man,
   as one who subverteth the people; and lo, having interrogated him in
   your presence, I find no fault in this man, as to those things of which
   you accuse him. 15. Nor even Herod; for I sent you to him, and lo,
   nothing worthy of death hath been done to him. [257] 16. When I have
   chastised him, therefore, I will release him. 17. Now he was under the
   necessity of releasing to them one at the festival. 18. Then the whole
   multitude cried out together, saying, Take away this man, and release
   to us Barabbas; 19. Who had been put in prison on account of a certain
   insurrection that had been made in the city, and for murder. [258]
   20. And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus. 21. But
   they cried out, saying Crucify him, crucify him. 22. And a third time
   he said to them, But what evil hath he done? I find in him no fault
   worthy of death. I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
   23. But they persisted with loud voices, demanding that he should be
   crucified; and their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.


   Matthew 27:15. Now the governor was wont at the festival Here is
   described to us, on the one hand, the insatiable cruelty of the
   priests, and, on the other, the furious obstinacy of the people; for
   both must have been seized with astonishing madness, when they were not
   satisfied with conspiring to put to death an innocent man, if they did
   not also, through hatred of him, release a robber. Thus wicked men
   after having once begun to fall, are driven headlong by Satan, so that
   they shrink from no crime, however detestable, but, blinded and
   stupefied, add sin to sin. There can be no doubt that Pilate, in order
   to prevail upon them through shame, selected a very wicked man, by
   contrast with whom Christ might be set free; and the very atrocity of
   the crime of which Barabbas was guilty ought justly to have made the
   resentment of the people to fall on him, that by comparison with him,
   at least, Christ might be released. But no disgrace makes either the
   priests, or the whole nation, afraid to ask that a seditious man and a
   murderer should be granted to them.

   Meanwhile, we ought to consider the purpose of God, by which Christ was
   appointed to be crucified, as if he had been the basest of men. The
   Jews, indeed, rage against him with blinded fury; but as God had
   appointed him to be a sacrifice (katharma) to atone for the sins of the
   world, [259] he permitted him to be placed even below a robber and
   murderer. That the Son of God was reduced so low none can properly
   remember without the deepest horror, and displeasure with themselves,
   and detestation of their own crimes. But hence also arises no ordinary
   ground of confidence; for Christ was sunk into the depths of ignominy,
   that he might obtain for us, by his humiliation, an ascent to the
   heavenly glory: he was reckoned worse than a robber, that he might
   admit us to the society of the angels of God. If this advantage be
   justly estimated, it will be more than sufficient to remove the offense
   of the cross.

   The custom of having one of the prisoners released by the governor on
   the festival, to gratify the people, was a foolish and improper
   practice, and, indeed, was an open abuse of the worship of God; for
   nothing could be more unreasonable than that festivals should be
   honored by allowing crimes to go unpunished. God has armed magistrates
   with the sword, that they may punish with severity those crimes which
   cannot be tolerated without public injury; and hence it is evident that
   lie does not wish to be worshipped by a violation of laws and
   punishments. But since nothing ought to be attempted but by the rule of
   his word, all that men gain by methods of worshipping God which have
   been rashly contrived by themselves is, that under the pretense of
   honoring, they often throw dishonor upon Him. We ought therefore to
   preserve such moderation, as not to offer to God any thing but what he
   requires; for he is so far from taking pleasure in profane gift that
   they provoke his anger the more.

   19. While he was sitting on the judgment-seat. Although the thoughts
   which had passed through the mind of Pilate's wife during the day might
   be the cause of her dream, yet there can be no doubt that she suffered
   these torments, not in a natural way, (such as happens to us every
   day,) but by an extraordinary inspiration of God. It has been commonly
   supposed that the devil stirred up this woman, in order to retard the
   redemption of mankind; which is in the highest degree improbable, since
   it was he who excited and inflamed, to such a degree, the priests and
   scribes to put Christ to death. We ought to conclude, on the contrary,
   that God the Father took many methods of attesting the innocence of
   Christ, that it might evidently appear that he suffered death in the
   room of others, -- that is, in our room. God intended that Pilate
   should so frequently acquit him with his own mouth before condemning
   him, that in his undeserved condemnation the true satisfaction for our
   sins might be the more brightly displayed. Matthew expressly mentions
   this, that none may wonder at the extreme solicitude of Pilate, when he
   debates with the people, in the midst of a tumult, for the purpose of
   saving the life of a man whom he despised. And, indeed, by the terrors
   which his wife, had suffered during the night, God compelled him to
   defend the innocence of his own Son; not to rescue him from death, but
   only to make it manifest, that in the room of others he endured that
   punishment which he had not deserved. As to dreams, which serve the
   purpose of visions, we have spoken elsewhere.

   20. But the chief priests and elder's persuaded the multitude. The
   Evangelist points out the chief instigators of the wicked proceedings;
   not that the foolish credulity of the people, who were influenced by
   others, admits of any excuse; but for the purpose of informing us that
   they were not, of their own accord, hostile to Christ, but that, having
   sold themselves to gratify the priests, they forget all justice and
   modesty, [260] as well as their own salvation. Hence we learn how
   pernicious is the influence of wicked men, who can easily turn in every
   direction, to all kind of wickedness, the giddy and changeful
   multitude. Yet we must attend to the design of the Evangelist, which
   was to show, that the death of Christ was so eagerly demanded by the
   voice of the people, not because he was universally hated, but because
   the greater part of them, ambitiously desirous to follow the
   inclination of their rulers, threw aside all regard to justice, and
   might be said to have sold and enslaved their tongue to the wicked
   conspiracy of a few.

   22. What then shall I do with Jesus? Perceiving that they are so
   blinded by madness, that they do not hesitate, to their own great
   dishonor, to rescue a robber from death, Pilate resorts to another
   expedient for touching them to the quick, and bringing them to a sound
   mind. He argues that the death of Christ would bring disgrace on
   themselves, because it had been commonly reported of Jesus, that he was
   the King and the Christ. As if he had said, "If you have no compassion
   for the man, pay some regard, at least, to your own honor; for it will
   be generally thought by foreigners, that he was put to death for a
   chastisement to you all." [261] Yet even this did not abate the
   fierceness of their cruelty, or hinder them from proceeding to manifest
   a greater degree of opposition to the public interests than of private
   hostility to Christ. Thus, according to Mark, Pilate, in order to wound
   them still more deeply, says that even themselves call Jesus the King;
   meaning, that this title was constantly used, as if it had been his
   ordinary surname. Yet, throwing aside all shame, they obstinately
   insist on the murder of Christ, which brought along with it the
   disgrace of the whole nation. The Evangelist John (14:15) states a
   reply, which the other three Evangelists do not mention; namely, that
   they had no king but Caesar. Thus they choose rather to be deprived of
   the hope of the promised redemption, and to be devoted to perpetual
   slavery, than to receive the Redeemer, whom God had offered to them.

   Luke 23:16. I will therefore chastise him, and release him. If any
   slight offense had been committed, which was not a capital crime, the
   Roman governors [262] were wont to cause the offenders to be beaten
   with rods; and this kind of punishment was called, in the Latin
   language, coerctio Pilate, therefore, acts unjustly when, after
   pronouncing Christ to be free from all blame, he resolves to punish
   him, as if he had been guilty of an ordinary offense; for he not only
   declares that he has found in him no crime worthy of death, but asserts
   his innocence in the most unqualified manner. Why, then, does he beat
   him with rods? But earthly men, who are not confirmed by the Spirit of
   God in a constant wish to do what is right, even though they are
   desirous to maintain integrity, are accustomed, in this manner, to
   yield so far as to commit small injuries, when they are compelled. And
   not only do they reckon it a valid excuse, that they have not
   perpetrated a very heinous crime, but they even claim for themselves
   the praise of mildness, because they have, to some extent, spared the
   innocent. As to the Son of God, had he been dismissed in this manner,
   he would have carried with him the shame of having been scourged,
   without any advantage to our salvation; but on the cross, as in a
   magnificent chariot, he triumphed over his enemies and ours.

   Would to God [263] that the world were not now filled with many
   Pilates! But we see that what was begun in the head is accomplished in
   the members. The Popish clergy persecute his holy servants with the
   same cruelty with which the Jewish priests cried out, demanding that
   Christ should be put to death. Many of the judges, indeed, willingly
   offer themselves as executioners to follow out their rage; [264] but
   when they shrink from shedding blood, so as to save innocent men from
   dying, they scourge Christ himself, who is the only righteousness of
   God. For when they compel the worshippers of God to deny the Gospel,
   for the purpose of saving their life, what else is it than to cause the
   name of Christ to undergo the disgrace of being beaten with rods? Yet
   in their defense they plead the violence of his enemies; as if this
   pretense were a sufficient cloak for their treacherous cowardice,
   which, if it was not excusable in Pilate, deserves to be viewed in them
   with the highest detestation. But though our three Evangelists pass by
   this circumstance, yet it is evident from the Evangelist John, (14:1,)
   that Christ was beaten with rods, while Pilate was still laboring to
   save his life, in order that so appalling a spectacle might appease the
   rage of the people. But John has also added, that it could not be
   appeased until the Author of life was put to death.

   24. But Pilate, perceiving that he gained nothing by it, but that the
   tumult became the greater, took water, and washed his hands before the
   people, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man: see
   you to it. 25. And the whole people, answering, said, His blood be on
   us and on our children. 26. Then he released to them Barabbas, and
   after having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.
   27. Then the soldiers of the governor conducted Jesus into the
   Pretorium, and gathered around him the whole band. 28. And having
   stripped him, they put on him a scarlet robe. 29. And having wreathed a
   crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand;
   and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
   Jews! 30. And having spat on him, they took the reed and struck him on
   the head. 31. And after having mocked him, they stripped him of the
   robe, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
   32. And as they were going out, they found a Cyrenian named Simon: him
   they constrained to bear his cross.

   15. Pilate then wishing to satisfy the multitude, released Barabbas to
   them, and after having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be
   crucified. 16. And the soldiers conducted him into the hall, which is
   the Pretorium; and they gather together the whole band. 17. And they
   clothe him with purple, and put upon his head a crown interwoven with
   thorns. 18. And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
   19. And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spat on him; and
   kneeling they worshipped him. 20. And having mocked him, they stripped
   him of the purple, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
   crucify him. 21. And they compelled the one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was
   passing by, who was coming from the country, the father of Alexander
   and Rufus, to bear his cross.

   24. And Pilate decided that what they demanded should be done. 25. And
   he released to them him who, for sedition and murder, had been put in
   prison, whom they had desired; and delivered up Jesus to their will.
   26. And as they were leading him away, they seized one Simon, a
   Cyrenian, who was coming out of the country, and laid the cross upon
   him, to carry it after Jesus. 27. And there followed him a great
   multitude of people and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.
   28. And Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
   for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 29. For, lo, the
   days will come in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the
   wombs that did not bear, and the breasts which did not give suck.
   30. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to
   the hills, Cover us. 31. For if they do these things in the green tree,
   what shall be done in the dry? 32. Two others also, who were
   malefactors, were led with him to be crucified.


   Matthew 27:24. But Pilate, perceiving that he gained nothing by it. As
   sailors, who have experienced a violent tempest, at last give way, and
   permit themselves to be carried out of the proper course; so Pilate,
   finding himself unable to restrain the commotion of the people, lays
   aside his authority as a judge, and yields to their furious outcry. And
   though he had long attempted to hold out, still the necessity does not
   excuse him; for he ought rather to have submitted to any amount of
   suffering than to have swerved from his duty. Nor is his guilt
   alleviated by the childish ceremony which he uses; for how could a few
   drops of water wash away the stain of a crime which no satisfaction of
   any kind could obliterate? His principal object in doing so was not to
   wash out his stains before God, but to exhibit to the people a Mark of
   abhorrence, to try if perhaps he might lead them to repent of their
   fury; as if he had employed such a preface as this, "Lo, you compel me
   to an unrighteous murder, to which I cannot come but with trembling and
   horror. What then shall become of you, and what dreadful vengeance of
   God awaits you, who are the chief actors in the deed?" But whatever
   might be the design of Pilate, God intended to testify, in this manner,
   the innocence of his Son, that it might be more manifest that in him
   our sins were condemned. The supreme and sole Judge of the world is
   placed at the bar of an earthly judge, is condemned to crucifixion as a
   malefactor, and -- what is more -- is placed between two robbers, as if
   he had been the prince of robbers. A spectacle so revolting might, at
   first sight, greatly disturb the senses of men, were it not met by this
   argument, that the punishment which had been due to us was laid on
   Christ, so that, our guilt having now been removed, we do not hesitate
   to come into the presence of the Heavenly Judge. Accordingly, the
   water, which was of no avail for washing away the filth of Pilate,
   ought to be efficacious, in the present day, for a different purpose,
   to cleanse our eyes from every obstruction, that, in the midst of
   condemnation, they may clearly perceive the righteousness of Christ.

   25. His blood be on us. There can be no doubt that the Jews pronounced
   this curse on themselves without any concern, as if they had been fully
   convinced that they had a righteous cause before God; but their
   inconsiderate zeal carries them headlong, so that, while they commit an
   irreparable crime, they add to it a solemn imprecation, by which they
   cut themselves off from the hope of pardon. Hence we infer how
   carefully we ought to guard against headlong rashness in all our
   judgments. For when men refuse to make inquiry, and venture to decide
   in this or the other matter according to their own fancy, blind impulse
   must at length carry them to rage. And this is the righteous vengeance
   of God with which he visits the pride of those who do not deign to take
   the trouble of distinguishing between right and wrong. The Jews thought
   that, in slaying Christ, they were performing a service acceptable to
   God; but whence arose this wicked error, unless from wicked obstinacy,
   and from despising God himself? Justly, therefore, were they abandoned
   to this rashness of drawing upon themselves final ruin. But when the
   question relates to the worship of God and his holy mysteries, let us
   learn to open our eyes, and to inquire into the matter with reverence
   and sobriety, lest through hypocrisy and presumption we become
   stupefied and enraged.

   Now as God would never have permitted this execrable word to proceed
   from the mouth of the people, if their impiety had not been already
   desperate, so afterwards he justly revenged it by dreadful and unusual
   methods; and yet by an incredible miracle he reserved for himself some
   remnant, that his covenant might not be abolished by the destruction of
   the whole nation. He had adopted for himself the seed of Abraham, that
   it might be

   a chosen nation, a royal priesthood, his peculiar people and
   inheritance,
   (1 Peter 2:9.)

   The Jews now conspire, as with one voice, to renounce a favor so
   distinguished. Who would not say that the whole nation was utterly
   rooted out from the kingdom of God? But God, through their treachery,
   renders more illustrious the fidelity of his promise, and, to show that
   he did not in vain make a covenant with Abraham, he rescues from the
   general destruction those whom he has elected by free grace. Thus the
   truth of God always rises superior to all the obstacles raised by human
   unbelief.

   26 Then he released to them Barabbas. Our three Evangelists do not
   mention what is related by John, (15:13,) that Pilate ascended the
   judgment-seat to pronounce sentence from it; for they only state that
   the clamor of the people and the confused tumult prevailed on him
   basely to deliver up Christ to death. But both of these things must be
   observed, that a compliance was forced from him contrary to his will,
   and yet that he exercised the office of a judge in condemning him whom
   he pronounces to be innocent. For if the Son of God had not been free
   from all sin, we would have had no right to look for satisfaction from
   his death; and, on the other hand, if he had not become our surety, to
   endure the punishment which we had deserved, we would now have been
   involved in the condemnation of our sins. So then God determined that
   his Son should be condemned in a solemn manner, that he might acquit us
   for his sake.

   But even the severity of the punishment serves to confirm our faith,
   not less than to impress our minds with dread of the wrath of God, and
   to humble us by a conviction of our miseries. For if we are desirous to
   profit aright by meditating on the death of Christ, we ought to begin
   with cherishing abhorrence of our sins, in proportion to the severity
   of the punishment which he endured. This will cause us not only to feel
   displeasure and shame of ourselves, but to be penetrated with deep
   grief, and therefore to seek the medicine with becoming ardor, and at
   the same time to experience confusion and trembling. For we must have
   hearts harder than stones, if we are not cut to the quick by the wounds
   of the Son of God, if we do not hate and detest our sins, for expiating
   which the Son of God endured so many torments. But as this is a display
   of the dreadful vengeance of God, so, on the other hand, it holds out
   to us the most abundant grounds of confidence; for we have no reason to
   fear that our sins, from which the Son of God acquits us by so valuable
   a ransom, will ever again be brought into judgment before God. For not
   only did he endure an ordinary kind of death, in order to obtain life
   for us, but along with the cross he took upon him our curse, that no
   uncleanness might any longer remain in us.

   27. Then the soldiers of the governor. It is not without reason that
   these additional insults are related. We know that it was not some sort
   of ludicrous exhibition, when God exposed his only-begotten Son to
   every kind of reproaches. First, then, we ought to consider what we
   have deserved, and, next, the satisfaction offered by Christ ought to
   awaken us to confident hope. Our filthiness deserves that God should
   hold it in abhorrence, and that all the angels should spit upon us; but
   Christ, in order to present us pure and unspotted in presence of the
   Father, resolved to be spat upon, and to be dishonored by every kind of
   reproaches. For this reason, that disgrace which he once endured on
   earth obtains for us favor in heaven, and at the same time restores in
   us the image of God, which had been not only stained, but almost
   obliterated, by the pollutions of sin. Here, too, is brightly displayed
   the inconceivable mercy of God towards us, in bringing his
   only-begotten Son so low on our account. This was also a proof which
   Christ gave of his astonishing love towards us, that there was no
   ignominy to which he refused to submit for our salvation. but these
   matters call for secret meditation, rather than for the ornament of
   words.

   We are also taught that the kingdom of Christ ought not to be estimated
   by the sense of the flesh, but by the judgment of faith and of the
   Spirit. For so long as our minds grovel in the world, we look: upon his
   kingdom not only as contemptible, but even as loaded with shame and
   disgrace; but as soon as our minds rise by faith to heaven, not only
   will the spiritual majesty of Christ be presented to us, so as to
   obliterate all the dishonor of the cross, but the spittings,
   scourgings, blows, and other indignities, will lead us to the
   contemplation of his glory; as Paul informs us, that

   God hath given him a name, and the highest authority, that before him
   every knee might bow, because he willingly emptied himself (ekenose)
   even to the death of the cross,
   (Philippians 2:8-10.)

   If, therefore, even in the present day, the world insolently mocks at
   Christ, let us learn to rise above these offenses by elevated faith;
   and let us not stop to inquire, what unworthy opposition is made to
   Christ by wicked men, but with what ornaments the Father hath clothed
   him, with what scepter and with what crown he hath adorned him, so as
   to raise him high, not only above men, but even above all the angels.

   Mark uses the word purple instead of scarlet; but though these are
   different colors, we need not trouble ourselves much about that matter.
   That Christ was clothed with a costly garment is not probable; and
   hence we infer that it was not purple, but something that bore a
   resemblance to it, as a painter counterfeits truth by his likenesses.

   32. They found a man, a Cyrenian. This circumstance points out the
   extreme cruelty both of the Jewish nation and of the soldiers. There is
   no reason to doubt that it was then the custom for malefactors to carry
   their own crosses to the place of punishment, but as the only persons
   who were crucified were robbers, who were men of great bodily strength,
   they were able to bear such a burden. It was otherwise with Christ, so
   that the very weakness of his body plainly showed that it was a lamb
   that was sacrificed. Perhaps, too, in consequence of having been
   mangled by scourging, and broken down by many acts of outrage, he bent
   under the weight of the cross. Now the Evangelists relate that the
   soldiers constrained a man who was a peasant, and of mean rank, to
   carry the cross; because that punishment was reckoned so detestable,
   that every person thought himself polluted, if he only happened to put
   his hand to it. [265] But God ennobles by his heralds the man who was
   taken from the lowest dregs of the people to perform a mean and
   infamous office; for it is not a superfluous matter, that the
   Evangelists not only mention his name, but inform us also about his
   country and his children. Nor can there be any doubt that God intended,
   by this preparation, to remind us that we are of no rank or estimation
   in ourselves, and that it is only from the cross of his Son that we
   derive eminence and renown.

   Luke 23:27. And there followed him. Although in public all the people,
   with one shout, had condemned Christ, yet we see that there were some
   who had not forgotten his doctrine and miracles; and thus, in the midst
   of that miserable dispersion, God reserved for himself a small remnant.
   And though the faith of those women was weak, yet it is probable that
   there was a hidden seed of piety, which afterwards in due time produced
   fruit. Yet their lamentation served to condemn the wicked and shocking
   cruelty of the men, who had conspired with the scribes and priests to
   put Christ to death But Luke's design was different, namely, to inform
   us, that when the wickedness of men breaks out into unrestrained
   disorder, God does not indolently look on, to see what they are doing,
   but sits as a judge in heaven, to punish them soon for their unjust
   cruelty; and that we ought not to despise his vengeance, because he
   delays it till the proper time, but that we ought to dread it before he
   appears.

   28. Weep not. Some have thought that the women are reproved, because
   foolishly and inconsiderately they poured out tears to no purpose. On
   the contrary, Christ does not simply reprove them, as if it were
   improperly and without a cause that they were weeping, but warns them
   that there will be far greater reason for weeping on account of the
   dreadful judgment of God which hangs over them; as if he had said, that
   his death was not the end, but the beginning, of evils to Jerusalem and
   to the whole nation; and in this way he intimates, that he was not
   abandoned to the wickedness of man in such a manner as not to be the
   object of Divine care. For, from the punishment which immediately
   followed, it was manifest that the life of Christ was dear to God the
   Father, at the time when all imagined that he had been wholly forsaken
   and cast off.

   These words do indeed show plainly with what exalted fortitude Christ
   was endued; for he could not have spoken in this manner, if he had not
   advanced to death with a steady and firm step. But the principal object
   is to show, that under this mean and revolting aspect he is still under
   the eye of God, and that wicked men, who now proudly triumph, as if
   they had obtained a victory, will not long enjoy their foolish mirth,
   for it will quickly be followed by an astonishing change. This doctrine
   is even now of use to us, when we learn that Christ was not less dear
   to his Father, because for a moment he was deprived of his aid, but
   that he set so high a value on our salvation, that he did not even
   spare his only-begotten Son. He gave a remarkable proof of this, when
   he razed to the foundation, and destroyed, along with its inhabitants,
   the Holy City, in which he had chosen his only sanctuary. Let us learn
   from this to rise to meditation on the cause of the death of Christ;
   for since God revenged it with such severity, he would never have
   permitted his Son to endure it, unless he had intended that it should
   be an expiation for the sins of the world.

   29 For, lo, the days will come. He threatens, that a calamity which is
   not usual, but fearful and unheard of, is at hand, in which will be
   perceived, at a glance, the vengeance of God. As if he had said, that
   this nation will not be carried away by a single or ordinary kind of
   destruction, but that it will perish under a mass of numerous and great
   calamities, so that it would be much more desirable that the mountains
   should fall upon them, and crush them, or that the earth should open
   and swallow them up, than that they should pine away amidst the cruel
   torments of a lingering destruction. Nor did those threatenings fall to
   the ground without effect, but this thunder of words was surpassed by
   the awful result, as is evident from Josephus. And as the wish to be
   crushed by the mountains, and the cursing of their children, were
   expressive of the lowest despair, Christ taught by these words that the
   Jews would at length feel that they had made war, not with a mortal
   man, but with God. Thus shall the enemies of God reap the just reward
   of their impious rage, when they who formerly dared even to attack
   heaven, shall in vain desire to employ the earth as a shield against
   his vengeance.

   31. If they do these things in the green tree. By this sentence Christ
   confirms what he had stated, that his death will not remain unpunished,
   and that the Jews, whose iniquity is ripe, or rather half-rotten, will
   not remain long in their present condition; and by a familiar
   comparison, he proves it to be impossible but that the fire of the
   divine wrath shall immediately kindle and devour them. We know that dry
   wood is wont to be first thrown into the fire; but if what is moist and
   green be burnt, much less shall the dry be ultimately spared. The
   phrase, if they do, may be taken indefinitely for if it be done [266]
   and the meaning will be: "If green wood is thrown into the fire before
   the time, what, think you, shall become of what is dry and old?" But
   some perhaps will prefer to view it as a comparison of men with God, as
   if Christ had said: "Wicked men, who resemble dry wood, when they have
   basely murdered the righteous, will find that their time is prepared by
   God. For how could they who are already devoted to destruction escape
   the hand of the heavenly Judge, who grants them so much liberty for a
   time against the good and innocent?"

   Whether you choose to interpret it in the one or the other of these
   ways, the general meaning is, that the lamentation of the women is
   foolish, if they do not likewise expect and dread the awful judgment of
   God which hangs over the wicked. And whenever our distress of mind,
   arising from the bitterness of the cross, goes to excess, it is proper
   to soothe it by this consolation, that God, who now permits his own
   people to be unjustly oppressed, will not ultimately allow the wicked
   to escape punishment. If we were not sustained by this hope, we must
   unavoidably sink under our afflictions. Though it be the natural and
   more frequent practice to make a fire of dry wood rather than of green
   wood, yet God pursues a different order; for, while he allows
   tranquillity and ease to the reprobate, he trains his own people by a
   variety of afflictions, and therefore their condition is more wretched
   than that of others, if we judge of it from the present appearance. But
   this is an appropriate remedy, if we patiently look for the whole
   course of the judgment of God; for thus we shall perceive that the
   wicked gain nothing by a little delay; for when God shall have humbled
   his faithful servants by fatherly chastisements, he will rise with a
   drawn sword against those whose sins he appeared for a time not to
   observe.

   33. And they came to a place which is called Golgotha, which is the
   place of Calvary. [267] 34. And they gave him to drink vinegar mingled
   with gall; and when he had tasted it, he would not drink. 35. And after
   they had crucified him, they parted his garments by casting lots; that
   it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my
   garments, and cast lots on my raiment. 36. And sitting down they
   watched him there. 37. And they placed over his head his accusation
   written, this is jesus the king of the jews. 38. Then were crucified
   with him two robbers, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.

   22. And they bring him to the place of Golgotha, which is, if you
   interpret it, The place of Calvary. [268] 23. And they gave him to
   drink wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not receive it. 24. And when
   they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon
   them, (to decide) what every one should take. 25. And it was the third
   hour, and they crucified him. [269] 26. And the inscription of his
   accusation was written, the king of the jews. 27. And they crucify with
   him two robbers, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.
   28. And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, [270] And he was
   ranked with malefactors.

   33. Having come to the place which is called Calvary, [271] there they
   crucified him, and the malefactors, one at his right hand, and the
   other at his left. 34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they
   know not what they do. And, parting his garments, they cast lots (A
   little after.) 38. And there was also an inscription written over him,
   in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew characters, this is the king of the jews.


   Matthew 27:33. And they came to the place. Jesus was brought to the
   place where it was customary to execute criminals, that his death might
   be more ignominious. Now though this was done according to custom,
   still we ought to consider the loftier purpose of God; for he
   determined that his Son should be cast out of the city as unworthy of
   human intercourse, that he might admit us into his heavenly kingdom
   with the angels. For this reason the apostle, in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, (13:12,) refers it to an ancient figure of the law. For as God
   commanded his people to burn without the camp the bodies of those
   animals, the blood of which was carried into the sanctuary to make
   atonement for sins, (Exodus 29:14; Leviticus 16:27;) so he says that
   Christ went out of the gate of the city, that, by taking upon him the
   curse which pressed us down, he might be regarded as accursed, and
   might in this manner atone for our sins. [272] Now the greater the
   ignominy and disgrace which he endured before the world, so much the
   more acceptable and noble a spectacle did he exhibit in his death to
   God and to the angels. For the infamy of the place did not hinder him
   from erecting there a splendid trophy of his victory; nor did the
   offensive smell of the carcasses which lay there hinder the sweet savor
   of his sacrifice from diffusing itself throughout the whole world, and
   penetrating even to heaven.

   34. And they gave him vinegar. Although the Evangelists are not so
   exact in placing each matter in its due order, as to enable us to fix
   the precise moment at which the events occurred; yet I look upon it as
   a probable conjecture that, before our Lord was elevated on the cross,
   there was offered to him in a cup, according to custom, wine mingled
   with myrrh, or some other mixture, which appears to have been
   compounded of gall and vinegar. It is sufficiently agreed, indeed,
   among nearly all interpreters, that this draught was different from
   that which is mentioned by John, (14:29,) and of which we shall speak
   very soon. I only add, that I consider the cup to have been offered to
   our Lord when he was about to be crucified; but that after the cross
   was lifted up, a sponge was then dipped and given to him. At what time
   he began to ask something to drink, I am not very anxious to inquire;
   but when we compare all the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to
   suppose that, after he had refused that bitter mixture, it was
   frequently in derision presented to his lips. For we shall find Matthew
   afterwards adding that the soldiers, while they were giving him to
   drink, upbraided him for not being able to rescue himself from death.
   Hence we infer that, while the remedy was offered, they ridiculed the
   weakness of Christ, because he had complained that he was forsaken by
   God, (Matthew 27:49.)

   As to the Evangelist John's narrative, it is only necessary to
   understand that Christ requested that some ordinary beverage might be
   given him to assuage his thirst, but that vinegar, mingled with myrrh
   and gall, was attempted to be forced upon him for hastening his death.
   But he patiently bore his torments, so that the lingering pain did not
   lead him to desire that his death should be hastened; for even this was
   a part of his sacrifice and obedience, to endure to the very last the
   lingering exhaustion.

   They are mistaken, in my opinion, who look upon the vinegar as one of
   the torments which were cruelly inflicted on the Son of God. There is
   greater probability in the conjecture of those who think that this kind
   of beverage had a tendency to promote the evacuation of blood, and that
   on this account it was usually given to malefactors, for the purpose of
   accelerating their death. Accordingly, Mark calls it wine mingled with
   myrrh. Now Christ, as I have just now hinted, was not led to refuse the
   wine or vinegar so much by a dislike of its bitterness, as by a desire
   to show that he advanced calmly to death, according to the command of
   the Father, and that he did not rush on heedlessly through want of
   patience for enduring pain. Nor is this inconsistent with what John
   says, that the Scripture was fulfilled, In my thirst they gave me
   vinegar to drink. For the two accounts perfectly agree with each other;
   that a remedy was given to him in order to put an end to the torments
   of a lingering death, and yet that Christ was in every respect treated
   with harshness, so that the very alleviation was a part, or rather was
   an augmentation, of his pain.

   35. They parted his garments. It is certain that the soldiers did this
   also according to custom, in dividing among themselves the clothes of a
   man who had been condemned to die. One circumstance was perhaps
   peculiar, that they cast lots on a coat which was without seam, (John
   19:23.) But though nothing happened to Christ in this respect but what
   was done to all who were condemned to die, still this narrative
   deserves the utmost attention. For the Evangelists exhibit to us the
   Son of God stripped of his garments, in order to inform us, that by
   this nakedness we have obtained those riches which make us honorable in
   the presence of God. God determined that his own Son should be stripped
   of his raiment, that we, clothed with his righteousness and with
   abundance of all good things, may appear with boldness in company with
   the angels, whereas formerly our loathsome and disgraceful aspect, in
   tattered garments, kept us back from approaching to heaven. Christ
   himself permitted his garments to be torn in pieces like a prey, that
   he might enrich us with the riches of his victory.

   That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. When
   Matthew says that thus was fulfilled the prediction of David,

   they part my garments among them, and cast the lot upon my vesture,
   (Psalm 22:18,)

   we must understand his meaning to be, that what David complained of, as
   having been done to himself metaphorically and figuratively, was
   literally, (as the common phrase is,) and in reality, exhibited in
   Christ. For by the word garments David means his wealth and honors; as
   if he had said that, during his life, and under his own eyes, he was
   prey to enemies, who had robbed his house, and were so far from sparing
   the rest of his property, that they even carried off his wife. This
   cruelty is represented even more strikingly by the metaphor, when he
   says that his garments were divided by lot. Now as he was a shadow and
   image of Christ, he predicted, by the spirit of prophecy, what Christ
   was to suffer. In his person, therefore, this is worthy of observation,
   that the soldiers plundered his raiment, because in this pillage we
   discern the signs and marks by which he was formerly pointed out. It
   serves also to remove the offense with which the sense of the flesh
   might otherwise have regarded his nakedness, since he suffered nothing
   which the Holy Spirit does not declare to belong truly and properly to
   the person of the Redeemer.

   Mark 15:25 And it was the third hour. This appears not to agree well
   with the testimony of the Evangelist John; for he relates that Christ
   was condemned about the sixth hour, (14:14.) But if we consider--what
   is evident from other passages--that the day was divided into four
   parts, and that each of the parts took its name from the first hour of
   its commencement, the solution will not be difficult. The whole time,
   from sunrise to the second part of the day, they called the first hour.
   The second part, which lasted till noon, was called by them the third
   hour. The sixth hour commenced at noon, and lasted till three or four
   o'clock in the afternoon. Thus, when the Jews saw that Pilate was
   wearing out the time, and that the hour of noon was approaching, John
   says that they cried out the more vehemently, that the whole day might
   not be allowed to pass without something being done, (14:15.) But this
   is not inconsistent with the assertion, that our Lord was crucified
   about the close of the third hour; for it is plain enough, that no
   sooner was he hastily condemned, than he was immediately executed; so
   eager was the desire of the Jews to put him to death. Mark therefore
   means not the beginning, but the close, of the third hour; and it is
   highly probable that Christ did not hang on the cross longer than three
   hours.

   Luke 23:34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them. By this expression
   Christ gave evidence that he was that mild and gentle lamb, which was
   to be led out to be sacrificed, as Isaiah the prophet had foretold,
   (53:7.) For not only does he abstain from revenge, but pleads with God
   the Father for the salvation of those by whom he is most cruelly
   tormented. It would have been a great matter not to think of rendering
   evil for evil, (1 Peter 3:9;) as Peter, when he exhorts us to patience
   by the example of Christ, says that he did not render curses for
   curses, and did not revenge the injuries done to him, but was fully
   satisfied with having God for his avenger (1 Peter 2:23.) But this is a
   far higher and more excellent virtue, to pray that God would forgive
   his enemies.

   If any one think that this does not agree well with Peter's sentiment,
   which I have just now quoted, the answer is easy. For when Christ was
   moved by a feeling of compassion to ask forgiveness from God for his
   persecutors, this did not hinder him from acquiescing in the righteous
   judgment of God, which he knew to be ordained for reprobate and
   obstinate men. Thus when Christ saw that both the Jewish people and the
   soldiers raged against him with blind fury, though their ignorance was
   not excusable, he had pity on them, and presented himself as their
   intercessor. Yet knowing that God would be an avenger, he left to him
   the exercise of judgment against the desperate. In this manner ought
   believers also to restrain their feelings in enduring distresses, so as
   to desire the salvation of their persecutors, and yet to rest assured
   that their life is under the protection of God, and, relying on this
   consolation, that the licentiousness of wicked men will not in the end
   remain unpunished, not to faint under the burden of the cross.

   Of this moderation Luke now presents an instance in our Leader and
   Master; for though he might have denounced perdition against his
   persecutors, he not only abstained from cursing, but even prayed for
   their welfare. But it ought to be observed that, when the whole world
   rises against us, and all unite in striving to crush us, the best
   remedy for over-coming temptation is, to recall to our remembrance the
   blindness of those who fight against God in our persons. For the result
   will be, that the conspiracy of many persons against us, when solitary
   and deserted, will not distress us beyond measure; as, on the other
   hand, daily experience shows how powerfully it acts in shaking weak
   persons, when they see themselves attacked by a great multitude. And,
   therefore, if we learn to raise our minds to God, it will be easy for
   us to look down, as it were, from above, and despise the ignorance of
   unbelievers; for whatever may be their strength and resources, still
   they know not what they do.

   It is probable, however, that Christ did not pray for all
   indiscriminately, but only for the wretched multitude, who were carried
   away by inconsiderate zeal, and not by premeditated wickedness. For
   since the scribes and priests were persons in regard to whom no ground
   was left for hope, it would have been in vain for him to pray for them.
   Nor can it be doubted that this prayer was heard by the heavenly
   Father, and that this was the cause why many of the people afterwards
   drank by faith the blood which they had shed.

   Matthew 27:37. And placed over his head. What is briefly noticed by
   Matthew and Mark is more fully related by Luke, (23:38,) that the
   inscription was written in three languages. John also describes it more
   largely, (14:19-22.) Under this passage my readers will find what I
   pass over here for the sake of brevity. I shall only say, that it did
   not happen without the providence of God, that the death of Christ was
   made known in three languages. Though Pilate had no other design than
   to bring reproach and infamy on the Jewish nation, yet God had a higher
   end in view; for by this presage he caused it to be widely known that
   the death of his Son would be highly celebrated, so that all nations
   would everywhere acknowledge that he was the King promised to the Jews.
   This was not, indeed, the lawful preaching of the Gospel, for Pilate
   was unworthy to be employed by God as a witness for his Son; but what
   was afterwards to be accomplished by the true ministers was prefigured
   in Pilate. In short, we may look upon him to be a herald of Christ in
   the same sense that Caiaphas was a prophet, (John 11:51.)

   38. Then were crucified with him two robbers. It was the finishing
   stroke of the lowest disgrace when Christ was executed between two
   robbers; for they assigned him the most prominent place, as if' he had
   been the prince of robbers. If he had been crucified apart from the
   other malefactors, there might have appeared to be a distinction
   between his case and theirs; but now he is not only confounded with
   them, but raised aloft, as if he had been by far the most detestable of
   all. On this account Mark applies to him the prediction of Isaiah,
   (53:12) he was reckoned among transgressors; for the prophet expressly
   says concerning Christ, that he will deliver his people, not by pomp
   and splendor, but because he will endure the punishment clue to their
   sins. In order that he might free us from condemnation, this kind of
   expiation was necessary, that he might place himself in, our room. Here
   we perceive how dreadful is the weight of the wrath of God against
   sins, for appeasing which it became necessary that Christ, who is
   eternal justice, should be ranked with robbers. We see, also, the
   inestimable love of Christ towards us, who, in order that he might
   admit us to the society of the holy angels, permitted himself to be
   classed as one of the wicked.

   39. And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, 40. And
   saying, Thou who destroyedst the temple, and buildedst it in three
   days, save thyself; if thou art the Son of God, come down from the
   cross. 41. In like manner also the chief priests mocking, with the
   scribes and elders, said, 42. He saved others, himself he cannot save;
   if he is the King of Israel, let him now descend from the cross, and we
   will believe him. 43. He trusted in God. Let him deliver him now, if he
   favors him; for he said, I am the Son of God. 44. The robbers also, who
   were crucified with him, upbraided him in the same manner.

   29. And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and
   saying, O, thou who destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
   days, 30. Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 31. In like
   manner also the chief priests mocking, said among themselves, with the
   scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save. 32. Let Christ the
   King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and
   believe. And they that were crucified with him upbraided him.

   35. And the people stood gazing, and the rulers along with them mocked
   him, saying, He saved others, let him save himself, if he is the
   Christ, the elect of God. 36. The soldiers also mocked him,
   approaching, and offering him vinegar, 37. And saying, If thou art the
   King of the Jews, save thyself. (And a little after.) 39. And one of
   the malefactors, who were executed, reviled him, saying, If thou art
   the Christ, save thyself and us. 40. And the other answering, rebuked
   him, saying, Dost not thou at least fear God, since thou art in the
   same condemnation? 41. And we indeed justly; for we receive what is due
   to our actions, but this man hath done nothing amiss. 42. And he said
   to Jesus, Lord, remember me, when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.
   43. Jesus said to him, Verily, I say to thee, Today shalt thou be with
   me in paradise.


   Matthew 27:39. And they that passed by. These circumstances carry great
   weight; for they place before us the extreme abasement of the Son of
   God, that we may see more clearly how much our salvation cost him, and
   that, reflecting that we justly deserved all the punishments which he
   endured, we may be more and more excited to repentance. For in this
   exhibition God hath plainly showed to us how wretched our condition
   would have been, if we had not a Redeemer. But all that Christ endured
   in himself ought to be applied for our consolation. This certainly was
   more cruel than all the other tortures, that they upbraided, and
   reviled, and tormented him as one that had been cast off and forsaken
   by God, (Isaiah 53:4.) And, therefore, David, as the representative of
   Christ, complains chiefly of this among the distresses which he
   suffered; (Psalm 22:7.) And, indeed, there is nothing that inflicts a
   more painful wound on pious minds than when ungodly men, in order to
   shake their faith, upbraid them with being deprived of the assistance
   and favor of God. This is the harsh persecution with which, Paul tells
   us, Isaac was tormented by Ishmael, (Galatians 4:29;) not that he
   attacked him with the sword, and with outward violence, but that, by
   turning the grace of God into ridicule, he endeavored to overthrow his
   faith. These temptations were endured, first by David, and afterwards
   by Christ him-self, that they might not at the present day strike us
   with excessive alarm, as if they had been unusual; for there never will
   be wanting wicked men who are disposed to insult our distresses. And
   whenever God does not assist us according to our wish, but conceals his
   aid for a little time, it is a frequent stratagem of Satan, to allege
   that our hope was to no purpose, as if his promise had failed.

   40. Thou who destroyedst the temple. They charge Christ with teaching
   falsehood, because, now that it is called for, he does not actually
   display the power to which he laid claim. But if their unbridled
   propensity to cursing had not deprived them of sense and reason, they
   would shortly afterwards have perceived clearly the truth of his
   statement. Christ had said,

   Destroy this temple, and after three days I will raise it up,
   (John 2:19;)

   but now they indulge in a premature triumph, and do not wait for the
   three days that would elapse from the commencement of its destruction.
   Such is the daring presumption of wicked men, when, under the pretense
   of the cross, they endeavor to cut them off from the hope of the future
   life. "Where," say they, "is that immortal glory of which weak and
   credulous men are accustomed to boast? while the greater part of them
   are mean and despised, some are slenderly provided with food, others
   drag out a wretched life, amidst uninterrupted disease; others are
   driven about in flight, or in banishment; others pine away in prisons,
   and others are burnt and reduced to ashes?" Thus are they blinded by
   the present corruption of our outward man, so as to imagine that the
   hope of the future restoration of life is vain and foolish but our duty
   is to wait for the proper season of the promised building, and not to
   take it ill if we are now crucified with Christ, that we may afterwards
   be partakers of his resurrection, (Romans 6:5, 6.)

   If thou art the Son of God. Wicked men demand from Christ such a proof
   of His power that, by proving himself to be the Son of God, he may
   cease to be the Son of God. He had clothed himself with human flesh,
   and had descended into the world, on this condition, that, by the
   sacrifice of his death, he might reconcile men to God the Father. So
   then, in order to prove himself to be the Son of God, it was necessary
   that he should hang on the cross. And now those wicked men affirm that
   the Redeemer will not be recognized as the Son of God, unless he come
   clown from the cross, and thus disobey the command of his Father, and,
   leaving incomplete the expiation of sins, divest himself of the office
   which God had assigned to him. But let us learn from it to confirm our
   faith by considering that the Son of God determined to remain nailed to
   the cross for the sake of our salvation, until he had endured most
   cruel torments of the flesh, and dreadful anguish of soul, and even
   death itself. And lest we should come to tempt God in a manner similar
   to that in which those men tempted him, let us allow God to conceal his
   power, whenever it pleases Him to do so, that he may afterwards display
   it at his pleasure at the proper time and place. The same kind of
   depravity appears in the other objection which immediately follows: --

   42. If he is the King, of Israel, let him now come down from the cross,
   and we shall believe him. For they ought not to embrace as King any one
   who did not answer to the description given by the prophets. But Isaiah
   (52:14; 53:2) and Zechariah (13:7) expressly represent Christ as devoid
   of comeliness, afflicted, condemned, and accursed, half-dead, poor, and
   despised, before he ascends the royal throne. It is therefore foolish
   in the Jews to desire one of an opposite character, whom they may
   acknowledge as King; for, by so doing, they declare that they have no
   good-will to the King whom the Lord had promised to give. But let us,
   on the contrary, that our faith may firmly rely on Christ, seek a
   foundation in his cross; for in no other way could he be acknowledged
   to be the lawful King of Israel than by fulfilling what belonged to the
   Redeemer. And hence we conclude how dangerous it is to depart from the
   word of God by wandering after our speculations. For the Jews, in
   consequence of having imagined to themselves a King who had been
   suggested to them by their own senses, rejected Christ crucified,
   because they reckoned it absurd to believe in him; while we regard it
   as the best and highest reason for believing, that he voluntarily
   subjected himself on our account to the ignominy of the cross.

   He saved others; himself he cannot save. It was an ingratitude which
   admits of no excuse, that, taking offense at the present humiliation of
   Christ, they utterly disregard all the miracles which he had formerly
   performed before their eyes. They acknowledge that he saved others. By
   what power, or by what means? Why do they not in this instance, at
   least, behold with reverence an evident work of God? But since they
   maliciously exclude, and--as far as lies in their power--endeavor to
   extinguish the light of God which shone in the miracles, they are
   unworthy of forming an accurate judgment of the weakness of the cross.
   Because Christ does not immediately deliver himself from death, they
   upbraid him with inability. And it is too customary with all wicked men
   to estimate the power of God by present appearances, so that whatever
   he does not accomplish they think that he cannot accomplish, and so
   they accuse him of weakness, whenever he does not comply with their
   wicked desire. But let us believe that Christ, though he might easily
   have done it, did not immediately deliver himself from death, but it
   was because he did not wish to deliver himself. And why did he for the
   time disregard his own safety, but because he cared more about the
   salvation of us all? We see then that the Jews, through their malice,
   employed, in defense of their unbelief, those things by which our faith
   is truly edified.

   43. He trusted in God. This, as I said a little ago, is a very sharp
   arrow of temptation which Satan holds in his hand, when he pretends
   that God has forgotten us, because He does not relieve us speedily and
   at the very moment. For since God watches over the safety of his
   people, and not only grants them seasonable aid, but even anticipates
   their necessities, (as Scripture everywhere teaches us,) he appears not
   to love those whom he does not assist. Satan, therefore, attempts to
   drive us to despair by this logic, that it is in vain for us to feel
   assured o the love of God, when we do not clearly perceive his aid. And
   as he suggests to our minds this kind of imposition, so he employs his
   agents, who contend that God has sold and abandoned our salvation,
   because he delays to give his assistance. We ought, therefore, to
   reject as false this argument, that God does not love those whom he
   appears for a time to forsake; and, indeed, nothing is more
   unreasonable than to limit his love to any point of time. God has,
   indeed, promised that he will be our Deliverer; but if he sometimes
   wink at our calamities, we ought patiently to endure the delay. It is,
   therefore, contrary to the nature of faith, that the word now should be
   insisted on by those whom God is training by the cross and by adversity
   to obedience, and whom he entreats to pray and to call on his name; for
   these are rather the testimonies of his fatherly love, as the apostle
   tells us, (Hebrews 12:6.) But there was this peculiarity in, Christ,
   that, though he was the well-beloved Son, (Matthew 3:17; 17:5,) yet he
   was not delivered from death, until he had endured the punishment which
   we deserved; because that was the price by which our salvation was
   purchased. [273] Hence it follows again that the priests act
   maliciously, when they infer that he is not the Son of God, because he
   performs the office which was enjoined upon him by the Father.

   44. And the robbers also. Matthew and Mark, by synecdoche, attribute to
   the robbers what was done only by one of them, as is evident from Luke
   And this mode of expression ought not to be accounted harsh; for the
   two Evangelists had no other design than to show that Christ was
   attacked on every hand by the reproaches of all men, so that even the
   robbers, who were fast dying, did not spare him. In like manner David,
   deploring his calamities, exhibits their violence in a strong light by
   saying, that he is the reproach of all sorts of men, and despised by
   the people. Now although they leave out the memorable narrative which
   Luke relates as to the other robber, still there is no inconsistency in
   their statement, that Christ was despised by all, down to the very
   robbers; for they do not speak of particular individuals, but of the
   class itself. Let us now, therefore, come to what is stated by Luke

   Luke 23:39. And one of the malefactors. This reproach, which the Son of
   God endured from the robber, obtained for us among angels the very high
   honor of acknowledging us to be their brethren. But at the same time,
   an example of furious obstinacy is held out to us in this wretched man,
   since even in the midst of his torments he does not cease fiercely to
   foam out his blasphemies. Thus desperate men are wont to take obstinate
   revenge for the torments which they cannot avoid. [274] And although he
   upbraids Christ with not being able to save either himself or others,
   yet this objection is directed against God himself; just as wicked men,
   when they do not obtain what they wish, would willingly tear God from
   heaven. They ought, indeed, to be tamed to humility by strokes; but
   this shows that the wicked heart, which no punishments can bend, is
   hard like iron.

   40. And the other answering. In this wicked man a striking mirror of
   the unexpected and incredible grace of God is held out to us, not only
   in his being suddenly changed into a new man, when he was near death,
   and drawn from hell itself to heaven, but likewise in having obtained
   in a moment the forgiveness of all the sins in which he had been
   plunged through his whole life, and in having been thus admitted to
   heaven before the apostles and first-fruits of the new Church. First,
   then, a remarkable instance of the grace of God shines in the
   conversion of that man. For it was not by the natural movement of the
   flesh that he laid aside his fierce cruelty and proud contempt of God,
   so as to repent immediately, but he was subdued by the hand of God; as
   the whole of Scripture shows that repentance is His work. And so much
   the more excellent is this grace, that it came beyond the expectation
   of all. For who would ever have thought that a robber, in the very
   article of death, would become not only a devout worshiper of God, but
   a distinguished teacher of faith and piety to the whole world, so that
   we too must receive from his mouth the rule of a true and proper
   confession? Now the first proof which he gave of his repentance was,
   that he severely reproved and restrained the wicked forwardness of his
   companion. He then added a second, by humbling himself in open
   acknowledgment of his crimes, and ascribing to Christ the praise due to
   his righteousness. Thirdly, he displayed astonishing faith by
   committing himself and his salvation to the protection of Christ, while
   he saw him hanging on the cross and near death.

   Dost not thou fear God? Though these words are tortured in various ways
   by commentators, yet the natural meaning of them appears to me to be,
   What is the meaning of this, that even this condemnation does not
   compel thee to fear God? For the robber represents it as an additional
   proof of the hard-heartedness of his companion, that when reduced to
   the lowest straits, he does not even now begin to fear God. But to
   remove all ambiguity, it is proper to inform the reader that an
   impudent and detestable blasphemer, who thought that he might safely
   indulge in ridicule, is summoned to the judgment-seat of God; for
   though he had remained all his life unmoved, he ought to have trembled
   when he saw that the hand of God was armed against him, and that he
   must soon render an account of all his crimes; It was, therefore, a
   proof of desperate and diabolical obstinacy, that while God held him
   bound by the final judgment, he did not even then return to a sound
   mind; for if there had been the smallest particle of godliness in the
   heart of that man, he would at least have been constrained to yield to
   the fear of God. We now perceive the general meaning of his words, that
   those men, in whom even punishments do not produce amendment, are
   desperate, and totally destitute of the fear of God.

   I interpret the words en to auto krimati to mean not in the same
   condemnation, but during the condemnation itself; [275] as if the
   robber had said, Since thou art even now in the jaws of death, thou
   oughtest to be aroused to acknowledge God as thy Judge. Hence, too, we
   draw a useful doctrine, that those whom punishments do not train to
   humility do altogether resist God; for they who possess any fear of God
   must necessarily be overwhelmed with shame, and struck silent.

   41. And we indeed justly. As the reproof founded on the condemnation
   might be thought to apply to Christ, the robber here draws a
   distinction between the condition of Christ and that of himself and his
   companion, or he acknowledges, that the punishment which was common to
   all the three was justly inflicted on him and his companion, but not on
   Christ, who had been dragged to the punishment of death, not by his own
   crime, but by the cruelty of enemies. But we ought to remember what I
   said a little ago, that the robber gave a proof of his repentance, such
   as God demands from all of us, when he acknowledged that he was now
   receiving the reward due to his actions. Above all, it ought to be
   observed, that the severity of the punishment did not hinder him from
   patiently submitting to dreadful tortures. And, therefore, if we truly
   repent of our crimes, let us learn to confess them willingly and
   without hypocrisy, whenever it is necessary, and not to refuse the
   disgrace which we have deserved. For the only method of burying our
   sins before God and before angels is, not to attempt to disguise them
   before men by vain excuses. Again, among the various coverings on which
   hypocrisy seizes, the most frequent of all is, that every one draws in
   others along with himself, that he may excuse himself by their example
   The robber, on the other hand, is not less eager to maintain the
   innocence of Christ, than he is frank and open in condemning himself
   and his companion.

   42. Lord, remember me. I know not that, since the creation of the
   world, there ever was a more remarkable and striking example of faith;
   and so much the greater admiration is due to the grace of the Holy
   Spirit, of which it affords so magnificent a display. A robber, who not
   only had not been educated in the school of Christ, but, by giving
   himself up to execrable murders, had endeavored to extinguish all sense
   of what was right, suddenly rises higher than all the apostles and the
   other disciples whom the Lord himself had taken so much pains to
   instruct; and not only so, but he adores Christ as a King while on the
   gallows, celebrates his kingdom in the midst of shocking and worse than
   revolting abasement, and declares him, when dying, to be the Author of
   life. Even though he had formerly possessed right faith, and heard many
   things about the office of Christ, and had even been confirmed in it by
   his miracles, still that knowledge might have been overpowered by the
   thick darkness of so disgraceful a death. But that a person, ignorant
   and uneducated, and whose mind was altogether corrupted, should all at
   once, on receiving his earliest instructions, perceive salvation and
   heavenly glory in the accursed cross, was truly astonishing. For what
   marks or ornaments of royalty did he see in Christ, so as to raise his
   mind to his kingdom? And, certainly, this was, as it were, from the
   depth of hell to rise above the heavens. To the flesh it must have
   appeared to be fabulous and absurd, to ascribe to one who was rejected
   and despised, (Isaiah 53:3) whom the world could not endure, an earthly
   kingdom more exalted than all the empires of the world. Hence we infer
   how acute must have been the eyes of his mind, by which he beheld life
   in death, exaltation in ruin, glory in shame, victory in destruction, a
   kingdom in bondage.

   Now if a robber, by his faith, elevated Christ--while hanging on the
   cross, and, as it were, overwhelmed with cursing--to a heavenly throne,
   woe to our sloth [276] , if we do not behold him with reverence while
   sitting at the right hand of God; if we do not fix our hope of life on
   his resurrection; if our aim is not towards heaven where he has
   entered. Again, if we consider, on the other hand, the condition in
   which he was, when he implored the compassion of Christ, our admiration
   of his faith will be still heightened. With a mangled body, and almost
   dead, he is looking for the last stroke of the executioner and yet he
   relies on the grace of Christ alone. First, whence came his assurance
   of pardon, but because in the death of Christ, which all others look
   upon as detestable, he beholds a sacrifice of sweet savor, efficacious
   for expiating the sins of the world. [277] And when he courageously
   disregards his tortures, and is even so forgetful of himself, that he
   is carried away to the hope and desire of the hidden life, this goes
   far beyond the human faculties. From this teacher, therefore, whom the
   Lord has appointed over us to humble the pride of the flesh, let us not
   be ashamed to learn the mortification of the flesh, and patience, and
   elevation of faith, and steadiness of hope, and ardor of piety; for the
   more eagerly any man follows him, so much the more nearly will he
   approach to Christ.

   43. Verily I tell thee. Though Christ had not yet made a public triumph
   over death, still he displays the efficacy and fruit of his death in
   the midst of his humiliation. And in this way he shows that he never
   was deprived of the power of his kingdom; for nothing more lofty or
   magnificent belongs to a divine King, [278] than to restore life to the
   dead. So then, Christ, although, struck by the hand of God, he appeared
   to be a man utterly abandoned, yet as he did not cease to be the Savior
   of the world, he was always endued with heavenly power for fulfilling
   his office. And, first, we ought to observe his inconceivable readiness
   in so kindly receiving the robber without delay, and promising to make
   him a partaker [279] of a happy life. There is therefore no room to
   doubt that he is prepared to admit into his kingdom all, without
   exception, who shall apply to him. Hence we may conclude with certainty
   that we shall be saved, provided that he remember us; and it is
   impossible that he shall forget those who commit to him their
   salvation.

   But if a robber found the entrance into heaven so easy, because, while
   he beheld on all sides ground for total despair, he relied on the grace
   of Christ; much more will Christ, who has now vanquished death, stretch
   out his hand to us from his throne, to admit us to be partakers of
   life. For since Christ has

   nailed to his cross the handwriting which was opposed to us,
   (Colossians 2:14,)

   and has destroyed death and Satan, and in his resurrection has
   triumphed over the prince of the world, (John 12:31,) it would be
   unreasonable to suppose that the passage from death to life will be
   more laborious and difficult to us than to the robber. Whoever then in
   dying shall commit to Christ, in true faith, the keeping of his soul,
   will not be long detained or allowed to languish in suspense; but
   Christ will meet his prayer with the same kindness which he exercised
   towards the robber. Away, then, with that detestable contrivance of the
   Sophists about retaining the punishment when the guilt is removed; for
   we see how Christ, in acquitting him from condemnation, frees him also
   from punishment. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that the
   robber nevertheless endures to the very last the punishment which had
   been pronounced upon him; for we must not here imagine any compensation
   which serves the purpose of satisfaction for appeasing the judgment of
   God, (as the Sophists dream,) but the Lord merely trains his elect by
   corporal punishments to displeasure and hatred of sin. Thus, when the
   robber has been brought by fatherly discipline to self-denial Christ
   receives him, as it were, into his bosom, and does not send him away to
   the fire of purgatory.

   We ought likewise to observe by what keys the gate of heaven was opened
   to the robber; for neither papal confession nor satisfactions are here
   taken into account, but Christ is satisfied with repentance and faith,
   so as to receive him willingly when he comes to him. And this confirms
   more fully what I formerly suggested, that if any man disdain to abide
   by the footsteps of the robber, and to follow in his path, he deserves
   everlasting destruction, because by wicked pride he shuts against
   himself the gate of heaven. And, certainly, as Christ has given to all
   of us, in the person of the robber, a general pledge of obtaining
   forgiveness, so, on the other hand, he has bestowed on this wretched
   man such distinguished honor, in order that, laying aside our own
   glory, we may glory in nothing but the mercy of God alone. If each of
   us shall truly and seriously examine the subject, we shall find
   abundant reason to be ashamed of the prodigious mass of our crimes, so
   that we shall not be offended at having for our guide and leader a poor
   wretch, who obtained salvation by free grace. Again, as the death of
   Christ at that time yielded its fruit, so we infer from it that souls,
   when they have departed from their bodies, continue to live; otherwise
   the promise of Christ, which he confirms even by an oath, would be a
   mockery.

   Today shalt thou be with me in paradise. We ought not to enter into
   curious and subtle arguments about the place of paradise. Let us rest
   satisfied with knowing that those who are engrafted by faith into the
   body of Christ are partakers of that life, and thus enjoy after death a
   blessed and joyful rest, until the perfect glory of the heavenly life
   is fully manifested by the coming of Christ.

   One point still remains. What is promised to the robber does not
   alleviate his present sufferings, nor make any abatement of his bodily
   punishment. This reminds us that we ought not to judge of the grace of
   God by the perception of the flesh; for it will often happen that those
   to whom God is reconciled are permitted by him to be severely
   afflicted. So then, if we are dreadfully tormented in body, we ought to
   be on our guard lest the severity of pain hinder us from tasting the
   goodness of God; but, on the contrary, all our afflictions ought to be
   mitigated and soothed by this single consolation, that as soon as God
   has received us into his favor, all the afflictions which we endure are
   aids to our salvation. This will cause our faith not only to rise
   victorious over all our distresses, but to enjoy calm repose amidst the
   endurance of sufferings.

   Luke 23:44-49

   45. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land
   [280] till the ninth hour. 46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried
   with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God,
   my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 47. And some of those who were
   standing by, when they heard it, said, He calleth Elijah. 48. And
   immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with
   vinegar, and fastened it to a reed, and gave him to drink. 49. But
   others said, Let him alone, let us see if Elijah will come to save him.
   50. And Jesus having again cried with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.
   51. And, lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the
   bottom; and the earth trembled, and the rocks were split, 52. And
   graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had slept arose,
   53. And came out of their graves, after his resurrection, and came into
   the holy city and appeared to many. 54. Now the centurion, and they who
   were with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and those
   things which were done, were exceedingly terrified, saying, Truly this
   was the Son of God. 55. And there were there many women looking on at a
   distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:
   56. Among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and
   Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

   33. But when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over all the
   land [281] till the ninth hour. 34. And the ninth hour Jesus cried with
   a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, when
   interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 35. And some of
   those who were standing by, when they heard it, said, Lo, he calleth
   for Elijah. 36. And some one ran, and filled a sponge with vinegar, and
   fastened it to a reed, and held it out to him to drink, saying, Let him
   alone, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down. 37. And Jesus,
   having uttered a loud voice, expired. 38. And the veil of the temple
   was rent in two from the top to the bottom. 39. And when the centurion,
   who was standing opposite to him, saw that he thus expired after crying
   aloud, he said, Certainly this man was the Son of God. 40. And there
   were also women looking on from a distance, among whom was Mary
   Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James the less and of Joses, and of
   Salome; 41. (Who also, when he was in Galilee, had followed him, and
   ministered to him,) and many others, who had also gone up with him to
   Jerusalem.

   44. Now it was about the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all
   the land [282] till the ninth hour. 45. And the sun was darkened, and
   the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 46. And Jesus having
   cried with a loud voice, said, Father into thy hands I commit my
   spirit. And having said this, he expired. 47. And when the centurion
   saw what happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a
   righteous man. 48. And all the multitudes who were present at that
   spectacle, when they saw what was done, returned, smiting their
   breasts. 49. And all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed
   him from Galilee, stood at a distance, beholding these things.


   Matthew 27:45. Now from the sixth hour. Although in the death of Christ
   the weakness of the flesh concealed for a short time the glory of the
   Godhead, and though the Son of God himself was disfigured by shame and
   contempt, and, as Paul says, was emptied, (Philippians 2:7) yet the
   heavenly Father did not cease to distinguish him by some marks, and
   during his lowest humiliation prepared some indications of his future
   glory, in order to fortify the minds of the godly against the offense
   of the cross. Thus the majesty of Christ was attested by the
   obscuration of the sun, by the earthquake, by the splitting of the
   rocks, and the rending of the veil, as if heaven and earth were
   rendering the homage which they owed to their Creator.

   But we inquire, in the first place, what was the design of the eclipse
   of the sun? For the fiction of the ancient poets in their tragedies,
   that the light of the sun is withdrawn from the earth whenever any
   shocking crime is perpetrated, was intended to express the alarming
   effects of the anger of God; and this invention unquestionably had its
   origin in the ordinary feelings of mankind. In accordance with this
   view, some commentators think that, at the death of Christ, God sent
   darkness as a Mark of detestation, as if God, by bringing darkness over
   the sun, hid his face from beholding the blackest of all crimes. Others
   say that, when the visible sun was extinguished, it pointed out the
   death of the Sun of righteousness. Others choose to refer it to the
   blinding of the nation, which followed shortly afterwards. For the
   Jews, by rejecting Christ, as soon as he was removed from among them,
   were deprived of the light of heavenly doctrine, and nothing was left
   to them but the darkness of despair.

   I rather think that, as stupidity had shut the eyes of that people
   against the light, the darkness was intended to arouse them to consider
   the astonishing design of God in the death of Christ. For if they were
   not altogether hardened, an unusual change of the order of nature must
   have made a deep impression on their senses, so as to look forward to
   an approaching renewal of the world. Yet it was a terrific spectacle
   which was exhibited to them, that they might tremble at the judgment of
   God. And, indeed, it was an astonishing display of the wrath of God
   that he did not spare even his only begotten Son, and was not appeased
   in any other way than by that price of expiation.

   As to the scribes and priests, and a great part of the nation, who paid
   no attention to the eclipse of the sun, but passed it by with closed
   eyes, their amazing madness ought to strike us with horror; [283] for
   they must have been more stupid than brute beasts, who when plainly
   warned of the severity of the judgment of heaven by such a miracle, did
   not cease to indulge in mockery. But this is the spirit of stupidity
   and of giddiness with which God intoxicates the reprobate, after having
   long contended with their malice. Meanwhile, let us learn that, when
   they were bewitched by the enchantments of Satan, the glory of God,
   however manifest, was afterwards hidden from them, or, at least, that
   their minds were darkened, so that, seeing they did not see, (Matthew
   13:14.) But as it was a general admonition, it ought also to be of
   advantage to us, by informing us that the sacrifice by which we are
   redeemed was of as much importance as if the sun had fallen from
   heaven, or if the whole fabric of the world had fallen to pieces; for
   this will excite in us deeper horror at our sins.

   As to the opinion entertained by some who make this eclipse of the sun
   extend to every quarter of the world, I do not consider it to be
   probable. For though it was related by one or two authors, still the
   history of those times attracted so much attention, that it was
   impossible for so remarkable a miracle to be passed over in silence by
   many other authors, who have described minutely events which were not
   so worthy of being recorded. Besides, if the eclipse had been universal
   throughout the world, it would have been regarded as natural, and would
   more easily have escaped the notice of men. [284] But when the sun was
   shining elsewhere, it was a more striking miracle that Judea was
   covered with darkness.

   46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried. Though in the cry which
   Christ uttered a power more than human was manifested, yet it was
   unquestionably drawn from him by intensity of sorrow. And certainly
   this was his chief conflict, and harder than all the other tortures,
   that in his anguish he was so far from being soothed by the assistance
   or favor of his Father, that he felt himself to be in some measure
   estranged from him. For not only did he offer his body as the price of
   our reconciliation with God, but. in his soul also he endured the
   punishments due to us; and thus he became, as Isaiah speaks, a man of
   sorrows, (53:3.) Those interpreters are widely mistaken who, laying
   aside this part of redemption, attended solely to the outward
   punishment of the flesh; for in order that Christ might satisfy for us,
   [285] it was necessary that he should be placed as a guilty person at
   the judgment-seat of God. Now nothing is more dreadful than to feel
   that God, whose wrath is worse than all deaths, is the Judge. When this
   temptation was presented to Christ, as if, having God opposed to him,
   he were already devoted to destruction, he was seized with horror,
   which would have been sufficient to swallow up a hundred times all the
   men in the world; but by the amazing power of the Spirit he achieved
   the victory. Nor is it by hypocrisy, or by assuming a character, that
   he complains of having been forsaken by the Father. Some allege that he
   employed this language in compliance with the opinion of the people,
   but this is an absurd mode of evading the difficulty; for the inward
   sadness of his soul was so powerful and violent, that it forced him to
   break out into a cry. Nor did the redemption which he accomplished
   consist solely in what was exhibited to the eye, (as I stated a little
   ago,) but having undertaken to be our surety, he resolved actually to
   undergo in our room the judgment of God.

   But it appear absurd to say that an expression of despair escaped
   Christ. The reply is easy. Though the perception of the flesh would
   have led him to dread destruction, still in his heart faith remained
   firm, by which he beheld the presence of God, of whose absence he
   complains. We have explained elsewhere how the Divine nature gave way
   to the weakness of the flesh, so far as was necessary for our
   salvation, that Christ might accomplish all that was required of the
   Redeemer. We have likewise pointed out the distinction between the
   sentiment of nature and the knowledge of faith; and, there ore, the
   perception of God's estrangement from him, which Christ had, as
   suggested by natural feeling, did not hinder him from continuing to be
   assured by faith that God was reconciled to him. This is sufficiently
   evident from the two clauses of the complaint; for, before stating the
   temptation, he begins by saying that he betakes himself to God as his
   God, and thus by the shield of faith he courageously expels that
   appearance of forsaking which presented itself on the other side. In
   short, during this fearful torture his faith remained uninjured, so
   that, while he complained of being forsaken, he still relied on the aid
   of God as at hand.

   That this expression eminently deserves our attention is evident from
   the circumstance, that the Holy Spirit, in order to engrave it more
   deeply on the memory of men, has chosen to relate it in the Syriac
   language; [286] for this has the same effect as if he made us hear
   Christ himself repeating the very words which then proceeded from his
   mouth. So much the more detestable is the indifference of those who
   lightly pass by, as a matter of jesting, the deep sadness and fearful
   trembling which Christ endured. No one who considers that Christ
   undertook the office of Mediator on the condition of suffering our
   condemnation, both in his body and in his soul, will think it strange
   that he maintained a struggle with the sorrows of death, as if an
   offended God had thrown him into a whirlpool of afflictions.

   47. He calleth Elijah. Those who consider this as spoken by the
   soldiers, ignorant and unskilled in the Syriac language, and
   unacquainted with the Jewish religion, and who imagine that the
   soldiers blundered through a resemblance of the words, are, in my
   opinion, mistaken. I do not think it at all probable that they erred
   through ignorance, but rather that they deliberately intended to mock
   Christ, and to turn his prayer into an occasion of slander. For Satan
   has no method more effectual for ruining the salvation of the godly,
   than by dissuading them from calling on God. For this reason, he
   employs his agents to drive off from us, as far as he can, the desire
   to pray. Thus he impelled the wicked enemies of Christ basely to turn
   his prayer into derision, intending by this stratagem to strip him of
   his chief armor. And certainly it is a very grievous temptation, when
   prayer appears to be so far from yielding any advantage to us, that God
   exposes his name to reproaches, instead of lending a gracious car to
   our prayers. This ironical language, therefore -- or rather this
   barking of dogs -- amounts to saying that Christ has no access to God,
   because, by imploring Elijah, he seeks relief in another quarter. Thus
   we see that he was tortured on every hand, in order that, overwhelmed
   with despair, he might abstain from calling on God, which was, to
   abandon salvation. But if the hired brawlers of Antichrist, as well as
   wicked men existing in the Church, are now found to pervert basely by
   their calumnies what has been properly said by us, let us not wonder
   that the same thing should happen to our Head. Yet though they may
   change God into Elijah, when they have ridiculed us to their heart's
   content, God will at length listen to our groanings, and will show that
   he vindicates his glory, and punishes base falsehood.

   48. And immediately one ran. As Christ had once refused to drink, it
   may be conjectured with probability, that it was repeatedly offered to
   him for the sake of annoyance; though it is also not improbable that
   the vinegar was held out to him in a cup before he was raised aloft,
   and that a sponge was afterwards applied to his mouth, while he was
   hanging on the cross.

   Mark 15:36. Saying, Let him alone, let us see if Elijah will come to
   save him. Mark relates these words as having been spoken by the
   soldier, while holding out the vinegar; but Matthew tells us that
   others used the same language. There is no inconsistency here, however;
   for it is probable that the jeering was begun by one person, but was
   eagerly seized by others, and loudly uttered by the multitude. The
   phrase, let him alone, appears to have implied not restraint, but
   ridicule; accordingly, the person who first mocked Christ, ironically
   addressing his companions, says, Let us see if Elijah will come. Others
   quickly followed, and every one sung the same song to his next
   neighbor, as usually happens with men who are agreed about any course.
   Nor is it of any importance to inquire if it was in the singular or
   plural number; for in either case the meaning is the same, the word
   being used in place of an interjection, as if they had said, Hush!
   Hush!

   Matthew 27:50. Jesus having again cried with a loud voice. Luke, who
   makes no mention of the former complaint, repeats the words of this
   second cry, which Matthew and Mark leave out. He says that Jesus cried,
   Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; by which he declared that,
   though he was fiercely attacked by violent temptations, still his faith
   was unshaken, and always kept its ground unvanquished. For there could
   not have been a more splendid triumph than when Christ boldly expresses
   his assurance that God is the faithful guardian of his soul, which all
   imagined to be lost. But instead of speaking to the deaf, he betook
   himself directly to God, and committed to his bosom the assurance of
   his confidence. He wished, indeed, that men should hear what he said;
   but though it might be of no avail to men, he was satisfied with having
   God alone as his witness. And certainly there is not a stronger or more
   decided testimony of faith than when a pious man--perceiving himself
   attacked on every hand:, so that he finds no consolation on the part of
   men--despises the madness of the whole world, discharges his sorrows
   and cares into the bosom of God, and rests in the hope of his promises.

   Though this form of prayer appears to be borrowed from Psalm 31:5, yet
   I have no doubt that he applied it to his immediate object, according
   to present circumstances; as if he had said, "I see, indeed, O Father,
   that by the universal voice I am destined to destruction, and that my
   soul is, so to speak, hurried to and fro; but though, according to the
   flesh, I perceive no assistance in thee, yet this will not hinder me
   from committing my spirit into thy hands, and calmly relying on the
   hidden safeguard of thy goodness." Yet it ought to be observed, that
   David, in the passage which I have quoted, not only prayed that his
   soul, received by the hand of God, might continue to be safe and happy
   after death, but committed his life to the Lord, that, guarded by his
   protection, he might prosper both in life and in death. He saw himself
   continually besieged by many deaths; nothing, therefore, remained but
   to commit himself to the invincible protection of God. Having made God
   the guardian of his soul, he rejoices that it is safe from all danger;
   and, at the same time, prepares to meet death with confidence, whenever
   it shall please God, because the Lord guards the souls of his people
   even in death. No as the former was taken away from Christ, to commit
   his soul to be protected by the Father during the frail condition of
   the earthly life, he hastens cheerfully to death, and desires to be
   preserved beyond the world; for the chief reason why God receives our
   souls into his keeping is, that our faith may rise beyond this
   transitory life.

   Let us now remember that it was not in reference to himself alone that
   Christ committed his soul to the Father, but that he included, as it
   were, in one bundle all the souls of those who believe in him, that
   they may be preserved along with his own; and not only so, but by this
   prayer he obtained authority to save all souls, so that not only does
   the heavenly Father, for his sake, deign to take them into his custody,
   but, giving up the authority into his hands, commits them to him to be
   protected. And therefore Stephen also, when dying, resigns his soul
   into his hands, saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit, (Acts 7:59.)
   Every one who, when he comes to die, following this example, shall
   believe in Christ, will not breathe his soul at random into the air,
   but will resort to a faithful guardian, who keeps in safety whatever
   has been delivered to him by the Father.

   The cry shows also the intensity of the feeling; for there can be no
   doubt that Christ, out of the sharpness of the temptations by which he
   was beset, not without a painful and strenuous effort, broke out into
   this cry. And yet he likewise intended, by this loud and piercing
   exclamation, to assure us that his soul would be safe and uninjured by
   death, in order that we, supported by the same confidence, may
   cheerfully depart from the frail hovel of our flesh.

   51. And, lo, the veil of the temple was rent. When Luke blends the
   rending of the veil with the eclipse of the sun, he inverts the order;
   for the Evangelists, as we have frequently seen, are not careful to
   mark every hour with exactness. Nor was it proper that the veil should
   be rent, until the sacrifice of expiation had been completed; for then
   Christ, the true and everlasting Priest, having abolished the figures
   of the law, opened up for us by his blood the way to the heavenly
   sanctuary, that we may no longer stand at a distance within the porch,
   but may freely advance into the presence of God. For so long as the
   shadowy worship lasted, [287] a veil was hung up before the earthly
   sanctuary, in order to keep the people not only from entering but from
   seeing it, (Exodus 26:33; 2 Chronicles 3:14.) Now Christ, by

   blotting out the handwriting which was opposed to us,
   (Colossians 2:14,)

   removed every obstruction, that, relying on him as Mediator, we may all
   be a royal priesthood, (1 Peter 2:9.) Thus the rending of the veil was
   not only an abrogation of the ceremonies which existed under the law,
   but was, in some respects, an opening of heaven, that God may now
   invite the members of his Son to approach him with familiarity.

   Meanwhile, the Jews were informed that the period of abolishing outward
   sacrifices had arrived, and that the ancient priesthood would be of no
   farther use; that though the building of the temple was left standing,
   it would not be necessary to worship God there after the ancient
   custom; but that since the substance and truth of the shadows had been
   fulfilled, the figures of the law were changed into spirit. For though
   Christ offered a visible sacrifice, yet, as the Apostle tells us
   (Hebrews 9:14) it must be viewed spiritually, that we may enjoy its
   value and its fruit. But it was of no advantage to those wretched men
   that the outward sanctuary was laid bare by the rending of the veil,
   because the inward veil of unbelief, which was in their hearts, [288]
   hindered them from beholding the saving light.

   And the earth trembled, and the rocks were split. What Matthew adds
   about the earthquake and the splitting oft he rocks, I think it
   probable, took place at the same time. In this way not only did the
   earth bear the testimony to its Creator, but it was even called as a
   witness against the hard-heartedness of a perverse nation; for it
   showed how monstrous that obstinacy must have been on which neither the
   earthquake nor the splitting of the rocks made any impression.

   52 And graves were opened. This was also a striking miracle, by which
   God declared that his Son entered into the prison of death, not to
   continue to be shut up there, but to bring out all who were held
   captive. For at the very time when the despicable weakness of the flesh
   was beheld in the person of Christ, the magnificent and divine energy
   of his death penetrated even to hell. This is the reason why, when he
   was about to be shut up in a sepulcher, other sepulchers were opened by
   him. Yet it is doubtful if this opening of the graves took place before
   his resurrection; for, in my opinion, the resurrection of the saints,
   which is mentioned immediately afterwards, was subsequent to the
   resurrection of Christ. There is no probability in the conjecture of
   some commentators that, after having received life and breath, they
   remained three days concealed in their graves. I think it more probable
   that, when Christ died, the graves were immediately opened: and that,
   when he rose, some of the godly, having received life, went out of
   their graves, and were seen in the city. For Christ is called the
   first-born from the dead, (Colossians 1:18,) and the first-fruits of
   those who rise, (1 Corinthians 15:20,) because by his death he
   commenced, and by his resurrection he completed, a new life; not that,
   when he died, the dead were immediately raised, but because his death
   was the source and commencement of life. This reason, therefore, is
   fully applicable, since the opening of the graves was the presage of a
   new life, that the fruit or result appeared three days afterwards,
   because Christ, in rising from the dead, brought others along with him
   out of their graves as his companions. Now by this sign it was made
   evident, that he neither died nor rose again in a private capacity, but
   in order to shed the odor of life on all believers.

   But here a question arises. Why did God determine that only some should
   arise, since a participation in the resurrection of Christ belongs
   equally to all believers? I reply: As the time was not fully come when
   the whole body of the Church should be gathered to its Head, he
   exhibited in a few persons an instance of the new life which all ought
   to expect. For we know that Christ was received into heaven on the
   condition that the life of his members should still be hid, (Colossians
   3:3,) until it should be manifested by his coming. But in order that
   the minds of believers might be more quickly raised to hope, it was
   advantageous that the resurrection, which was to be common to all of
   them, should be tasted by a few.

   Another and more difficult question is, What became of those saints
   afterwards? For it would appear to be absurd to suppose that, after
   having been once admitted by Christ to the participation of a new life,
   they again returned to dust. But as this question cannot be easily or
   quickly answered, so it is not necessary to give ourselves much
   uneasiness about a matter which is not necessary to be known. That they
   continued long to converse with men is not probable; for it was only
   necessary that they should be seen for a short time, that in them, as
   in a mirror or resemblance, the power of Christ might plainly appear.
   As God intended, by their persons, to confirm the hope of the heavenly
   life among those who were then alive, there would be no absurdity in
   saying that, after having performed this office, they again rested in
   their graves. But it is more probable that the life which they received
   was not afterwards taken from them; for if it had been a mortal life,
   it would not have been a proof of a perfect resurrection. Now, though
   the whole world will rise again, and though Christ will raise up the
   wicked to judgment, as well as believers to salvation, yet as it was
   especially for the benefit of his Church that he rose again, so it was
   proper that he should bestow on none but saints the distinguished honor
   of rising along with him.

   53. And went into the holy city. When Matthew bestows on Jerusalem the
   honorable designation of the holy city, he does not intend to applaud
   the character of its inhabitants, for we know that it was at that time
   full of all pollution and wickedness, so that it was rather a den of
   robbers, (Jeremiah 7:11.) But as it had been chosen by God, its
   holiness, which was founded on God's adoption, could not be effaced by
   any corruptions of men, till its rejection was openly declared. Or, to
   express it more briefly, on the part of man it was profane, and on the
   part of God it was holy, till the destruction or pollution of the
   temple, which happened not long after the crucifixion of Christ.

   54. Now the centurion. As Luke mentions the lamentation of the people,
   the centurion and his soldiers were not the only persons who
   acknowledged Christ to be the Son of God; but the Evangelists mention
   this circumstance respecting him for the purpose of heightening their
   description: for it is wonderful that an irreligious man, who had not
   been instructed in the Law, and was ignorant of true religion, should
   form so correct a judgment from the signs which he beheld. This
   comparison tends powerfully to condemn the stupidity of the city; for
   it was an evidence of shocking madness, that when the fabric of the
   world shook and trembled, none of the Jews were affected by it except
   the despised rabble. And yet, amidst such gross blindness, God did not
   permit the testimonies which he gave respecting his Son to be buried in
   silence. Not only, therefore, did true religion open the eyes of devout
   worshippers of God to perceive that from heaven God was magnifying the
   glory of Christ, but natural understanding compelled foreigners, and
   even soldiers, to confess what they had not learned either from the law
   or from any instructor.

   When Mark says that the centurion spoke thus, because Christ, when he
   had uttered a loud voice, expired, some commentators think that he
   intends to point out the unwonted strength which remained unimpaired
   till death; and certainly, as the body of Christ was almost exhausted
   of blood, it could not happen, in the ordinary course of things, that
   the sides and the lungs should retain sufficient rigor for uttering so
   loud a cry. Yet I rather think that the centurion intended to applaud
   the unshaken perseverance of Christ in calling on the name of God. Nor
   was it merely the cry of Christ that led the centurion to think so
   highly of him, but this confession was extorted from him by perceiving
   that his extraordinary strength harmonized with heavenly miracles.

   The words, he feared God, [289] must not be so explained as if he had
   fully repented. [290] It was only a sudden and transitory impulse, as
   it frequently happens, that men who are thoughtless and devoted to the
   world are struck with the fear of God, when he makes an alarming
   display of his power; but as they have no living root, indifference
   quickly follows, and puts an end to that feeling. The centurion had not
   undergone such a change as to dedicate himself to God for the remainder
   of his life, but was only for a moment the herald of the divinity of
   Christ.

   When Luke represents him as saying no more than certainly this was a
   righteous man, the meaning is the same as if he had plainly said that
   he was the Son of God, as it is expressed by the other two Evangelists.
   For it had been universally reported that Christ was put to death,
   because he declared himself to be the Son of God. Now when the
   centurion bestows on him the praise of righteousness, and pronounces
   him to be innocent, he likewise acknowledges him to be the Son of God;
   not that he understood distinctly how Christ was begotten by God the
   Father, but because he entertains no doubt that there is some divinity
   in him, and, convinced by proofs, holds it to be certain that Christ
   was not an ordinary man, but had been raised up by God.

   As to the multitudes, by striving their breasts, they expressed the
   dread of punishment for a public crime, because they felt that public
   guilt had been contracted by an unjust and shocking murder. [291] But
   as they went no farther, their lamentation was of no avail, unless,
   perhaps, in some persons it was the commencement or preparation of true
   repentance. And since nothing more is described to us than the
   lamentation which God drew from them to the glory of his Son, let us
   learn by this example, that it is of little importance, or of no
   importance at all, if a man is struck with terror, when he sees before
   his eyes the power of God, until, after the astonishment has been
   abated, the fear of God remains calmly in his heart.

   55. And there were also many women there. I consider this to have been
   added in order to inform us that, while the disciples had fled and were
   scattered in every direction, still some of their company were retained
   by the Lord as witnesses. Now though the Apostle John did not depart
   from the cross, yet no mention is made of him; but praise is bestowed
   on the women alone, who accompanied Christ till death, because their
   extraordinary attachment to their Master was the more strikingly
   displayed, when the men fled trembling. For they must have been endued
   with extraordinary strength of attachment, since, though they could
   render him no service, they did not cease to treat him with reverence,
   even when exposed to the lowest disgrace. And yet we learn fromLuke
   that all the men had not fled; for he says that all his acquaintances
   stood at a distance. But not without reason do the Evangelists bestow
   the chief praise on the women, for they deserved the preference above
   the men. In my opinion, the implied contrast suggests a severe reproof
   of the apostles. I speak of the great body of them; for since only one
   remained, the three Evangelists, as I mentioned a little ago, take no
   notice of him. It was in the highest degree disgraceful to chosen
   witnesses to withdraw from that spectacle on which depended the
   salvation of the world. Accordingly, when they afterwards proclaimed
   the gospel, they must have borrowed from women the chief portion of the
   history. But if a remedy had not been miraculously prepared by
   Providence against a great evil, they would have deprived themselves,
   and us along with them, of the knowledge of redemption.

   At first sight, we might think that the testimony of the women does not
   possess equal authority; but if we duly consider by what power of the
   Spirit they were supported against that temptation, we shall find that
   there is no reason why our faith should waver, since it rests on God,
   who is the real Author of their testimony. [292] Yet let us observe,
   that it proceeded from the inconceivable goodness of God, that even to
   us should come that gospel which speaks of the expiation by which God
   has been reconciled to us. For during the general desertion of those
   who ought to have run before others, God encouraged some, out of the
   midst of the flock, who, recovering from the alarm, should be witnesses
   to us of that history, without the belief of which we cannot be saved.
   Of the women themselves, we shall presently have another opportunity of
   saying something. At present, it may be sufficient to take a passing
   notice of one point, that their eagerness for instruction led them to
   withdraw from their country, and constantly to learn from the lips of
   Christ, and that they spared neither toil nor money, provided that they
   might enjoy his saving doctrine.

   MATTHEW 27:57-61; MARK 15:42-47;

   Matthew 27:57-61

   Mark 15:42-47

   Luke 23:50-56

   57. And when the evening was come, there came a rich man from
   Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus. 58. He
   went to Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus; then Pilate commanded
   the body to be delivered. 59. And Joseph, having received the body,
   wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. 60. And laid it in his own new tomb,
   which he had hewn out in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to
   the door of the tomb, he departed. 61. And Mary Magdalene and the other
   Mary were there, sitting opposite to the sepulcher.

   42. And when it was now evening, (because it was the preparation, [293]
   which goes before the Sabbath,) 43. Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable
   counselor, who was also himself waiting for the kingdom of God, came
   and boldly went in to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. 44. And
   Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and having called to him the
   centurion, he asked him if he had been long dead. 45. And having
   ascertained it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46. And
   he, having brought a linen cloth, took him down (from the cross, [294]
   ) and wrapped him in the linen cloth, and laid him in the tomb which
   had been hewn out of the rock; and rolled a stone to the door of the
   tomb. 47. And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where
   he was laid.

   50. And, lo, a man named Joseph, a counselor, a good and righteous man,
   51. Who had not consented to their decision, and to their deed; a
   native of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for
   the kingdom of God. 52. He came to Pilate, and requested the body of
   Jesus. 53. And he took him down, and wrapped him in a linen cloth, and
   laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock, in which no man
   had ever been laid. 54. And it was the day of the preparation, and the
   Sabbath was approaching. 55. And the women who had come with him from
   Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how the body was laid. 56. And
   they returned, and prepared spices and ointments, and rested on the
   Sabbath, according to the commandment.


   The burial of Christ is now added, as an intermediate transition from
   the ignominy of the cross to the glory of the resurrection. True,
   indeed, God determined, for another reason, that Christ should be
   buried, that it might be more fully attested that he suffered real
   death on our account. But yet it ought to be regarded as the principal
   design, that in this manner the cursing, which he had endured for a
   short time, began to be removed; for his body was not thrown into a
   ditch in the ordinary way, but honorably laid in a hewn sepulcher.
   Although at that time the weakness of the flesh was still visible, and
   the divine power of the Spirit was not clearly seen before his
   resurrection; yet God determined by this, as a sort of preparation, to
   shadow out what he was shortly afterwards to do, that he might exalt
   gloriously above the heavens his Son, the conqueror of death.

   Matthew 27:57. And when the evening was come. Let it be understood that
   Joseph did not come in the dusk of the evening, but before sunset, that
   he might perform this office of kindness to his Master, without
   violating the Sabbath; for the Sabbath commenced in the evening, and
   therefore it was necessary that Christ should be laid in the grave
   before night came on. Now from the time that Christ died until the
   Sabbath began to be observed, there were three free days. And though
   John does not mention Joseph only, but joins Nicodemus as his
   companion, (19:39;) yet as he alone undertook the business at first,
   and as Nicodemus did no more than follow and join him, the three:
   Evangelists satisfied themselves with relating in a brief narrative
   what was done by Joseph alone.

   Now though this affection of Joseph deserved uncommon praise, still we
   ought first to consider the providence of God, in subduing a man of
   high and honorable rank among his countrymen, to wipe away the reproach
   of the cross by the honor of burial. And, indeed, as he exposed himself
   to the dislike and hatred of the whole nation, and to great dangers,
   there can be no doubt that this singular courage arose from a secret
   movement of the Spirit; for though he had formerly been one of Christ's
   disciples, yet he had never ventured to make a frank and open
   profession of his faith. When the death of Christ now presents to him a
   spectacle full of despair, and fitted to break the strongest minds, how
   comes he suddenly to acquire such noble courage that, amidst the
   greatest terrors, he feels no dread, and hesitates not to advance
   farther than he had ever done, when all was in peace? Let us know then
   that, when the Son of God was buried by the hand of Joseph, it was the
   work of God.

   To the same purpose must also be referred the circumstances which are
   here detailed. Joseph's piety and integrity of life are commended, that
   in the servant of God we may learn to recognize the work of God. The
   Evangelists relate that he was rich, in order to inform us that his
   amazing magnanimity of mind enabled him to rise superior to the
   obstruction which would otherwise have compelled him to retire. For
   rich men, being naturally proud, find nothing more difficult than to
   expose themselves voluntarily to the contempt of the people. Now we
   know how mean and disgraceful an act it was to receive from the hand of
   the executioner the body of a crucified man. Besides, as men devoted to
   riches are wont to avoid everything fitted to excite prejudice, the
   more eminent he was for wealth, the more cautious and timid he would
   have been, unless a holy boldness [295] had been imparted to him from
   heaven. The dignity of his rank is likewise mentioned, that he was a
   counselor, or senator, that in this respect also the power of God may
   be displayed; for it was not one of the lowest of the people that was
   employed to bury the body of Christ in haste and in concealment, but
   from a high rank of honor he was raised up to discharge this office.
   For the less credible it was that such an office of kindness should be
   performed towards Christ, the more clearly did it appear that the whole
   of this transaction was regulated by the purpose and hand of God.

   We are taught by this example, that the rich are so far from being
   excusable, when they deprive Christ of the honor due to him: that they
   must be held to be doubly criminal, for turning into obstructions those
   circumstances which ought to have been excitements to activity. It is
   too frequent and customary, I acknowledge, for those who think
   themselves superior to others, to withdraw from the yoke, and to become
   soft and effeminate through excessive timidity and solicitude about
   their affairs. But we ought to view it in a totally different light;
   for if riches and honors do not aid us in the worship of God, we
   utterly abuse them. The present occurrence shows how easy it is for God
   to correct wicked fears by hindering us from doing our duty; since
   formerly Joseph did not venture to make an open profession of being a
   disciple of Christ, when matters were doubtful, but now, when the rage
   of enemies is at its height, and when their cruelty abounds, he gathers
   courage, and does not hesitate to incur manifest danger. We see then
   how the Lord in a moment forms the hearts to new feelings, and raises
   up by a spirit of fortitude those who had previously fainted. But if,
   through a holy desire to honor Christ, Joseph assumed such courage,
   while Christ was hanging on the cross, woe to our slothfulness, [296]
   if, now that he has risen from the dead, an equal zeal, at least, to
   glorify him do not burn in our hearts.

   Mark 15:43, and Luke 23:51. Who also himself was waiting for the
   kingdom of God. The highest commendation bestowed on Joseph is, that he
   waited for the kingdom of God. He is likewise praised, no doubt, for
   righteousness, but this waiting for the kingdom of God was the root and
   source of his righteousness. By the kingdom of God, we must understand
   the renovation promised through Christ; for the perfection of order
   which, the prophets had every where promised, would exist at the coming
   of Christ, cannot exist, unless God assembles under his government
   those men who had gone astray. It is therefore pointed out in
   commendation of Joseph's piety, that, during the disorder which then
   prevailed, he cherished the hope of that redemption which God had
   promised. Hence, too, arises the fear of God, and the desire of
   holiness and uprightness; for it is impossible for any one to dedicated
   himself to God, unless he expects that God will be his deliverer.

   Yet let us observe, that while salvation through Christ was promised
   indiscriminately to all the Jews, and while the promise of it was
   common to them all, it is only of a very few that the Holy Spirit
   testifies what we are here told of Joseph. Hence it is evident, that
   nearly the whole of the people had buried in base forgetfulness the
   inestimable grace of God. All of them, indeed, had on their lips the
   language of boasting in reference to the coming of Christ, which was
   approaching; but few had the covenant of God fixed in their minds, so
   as to rise by faith to spiritual renovation. That was indeed an awful
   insensibility; and therefore we need not wonder if pure religion fell
   into decay, when the faith of salvation was extinguished. Would to God
   that a similar corruption did not prevail in this unhappy age! Christ
   once appeared as a Redeemer to the Jews and to the whole world, as had
   been declared in the predictions of the prophets. He set up the kingdom
   of God, by restoring affairs from confusion and disorder to a regular
   and proper condition. He has assigned to us a period of warfare, to
   exercise our patience till he come again from heaven to complete his
   reign which he has commenced. How many are there who aspire to this
   hope, even in a moderate degree? Do not almost all cleave to the earth,
   as if there had been no promise of a resurrection? But while the
   greater part of men, forgetful of their end, fall off on all sides, let
   us remember that it is a virtue peculiar to believers, to seek the
   things which are above, (Colossians 3:1;) and especially since the
   grace of God has shone upon us through the Gospel,

   teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
   live soberly, justly, and piously, in the present world, looking for
   the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of the great God,
   (Titus 2:11-13.)

   Matthew 27:59. And having taken the body. The three Evangelists glance
   briefly at the burial; and therefore they say nothing about the
   aromatic ointments which John alone mentions, (19:39) only they relate
   that Joseph purchased a clean linen cloth; from which we infer, that
   Christ was honorably buried. And, indeed, there could be no doubt that
   a rich man, when he gave up his sepulcher to our Lord, made provision
   also, in other respects, for suitable magnificence and splendor. And
   this, too, was brought about by the secret providence of God, rather
   than by the premeditated design of men, that a new sepulcher, in which
   no man had ever yet been laid, was obtained by our Lord, who is the
   first-born from the dead, (Colossians 1:18,) and the first-fruits of
   them that rise, (1 Corinthians 15:20.) God intended, therefore, by this
   Mark to distinguish his Son from the remainder of the human race, and
   to point out by the sepulcher itself his newness of life.

   61. And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were there. Matthew and
   Mark relate only that the women looked at what was done, and marked the
   place where the body was laid. But Luke states, at the same time, their
   resolution, which was, that they returned to the city, and prepared
   spices and ointments, that two days afterwards they might render due
   honor to the burial. Hence we learn that their minds were filled with a
   better odor, which the Lord breathed into his death, that he might
   bring them to his grave, and exalt them higher.

   MATTHEW 27:62-66

   Matthew 27:62-66

   62. And the next day, which is after the preparation, [297] the chief
   priests and Pharisees came to Pilate, 63. Saying, Sir, we remember that
   that impostor said, while he was still alive, After three days I shall
   rise again. 64. Command, therefore, that the sepulcher be made secure
   till the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come by night to steal
   him, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last
   error shall be worse than the first. 65. Pilate saith to them, You have
   a guard; go, make it as secure as you can. 66. And they went and made
   the sepulcher secures sealing the stone, and posting guards.


   Matthew 27:62. And the next day. In this narrative Matthew did not so
   much intend to show with what determined rage the scribes and priests
   pursued Christ, as to exhibit to us, as in a mirror, the amazing
   providence of God in proving the resurrection of his Son. Cunning men,
   practiced at least in fraud and treachery, plot among themselves, and
   contrive a method by which they may extinguish the memory of a dead
   man; for they see that they have gained nothing, if they do not destroy
   the certainty of the resurrection. But while they are attempting to do
   this, they appear rather as if they had expressly intended to bring it
   forth to the light, that it might be known. The resurrection of Christ
   would undoubtedly have been less manifest, or, at least, they would
   have had more plausible grounds for denying it, if they had not taken
   pains to station witnesses at the sepulcher. We see then how the Lord
   not only disappointeth the crafty, (Job 5:12,) but employs even their
   own schemes as snares for holding them fast, that he may draw and
   compel them to render obedience to him. The enemies of Christ were
   indeed unworthy of having his resurrection made known to them; but it
   was proper that their insolence should be exposed, and every occasion
   of slander taken away from them, and that even their consciences should
   be convinced, so that they might not be held excusable for ignorance.
   Yet let us observe that God, as if he had hired them for the purpose,
   employed their services for rendering the glory of Christ more
   illustrious, because no plausible ground for lying, in order to deny
   it, was left to them when they found the grave empty; not that they
   desisted from their wicked rage, but with all persons of correct and
   sober judgment it was a sufficient testimony that Christ was risen,
   since his body, which had been placed in a grave, and protected by
   guards who surrounded it on all sides, was not to be found.

   63. We remember that that impostor said. This thought was suggested to
   them by divine inspiration, not only that the Lord might execute upon
   them just vengeance for their wickedness, (as he always punishes bad
   consciences by secret torments,) but chiefly in order to restrain their
   unholy tongues. Yet we again perceive what insensibility seizes on
   wicked men, when they are bewitched by Satan. They go so far as to call
   him an impostor, whose divine power and glory were lately manifested by
   so many miracles. This certainly was not to defy the clouds, but to
   spit in the face of God, so to speak, by ridiculing the brightness of
   the sun. Such examples show us that we ought, with pious and modest
   thoughtfulness, to direct our attention early to the glory of God when
   it is presented to our view, that our hardness of heart may not lead us
   to brutal and dreadful blindness. Now though it may appear strange and
   absurd for wicked men to indulge in such wicked mockery over Christ
   when dead, that our minds may not be rendered uneasy by this
   licentiousness, we ought always to consider wisely the purpose to which
   the Lord turns it. Wicked men imagine that they will overwhelm the
   whole of the doctrine of Christ, together with his miracles, by that
   single blasphemy, which they haughtily vomit out; but God employs no
   other persons than themselves for vindicating his Son from all blame of
   imposture. Whenever these wicked men shall labor to overturn everything
   by their calumnies, and shall launch out into unmeasured slander, let
   us wait with composure and tranquillity of mind until God bring light
   out of darkness.

   65. You have a guard. By these words, Pilate means that he grants their
   request by permitting them to post soldiers to keep watch. This,
   permission bound them more firmly, so that they could not escape by any
   evasion; for though they were not ashamed to break out against Christ
   after his resurrection, yet with Pilate's signet they as truly shut
   their own mouths as they shut up the sepulcher.

   Mark 16:1-7

   Luke 24:1-8

   1. Now in the evening of the Sabbaths, [298] which began to dawn
   towards the first of the Sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene, and the other
   Mary, to see the sepulcher. 2. And lo, there was a great earthquake;
   for the angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and approached, and
   rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 3. And his
   countenance was like lightning, and his raiment was white as snow.
   4. And through fear of him the guards trembled, and became as dead men.
   5. But the angel answering, said to the women, Fear not; for I know
   that you seek Jesus, who was crucified. 6. He is not here; for he is
   risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: 7. And go
   quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and,
   lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: lo, I
   have told you.

   1. And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the wife of
   James, and Salome, bought spices to come and anoint him. 2. And very
   early in the morning of the first day of the Sabaths, [299] They come
   to the tomb at the rising of the sun. [300] 3. And they said among
   themselves, Who shall roll away the stone for us from the door of the
   tomb? 4. And having looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away;
   for it was very great. 5. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man
   sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe; and they were
   afraid. 6. But he saith to them, Be not terrified: you seek Jesus of
   Nazareth, who was crucified; he is risen, he is not here: lo, the place
   where they laid him. 7. But go away, tell his disciples and Peter, that
   he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall you see him, as he said
   to you.

   1. And on the first day of the Sabbaths, very early in the morning,
   they came to the tomb, carrying the spices which they had prepared, and
   some women with them. 2. And they found the stone rolled away from the
   tomb. 3. And having entered, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
   4. And it happened, while they were in consternation on this account,
   lo, two men stood near them in shining garments. 5. And when the women
   were terrified, and bowed their face to the earth, they said to them,
   Why do you seek the living among the dead? 6. He is not here, but is
   risen: remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
   7. Saying, that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of the
   wicked men, and be crucified and rise again on the third day. 8. And
   they remembered his words.


   We now come to the closing scene of our redemption. For the lively
   assurance of our reconciliation with God arises from Christ having come
   from hell as the conqueror of death, in order to show that he had the
   power of a new life at his disposal. Justly, therefore, does Paul say
   that there will be no gospel, and that the hope of salvation will be
   vain and fruitless, unless we believe that Christ is risen from the
   dead, (1 Corinthians 15:14.) For then did Christ obtain righteousness
   for us, and open up our entrance into heaven; and, in short, then was
   our adoption ratified, when Christ, by rising from the dead, exerted
   the power of his Spirit, and proved himself to be the Son of God. No
   though he manifested his resurrection in a different manner from what
   the sense of our flesh would have desired, still the method of which he
   approved ought to be regarded by us also as the best. he went out of
   the grave without a witness, that the emptiness of the place might be
   the earliest indication; next, he chose to have it announced to the
   women by the angels that he was alive; and shortly afterwards he
   appeared to the women, and, finally, to the apostles, and on various
   occasions.

   Thus he gradually brought his followers, according to their capacity,
   to a larger measure of knowledge. He began with the women, and not only
   presented himself to be seen by them, but even gave them a commission
   to announce the gospel to the apostles, so as to become their
   instructors. This was intended, first, to chastise the indifference of
   the apostles, who were like persons half-dead with fear, while the
   women ran with alacrity to the sepulcher, and likewise obtained no
   ordinary reward. For though their design to anoint Christ, as if Ire
   were still dead, was not free from blame, still he forgave their
   weakness, and bestowed on them distinguished honor, by taking away from
   men the apostolic office, and committing it to them for a short time.
   In this manner also he exhibited an instance of what Paul tells us,
   that he chooses those things which are foolish and weak in the world to
   abase the loftiness of the flesh. And never shall we be duly prepared
   to learn this article of our faith in any other manner than by laying
   aside all pride, and submitting to receive the testimony of the women.
   Not that our faith ought to be confined within such narrow limits, but
   because the Lord, in order to make trial of our faith, determines that
   we shall become fools, before he admits us to a more ample knowledge of
   his mysteries.

   So far as regards the narrative, Matthew says only that the two Marys
   came to see the sepulcher; Mark adds a third, Salome, and says that
   they bought spices to anoint the body; and from Luke we infer, that not
   two or three only, but many women came. But we know that it is
   customary with the sacred writers, when speaking of a great number, to
   name but a few of them. It may also be conjectured with probability,
   that Mary Magdalene, with another companion--whether she was sent
   before, or ran forward of her own accord arrived at the grave before
   the rest of the women. And this appears to be conveyed by the words of
   Matthew, that those two women came for the purpose of seeing; for
   without seeing Christ:, they had no means of anointing him. He says
   nothing, in the meantime, about the purpose which they had formed of
   doing honor to him; for the principal object which he had in view was,
   to testify of the resurrection.

   But it may be asked, how could this zeal of the women, which was mixed
   with superstition, be acceptable to God? I have no doubt, that the
   custom of anointing the dead, which they had borrowed from the Fathers,
   was applied by them to its proper object, which was, to draw
   consolation, amidst the mourning of death, from the hope of the life to
   come. I readily acknowledge that they sinned in not immediately raising
   their minds to that prediction which they had heard from the lips of
   their Master, when he foretold that he would rise again on the third
   day. [301] But as they retain the general principle of the final
   resurrection, that defect is forgiven, which would justly have
   vitiated, as the phrase is, the whole of the action. Thus God
   frequently accepts, with fatherly kindness, the works of the saints,
   which, without pardon, not only would not have pleased him, but would
   even have been justly rejected with shame and punishment. It is,
   therefore, an astonishing display of the goodness of Christ, that he
   kindly and generously presents himself alive to the women, who did him
   wrong in seeking him among the dead. Now if he did not permit them to
   come in vain to his grave, we may conclude with certainty, that those
   who now aspire to him by faith will not be disappointed; for the
   distance of places does not prevent believers from enjoying him who
   fills heaven and earth by the power of his Spirit.

   Mark 16:1. And when the Sabbath was past. The meaning is the same as in
   Matthew, In the evening, which began to dawn towards the first day of
   the Sabbaths, and in Luke, on the first day of the Sabbaths. For while
   we know that the Jews began to reckon their day from the commencement
   of the preceding night, everybody understands, that when the Sabbath
   was past, the women resolved among themselves to visit the sepulcher,
   so as to come there before the dawn of day. The two Evangelists give
   the name of the first day of the Sabbaths, to that which came first in
   order between two Sabbaths. Some of the Latin translators [302] have
   rendered it one, and many have been led into this blunder through
   ignorance of the Hebrew language; for though ('chd) sometimes means
   one, and sometimes first, the Evangelists, as in many other passages,
   have followed the Hebrew idiom, and used the word mian, one. [303] But
   that no one may be led astray by the ambiguity, I have stated their
   meaning more clearly. As to the purchase of the spices, Luke's
   narrative differs, in some respects, from the words of Mark; for Luke
   says that they returned into the city, and procured spices, and then
   rested one day, according to the commandment of the law before pursuing
   their journey. But Mark, in introducing into the same part of the
   narrative two different events, at--tends less accurately than Luke to
   the distinction of dates; for he blends with their setting out on the
   journey what had been previously done. In the substance of the fact
   they perfectly agree, that the women, after having observed the holy
   rest, left home during the darkness of the night, that they might reach
   the sepulcher about the break of day.

   We ought also to recollect what I have formerly suggested, that the
   custom of anointing the dead, though it was common, among many heathen
   nations, was applied to a lawful use by the Jews alone, to whom it had
   been handed down by the Fathers, to confirm them in the faith of the
   resurrection. For without having this object in view, to embalm a dead
   body, which has no feeling, would be an idle and empty solace, as we
   know that the Egyptians bestowed great labor and anxiety on this point,
   without looking for any advantage. But by this sacred symbol, God
   represented to the Jews the image of life in death, to lead them to
   expect that out of putrefaction and dust they would one day acquire new
   vigor. Now as the resurrection of Christ, by its quickening vigor,
   penetrated every sepulcher, so as to breathe life into the dead, so it
   abolished those outward ceremonies. For himself, he needed not those
   aids, but they were owing to the ignorance of the women, who were not
   yet fully aware that he was free from corruption.

   3. And they said among themselves. Mark alone expresses this doubt; but
   as the other Evangelists relate that the stone was rolled away by the
   angel, it may easily be inferred, that they remained in perplexity and
   doubt as to what they should do, until the entrance was opened up by
   the hand of God. But let us learn from this, that in consequence of
   having been carried away by their zeal, they came there without due
   consideration. They had seen a stone placed before the sepulcher, to
   hinder any one from entering. Why did not this occur to them, when they
   were at home and at leisure, but because they were seized with such
   fear and astonishment, that thought and recollection failed them? But
   as it is a holy zeal that blinds them, God does not charge them with
   this fault.

   Matthew 28:2. And, lo, a great earthquake. By many signs the Lord
   showed the presence of his glory, that he might more fully prepare the
   hearts of the holy women to reverence the mystery. [304] For since it
   was not a matter of little consequence to know that the Son of God had
   obtained a victory over death, (on which the principal point of our
   salvation is founded,) it was necessary to remove all doubts, that the
   divine majesty might be openly and manifestly presented to the eyes of
   the women. Matthew says, therefore, that there was an earthquake, by
   which the divine power which I have mentioned might be perceived. And
   by this prodigy, it was proper that the women should be allowed to
   expect nothing human or earthly, but to raise their minds to a work of
   God which was new, and surpassed the expectations of men.

   The raiment and the countenance of the angel, too, might be said to be
   rays by which the splendor of Godhead was diffused, so as to enable
   them to perceive that it was not a mortal man that stood near them,
   having the face of a man. For though dazzling light, or the whiteness
   of snow, is nothing in comparison of the boundless glory of God, but
   rather, if we wish to know him aright, we ought not to imagine to
   ourselves any color; yet when he makes known by outward signs that he
   is present, he invites us to him, as far as our weakness can endure.
   Still we ought to know that the visible signs of his presence are
   exhibited to us, that our minds may conceive of him as invisible; and
   that, under bodily forms, we obtain a taste of his spiritual essence,
   that we may seek him spiritually. Yet it cannot be doubted that,
   together with outward signs, there was an inward power, which engraved
   on the hearts of the women an impression of Deity. For though at first
   they were struck with amazement, yet it will appear, from what follows,
   that they gathered courage, and were gradually instructed in such a
   manner, that they perceived the hand of God to be present.

   Our three Evangelists, from a desire of brevity, leave out what is more
   fully related by John, (20:1-12) which, we know, is not unusual with
   them. There is also this difference, that Matthew and Mark mention but
   one angel, while John and Luke speak of two. But this apparent
   contradiction also is easily removed; for we know how frequently in
   Scripture instances occur of that figure of speech by which a part is
   taken for the whole. There were two angels, therefore, who appeared
   first to Mary, and afterwards to her other companions; but as the
   attention of the women was chiefly directed to the angel who spoke,
   Matthew and Mark have satisfied themselves with relating his message.
   Besides, when Matthew says that the angel sat on a stone, there is in
   his words (husteron proteron), an inversion of the order of events; or,
   at least, that order was disregarded by him; for the angel did not
   immediately appear, but while the women were held in suspense and
   anxiety by an event so strange and astonishing.

   4. Through fear the guards trembled. The Lord struck the guards with
   terror, as if he had engraved their consciences with a hot iron, so as
   to constrain them reluctantly to feel his divine power. The terror had,
   at least, the effect of hindering them from treating with careless
   mockery the report of the resurrection which was to be spread abroad
   shortly afterwards. For though they were not ashamed of prostituting
   their tongues for him, still they were compelled, whether they would or
   not, to acknowledge inwardly what they wickedly denied before men. Nor
   can it be doubted that, when they were at liberty to talk freely among
   their acquaintances, they frankly admitted what they dare not openly
   avow, in consequence of having been gained over by money.

   We must attend to the distinction between the two kinds of terror,
   between which Matthew draws a comparison. The soldiers, who were
   accustomed to tumults, were terrified, and were so completely
   overwhelmed by alarm, that they fell down like men who were almost
   dead; but no power was exerted to raise them from that condition. A
   similar terror seized the women; but their minds, which had nearly
   given way, were restored by the consolation which immediately followed,
   so as to begin, at least, to entertain some better hope. And,
   certainly, it is proper that the majesty of God should strike both
   terror and fear indiscriminately into the godly, as well as the
   reprobate, that all flesh may be silent before his face. But when the
   Lord has humbled and subdued his elect, he immediately mitigates their
   dread, that they may not sink under its oppressive influence; and not
   only so, but by the sweetness of his grace heals the wound which he had
   inflicted. The reprobate, on the other hand, he either overwhelms by
   sudden dread, or suffers to languish in slow torments. As to the
   soldiers themselves, they were, no doubt, like dead men, but without
   any serious impression. Like men in a state of insensibility, they
   tremble, indeed, for a moment, but presently forget that they were
   afraid; not that the remembrance of their terror was wholly
   obliterated, but because that lively and powerful apprehension of the
   power of God, to which they were compelled to yield, soon passed away
   from them. But we ought chiefly to attend to this point, that though
   they, as well as the women, were afraid, no medicine was applied to
   soothe their terror; for to the women only did the angel say, Fear not.
   He held out to them a ground of joy and assurance in the resurrection
   of Christ. Luke adds a reproof, Why do you seek the living among the
   dead? as if the angel pulled their ear, that they might no longer
   remain in sluggishness and despair.

   7. And go quickly, and tell his disciples. Here God, by the angel,
   confers extraordinary honor on the women, by enjoining them to proclaim
   to the apostles themselves the chief point of our salvation. In Mark's
   account of it, they are expressly enjoined to carry this message to
   Peter; not because he was at that time higher in rank than the others,
   but because his crime, which was so disgraceful, needed peculiar
   consolation to assure him that Christ had not cast him off, though he
   had basely and wickedly fallen. He had already entered into the
   sepulcher, and beheld the traces of the resurrection of Christ; but God
   denied him the honor, which he shortly afterwards conferred on the
   women, of hearing from the lips of the angel that Christ was risen.
   And, indeed, the great insensibility under which he still labored is
   evident from the fact that he again fled trembling to conceal himself,
   as if he had seen nothing, while Mary sat down to weep at the grave. It
   cannot be doubted, therefore, that she and her companions, in beholding
   the angel, obtained the reward of their patience.

   And, lo, He goeth before you into Galilee. When the angel sent the
   disciples into Galilee, he did so, I think, in order that Christ might
   make himself known to a great number of persons; for we know that he
   had lived a long time in Galilee. He intended also to give his
   followers greater liberty, that by the very circumstance of their
   retirement they might gradually acquire courage. Besides, by being
   accustomed to the places, they were aided in recognizing their Master
   with greater certainty; for it was proper to adopt every method of
   confirming them, that nothing might be wanting to complete the
   certainty of their faith.

   Lo, I have told you. By this manner of speaking the angel earnestly
   assures them that what is said is true. He states this, not as from
   himself, as if he had been the first to suggest it, but gives his
   signature to the promise of Christ; and, therefore, in Mark's account
   of it, he merely recalls to their remembrance the very words of Christ.
   Luke carries out the address still farther, by saying that the
   disciples were informed by Christ that he must be crucified, and rise
   again on the third day. But the meaning is the same; for along with his
   resurrection he had foretold his death. He then adds, --

   Luke 24:8. And they remembered his words; by which we are taught that,
   though they had made little proficiency in the doctrine of Christ,
   still it was not lost, but was choked up, until in due time it yielded
   fruit.

   MATTHEW 28:8-10; MARK 16:8-11; LUKE 24:9-12

   Matthew 28:8-10

   Mark 16:8-11

   Luke 24:9-12

   8. And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and
   ran to inform his disciples. 9. And while they went to inform his
   disciples, then, lo, Jesus met them, saying, Hail. [305] And they
   approached, and held his feet, and worshipped him. 10. Then Jesus saith
   to them, Fear not; go, tell my brethren to go into Galilee; and there
   shall they see me.

   8. And they went away quickly, and fled from the tomb; for they were
   seized with trembling and amazement, and said nothing to any person;
   for they were afraid. 9. Now, when Jesus was risen early on the first
   day of the Sabbath, [306] he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of
   whom he had cast seven devils. 10. She went and told it to those who
   had been with him, who were mourning and weeping. 11. And they, when
   they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not
   believe.

   9. And returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the
   eleven, and to all the rest. 10. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna,
   and Mary the mother of James, and others who were with them, that told
   these things to the apostles. 11. And their words appeared to them as
   idle fancies, and they did not believe them. 12. And Peter rose, and
   ran to the tomb, and stooping down, saw the linen clothes placed by
   themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at what had happened.


   Matthew 28:8. And they departed quickly. The three Evangelists pass by
   what John relates about Mary Magdalene, (20:2,) that she returned into
   the city before she had seen the angels, and complained with tears that
   the body of Christ had been taken away. Here they mention only the
   second return to the city, when she, and other women who accompanied
   her, told the disciples that Christ was risen; which they had learned
   both from the words and testimony of the angel, and from seeing Christ
   himself. Now before Christ showed himself, they already ran to the
   disciples, as they had been commanded by the angel. On the road they
   received a second confirmation, that they might with greater certainty
   assert the resurrection of the Lord.

   With fear and great joy. By these words Matthew means that they were
   indeed gladdened by what the angel told them, but, at the same the were
   struck with fear, so that they were held in suspense between joy and
   perplexity. For there are sometimes opposite feelings in the hearts of
   the godly, which move them alternately in opposite directions, until at
   length the peace of the Spirit brings them into a settled condition.
   For if their faith had been strong, it would have given them entire
   composure by subduing fear; but now fear, mingled with joy, shows that
   they had not yet fully relied on the testimony of the angel. And here
   Christ exhibited a remarkable instance of compassion, in meeting them
   while they thus doubted and trembled, so as to remove all remaining
   doubt.

   Yet there is some diversity in the words of Mark, that they fled,
   seized with trembling and amazement, so that through fear they were
   dismayed. But the solution is not very difficult; for though they were
   resolved to obey the angel, still they had not power to do so, [307] if
   the Lord himself had not loosed their tongues. But in what follows
   there is greater appearance of contradiction; for Mark does not say
   that Christ met them, but only that he appeared first to Mary
   Magdalene, while Luke says nothing whatever of this appearance. But
   this omission ought not to appear strange to us, since it is far from
   being unusual with the Evangelists.

   As to the difference between the words of Matthew and of Mark, it is
   possible that Magdalene may have been a partaker of so great a favor
   before the other women, or even that Matthew, by synecdoche, may have
   extended to all what was peculiar to one of their number. It is more
   probable, however, that Mark names her alone, because she first
   obtained a sight of Christ, and in a peculiar manner, in preference to
   the others, and yet that her companions also saw Christ in their order,
   and that on this account Matthew attributes it to all them in common.
   This was an astonishing instance of goodness, that Christ manifested
   his heavenly glory to a wretched woman, who had been possessed by seven
   devils, (Luke 8:2,) and, intending to display the light of a new and
   eternal life, began where there was nothing in the eyes of man but what
   was base and contemptible. But by this example Christ showed how
   generously he is wont to continue the progress of his grace, when he
   has once displayed it towards us; and, at the same time, he threw down
   the pride of the flesh.

   9. And held his feet. This appears not to agree with the words of John,
   (20:17,) where he declares that Mary was forbidden to touch Christ. But
   it is easy to reconcile them. The Lord, perceiving that Mary was too
   eager to embrace and kiss his fleet, orders her to retire; because it
   was proper to correct the superstition, and to point out the design of
   his resurrection, which Mary was withheld from perceiving, partly by an
   earthly and carnal affection, and partly by foolish zeal. Yet at first
   the Lord permitted her to touch his feet, that nothing might be wanting
   to give her a full conviction; and, therefore, Matthew immediately
   adds, that they worshipped the Lord, which was a proof that they fully
   recognized him.

   10. Then Jesus saith to them. We conclude, that it was an improper
   fear, from which Christ again delivers them; for though it arose out of
   admiration, still it was opposed to the tranquillity of faith. That
   they may raise themselves to Christ, the Conqueror of death, they are
   commanded to be cheerful. [308] But by those words we are taught that
   we never know aright our Lord's resurrection, until, through the firm
   assurance which we have conceived in our hearts, we venture to rejoice
   that we have been made partakers of the same life. Our faith ought, at
   least, to proceed so far that fear shall not predominate.

   Go, tell my brethren. When Christ ordered them to tell this to the
   disciples, by this message he again collected and raised up the Church,
   which was scattered and fallen down. For as it is chiefly by the faith
   of the resurrection that we are now quickened, so at that time it was
   proper that the disciples should have that life restored to them from
   which they had fallen. Here, to it is proper to remark the astonishing
   kindness of Christ, in deigning to bestow the name of brethren on
   deserters who had basely forsaken him. Nor can it be doubted that he
   intentionally employed so kind an appellation, for the purpose of
   soothing the grief by which he knew that they were grievously
   tormented. But as the Apostles were not the only persons who were
   acknowledged by him as brethren, let us know that this message was
   conveyed by the recommend of Christ, in order that it might afterwards
   come to us. And, therefore, we ought not to listen with indifference to
   the narrative of the resurrection, when Christ, with his own mouth,
   kindly invites us to receive the fruit of it on the ground of our being
   related to him as brethren. As to the interpretation which some have
   given to the word brethren, as denoting the cousins and other relatives
   of Christ, [309] their mistake is abundantly refuted by the context;
   for John expressly says that Mary came and told the disciples, (20:18;)
   and Luke immediately adds, that the women told these things to the
   apostles. Mark also agrees with them; for he says that Mary came and
   told it to the apostles, while they were mourning and weeping.

   Mark 16:11. And when they heard. The testimony of Mary alone is related
   by Mark; but I am convinced that all of them in common conveyed the
   message in obedience to the commands of Christ. And even this passage
   confirms more fully what I have just now said, that there is no
   disagreement among the, Evangelists, when one of them specially
   attributes to Mary Magdalene what the other Evangelists represent as
   common to all the women, though not in an equal degree. But the
   disciples must have been held bound by shameful indifference, so that
   they did not recall to their recollection that what they had often
   heard from their Master was accomplished. If the women had related any
   thing of which they had not formerly heard, there would have been some
   reason for not immediately believing them in a matter which was
   incredible; but now they must have been uncommonly stupid in holding as
   a fable or a dream what had been so frequently promised and declared by
   the Son of God, when eye-witnesses assured them that it was
   accomplished. Besides, their unbelief having deprived them of sound
   understanding, they not only refuse the light of truth, but reject it
   as an idle fancy, as Luke tells us. Hence it appears that they had
   yielded so far to temptation, that their minds had lost nearly all
   relish for the words of Christ.

   Luke 24:12. And Peter arose, and ran to the tomb. I have no doubt that
   Luke here inverts the order of the narrative, as may be readily
   inferred from the words of John, (20:3;) and, in my opinion, the word
   ran (edramen) might justly be rendered as a pluperfect tense, had run.
   All who possess a tolerable acquaintance with Scripture are aware that
   it is customary with Hebrew writers to relate afterwards those
   occurrences which had been omitted in their proper place. Luke mentions
   this circumstance for the purpose of showing more strongly the
   obstinacy of the apostles ill despising the words of the women, when
   Peter had already seen the empty grave, and had been compelled to
   wonder at an evident proof of the resurrection.

   MATTHEW 28:11-15

   Matthew 28:11-15

   11. And while they were departing, lo, some of the guards came into the
   city, and told the chief priests all things which had happened. 12. And
   having assembled with the eiders, and entered into consultation, they
   gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13. Saying, Say that his
   disciples came by night, and stole him, while you were asleep. 14. And
   if this come to the ears of the governor, we will persuade him, and
   ensure your safety. 15. And they took the money, and did as they had
   been instructed: and this statement is currently reported among the
   Jews till the present day.


   Matthew 28:11. And while they were departing. It is not only credible,
   but the fact is manifest, that the soldiers, to whom had been entrusted
   the charge of the sepulcher, were corrupted by a bribe, so that they
   were prepared to tell a lie at the bidding of the priests. They knew
   well that there was nothing which the priests dreaded more than that a
   report should gain credit that Christ rose on the third day after his
   death; and they knew that they had been sent there, that, by guarding
   the body, they might suppress that report. Those men, therefore, being
   addicted to making gain, and seizing on opportunities of making it from
   every quarter, after having found that their diligence was of no
   service to them, contrive a new method of cheating their employers out
   of their money. The words of Matthew -- some of them came -- leave it
   uncertain if a few cunning men adopted this resolution without
   communicating with the rest, or if they were sent, by a general
   agreement, in the name of all. The latter supposition appears to be
   more probable; for Matthew afterwards says that money was given, not to
   one or two, but generally to the soldiers, to induce them to commit
   perjury. It is at all events certain that, whether they all plotted
   together, or only a part of them, they sought to make profit of the
   cruel and implacable hatred which the priests bore towards Christ; and
   that, looking upon them as convicted of a crime. they abused their evil
   conscience to extort money from them. For, as usually happens with all
   wicked men, the priests, conscious of having done wrong, in order to
   cover their disgrace, were compelled to bribe the soldiers by a large
   reward. Thus it is evident that the reprobate, after having once given
   themselves up to a course of sinning, are continually entangled in new
   crimes; and this arises out of their desire to conceal their shame
   before men, while they give themselves no concern about the offense
   committed against God. Those wretched men not only bribe the soldiers
   by a large sum of money, but expose their own reputation and life to
   serious danger, should cognizance be taken of the crime. And what
   constrains them, in addition to the expense which they have laid out,
   to incur so serious a risk, but because inveterate rage does not permit
   them to withdraw until they have added sin to sin?

   15. And this statement is currently reported. It was the finishing
   stroke of the vengeance of God to blind the Jews, that the resurrection
   of Christ was buried by the perjury of the soldiers, and that so gross
   a falsehood was believed. And hence it is evident that those who did
   not believe that Christ was risen were deceived by a voluntary error,
   as the world voluntarily gives itself up to be deceived by the snares
   of Satan. For if a man had but opened his eyes, it was unnecessary that
   he should make a long inquiry. Armed soldiers say that the body of
   Christ was stolen from them by a feeble, timid, small, and unarmed body
   of men. What plausible grounds have they for saying so? They add that
   this was done while they were asleep. How then do they come to know
   that it was stolen? And if they had any suspicion of the disciples, why
   did they not track their footsteps? Why did they not, at least, make a
   noise? It was therefore a childish subterfuge, which would not have
   screened them from punishment, if they had had to deal with an honest
   and upright governor; but through the connivance of Pilate, that
   enormous wickedness was allowed to pass unnoticed, In like manner, we
   see it happen every day, that irreligious judges give themselves little
   trouble, when truth is oppressed by fraud and malice; but, on the
   contrary, if they are not afraid of suffering damage, they appear to
   enter into collusion with base and infamous men.

   Though it may appear strange that God should permit this false report
   to gain currency to extinguish the glory of his Son, we ought to render
   the honor which is due to his just vengeance. For we perceive that this
   nation deserved to have its light taken away by clouds, because it so
   eagerly seizes hold on an idle and childish falsehood; next, because
   almost all have struck on the stone of stumbling, it was proper that
   their eyes should be darkened, that they might not see that the cup of
   giddiness was presented to them; and, in short, that they were
   abandoned to every kind of madness, as Isaiah had foretold, (6:9.) For
   God would never have permitted them to be deceived by such a foolish
   credulity, but in order that those who had despised the Redeemer might
   be shut out from the hope of salvation; as he now inflicts a similar
   punishment on the ingratitude of the world, by giving loose reins to
   the reprobate, that they may go from bad to worse. But though this
   falsehood obtained currency among the Jews, this did not prevent the
   truth of the Gospel from flying at liberty to the very ends of the
   earth, as it always rises victorious over all the obstacles in the
   world.

   MARK 16:12; LUKE 24:13-30

   Mark 16:12

   Luke 24:13-30

   12. And after these things he appeared in another form to two of them
   who were walking, and were going into the country.

   13. And lo, two of them were going, on the same day, to a village which
   was about sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem, called Emmaus; 14. And
   they conversed with each other about all things that had taken place.
   15. And it happened, while they were talking and reasoning, Jesus
   himself approached, and went with them. 16. But their eyes were held
   that they did not know him. 17. And he said to them, What are those
   discourses which you hold with each other, while you talk? and why
   [310] are you sad? 18. And one, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
   to him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and knowest thou not
   those things which have happened there in these days? 19. And he said
   to them, What things? And they said to him, About Jesus of Nazareth, a
   man who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the
   people: 20. And how our chief priests delivered him to be condemned to
   death, and crucified him. 21. But we hoped that he would be the person
   who should redeem Israel; and besides all these things, today is the
   third day since these things happened. 22. But also some women of our
   company made us astonished, who went early in the morning to the tomb;
   23. And not having found his body, came, saying, that they had also
   seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 24. And some of
   those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it to be as the
   women said; but him they saw not. 25. And he said to them, O fools, and
   slow of heart to believe all things which the prophets have spoken!
   26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to have entered
   into his glory? 27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he
   expounded to them in all the Scriptures those things which related to
   himself. 28. And they approached the village to which they constrained
   him, saying, Remain with us; for it is towards evening, and the day is
   spent. And he went in to remain with them. 30. And it happened while he
   sat at table with them, he took bread and blessed, [311] and broke it,
   and gave it to them.


   Luke 24:13. And lo, two of them. Although Mark touches slightly and
   briefly on this narrative, and Matthew and John say not a single word
   respecting it; yet as it is highly useful to be known and worthy of
   being remembered, it is not without reason that Luke treats it with so
   much exactness. But I have already mentioned on various occasions, that
   each of the Evangelists had his portion so appropriately assigned to
   him by the Spirit of God, that what is not to be found in one or two of
   them may be learned from the others. For there are also many
   appearances [312] which are mentioned by John, but are passed over in
   silence by our three Evangelists.

   Before I come to the minute details, it will be proper to begin with
   stating briefly, that those were two chosen witnesses, by whom the Lord
   intended, not to convince the apostles that he was risen, but to
   reprove their slowness; for though at first; they were of no service,
   yet their testimony, strengthened by other aids, had at length its due
   weight with the apostles. Who they were is uncertain, except that from
   the name of one of them, whom we shall find that Luke shortly
   afterwards calls Cleopas, we may conjecture that they did not belong;
   to the eleven. Emmaus was an ancient, and by no means inconsiderable,
   town, which the Romans afterwards called Nicopolis and was not at a
   great distance from Jerusalem, for sixty furlongs are not more than
   seven thousand and four hundred paces. [313] But the place is named by
   Luke, not so much on account of its celebrity, as to add certainty to
   the narrative.

   14. And they were conversing with each other. It was a proof of
   godliness that they endeavored to cherish their faith in Christ: though
   small and weak; for their conversation had no other object than to
   employ their reverence for their Master as a shield against the offense
   of the cross. Now though their questions and disputes showed an
   ignorance which was worthy of reproof -- since, after having been
   informed that the resurrection of Christ would take place, they were
   astonished at hearing it mentioned--still their docility afforded
   Christ an opportunity of removing their error. For many persons
   intentionally put questions, because they have resolved obstinately to
   reject the truth; but when men are desirous to embrace the truth
   submissively, though they may waver on account of very small
   objections, and stop at slight difficulties, their holy desire to obey
   God finds favor in his sight, so that he stretches out his hand to
   them, brings them to full conviction, and does not permit them to
   remain irresolute. We ought, at least, to hold it as certain, that when
   we inquire about Christ, if this be done from a modest desire to learn,
   the door is opened for him to assist us; nay, we may almost say that we
   then call for himself to be our Teacher; as irreligious men, by their
   unholy speeches, drive him to a distance from them.

   16. But their eyes were restrained. The Evangelist expressly states
   this, lest any one should think that the aspect of Christ's body was
   changed, and that the features of his countenance were different from
   what they had formerly been. [314] For though Christ remained like
   himself, he was not recognized, because the eyes of beholders were
   held; and this takes away all suspicion of a phantom or false
   imagination. But hence we learn how great is the weakness of all our
   senses, since neither eyes nor ears discharge their office, unless so
   far as power is incessantly communicated to them from heaven. Our
   members do indeed possess their natural properties; but to make us more
   fully sensible that they are held by us at the will of another, God
   retains in his own hand the use of them, so that we ought ever to
   reckon it to be one of his daily favors, that our ears hear and our
   eyes see; for if he does not every hour quicken our senses, all their
   power will immediately give way. I readily acknowledge that our senses
   are not frequently held in the same manner as happened at that time, so
   as to make so gross a mistake about an object presented to us; but by a
   single example God shows that it is in his power to direct the
   faculties which he has. bestowed, so as to assure us that nature is
   subject to his will. Now if the bodily eyes, to which peculiarly
   belongs the power of seeing, are held, whenever it pleases the Lord, so
   as not to perceive the objects presented to them, our understandings
   would possess no greater acuteness, even though their original
   condition remained unimpaired; but no in this wretched corruption,
   after having been deprived of their light, they are liable to
   innumerable deceptions, and are sunk into such gross stupidity, that
   they can do nothing but commit mistakes, as happens to us incessantly.
   The proper discrimination between truth and falsehood, therefore, does
   not arise from the sagacity of our own mind, but comes to us from the
   Spirit of wisdom. But it is chiefly in the contemplation of heavenly
   things that our stupidity is discovered; for not only do we imagine
   false appearances to be true, but we turn the clear light into
   darkness.

   17. What are those discourses which you hold with each other? What was
   at that time, as we perceive, done openly by Christ, we daily feel to
   be accomplished in ourselves in a secret manner; which is, that of his
   own accord he approaches us unperceived for the purpose of instructing
   us. Now from the reply of Cleopas it is still more evident that, as I
   have lately mentioned, though they were in doubt and uncertainty about
   the resurrection of Christ, yet they had in their hearts a reverence
   for his doctrine, so that they were far from having any inclination to
   revolt. For they do not expect that Christ will anticipate them by
   making himself known, or that this fellow-traveler, whoever he may be,
   will speak of him respectfully; but, on the contrary, having but a
   small and obscure light, Cleopas throws out a few sparks on an unknown
   man, which were intended to enlighten his mind, if he were ignorant and
   uninformed. The name of Christ was, at that time, so generally held in
   hatred and detestation, that it was not safe to speak of him
   respectfully; but spurning from him suspicion, he calls Christ a
   prophet of God, and declares that he is one of his disciples. And
   though this designation falls greatly below the Divine Majesty of
   Christ, yet the commendation which he bestows, though moderate, is
   laudable; for Cleopas had no other intention than to procure for Christ
   disciples who would submit to his Gospel. It is uncertain, however, if
   it was through ignorance that Cleopas spoke of Christ in terms less
   magnificent than the case required, or if he intended to begin with
   first principles, which were better known, and to rise higher by
   degrees. Certain it is, that a little afterwards, he does not simply
   place Christ in the ordinary rank of prophets, but says that he and
   others believed him to be the redeemer.

   19. Powerful in deed and in word. Luke has employed nearly the same
   form of expression in reference to the person of Stephen, (Acts 7:22,)
   where he says of Moses, by way of commendation, that he was powerful in
   words and in actions. But in this passage it is uncertain if it is on
   account of miracles that Christ is said to be powerful in actions, (as
   if it had been said that he was endued with divine virtues which proved
   that he was sent from heaven;) or if the phrase is more extensive, and
   means that he excelled both in ability to teach, and in holiness of
   life and other remarkable endowments. I prefer the latter of these
   views.

   Before God and all the people. The addition of these words ought not to
   be reckoned superfluous; for they mean that the high excellence of
   Christ was so well known, and was demonstrated by such undoubted
   proofs, that he had no hypocrisy or vain ostentation. And hence we may
   obtain a brief definition of a true Prophet, namely, that to what he
   speaks he will likewise add power in actions, and will not only
   endeavor to appear excellent before men, but to act with sincerity as
   under the eyes of God.

   21. But we hoped. From what follows it is evident that the hope which
   they had entertained respecting Christ was not broken off, though at
   first sight such might appear to be the import of their words. But as a
   person who had received no previous instruction in the Gospel might be
   apt to be prejudiced by the narrative which he was about to give
   respecting the condemnation of Christ, that he was condemned by the
   rulers of the Church, Cleopas meets this offense by the hope of
   redemption. And though he afterwards shows that it is with trembling
   and hesitation that he continues in this hope, yet he industriously
   collects all that can contribute to its support. For it is probable
   that he mentions the third day for no other reason than that the Lord
   had promised that after three days he would rise again. When he
   afterwards relates that the women had not fouled the body, and that
   they tad seen a vision of angels, and that what the women had said
   about the empty grave was likewise confirmed by the testimony of the
   men, the whole amounts to this, that Christ had risen. Thus the holy
   man, hesitating between faith and fear, employs what is adapted to
   nourish faith, and struggles against fear to the utmost of his power.

   25. And he said to them. This reproof appears to be too harsh and
   severe for a weak man such as this was; but whoever attends to all the
   circumstances will have no difficulty in perceiving that our Lord had
   good reason for rebuking so sharply those on whom he had long bestowed
   labor to little purpose, and almost without any fruit. For it ought to
   be observed, that; what is here said was not confined to these two
   persons, but, as a reproof of a common fault, was intended to be
   conveyed by their lips to the rest of their companions. So frequently
   had Christ forewarned them of his death -- so frequently had he even
   discoursed about a new and spiritual life, and confirmed his doctrine
   by the inspired statements of the prophets -- that he would seem to
   have spoken to the deaf, or rather to blocks and stones; for they are
   struck with such horror at his death, that they know not to what hand
   to turn. This hesitation, therefore, he justly attributes to folly, and
   assigns as the reason of it their carelessness in not having been more
   ready to believe. Nor does he only reprove them because, while they had
   the best Teacher, they were dull and slow to learn, but because they
   had not attended to the instructions of the Prophets; as if he had
   said, that their insensibility admitted of no excuse, because it was
   owing to themselves alone, since the doctrine of the Prophets was
   abundantly clear, and had been fully expounded to them. In like manner,
   the greater part of men, at the present day, remain in ignorance
   through their own fault, because they are obstinate, and refuse to be
   instructed. But let us observe that Christ, perceiving that his
   disciples are excessively sluggish; commences with reproof, in order to
   arouse them; for this is the way in which we must subdue those whom we
   have found to be hardened or indolent.

   26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things? There is no room to
   doubt that our Lord discoursed to them about the office of Messiah, as
   it is described by the Prophets, that they might not take offense at
   his death; and a journey of three or four hours afforded abundance of
   time for a full explanation of those matters. Christ did not,
   therefore, assert in three words, that Christ ought to have suffered,
   but explained at great length that he had been sent in order that he
   might expiate, by the sacrifice of his death, the sins of the world, --
   that he might become a curse in order to remove the curse, -- that by
   having guilt imputed to him he might wash away the pollutions of
   others. Luke has put this sentence in the form of a question, in order
   to present it with greater force; from which it may be inferred, that
   he employed arguments for showing the necessity of his death. The sum
   of what is stated is, that the disciples are wrong in distressing their
   minds about their Master's death, (without which he could not discharge
   what belonged to Christ; because his sacrifice was the most important
   part of redemption;) for in this way they shut the gate, that he might
   not enter into his kingdom. This ought to be carefully observed; for
   since Christ is deprived of the honor due to him, if he is not reckoned
   to be a sacrifice for sins, the only way by which he could enter into
   his glory was that humiliation or emptying, (Philippians 2:7,) out of
   which the Redeemer had arisen. But we see that no trivial offense is
   committed among at the present day, by the inversion of this order; for
   among the multitude of those who declare, in magnificent language, that
   Christ is King, and who extol him by divine titles, hardly one person
   in ten thinks of the grace which has been brought to us by his death.

   27. And beginning at Moses. This passage shows us in what manner Christ
   is made known to us through the Gospel. It is when light is thrown on
   the knowledge of him by the Law and the Prophets. For never was there a
   more able or skillful teacher of the Gospel than our Lord himself; and
   we see that he borrows from the Law and the Prophets the proof of his
   doctrine. If it be objected that he began with easy lessons, that the
   disciples might gradually dismiss the Prophets, and pass on to the
   perfect Gospel, this conjecture is easily refuted; for we shall
   afterwards find it stated, that all the apostles had their
   understanding opened, not to be wise without the assistance of the Law,
   but to understand the Scriptures. In order that Christ may be made
   known to us through the Gospel, it is therefore necessary that Moses
   and the Prophets should go before as guides, to show us the way. It is
   necessary to remind readers of this, that they may not lend an ear to
   fanatics, who, by suppressing the Law and the Prophets, wickedly
   mutilate the Gospel; as if God intended that any testimony which he has
   ever given respecting his Son should become useless.

   In what manner we must apply to Christ those passages respecting him
   which are to be found in every part of the Law and the Prophets, we
   have not now leisure to explain. [315] Let it suffice to state briefly,
   that there are good reasons why Christ is called the end of the law,
   (Romans 10:4.) For however obscurely and at a distance Moses may
   exhibit Christ in shadows, rather than in a full portrait, (Hebrews
   10:1,) this, at least, is beyond dispute, that unless there be in the
   family of Abraham one exalted Head, under whom the people may be united
   in one body, the covenant which God made with the holy fathers will be
   nullified and revoked. Besides, since God commanded that the tabernacle
   and the ceremonies of the law should be adjusted to a heavenly pattern,
   (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5,) it follows that the sacrifices and the
   other parts of the service of the temple, if the reality of them is to
   be found nowhere else, would be an idle and useless sport. [316] This
   very argument is copiously illustrated by the apostle, (Hebrews 9:1;)
   for, assuming this principle, that the visible ceremonies of the law
   are shadows of spiritual things, he shows that in the whole of the
   legal priesthood, in the sacrifices, and in the form of the sanctuary,
   we ought to seek Christ.

   Bucer, too, somewhere throws out a judicious conjecture, that, amidst
   this obscurity, the Jews were accustomed to pursue a certain method of
   interpreting Scripture which had been handed down to them by tradition
   from the fathers. But that I may not involve my inquiries in any
   uncertainty, I shall satisfy myself with that natural and simple method
   which is found universally in all the prophets, who were eminently
   skilled in the exposition of the Law. From the Law, therefore, we may
   properly learn Christ, if we consider that the covenant which God made
   with the fathers was founded on the Mediator; that the sanctuary, by
   which God manifested the presence of his grace, was consecrated by his
   blood; that the Law itself, with its promises, was sanctioned by the
   shedding of blood; that a single priest was chosen out of the whole
   people, to appear in the presence of God, in the name of all, not as an
   ordinary mortal, but clothed in sacred garments; and that no hope of
   reconciliation with God was held out to men but through the offering of
   sacrifice. Besides, there is a remarkable prediction, that the kingdom
   would be perpetuated in the tribe of Judah, (Genesis 49:10.) The
   prophets themselves, as we have hinted, drew far more striking
   portraits of the Mediator, though they had derived their earliest
   acquaintance with him from Moses; for no other office was assigned to
   them than to renew the remembrance of the covenant, to point out more
   clearly the spiritual worship of God, to found on the Mediator the hope
   of salvation, and to show more clearly the method of reconciliation.
   Yet since it had pleased God to delay the full revelation till the
   coming of his Son, the interpretation of them was not superfluous.

   28. And they drew near to the village. There is no reason for
   supposing, as some commentators have done, that this was a different
   place from Emmaus; for the journey was not so long as to make it
   necessary for them to take rest for the night at a nearer lodging. We
   know that seven thousand paces--even though a person were to walk
   slowly for his own gratification--would be accomplished in four hours
   at the utmost; and, therefore, I have no doubt that Christ had now
   reached Emmaus.

   And he seemed as if he would go farther. Now as to the question, Can
   insincerity apply to him who is the eternal truth of God? I answer,
   that the Son of God was under no obligation to make all his designs
   known. Still, as insincerity of any kind is a sort of falsehood, the
   difficulty is not yet removed; more especially as this example is
   adduced by many to prove that they are at liberty to tell lies. But I
   reply, that Christ might without falsehood have pretended what is here
   mentioned, in the same manner that he gave himself out to be a stranger
   passing along the road; for there was the same reason for both. A
   somewhat more ingenious solution is given by Augustine, (in his work
   addressed To Consentius, Book II., chap. 13, and in the book of
   Questions on the Gospels, chap. 51,) for he chooses to enumerate this
   kind of feigning among tropes and figures, and afterwards among
   parables and fables. For my own part, I am satisfied with this single
   consideration, that as Christ for the time threw a veil over the eyes
   of those with whom he was conversing, so that he had assumed a
   different character, and was regarded by them as all ordinary stranger,
   so, when he appeared for the time to intend to go farther, it was not
   through pretending any thing else than what he had resolved to do, but
   because he wished to conceal the manner of his departure; for none will
   deny that he did go farther, since he had then withdrawn from human
   society. So then by this feigning he did not deceive his disciples, but
   held them for a little in suspense, till the proper time should arrive
   for making himself known. It is, therefore, highly improper to attempt
   to make Christ an advocate of falsehood; and we are no more at liberty
   to plead his example for feigning any thing, than to endeavor to equal
   his divine power in shutting the eyes of men. Our safest course is to
   adhere to the rule which has been laid down to us, to speak with truth
   and simplicity; not that our Lord himself ever departed from the law of
   his Father, but because, without confining himself to the letter of the
   commandments, he kept by the true meaning of the law; but we, on
   account of the weakness of our senses, need to be restrained in a
   different manner.

   30. He took bread. Augustine, and the greater part of other
   commentators along with him, have thought that Christ gave the bread,
   not as an ordinary meal, but as the sacred symbol of his body. And,
   indeed, it might be said with some plausibility, that the Lord was at
   length recognized in the spiritual mirror of the Lord's Supper; for the
   disciples did not know him, when they beheld him with the bodily eyes.
   But as this conjecture rests on no probable grounds, I choose rather to
   view the words of Luke as meaning that Christ, in taking the bread,
   gave thanks according to his custom. But it appears that he employed
   his peculiar and ordinary form of prayer, to which he knew that the
   disciples had been habitually accustomed, that, warned by this sign,
   they might arouse their senses. In the meantime, let us learn by the
   example of our Master, whenever we eat bread, to offer thanksgiving to
   the Author of life, -- an action which will distinguish us from
   irreligious men.

   MARK 16:13,14; LUKE 24:31-40

   Mark 16:13-14

   Luke 24:31-40

   13. And they went away and told it to the rest, but neither did they
   believe them. 14. Afterwards he appeared to the eleven while they sat
   at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
   because they did not believe those who saw him after he was risen.

   31. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; [317] and he
   vanished from their eyes. [318] 32. And they said one to another, Did
   not our heart burn within us, while he talked to us on the road, and
   opened to us the Scriptures? 33. And they arose in the same hour, [319]
   and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled, and those
   who were with them, 34. Saying, The Lord is actually risen, and hath
   appeared to Simon. 35. Then they related what had taken place on the
   road, and how he had been recognized by them in the breaking of bread.
   36. And while they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst
   of them, and said to them, Peace be to you. 37. But they were terrified
   and affrighted, and thought that they saw a spirit. 38. And he said to
   them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
   39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and
   see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have. 40. And
   having said these things, he showed them his hands and his feet.


   Luke 24:31. And their eyes were opened. By these words, we are taught
   that there was not in Christ any metamorphosis, or variety of forms, by
   which he might impose on the eyes of men, (as the poets feign their
   Proteus,) but that, on the contrary, the eyes of beholders were
   mistaken, because they were covered; just as, shortly afterwards, he
   vanished from the eyes of those very persons, not because his body was
   in itself invisible, but because God, by withdrawing their rigor,
   blunted their acuteness. Nor ought we to wonder that Christ, as soon as
   he was recognized, immediately disappeared; for it was not advantageous
   that they should any longer behold him, lest, as they were naturally
   too much addicted to the earth, they might desire again to bring him
   back to an earthly life. So far, then, as it was necessary to assure
   them of his resurrection, he made himself visible to them; but by the
   sudden departure, he taught them that they must seek him elsewhere than
   in the world, because the completion of the new life was his ascension
   to heaven.

   32. Did not our heart burn within us? Their recognition of Christ led
   the disciples to a lively perception of the secret and hidden grace of
   the Spirit, which he had formerly bestowed upon them. For God sometimes
   works in his people in such a manner, that for a time they are not
   aware of the power of the Spirit, (of which, however, they are not
   destitute,) or, at least, that they do not perceive it distinctly, but
   only feel it by a secret movement. Thus the disciples had formerly
   indeed felt an ardor, which they now remember, but which they had not
   then observed: now that Christ has made himself known to them, they at
   length begin to consider the grace which they had formerly, as it were,
   swallowed without tasting it, and perceive that they were stupid. For
   they accuse themselves of indifference, as if they had said, "How did
   it happen that we did not recognize him while he was talking? for when
   he penetrated into our hearts, we ought to have perceived who he was."
   But they conclude that he is Christ, not simply from the bare sign that
   his word was efficacious to inflame their hearts, but because they
   ascribe to him the honor which belongs to him, that when he speaks with
   the mouth, he likewise inflames their hearts inwardly by the warmth of
   his Spirit. Paul, indeed, boasts that the ministration of the Spirit
   was given to him, (2 Corinthians 3:8;) and Scripture frequently adorns
   the ministers of the word with such titles as the following; that they
   convert the hearts, enlighten the understandings, and renew men so as
   to become pure and holy sacrifices; but then it is not to show what
   they do by their own power, but rather what the Lord accomplishes by
   means of them. But both belong equally to Christ alone, to pronounce
   the outward voice, and to form the hearts efficaciously to the
   obedience of faith.

   It cannot be doubted that he then engraved an uncommon Mark on the
   hearts of these two men, that they might at length perceive that in
   speaking he had breathed into them a divine warmth. For though the word
   of the Lord is always fire, yet a fiery rigor was at that time
   manifested in a peculiar and unusual, manner in the discourse of
   Christ, and was intended to be an evident proof of his divine power;
   for it is he alone who baptizeth in the Holy Ghost and in fire, (Luke
   3:16.) Yet let us remember that it is the proper fruit of heavenly
   doctrine, whoever may be the minister of it, to kindle the fire of the
   Spirit in the hearts of men, to purify and cleanse the affections of
   the flesh, or rather to burn them up, and to kindle a truly fervent
   love of God; and by its flame, as it were, to carry away men entirely
   to heaven.

   33. And they arose in the same hour. [320] The circumstance of the
   time, and the distance of the places, show with what ardor those two
   men turned to convey the intelligence to their fellow-disciples. As
   they entered a lodging towards evening, it is probable that the Lord
   had not made himself known to them before night came on. To perform a
   journey of three hours in the dead of night was exceedingly
   inconvenient; yet they rise that very instant, and return in haste to
   Jerusalem. And, indeed, if they had only gone thither next day, their
   tardiness might have exposed them to suspicion; but as they chose
   rather to deprive themselves of the repose of the night than to allow
   the slightest delay in making the apostles partakers of their joy, the
   very haste gave additional credit to their narrative. Now whenLuke says
   that they arose in the same hour, [321] it is probable that they came
   to the disciples about midnight. But, according to the testimony of the
   same Luke, the disciples were at that time conversing together; and
   hence we learn their anxiety, and industry, and ardor, in spending
   almost the whole night without sleep, and unceasingly making inquiries
   at each other, until the resurrection of Christ was ascertained by a
   multitude of testimonies.

   34. Saying, The Lord is actually risen. By these words Luke means that
   those persons who had brought to the apostles joyful intelligence to
   confirm their minds, were informed by the disciples respecting another
   appearance. Nor can it be doubled that this mutual confirmation was the
   reward which God bestowed on them for their holy diligence. By a
   comparison of the time, we may conclude that Peter, after having
   returned from the sepulcher, was in a state of great perplexity and
   uncertainty, until Christ showed himself to him, and that, on the very
   day that he had visited the sepulcher, he obtained his wish. Hence
   arose that mutual congratulation among the eleven, that there was now
   no reason to doubt, because the Lord had appeared to Simon.

   But this appears to disagree with the words of Mark, who says, that the
   eleven did not even believe those two persons; for how could it be that
   those who were already certain now rejected additional witnesses, and
   remained in their former hesitation? By saying that he is actually
   risen, they acknowledge that the matter is beyond all doubt. First, I
   reply, that the general phrase contains a synecdoche; for some were
   harder or less ready to believe, and Thomas was more obstinate than all
   the rest, (John 20:25.) Secondly, We may easily infer that they were
   convinced in the same way as usually happens to persons who are
   astonished, and who do not consider the matter calmly; and we know that
   such persons are continually falling into various doubts. However that
   may be, it is evident from Luke, that the greater part of them, in the
   midst of that overpowering amazement, not, only embraced willingly what
   was told them, but contended with their own distrust; for by the word
   actually they cut off all ground for doubt. And yet we shall soon
   afterwards see that, a second and a third time, in consequence of their
   astonishment, they fell back into their former doubts.

   36. Jesus himself stood in the midst of them. While the Evangelist John
   copiously details the same narrative, (20:19,) he differs from Luke in
   some circumstances. Mark, too, differs somewhat in his brief statement.
   As to John, since he only collects what Luke omitted, both may be
   easily reconciled. There is no contradiction about the substance of the
   fact; unless some person were to raise a debate about the time: for it
   is there said that Jesus entered in the evening, while it is evident,
   from the thread of the narrative, that he appeared at a late hour in
   the night, when the disciples had returned from Emmaus. But I do not
   think it right to insist precisely on the hour of the evening. On the
   contrary, we may easily and properly extend to a late hour of the night
   what is here said, and understand it to mean that Christ came to them
   after the evening, when the apostles had shut the doors, and kept
   themselves concealed within the house. In short, John does not describe
   the very commencement of the night, but simply means that, when the day
   was past, and after sunset, and even at the dead hour of night, Christ
   came to the disciples contrary to their expectation.

   Still there arises here another question, since Mark and Luke relate
   that the eleven were assembled, when Christ appeared to them; and John
   says that Thomas was then absent, (20:24.) But there is no absurdity in
   saying that the number -- the eleven -- is here put for the apostles
   themselves, though one of their company was absent. We have lately
   stated--and the fact makes it evident--that John enters into the
   details with greater distinctness, because it was his design to relate
   what the others had omitted. Besides, it is beyond a doubt that the
   three Evangelists relate the same narrative; since John expressly says
   that it was only twice that Christ appeared to his disciples at
   Jerusalem, before they went to Galilee; for he says that he appeared to
   them the third time at the sea of Tiberias, (21:1) He had already
   described two appearances of our Lord, one which took place on the day
   after his resurrection, (20:19,) and the other which followed eight
   days afterwards, (20:26) though, were any one to choose rather to
   explain the second appearance to be that which is found in the Gospel
   by Mark, I should not greatly object.

   I now return to the words of Luke. He does not, indeed, say that
   Christ, by his divine power, opened for himself the doors which were
   shut, (John 20:26;) but something of this sort is indirectly suggested
   by the phrase which he employs, Jesus stood. For how could our Lord
   suddenly, during the night, stand in the midst of them, if he had not
   entered in a miraculous manner? The same form of salutation is employed
   by both, Peace be to you; by which the Hebrews mean, that for the
   person whom they address they wish happiness and prosperity.

   37. And they were terrified and affrighted. John does not mention this
   terror; but as he also says that Christ showed his hands and sides to
   the disciples, we may conjecture that some circumstance had been
   omitted by him. Nor is it at all unusual with the Evangelists, when
   they aim at brevity, to glance only at a part of the facts. From Luke,
   too, we learn that the terror excited in them by the strangeness of the
   spectacle was such, that they dare not trust their eyes. But a little
   ago, they had come to the conclusion that the Lord was risen, (verse
   34,) and had spoken of it unhesitatingly as a matter fully ascertained;
   and now, when they behold him with their eyes, their senses are struck
   with astonishment, so that they think he is a spirit. Though this
   error, which arose from weakness, was not free from blame, still they
   did not so far forget themselves as to be afraid of enchantments. But
   though they did not think that they are imposed upon, still they are
   more inclined to believe that an image of the resurrection is exhibited
   to them in vision by the Spirit, than that Christ himself, who lately
   died on the cross, is alive and present. So then they did not suspect
   that this was a vision intended to deceive them, as if it had been an
   idle phantom, but, seized with fear, they thought only that there was
   exhibited to them in spirit what was actually placed before their eyes.

   38. Why are you troubled? By these words they are exhorted to lay aside
   terror, and regain the possession of their minds, that, having returned
   to the rigor of their senses, they may judge of a matter which is fully
   ascertained; for so long as men are seized with perturbation, they are
   blind amidst the clearest light. In order, therefore, that the
   disciples may obtain undoubted information, they are enjoined to weigh
   the matter with calmness and composure.

   And why do thoughts arise in your hearts? In this second clause, Christ
   reproves another fault, which is, that by the variety of their thoughts
   they throw difficulties in their own way. By saying that thoughts
   arise, he means that the knowledge of the truth is choked in them in
   such a manner, that seeing they do not see, (Matthew 13:14;) for they
   do not restrain their wicked imaginations, but, on the contrary, by
   giving them free scope, they permit them to gain the superiority. And
   certainly we find it to be too true, that as, when the sky has been
   clear in the morning, clouds afterwards arise to darken the clear light
   of the sun; so when we allow our reasonings to arise with excessive
   freedom in opposition to the word of God, what formerly appeared clear
   to us is withdrawn from our eyes. We have a right, indeed, when any
   appearance of absurdity presents itself, to inquire by weighing the
   arguments on both sides; and, indeed, so long as matters are doubtful,
   our minds must inevitably be driven about in every direction: but we
   must observe sobriety and moderation, lest the flesh exalt itself more
   highly than it ought, and throw out its thoughts far and wide against
   heaven.

   39. Look at my hands and my feet. He calls upon their bodily senses as
   witnesses, that they may not suppose that a shadow is exhibited to them
   instead of a body. And, first, he distinguishes between a corporeal man
   and a spirit; as if he had said, "Sight and touch will prove that I am
   a real man, who have formerly conversed with you; for I am clothed with
   that flesh which was crucified, and which still bears the marks of it."
   Again, when Christ declares that his body may be touched, and that it
   has solid bones, this passage is justly and appropriately adduced by
   those who adhere to us, for the purpose of refuting the gross error
   about the transubstantiation of bread into the body, or about the local
   presence of the body, which men foolishly imagine to exist in the Holy
   Supper. For they would have us to believe that the body of Christ is in
   a place where no Mark of a body can be seen; and in this way it will
   follow that it has changed its nature, so that it has ceased to be what
   it was, and from which Christ proves it to be a real body. If it be
   objected, on the other hand, that his side was then pierced, and that
   his feet and hands were pierced and wounded by the nails, but that now
   Christ is in heaven without any vestige of wound or injury, it is easy
   to dispose of this objection; for the present question is not merely in
   what form Christ appeared, but what he declares as to the real nature
   of his flesh. Now he pronounces it to be, as it were, a distinguishing
   character of his body, that he may be handled, and therefore differs
   from a spirit. We must therefore hold that the distinction between
   flesh and spirit, which the words of Christ authorize us to regard as
   perpetual, exists in the present day.

   As to the wounds, we ought to look upon this as a proof by which it was
   intended to prove to us all, that Christ rose rather for us them for
   himself; since, after having vanquished death, and obtained a blessed
   and heavenly immortality, yet, on our account, he continued for a time
   to bear some remaining marks of the cross. It certainly was an
   astonishing act of condescension towards the disciples, that he chose
   rather to want something that was necessary to render perfect the glory
   of the resurrection, than to deprive their faith of such a support. But
   it was a foolish and an old wife's dream, to imagine that he will still
   continue to bear the marks of the wounds, when he shall come to judge
   the world.

   Mark 16:14. Afterwards he appeared to the eleven, while they were
   sitting. The participle (anakeimenois) which some have rendered sitting
   at table, ought, in my opinion, to be simply rendered sitting; and it
   is not without reason that I take this view of it, if it be agreed that
   the Evangelist here describes the first appearance; for it would have
   been an unseasonable hour of supper about midnight. Besides, if the
   cloth had been laid, [322] this would not have agreed with what Luke
   shortly afterwards says, that Christ asked if they had anything to eat.
   Now, to sit is the Hebrew phrase for resting in any place.

   And upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart. This
   reproof corresponds more to the first appearance than to the second;
   for since, the disciples, as John tells us, (20:20) were glad when they
   had seen the Lord on the day after the Passover, their unbelief was
   then rebuked. To restrict these words of Mark to Thomas alone, as some
   have done, appears to be forced; and, therefore, I prefer to explain
   them simply as meaning, that when Christ first appeared to the
   apostles, he reproved them for not believing the testimony of
   eye-witnesses, who informed them of his resurrection. And yet when he
   condemns their hardness of heart, it is not solely because they did not
   give credit to men, but because, after having been convinced by the
   result, they did not at length embrace the testimony of the Lord.
   Since, therefore, Peter and Mary, Cleopas and his companion, were not
   the first witnesses of the resurrection, but only subscribed to the
   words of Christ, it follows, that the rest of the apostles poured
   dishonor on the Lord by refusing to believe his words, though they had
   already been proved by their result. Justly, therefore, are they
   reproached with hardness of heart, because, in addition to their
   slowness, there was wicked obstinacy; as if they had intentionally
   desired to suppress what was evidently true; not that they intended to
   extinguish the glory of their Master, or to accuse him of falsehood,
   but because their obstinacy stood in the way, and hindered them from
   being submissive. In short, he does not here condemn them for voluntary
   obstinacy, as I have already said, but for blind indifference, which
   sometimes hardens men that otherwise are not wicked or rebellious.

   LUKE 24:41-49

   Luke 24:41-49

   41. But while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to
   them, Have you here any thing to eat? 42. And they presented to him a
   piece of a broiled fish, and some honeycomb. 43. And he took, and ate,
   in their presence. 44. And he said to them, These are the words which I
   spoke to you, while I was still with you; that all things which are
   written in the law Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms,
   concerning me, are fulfilled. 45. Then he opened their understanding,
   that they might understand the Scriptures. 46. And he said to them,
   Thus it is written, and thus it was proper that Christ should suffer,
   and rise from the dead on the third day; 47. And that repentance and
   forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations,
   beginning at Jerusalem. 48. And you are witnesses of those things.
   49. And, lo, send the promise of my Father upon you; but remain you in
   the city of Jerusalem, till you are endued with power from on high.


   Luke 24:41. But while they yet believed not for joy. This passage shows
   also that they were not purposely incredulous, like persons who
   deliberately resolve not to believe; but while their will led them to
   believe eagerly, they were held bound by the vehemence of their
   feelings, so that they could not rest satisfied. For certainly the joy
   which Luke mentions arose from nothing but faith; and yet it hindered
   their faith from gaining the victory. Let us therefore observe with
   what suspicion we ought to regard the vehemence of our feelings, which,
   though it may have good beginnings, hurries us out of the right path.
   We are also reminded how earnestly we ought to struggle against every
   thing that retards faith, since the joy which sprung up in the minds of
   the apostles from the presence of Christ was the cause of their
   unbelief.

   43. And he took, and ate it in their presence. Here we perceive, on the
   other hand, how kindly and gently Christ bears with the weakness of his
   followers, since he does not fail to give them this new support when
   they are falling. And, indeed, though he has obtained a new and
   heavenly life, and has no more need of meat and drink than angels have,
   still he voluntarily condescends to join in the common usages of
   mortals. During the whole course of his life, he had subjected himself
   to the necessity of eating and drinking; and now, though relieved from
   that necessity, he eats for the purpose of convincing his disciples of
   the certainty of his resurrection. Thus we see how he disregarded
   himself, and chose always to be devoted to our interests. This is the
   true and pious meditation on this narrative, in which believers may
   advantageously rest, dismissing questions of mere curiosity, such as,
   "Was this corruptible food digested?" "What sort of nourishment did the
   body of Christ derive from it?" and, "What became of what did not go to
   nourishment?" As if it had not been in the power of Him who created all
   things out of nothing to reduce to nothing a small portion of food,
   whenever he thought fit. As Christ really tasted the fish and the
   honeycomb, in order to show that he was a man, so we cannot doubt that
   by his divine power he consumed what was not needed to pass into
   nourishment. Thus the angels, at the table of Abraham, (Genesis 18:1,)
   having been clothed with real bodies, did actually, I have no doubt,
   eat and drink; but yet I do not therefore admit that the meat and drink
   yielded them that refreshment which the weakness of the flesh demands;
   but as they were clothed with a human form for the sake of Abraham, so
   the Lord granted this favor to his servant, that those heavenly
   visitors ate before his tent. Now if we acknowledge that the bodies
   which they assumed for a time were reduced to nothing after they had
   discharged their embassy, who will deny that the same thing happened as
   to the food?

   44. These are the words. Though it will afterwards appear from Matthew
   and Mark that a discourse similar to this was delivered in Galilee, yet
   I think it probable that Luke now relates what happened on the day
   after his resurrection. For what John says of that day, that he
   breathed on them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost, (20:22)
   agrees with the words of Luke which here immediately follow, that he
   opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures.
   By these words Christ indirectly reproves their gross and shameful
   forgetfulness, that, though they had long ago been fully informed of
   his future resurrection, they were as much astonished as if it had
   never been mentioned to them. The import of his words is: "Why do you
   hesitate as if this had been a new and unexpected occurrence, while it
   is only what I frequently predicted to you? Why do you not rather
   remember my words? For if hitherto you have reckoned me worthy of
   credit, this ought to have been known to you from my instructions
   before it happened." In short, Christ tacitly complains that his labor
   has been thrown away on the apostles, since his instruction has been
   forgotten.

   All things which are written concerning me. He now rebukes them more
   sharply for their slowness, by declaring that he brought forward
   nothing that was new but that he only reminded them of what had been
   declared by the Law and the Prophets, with which they ought to have
   been familiar from their childhood. But though they had been ignorant
   of the whole doctrine of religion, nothing could have been more
   unreasonable than not to embrace readily what they knew to have
   undoubtedly proceeded from God; for it was a principle admitted by the
   whole nation, that there was no religion but what was contained in the
   Law and the Prophets. The present division of the Scriptures is more
   copious than what we find in other passages; for besides the Law and
   the Prophets, he adds, in the third place, the Psalms, which, though
   they might with propriety have been reckoned among the Prophets, have,
   something distinct and peculiar to themselves. Yet the division into
   two par which we have seen elsewhere, (Luke 16:16; John 1:45,) embraces
   notwithstanding the whole of Scripture.

   45. Then he opened their understanding. As the Lord had formerly
   discharged the office of Teacher, with little or no improvement on the
   part of the disciples, he now begins to teach them inwardly by his
   Spirit; for words are icily wasted on the air, until the minds are
   enlightened by the gift of understanding. It is true, indeed, that

   the word of God is like a lamp,
   (Psalm 119:105;)

   but it shines in darkness and amidst the blind, until the inward light
   is given by the Lord, to whom it peculiarly belongs to enlighten the
   blind, (Psalm 146:8.) And hence it is evident how great is the
   corruption of our nature, since the light of life exhibited to us in
   the heavenly oracles is of no avail to us. Now if we do not perceive by
   the understanding what is right, how would the will be sufficient for
   yielding obedience? We ought, therefore, to acknowledge that we come
   short in every respect, so that the heavenly doctrine proves to be
   useful and efficacious to us, only so far as the Spirit both forms our
   minds to understand it, and our hearts to submit to its yoke; and,
   therefore, that in order to our being properly qualified for becoming
   his disciples, we must lay aside all confidence in our own abilities,
   and seek light from heaven; and, abandoning the foolish opinion of
   free-will, must give ourselves up to be governed by God. Nor is it
   without reason that Paul bids men

   become fools, that they may be wise to God,
   (1 Corinthians 3:18;)

   for no darkness is more dangerous for quenching the light of the Spirit
   than reliance on our own sagacity.

   That they might understand the Scriptures. Let the reader next observe,
   that the disciples had not the eyes of their mind opened, so as to
   comprehend the mysteries of God without any assistance, but so far as
   they are contained in the Scriptures; and thus was fulfilled what is
   said,

   (Psalm 119:18,) Enlighten mine eyes,
   that I may behold the wonders of thy law.

   For God does not bestow the Spirit on his people, in order to set aside
   the use of his word, but rather to render it fruitful. It is highly
   improper, therefore, in fanatics, under the pretense of revelations, to
   take upon themselves the liberty of despising the Scriptures; for what
   we now read in reference to the apostles is daily accomplished by
   Christ in all his people, namely, that by his Spirit he guides us to
   understand the Scriptures, and does not hurry us away into the idle
   raptures of enthusiasm.

   But it may be asked, Why did Christ choose to lose his labor, during
   the entire period of three years, in teaching them, rather than to open
   their understandings from the very outset? I reply, first, though the
   fruit of his labor did not immediately appear, still it was not
   useless; for when the new light was given to them, they likewise
   perceived the advantage of the former period. For I regard these words
   as meaning, not only that he opened their understandings, that, in
   future they might be ready to receive instruction, if any thing were
   stated to them, but that they might call to remembrance his doctrine,
   which they had formerly heard without any advantage. Next, let us learn
   that this ignorance, which lasted during three years, was of great use
   for informing them that from no other source than from the heavenly
   light did they obtain their new discernment. Besides, by this fact
   Christ gave an undoubted proof of his Divinity; for he not only was the
   minister of the outward voice, which sounded in their ears, but by his
   hidden power he penetrated into their minds, and thus showed that what,
   Paul tells us, does not belong to the teachers of the Church is the
   prerogative of Him alone, (1 Corinthians 3:7.) Yet it ought to be
   observed, that the apostles were not so destitute of the light of
   understanding as not to hold certain elementary principles; but as it
   was only a slight taste, it is reckoned to be a commencement of true
   understanding when the veil is removed, and they behold Christ in the
   Law and the Prophets.

   46. And he said to them, Thus it is written. The connection of these
   words refutes the calumny of those who allege that outward doctrine
   would be superfluous, if we did not naturally possess some power of
   understanding. "Why," say they, "would the Lord speak to the deaf?" But
   we see that, when the Spirit of Christ, who is the inward Teacher,
   performs his office, the labor of the minister who speaks is not thrown
   away; for Christ, after having bestowed on his followers the gift of
   understanding, instructs them out of the Scriptures with real
   advantage. With the reprobate, indeed, though the outward word passes
   away as if it were dead, still it renders them inexcusable.

   As to the words of Christ, they are founded on this principle: Whatever
   is written must be fulfilled, for God declared nothing by his prophets
   but what he will undoubtedly accomplish." But by these words we are
   likewise taught what it is that we ought chiefly to learn from the Law
   and the Prophets; namely, that since Christ is the end and the soul of
   the law, (Romans 10:4,) whatever we learn without him, and apart from
   him, is idle and unprofitable. Whoever then desires to make great
   proficiency in the Scriptures ought always to keep this end in view.
   Now Christ here places first in order his death and resurrection, and
   afterwards the fruit which we derive from both. For whence come
   repentance and forgiveness of sins, but because our old man is
   crucified with Christ, (Romans 6:6,) that by his grace we may rise to
   newness of life; and because our sins have been expiated by the
   sacrifice of his death, our pollution has been washed away by his
   blood, and we have, obtained righteousness through his resurrection? He
   teaches, therefore, that in his death and resurrection we ought to seek
   the cause and grounds of our salvation; because hence arise
   reconciliation to God, and regeneration to a new and spiritual life.
   Thus it is expressly stated that neither forgiveness of sins nor
   repentance can be preached but in his name; for, on the one hand, we
   have no right to expect the imputation of righteousness, and, on the
   other hand, we do not obtain self-denial and newness of life, except so
   far as

   he is made to us righteousness and sanctification,
   (1 Corinthians 1:30.)

   But as we have elsewhere treated copiously of this summary of the
   Gospel, it is better to refer my readers to those passages for what
   they happen not to remember, than to load them with repetitions.

   47. To all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. Christ now discovers
   clearly what he had formerly concealed--that the grace of the
   redemption brought by him extends alike to all nations. For though the
   prophets had frequently predicted the calling of the Gentiles, still it
   was not revealed in such a manner that the Jews could willingly admit
   the Gentiles to share with them in the hope of salvation. Till his
   resurrection, therefore, Christ was not acknowledged to be any thing
   more than the Redeemer of the chosen people alone; and then, for the
   first time, was the wall of partition (Ephesians 2:14) thrown down,
   that they who had been strangers, (Ephesians 2:19,) and who had
   formerly been scattered, might be gathered into the fold of the Lord.
   In the meantime, however, that the covenant of God might not seem to be
   made void, Christ has assigned to the Jews the first rank, enjoining
   the apostles to begin at Jerusalem. For since God had peculiarly
   adopted the posterity of Abraham, they must have been preferred to the
   rest of the world. This is the privilege of the firstborn which
   Jeremiah ascribes to them, when Jehovah says, I am a father to Israel,
   and Ephraim is first-born, (30:9.) This order, too, Paul everywhere
   observes with the greatest care, telling us that Christ came and
   proclaimed peace to those who were near, and afterwards to strangers
   who were at a distance, (Ephesians 2:17.)

   48. And you are witnesses of those things. He does not yet commission
   them to preach the gospel, but only reminds them to what service he has
   appointed them, that they may prepare themselves for it in due time. He
   holds out this, partly as a consolation to soothe their grief, and
   partly as a spur to correct their sloth. Conscious of their recent
   departure from their Master, they must have been in a state of
   dejection and here, contrary to all expectation, Christ bestows on them
   incredible honor, enjoining them to publish to the whole world the
   message of eternal salvation. In this manner he not only restores them
   to their former condition, but by the extent of this new favor he
   utterly obliterates the recollection of their heinous crimes; but at
   the same time, as I have said, he stimulates them, that they may not be
   so slow and dilatory in reference to the faith of which they were
   appointed to be preachers.

   49. And, lo, I send. That the apostles may not be terrified by their
   weakness, he invites them to expect new and extraordinary grace; as if
   he had said, though you feel yourselves to be unfit for such a charge,
   there is no reason why you should despond, because I will send you from
   heaven that power which I know that you do not possess. The more fully
   to confirm them in this confidence, he mentions that the Father had
   promised to them the Holy Spirit; for, in order that they might prepare
   themselves with greater alacrity for the work, God had already
   encouraged them by his promise, as a remedy for their distrust. Christ
   now puts himself in the place of the Father, and undertakes to perform
   the promise; in which he again claims for himself divine power. To
   invest feeble men with heavenly power, is a part of that glory which
   God swears that he will not give to another: and, therefore, if it
   belongs to Christ, it follows that he is that God who formerly spoke by
   the mouth of the prophet, (Isaiah 42:8.) And though God promised
   special grace to the apostles, and Christ bestowed it on them, we ought
   to hold universally that no mortal is of himself qualified for
   preaching the gospel, except so far as God clothes him with his Spirit,
   to supply his nakedness and poverty. And certainly, as it is not in
   reference to the apostles alone that Paul exclaims,

   (2 Corinthians 2:16,)
   And who shall be found sufficient for these things?

   so all whom God raises up to be ministers of the gospel must be endued
   with the heavenly Spirit; and, therefore, in every part of Scripture he
   is promised to all the teachers of the Church without exception.

   But remain you in the city of Jerusalem. That they may not advance to
   teach before the proper time, Christ enjoins on them silence and
   repose, until, sending them out according to his pleasure, he may make
   a seasonable use of their labors. And this was a useful trial of their
   obedience, that, after having been endued with the understanding of the
   Scripture, and after having had the grace of the Spirit breathed on
   them, (John 20:22;) yet because the Lord had forbidden them to speak,
   they were silent as if they had been dumb. For we know that those who
   expect to gain applause and admiration from their hearers are very
   desirous to appear in public. Perhaps, too, by this delay, Christ
   intended to punish them for indolence, because they did not, in
   compliance with his injunction, set out immediately, on the same day,
   for Galilee. However that may be, we are taught by their example, that
   we ought to attempt nothing but as the Lord calls us to it; and,
   therefore, though they may possess some ability to teach in public, let
   men remain in silence and retirement, until the Lord lead them by the
   hand into the public assembly. When they are commanded to remain at
   Jerusalem, we must understand this to mean, after they had returned
   from Galilee. For, as we shortly afterwards learn from Matthew, though
   he gave them an opportunity of seeing him at Jerusalem, still he did
   not change his original intention to go to Galilee, (Matthew 26:32, and
   28:10.) The meaning of the word, therefore, is, that after having given
   them injunctions at the appointed place, he wishes them to remain
   silent for a time, until he supplies them with new rigor.

   MATTHEW 28:16-20; MARK 16:15-18

   Matthew 28:16-20

   Mark 16:15-18

   16. But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where
   Jesus had appointed them. 17. And when they saw him, they worshipped
   him; but some doubted. 18. And Jesus approached, and spoke to them,
   saying, All power is given to me in heaven and on the earth. 19. Go
   out, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; 20. Teaching them to
   observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with
   you always, even to the end of the world.

   15. And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the gospel
   to every creature. 16. He who shall believe and be baptized shall be
   saved; but he who shall believe shall be condemned. 17. And these signs
   shall follow those who shall believe: In my name they shall cast out
   devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 18. They shall take up
   serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;
   they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.


   Matthew 28:16. And the eleven disciples went into Galilee. Matthew,
   passing by those occurrences which we have taken out of the other three
   Evangelists, mentions only in what place the eleven disciples were
   appointed to the apostolic office. For--as we have already had frequent
   opportunities of perceiving--it was not the intention of the
   Evangelists to embrace every part of the history; because the Holy
   Spirit, who guided their pen, has thought fit to compose such a summary
   as we see out of their united testimonies. Matthew has therefore
   selected what was of the greatest importance to us, namely, that when
   Christ appeared to the disciples, he likewise commissioned them to be
   apostles, to convey into every part of the world the message of eternal
   life.

   To the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. Though the mountain is
   not mentioned any where else, yet we con-elude that this spot in
   Galilee was known to Mary. [323]

   17. But some doubted. It is wonderful that, after they had twice seen
   Christ, still some doubted. If any one choose to view this as referring
   to the first appearance, there will be no absurdity in that opinion;
   for the Evangelists are sometimes in the habit of blending a variety of
   transactions. But neither would it have the appearance of absurdity to
   suppose that in some of them the remains of their former terror led
   them again into hesitation; for we know that, when Christ appeared,
   they were struck with fear and amazement, till they had recovered their
   minds and had become accustomed to his presence. The meaning, therefor
   appears to me to be, that some at first hesitated, until Christ made a
   nearer and more familiar approach to them; but that when they certainly
   and absolutely recognized him, then they worshipped, because the
   splendor of his divine glory was manifest. And perhaps it was the same
   reason that suddenly caused them to doubt, and afterwards led them to
   worship him; namely, that he had laid aside the form of a servant, and
   had nothing in his appearance but what was heavenly.

   18. And Jesus approached and spoke to them. His approach unquestionably
   removed all hesitation. Before relating that the office of teaching was
   committed to the disciples, Matthew says that Christ began by speaking
   of his power; and not without reason. For no ordinary authority would
   here have been enough, but sovereign and truly divine government ought
   to be possessed by him who commands them to promise eternal life in his
   name to reduce the whole world under his sway, and to publish a
   doctrine which subdues all pride, and lays prostrate the whole of the
   human race. And by this preface Christ not only encouraged the Apostles
   to full confidence in the discharge of their office, but confirmed the
   faith of his gospel in all ages. Never, certainly, would the Apostles
   have had sufficient confidence to undertake so arduous an office, if
   they had not known that their Protector sitteth in heaven, and that the
   highest authority is given to him; for without such a support it would
   have been impossible for them to make any progress. But when they learn
   that he to whom they owe their services is the Governor of heaven and
   earth, this alone was abundantly sufficient for preparing them to rise
   superior to all opposition. As regards the hearers, if the contemptible
   appearance of those who preach the gospel weakens or retards their
   faith, let them learn to raise their eyes to the Master himself, by
   whose power the majesty of the Gospel ought to be estimated, and then
   they will not venture to despise him when speaking by his ministers.

   He expressly calls himself the Lord and King of heaven and earth,
   because, by constraining men to obey him in the preaching of the
   gospel, he establishes his throne on the earth; and, by regenerating
   his people to a new life, and inviting them to the hope of salvation,
   he opens heaven to admit to a blessed immortality with angels those who
   formerly had not only crawled on the world, but had been plunged in the
   abyss of death. Yet let us remember that what Christ possessed in his
   own right was given to him by the Father in our flesh, or--to express
   it more clearly--in the person of the Mediator; for he does not lay
   claim to the eternal power with which he was endued before the creation
   of the world, but to that which he has now received, by being appointed
   to be Judge of the world. Nay, more, it ought to be remarked, that this
   authority was not fully known until he rose from the dead; for then
   only did he come forth adorned with the emblems of supreme King. To
   this also relate those words of Paul:

   he emptied himself, (heauton ekenose,) therefore God hath exalted him,
   and given to him a name which is above every other name,
   (Philippians 2:7, 9.)

   And though, in other passage the sitting at the right hand of God is
   placed after the ascension to heaven, as later in the order of time;
   yet as the resurrection and the ascension to heaven are closely
   connected with each other, with good reason does Christ now speak of
   his power in such magnificent terms.

   19. Go out, therefore, and teach all nations. Though Mark, after having
   related that Christ appeared to the eleven disciples, immediately
   subjoins the command to preach the gospel, he does not speak of these
   as an unbroken series of events, for we learn from the enumeration of
   them which is given by Matthew, that the latter event did not take
   place before they had gone into Galilee. The meaning amounts to this,
   that by proclaiming the gospel everywhere, they should bring all
   nations to the obedience of the faith, and next, that they should seal
   and ratify their doctrine by the sign of the gospel. In Matthew, they
   are first taught simply to teach; but Mark expresses the kind of
   doctrine, that they should preach the gospel; and shortly afterwards
   Matthew himself adds this limitation, to teach them to observe all
   things whatsoever the Lord hath commanded.

   Let us learn from this passage, that the apostleship is not an empty
   title, but a laborious office; and that, consequently, nothing is more
   absurd or intolerable than that this honor should be claimed by
   hypocrites, who live like kings at their ease, and disdainfully throw
   away from themselves the office of teaching. The Pope of Rome and his
   band proudly boast of their succession, as if they held this rank in
   common with Peter and his companions; and yet they pay no more regard
   to doctrine than was paid by the Luperci, or the priests of Bacchus and
   Venus. [324] And with what face, pray, do they claim to be the
   successors of those who, they are told, were appointed to be preachers
   of the gospel? But though they are not ashamed to display their
   impudence, still with every reader of sound judgment this single word
   is sufficient to lay prostrate their silly hierarchy--that no man can
   be a successor of the apostles who does not devote his services to
   Christ in the preaching of the gospel. In short, whoever does not
   fulfill the duties of a teacher acts wickedly and falsely by assuming
   the name of an apostle; and what is more--the priesthood of the New
   Testament consists in slaying men, as a sacrifice to God, by the
   spiritual sword of the word. Hence it follows, that all are but
   pretended and spurious priests who are not devoted to the office of
   teaching.

   Teach all nations. Here Christ, by removing the distinction, makes the
   Gentiles equal to the Jews, and admits both, indiscriminately to a
   participation in the covenant. Such is also the import of the term: go
   out; for the prophets under the law had limits assigned to them, but
   now,

   the wall of partition having been broken down,
   (Ephesians 2:14,)

   the Lord commands the ministers of the gospel to go to a distance, in
   order to spread the doctrine of salvation in every part of the world.
   For though, as we have lately suggested, the right of the first-born at
   the very commencement of the gospel, remained among the Jews, still the
   inheritance of life was common to the Gentiles. Thus was fulfilled that
   prediction of Isaiah, (49:6,) and others of a similar nature, that
   Christ was

   given for a light of the Gentiles,
   that he might be the salvation of God to the end of the earth.

   Mark means the same thing by every creature; for when peace has been
   proclaimed to those that are within the Church, the same message
   reaches those who are at a distance, and were strangers, (Ephesians
   2:17, 19.) How necessary it was that the apostles should be distinctly
   informed of the calling of the Gentiles, is evident from this
   consideration, that even after having received the command, they felt
   the greatest horror at approaching them, as if by doing so they
   polluted themselves and their doctrine.

   Baptizing them. Christ enjoins that those who have submitted to the
   gospel, and professed to be his disciples, shall be baptized; partly
   that their baptism may be a pledge of eternal life before God:, and
   partly that it may be an outward sign of faith before men. For we know
   that God testifies to us the grace of adoption by this sign, because he
   engrafts us into the body of his Son, so as to reckon us among his
   flock; and, therefore, not only our spiritual washing, by which he
   reconciles us to himself, but likewise our new righteousness, are
   represented by it. But as God, by this seal confirms to us his grace,
   so all who present themselves for baptism do, as it were, by their own
   signature, ratify their faith. Now since this charge is expressly given
   to the apostles along with the preaching of the word, it follows that
   none can lawfully administer baptism but those who are also the
   ministers of doctrine. When private persons, and even women, are
   permitted to baptize, nothing can be more at variance with the
   ordinance of Christ, nor is it any thing else than a mere profanation.
   Besides, as doctrine is placed first in order, this points out to us
   the true distinction between this mystery and the bastard rites of the
   Gentiles, by which they are initiated into their sacred mysteries; for
   the earthly element does not become a sacrament until God quickens it
   by his word. As superstition improperly counterfeits all the works of
   God, foolish men forge various sacraments at their pleasure; but as the
   word, which is the soul, is not in them, they are idle and unmeaning
   shadows. Let us therefore hold that the power of the doctrine causes
   the signs to assume a new nature; as the outward working of the flesh
   begins to be the spiritual pledge of regeneration, when it is preceded
   by the doctrine of the gospel; and this is the true consecration
   instead of which, Popery has introduced to us the enchantments of
   sorcery.

   Accordingly, it is said in Mark, He that shall believe and be baptized
   shall be saved. By these words Christ not only excludes from the hope
   of salvation hypocrites who, though destitute of faith, are puffed up
   only by the outward sign; but by a sacred bond he connects baptism with
   doctrine, so that the latter is nothing more than an appendage of the
   former. But as Christ enjoins them to teach before baptizing, and
   desires that none but believers shall be admitted to baptism, it would
   appear that baptism is not properly administered unless when it is
   preceded by faith. On this pretense, the Anabaptists have stormed
   greatly against infant baptism. But the reply is not difficult, if we
   attend to the reason of the command. Christ orders them to convey to
   all nations the message of eternal salvation, and confirms it by adding
   the seal of baptism. Now it was proper that faith in the word should be
   placed before baptism, since the Gentiles were altogether alienated
   from God, and had nothing in common with the chosen people; for
   otherwise it would have been a false figure, which offered forgiveness
   and the gift of the Spirit to unbelievers, who were not yet members of
   Christ. But we know that by faith those who were formerly despised are
   united to the people of God.

   It is now asked, on what condition does God adopt as children those who
   formerly were aliens? It cannot, indeed, be denied that, when he has
   once received them into his favor, he continues to bestow it on their
   children and their children's children. By the coming of Christ God
   manifested himself as a Father equally to the Gentiles and to the Jews;
   and, therefore, that promise, which was formerly given to the Jews,
   must now be in force towards the Gentiles,

   I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee,
   (Genesis 17:7.)

   Thus we see that they who entered by faith into the Church of God are
   reckoned, along with their posterity, among the members of Christ, and,
   at the same time, called to the inheritance of salvation. And yet this
   does not involve the separation of baptism from faith and doctrine;
   because, though infants are not yet of such an age as to be capable of
   receiving the grace of God by faith, still God, when addressing their
   parents, includes them also. I maintain, therefore, that it is not rash
   to administer baptism to infants, to which God invites them, when he
   promises that he will be their God.

   In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. This
   passage shows that the full and clear knowledge of God, which had been
   but darkly shadowed out under the Law and the Prophets, is at length
   fully discovered under the reign of Christ. True, indeed, the ancients
   would never have ventured to call God their Father, if they had not
   derived this assurance from Christ their Head; and the Eternal Wisdom
   of God, who is the fountain of light and life, was not wholly unknown
   to them. It was even one of their acknowledged principles, that God
   displays his power by the Holy Spirit. But at the commencement of the
   gospel God was far more clearly revealed in Three Persons; for then the
   Father manifested himself in the Son, his lively and distinct image,
   while Christ, irradiating the world by the full splendor of his Spirit,
   held out to the knowledge of men both himself and the Spirit.

   There are good reasons why the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
   are expressly mentioned; for there is no other way in which the
   efficacy of baptism can be experienced than when we begin with the
   unmerited mercy of the Father, who reconciles us to himself by the only
   begotten Son; next, Christ comes forward with the sacrifice of his
   death; and at length, the Holy Spirit is likewise added, by whom he
   washes and regenerates us, (Titus 3:5,) and, in short, makes us
   partakers of his benefits. Thus we perceive that God cannot be truly
   known, unless our faith distinctly conceive of Three Persons in one
   essence; and that the fruit and efficacy of baptism proceed from God
   the Father adopting us through his Son, and, after having cleansed us
   from the pollutions of the flesh through the Spirit: creating us anew
   to righteousness.

   Mark 16:16 He who shall believe and be baptized shall be saved. This
   promise was added in order to allure all mankind to believe; as it is
   followed, on the other hand, by a threatening of awful destruction, in
   order to terrify unbelievers. Nor is it wonderful that salvation is
   promised to believers; for, by believing in the only begotten Son of
   God, not only are they reckoned among the children of God, but
   receiving the gift of free justification and of the Spirit of
   regeneration, they possess what constitutes eternal life. Baptism is
   joined to the faith of the gospel, in order to inform us that the Mark
   of our salvation is engraved on it; for had it not served to testify
   the grace of God, it would have been improper in Christ to have said,
   that they who shall believe and be baptized shall be saved. Yet, at the
   same time, we must hold that it is not required as absolutely necessary
   to salvation, so that all who have not obtained it must perish; for it
   is not added to faith, as if it were the half of the cause of our
   salvation, but as a testimony. I readily acknowledge that men are laid
   under the necessity of not despising the sign of the grace of God; but
   though God uses such aids in accommodation to the weakness of men, I
   deny that his grace is limited to them. In this way we will say that it
   is not necessary in itself, but only with respect to our obedience.

   But he who shall not believe shall be condemned. By this second clause
   in which Christ condemns those who shall not believe, he means that
   rebels, when they reject the salvation offered to them, draw down upon
   themselves severer punishment, and not only are involved in the general
   destruction of mankind, but bear the guilt of their own ingratitude.

   17 And these signs shall follow them that shall believe. As the Lord,
   while he still lived with men in the world, had ratified the faith of
   his gospel by miracles, so now he extends the same power to the future,
   lest the disciples should imagine that it could not be separated from
   his bodily presence. For it was of very great importance that this
   divine power of Christ should continue to be exerted amongst believers,
   that it might be certainly known that he was risen from, the dead, and
   that thus his doctrine might remain unimpaired, and that his name might
   be immortal. When he says that believers will receive this gift, we
   must not understand this as applying to every one of them; for we know
   that gifts were distributed variously, so that the power of working
   miracles was possessed by only a few persons. But as that which was
   bestowed on a few was common to the whole Church, and as the miracles
   performed by one individual served for the confirmation of all, Christ
   properly uses the word believers in an indefinite sense. The meaning,
   therefore, is, that believers will be ministers of the same power which
   had formerly excited admiration in Christ, that during his absence the
   sealing of the gospel may be more fully ascertained, as he promises

   that they will do the same things, and greater,
   (John 14:12.)

   To testify the glory and the divinity of Christ, it was enough that a
   few of the believers should be endued with this power.

   Though Christ does not expressly state whether he intends this gift to
   be temporary, or to remain perpetually in his Church, yet it is more
   probable that miracles were promised only for a time, in order to give
   luster to the gospel, while it was new and in a state of obscurity. It
   is possible, no doubt, that the world may have been deprived of this
   honor through the guilt of its own ingratitude; but I think that the
   true design for which miracles were appointed was, that nothing which
   was necessary for proving the doctrine of the gospel should be wanting
   at its commencement. And certainly we see that the use of them ceased
   not long afterwards, or, at least, that instances of them were so rare
   as to entitle us to conclude that they would not be equally common in
   all ages.

   Yet those who came after them, that they might not allow it to be
   supposed that they were entirely destitute of miracles, were led by
   foolish avarice or ambition to forge for themselves miracles which had
   no reality. Thus was the door opened for the impostures of Satan, not
   only that delusions might be substituted for truth, but that, under the
   pretense of miracles, the simple might be led aside from the true
   faith. And certainly it was proper that men of eager curiosity, who,
   not satisfied with lawful proof, were every day asking new miracles,
   should be carried away by such impostures. This is the reason why
   Christ, in another passage, foretold that the reign of Antichrist would
   be full of lying signs, (Matthew 24:24;) and Paul makes a similar
   declaration, (2 Thessalonians 2:9.)

   That our faith may be duly confirmed by miracles, let our minds be kept
   within that moderation which I have mentioned. Hence, also, it follows
   that it is a silly calumny which is advanced by those who object
   against our doctrine, that it wants the aid of miracles; as if it were
   not the same doctrine which Christ long ago has abundantly sealed. But
   on this subject I use greater brevity, because I have already treated
   it more fully in many passages.

   Matthew 28:20. Teaching them to observe all things. By these words, as
   I have formerly suggested, Christ shows that, in sending the apostles,
   he does not entirely resign his office, as if he ceased to be the
   Teacher of his Church; for he sends away the apostles with this
   reservation, that they shall not bring forward their own inventions,
   but shall purely and faithfully deliver from hand to hand (as we say)
   what he has entrusted to them. Would to God that the Pope would subject
   to this rule the power which he claims for himself; for we would easily
   permit him to be the successor of Peter or of Paul, provided that he
   did not usurp a tyrannical dominion over our souls. But as he has set
   aside the authority of Christ, and infects the Church with his childish
   fooleries, this shows plainly enough how widely he has departed from
   the apostolic office. In short, let us hold that by these words
   teachers are appointed over the Church, not to put forward whatever
   they may think proper, but that they, as well as others, may depend on
   the mouth of the Master alone, so as to gain disciples for him, and not
   for themselves.

   And, lo, I am with you always. As Christ gave to the apostles a
   commission which they were unable to discharge by reliance on merely
   human power, he encourages them by the assurance of his heavenly
   protection. For before promising that he would be with them, he began
   with declaring that he is the, King of heaven and earth, who governs
   all things by his power and authority.

   The pronoun I must be viewed as emphatic; as if he had said that the
   apostles, if they wished zealously to perform their duty, must not
   consider what they are able to do, but must rely on the invincible
   power of those under whose banner they fight. The nature of that
   presence which the Lord promises to his followers ought to be
   understood spiritually; for it is not necessary that he should descend
   from heaven in order to assist us, since he can assist us by the grace
   of his Spirit, as if he stretched out his hand from heaven. For he who,
   in respect of his body, is at a great distance from us, not only
   diffuses the efficacy of his Spirit through the whole world, but even
   actually dwells in us.

   Even to the end of the world. It ought likewise to be remarked, that
   this was not spoken to the apostles alone; for the Lord promises his
   assistance not for a single age only, but even to the end of the world.
   It is as if he had said, that though the ministers of the gospel be
   weak and suffer the want of all things: he will be their guardian, so
   that they will rise victorious over all the opposition of the world. In
   like manner, experience clearly shows in the present day, that the
   operations of Christ are carried on wonderfully in a secret manner, so
   that the gospel surmounts innumerable obstacles.

   So much the more intolerable is the wickedness of the Popish clergy,
   when they take this as a pretext for their sacrilege and tyranny. They
   affirm that the Church cannot err, because it is governed by Christ; as
   if Christ, like some private soldier, hired himself for wages to other
   captains, and as if he had not, on the contrary, reserved the entire
   authority for himself, and declared that he would defend his doctrine,
   so that his ministers may confidently expect to be victorious over the
   whole world.

   [324] The God Pan, in honor of whom the grossest indecency was
   practiced at the festival of the Lupercalia, -- Bacchus, the patron of
   drunkenness, -- and Venus, the patroness of licentiousness, -- recall
   to every one who is familiar with classical literature the degraded
   state of morals into which Rome had sunk amidst the proudest triumphs
   of civilization. Ancient Heathenism, like the Braminism of modern
   Hindostan, offered a ready apology for every species of crime, and
   associated with the history of its gods, and with the most sacred
   duties of religion, scenes so utterly impure, and so much fitted to
   inflame the basest passions, that the bare recital of them would offend
   a modest ear. By the present allusion, Calvin means something more than
   meets the eye, and reminds us that the Pope and his clergy not only
   "paid as little regard to Christian doctrine as the priests of Pan, and
   Bacchus, and Venus," but that they too closely resembled them in the
   flagrant immorality of their lives. Above all, he points to the
   refinements of casuistry, the shocking disclosures of the confessional,
   and the profligacy of monastic life, in all of which, under the cloak
   of religion, practices, of which it is a shame even to speak,
   (Ephesians 5:12,) received the most direct encouragement. -- Ed.

   MARK 16:19-20; LUKE 24:50-53

   Mark 16:19-20

   Luke 24:50-53

   19. And after the Lord had thus spoken to them, he was taken up into
   heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. 20. And they went out
   and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the
   word by accompanying signs.

   50. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and lifted up his hands,
   and blessed them. 51. And it came to pass that, while he was blessing
   them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven. 52. And
   having worshipped him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
   53. And were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.


   Mark 16:19. And after the Lord had thus spoken to them. The Evangelist
   Matthew, having extolled in magnificent language the reign of Christ
   over the whole world, says nothing about his ascension to heaven. Mark,
   too, takes no notice of the place and the manner, both of which are
   described by Luke; for he says that the disciples were led out to
   Bethany, that from the Mount of Olives, (Matthew 24:3,) whence he had
   descended to undergo the ignominy of the cross, he might ascend the
   heavenly throne. Now as he did not, after his resurrection, appear
   indiscriminately to all, so he did not permit all to be the witnesses
   of his ascension to heaven; for he intended that this mystery of faith
   should be known by the preaching of the gospel rather than beheld by
   the eyes.

   Luke 24:50. And lifted up his hands, and blessed them; by which he
   showed that the office of blessing, which was enjoined on the priests
   under the law, belonged truly and properly to himself. When men bless
   one another it is nothing else than praying in behalf of their
   brethren; but with God it is otherwise, for he does not merely befriend
   us by wishes, but by a simple act of his will grants what is desirable
   for us. But while He is the only Author of all blessing, yet that men
   might obtain a familiar view of his grace, he chose that at first the
   priests should bless in his name as mediators. Thus Melchizedek blessed
   Abraham, (Genesis 14:19,) and in Numbers 6:23-27, a perpetual law is
   laid down in reference to this matter. To this purport also is what we
   read in Psalm 118:26, We bless you out of the house of the Lord In
   short, the apostle has told us that to bless others is a Mark of
   superiority; for the less, he says, is blessed by the greater, (Hebrews
   7:7.) Now when Christ, the true Melchizedek and eternal Priest, was
   manifested, it was necessary that in him should be fulfilled what had
   been shadowed out by the figures of the law; as Paul also shows that we
   are blessed in him by God the Father, that we may be rich in all
   heavenly blessings, (Ephesians 1:3.) Openly and solemnly he once
   blessed the apostles, that believers may go direct to himself, if they
   desire to be partakers of his grace. In the lifting up of the hands is
   described an ancient ceremony which, we know:, was formerly used by the
   priests.

   52. And having worshipped him, they returned. By the word worship, Luke
   means, first, that the apostles were relieved from all doubt, because
   at that time the majesty of Christ shone on all sides, so that there
   was no longer any room for doubting of his resurrection; and, secondly,
   that for the same reason they began to honor him with greater reverence
   than when they enjoyed his society on earth. For the worship which is
   here mentioned was rendered to him not only as Master or Prophet, nor
   even as the Messiah, whose character had been but half known, but as
   the King of glory and the Judge of the world. Now as Luke intended to
   give a longer narrative, he only states briefly what the apostles did
   during ten days. The amount of what is said is, that through the fervor
   of their joy they broke out openly into the praises of God, and were
   continually in the temple; not that they remained there by day and by
   night, but that they attended the public assemblies, and were present
   at the ordinary and stated hours to render thanksgiving to God. This
   joy is contrasted with the fear which formerly kept them retired and
   concealed at home.

   Mark 16:19. And sat down at the right hand of God. In other passages I
   have explained what is meant by this expression, namely, that Christ
   was raised on high, that he might be exalted above angels and all
   creatures; that by his agency the Father might govern the world, and,
   in short, that before him every knee might bow, (Philippians 2:10.) It
   is the same as if he were called God's Deputy, to represent the person
   of God; and, therefore, we must not imagine to ourselves any one place,
   since the right hand is a metaphor which denotes the power that is next
   to God. This was purposely added by Mark, in order to inform us that
   Christ was taken up into heaven, not to enjoy blessed rest at a
   distance from us, but to govern the world for the salvation of all
   believers.

   20. And they went out and preached. Mark here notices briefly those
   events of which Luke continues the history in his second book [325]
   that the voice of a small and dispersed body of men resounded even to
   the extremities of the world. For exactly in proportion as the fact was
   less credible, so much the more manifestly was there displayed in it a
   miracle of heavenly power. Every person would have thought that, by the
   death of the cross, Christ would either be altogether extinguished, or
   so completely overwhelmed, that he would never be again mentioned but
   with shame and loathing. The apostles, whom he had chosen to be his
   witnesses, had basely deserted him, and had betaken themselves to
   darkness and concealment. Such was their ignorance and want of
   education, and such was the contempt in which they were held, that they
   hardly ventured to utter a word in public. Was it to be expected that
   men who were unlearned, and were held in no esteem, and had even
   deserted their Master, should, by the sound of their voice, reduce so
   many scattered nations into subjection to him who had been crucified?
   There is great emphasis, therefore, in the words, they went out and
   preached everywhere -- men who but lately shut themselves up, trembling
   and silent, in their prison. For it was impossible that so sudden a
   change should be accomplished in a moment by human power; and therefore
   Mark adds,

   The Lord working with them; by which he means that this was truly a
   divine work. And yet by this mode of expression he does not represent
   them as sharing their work or labor with the grace of God, as if they
   contributed any thing to it of themselves; but simply means that they
   were assisted by God, because, according to the flesh, they would in
   vain have attempted what was actually performed by them. The ministers
   of the word, I acknowledge, are called fellow-workers with God, (1
   Corinthians 3:9,) because he makes use of their agency; but we ought to
   understand that they have no power beyond what he bestows, and that by
   planting and watering they do no good, unless the increase come from
   the secret efficacy of the Spirit.

   And confirming the word. Here, in my opinion, Mark points out a
   particular instance of what he had just now stated in general terms;
   for there were other methods by which the Lord wrought with them, that
   the preaching of the gospel might not be fruitless; but this was a
   striking proof of his assistance, that he confirmed their doctrine by
   miracles. Now this passage shows what use we ought to make of miracles,
   if we do not choose to apply them to perverse corruptions; namely, that
   they aid the gospel. Hence it follows that God's holy order is
   subverted, if miracles are separated from the word of God, to which
   they are appendages; and if they are employed to adorn wicked
   doctrines, or to disguise corrupt modes of worship.
