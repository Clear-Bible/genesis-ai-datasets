Translator's Introduction

   This famous and much loved little treatise, On Cleaving to God, (De
   Adhaerendo Deo) has always been attributed to Saint Albert the Great,
   who lived from about 1200 to 1280, and was one of the most respected
   theologians of his time. He was moreover a voluminous writer in the
   scholastic tradition, and, amongst other things, Bishop of Ratisbonne
   and one of the teachers of Eckhart at Paris University. The Latin text
   of which this is a translation is found in volume 37 of his Opera Omnia
   published in Paris in 1898.

   However almost all modern scholars are agreed that the work could not
   have been written by him, at least certainly not in its present form.
   It contains many implicit references and quotations from writers who
   lived well after Albert the Great. It is quite clear from the opening
   words of the treatise that it is in essence the private anthology of a
   contemplative or would-be contemplative, culled from many different
   sources, and including thoughts of his own. From the references
   included, it would seem to belong, at least in its present form to an
   unknown writer of the fifteenth century.

   However, it has often been pointed out that the first nine chapters
   seem to be of a somewhat different character to the remaining seven.
   Indeed most of the directly contemplative and mystical material in the
   work is contained in this first half, while the second section is
   concerned largely with more general matters of ordinary Christian
   piety. It has therefore been suggested that it is perhaps possible that
   a later hand has to some extent reworked and extended an original,
   shorter text, that could perhaps even go back to Albert the Great.
   Albert, we know, wrote a commentary on the teachings of the famous St.
   Dionysius, and this work, particularly in the first nine chapters is
   full of "Dionysian" themes. This could indicate that these chapters at
   least may belong to Albert the Great, or, alternatively, it could
   explain how it came to be attributed to him. The fact remains,
   whichever way round, that the work stands on its own merits as a
   classic of Western contemplative mysticism in the Via Negativa
   tradition. It has indeed been frequently called a supplement to the
   Imitation of Christ.

   In view of all these considerations, and in view of the fact that the
   work has always been attributed to Albert the Great (and all libraries
   and catalogues include it under his name), I have felt it best to leave
   it attached to his name, though with the above reservations. After all,
   Anonymous has dozens of works attributed to him that were actually
   written by someone else, so perhaps for once it is only fair to
   attribute an anonymous work to an actual person. Anyone who has ever
   tried to look for a work by Anonymous in a big library catalogue will,
   I feel confident, be grateful to me!

   Like Anonymous, I lay no claims to copyright on this translation. I
   commit it, and a copy of the Latin original, to the deep in sure and
   certain hope that it will do its own work.

  Chapter 1

    On the highest and supreme perfection of man, in so far as it is possible in
    this life

   I have had the idea of writing something for myself on and about the
   state of complete and full abstraction from everything and of cleaving
   freely, confidently, nakedly and firmly to God alone, so as to describe
   it fully (in so far as it is possible in this abode of exile and
   pilgrimage), especially since the goal of Christian perfection is the
   love by which we cleave to God. In fact everyone is obligated, to this
   loving cleaving to God as necessary for salvation, in the form of
   observing the commandments and conforming to the divine will, and the
   observation of the commandments excludes everything that is contrary to
   the nature and habit of love, including mortal sin. Members of
   religious orders have committed themselves in addition to evangelical
   perfection, and to the things that constitute a voluntary and
   counselled perfection by means of which one may arrive more quickly to
   the supreme goal which is God. The observation of these additional
   commitments excludes as well the things that hinder the working and
   fervour of love, and without which one can come to God, and these
   include the renunciation of all things, of both body and mind, exactly
   as one's vow of profession entails. Since indeed the Lord God is
   Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth,
   in other words, by knowledge and love, that is, understanding and
   desire, stripped of all images. This is what is referred to in Matthew
   6.6, When you pray, enter into your inner chamber,' that is, your inner
   heart, and having closed the door,' that is of your senses, and there
   with a pure heart and a clear conscience, and with faith unfeigned,
   pray to your Father,' in spirit and in truth, in secret.' This can be
   done best when a man is disengaged and removed from everything else,
   and completely recollected within himself. There, in the presence of
   Jesus Christ, with everything, in general and individually, excluded
   and wiped out, the mind alone turns in security confidently to the Lord
   its God with its desire. In this way it pours itself forth into him in
   full sincerity with its whole heart and the yearning of its love, in
   the most inward part of all its faculties, and is plunged, enlarged,
   set on fire and dissolved into him.

  Chapter 2

    How one can cling to and seek Christ alone, disdaining everything else

   Certainly, anyone who desires and aims to arrive at and remain in such
   a state must needs above all have eyes and senses closed and not be
   inwardly involved or worried about anything, nor concerned or occupied
   with anything, but should completely reject all such things as
   irrelevant, harmful and dangerous. Then he should withdraw himself
   totally within himself and not pay any attention to any object entering
   the mind except Jesus Christ, the wounded one, alone, and so he should
   turn his attention with care and determination through him into him -
   that is, through the man into God, through the wounds of his humanity
   into the inmost reality of his divinity. Here he can commit himself and
   all that he has, individually and as a whole, promptly, securely and
   without discussion, to God's unwearying providence, in accordance with
   the words of Peter, cast all your care upon him (1 Peter 5.7), who can
   do everything. And again, In nothing be anxious (Philippians 4.6), or
   what is more, Cast your burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain you.
   (Psalm 55.22) Or again, It is good for me to hold fast to God, (Ps.
   73.28) and I have always set up God before me. (Psalm 16.8) The bride
   too in the Song of Songs says, I have found him whom my soul loves,
   (Canticle 3.4) and again, All good things came to me along with her.
   (Wisdom 7.11) This, after all, is the hidden heavenly treasure, none
   other than the pearl of great price, which must be sought with
   resolution, esteeming it in humble faithfulness, eager diligence, and
   calm silence before all things, and preferring it even above physical
   comfort, or honour and renown. For what good does it do a religious if
   he gains the whole world but suffers the loss of his soul? Or what is
   the benefit of his state of life, the holiness of his profession, the
   virtue of his habit and tonsure, or the outer circumstances of his way
   of life if he is without a life of spiritual humility and truth in
   which Christ abides through a faith created by love. This is what Luke
   means by, the Kingdom of God (that is, Jesus Christ) is within you.
   (Luke 17.21)

  Chapter 3

    What the perfection of man consist of in this life

   Now the more the mind is concerned about thinking and dealing with what
   is merely lower and human, the more it is separated from the experience
   in the intimacy of devotion of what is higher and heavenly, while the
   more fervently the memory, desire and intellect is withdrawn from what
   is below to what is above, the more perfect will be our prayer, and the
   purer our contemplation, since the two directions of our interest
   cannot both be perfect at the same time, being as different as light
   and darkness. He who cleaves to God is indeed translated into the
   light, while he who clings to the world is in the dark. So the supreme
   perfection of man in this life is to be so united to God that all his
   soul with all its faculties and powers are so gathered into the Lord
   God that he becomes one spirit with him, and remembers nothing except
   God, is aware of and recognises nothing but God, but with all his
   desires unified by the joy of love, he rests contentedly in the
   enjoyment of his Maker alone. Now the image of God as found in the soul
   consists of these three faculties, namely reason, memory and will, and
   so long as they are not completely stamped with God, the soul is not
   yet deiform in accordance with the initial creation of the soul. For
   the true pattern of the soul is God, with whom it must be imprinted,
   like wax with a seal, and carry the mark of his impress. But this can
   never be complete until the intellect is perfectly illuminated,
   according to its capacity, with the knowledge of God, who is perfect
   truth, until the will is perfectly focused on the love of the perfect
   good, and until the memory is fully absorbed in turning to and enjoying
   eternal happiness, and in gladly and contentedly resting in it. And
   since the glory of the beatitude which is achieved in our heavenly
   homeland consists in the complete fulfilment of these three faculties,
   it follows that perfect initiation of them is perfection in this life.

  Chapter 4

    How man's activity should be purely in the intellect and not in the senses

   Happy therefore is the person who by continual removal of fantasies and
   images, by turning within, and raising the mind to God, finally manages
   to dispense with the products of the imagination, and by so doing works
   within, nakedly and simply, and with a pure understanding and will, on
   the the simplest of all objects, God. So eliminate from your mind all
   fantasies, objects, images and shapes of all things other than God, so
   that, with just naked understanding, intent and will, your practice
   will be concerned with God himself within you. For this is the end of
   all spiritual exercises - to turn the mind to the Lord God and rest in
   him with a completely pure understanding and a completely devoted will,
   without the entanglements and fantasies of the imagination. This sort
   of exercise is not practised by fleshly organs nor by the exterior
   senses, but by that by which one is indeed a man. For a man is
   precisely understanding and will. For that reason, in so far as a man
   is still playing with the products of the imagination and the senses,
   and holds to them, it is obvious that he has not yet emerged from the
   motivation and limitations of his animal nature, that is of that which
   he shares in common with the animals. For these know and feel objects
   by means of recognised shapes and sense impressions and no more, since
   they do not possess the higher powers of the soul. But it is different
   with man, who is created in the image and likeness of God with
   understanding, will, and free choice, through which he should be
   directly, purely and nakedly impressed and united with God, and firmly
   adhere to him. For this reason the Devil tries eagerly and with all his
   power to hinder this practice so far as he can, being envious of this
   in man, since it is a sort of prelude and initiation of eternal life.
   So he is always trying to draw man's mind away from the Lord God, now
   by temptations or passions, now by superfluous worries and pointless
   cares, now by restlessness and distracting conversation and senseless
   curiosity, now by the study of subtle books, irrelevant discussion,
   gossip and news, now by hardships, now by opposition, etc. Such matters
   may seem trivial enough and hardly sinful, but they are a great
   hindrance to this holy exercise and practice. Therefore, even if they
   may appear useful and necessary, they should be rejected, whether great
   or small, as harmful and dangerous, and put out of our minds. Above all
   therefore it is necessary that things heard, seen, done and said, and
   other such things, must be received without adding things from the
   imagination, without mental associations and without emotional
   involvement, and one should not let past or future associations,
   implications or constructs of the imagination form and grow. For when
   constructs of the imagination are not allowed to enter the memory and
   mind, a man is not hindered, whether he be engaged in prayer,
   meditation, or reciting psalms, or in any other practice or spiritual
   exercise, nor will they recur again. So commit yourself confidently and
   without hesitation, all that you are, and everything else, individually
   and in general, to the unfailing and totally reliable providence of
   God, in silence and in peace, and he will fight for you. He will
   liberate you and comfort you more fully, more effectively and more
   satisfactorily than if you were to dream about it all the time, day and
   night, and were to cast around frantically all over the place with the
   futile and confused thoughts of your mind in bondage, nor will you wear
   out your mind and body, wasting your time, and stupidly and pointlessly
   exhausting your strength. So accept everything, separately and in
   general, wherever it comes from and whatever its origin, in silence and
   peace, and with an equal mind, as coming to you from a father's hand
   and his divine providence. So render your imagination bare of the
   images of all physical things as is appropriate to your state and
   profession, so that you can cling to him with a bare and undivided
   mind, as you have so often and so completely vowed to do, without
   anything whatever being able to come between your soul and him, so that
   you can pass purely and unwaveringly from the wounds of his humanity
   into the light of his divinity.

  Chapter 5

    On purity of heart which is to be sought above all things

   If your desire and aim is to reach the destination of the path and home
   of true happiness, of grace and glory, by a straight and safe way then
   earnestly apply your mind to seek constant purity of heart, clarity of
   mind and calm of the senses. Gather up your heart's desire and fix it
   continually on the Lord God above. To do so you must withdraw yourself
   so far as you can from friends and from everyone else, and from the
   activities that hinder you from such a purpose. Grasp every opportunity
   when you can find the place, time and means to devote yourself to
   silence and contemplation, and gathering the secret fruits of silence,
   so that you can escape the shipwreck of this present age and avoid the
   restless agitation of the noisy world. For this reason apply yourself
   at all times to purity, clarity and peace of heart above all things, so
   that, so far as possible, you can keep the doors of your heart
   resolutely barred to the forms and images of the physical senses and
   worldly imaginations by shutting off the doors of the physical senses
   and turning within yourself. After all, purity of heart is recognised
   as the most important thing among all spiritual practices, as its final
   aim, and the reward for all the labours that a spiritual-minded person
   and true religious may undertake in this life. For this reason you
   should with all care, intelligence and effort free your heart, senses
   and desires from everything that can hinder their liberty, and above
   all from everything in the world that could possibly bind and overcome
   you. So struggle in this way to draw together all the distractions of
   your heart and desires of your mind into one true, simple and supreme
   good, to keep them gathered within yourself in one place, and by this
   means to remain always joined to things divine and to God in your mind,
   to abandon the unreliable things of earth, and be able to translate
   your mind continually to the things above within yourself in Jesus
   Christ. To which end, if you have begun to strip and purify yourself of
   images and imaginations and to simplify and still your heart and mind
   in the Lord God so that you can draw and taste the well of divine grace
   in everything within yourself, and so that you are united to God in
   your mind by a good will, then this itself is enough for you in place
   of all study and reading of holy scripture, and as demonstration of
   love of God and neighbour, as devotion itself testifies. So simplify
   your heart with all care, diligence and effort so that still and at
   peace from the products of the imagination you can turn round and
   remain always in the Lord within yourself, as if your mind were already
   in the now of eternity, that is of the godhead. In this way you will be
   able to renounce yourself through love of Jesus Christ, with a pure
   heart, clean conscience and unfeigned faith, and commit yourself
   completely and fully to God in all difficulties and eventualities, and
   be willing to submit yourself patiently to his will and good pleasure
   at all times. For this to come about you must repeatedly retreat into
   your heart and remain there, keeping yourself free from everything, so
   far as is possible. You must always keep the eye of your mind clear and
   still. You must guard your understanding from daydreams and thoughts of
   earthly things. You must completely free the inclination of your will
   from worldly cares and cling with all your being to the supreme true
   good with fervent love. You must keep your memory always lifted up and
   firmly anchored in that same true supreme good and only uncreated
   reality. In just this way your whole mind gathered up with all its
   powers and faculties in God, may become one spirit with him, in whom
   the supreme perfection of life is known to consist. This is the true
   union of spirit and love by which a man is made compliant to all the
   impulses of the supreme and eternal will, so that he becomes by grace
   what God is by nature. At the same time it should be noted that in the
   very moment in which one is able, by God's help, to overcome one's own
   will, that is to cast away from oneself inordinate love or strong
   feeling, in other words so as to dare simply to trust God completely in
   all one's needs, by this very fact one becomes so pleasing to God that
   his grace is imparted to one, and through that very grace one
   experiences that true love and devotion which drives out all
   uncertainty and fear and has full confidence in God. What is more,
   there can be no greater happiness than to place one's all in him who
   lacks nothing. So why do you still remain in yourself where you cannot
   stay. Cast yourself, all of yourself, with confidence into God and he
   will sustain you, heal you and make you safe. If you dwell on these
   things faithfully within, they will do more to confer a happy life on
   you than all riches, pleasures and honours, and above all the wisdom
   and knowledge of this present deceitful world and its life, even if you
   were to excel in them all that ever lived.

  Chapter 6

    That the devout man should cleave to God with naked understanding and will

   The more you strip yourself of the products of the imagination and
   involvement in external, worldly things and the objects of the senses,
   the more your soul will recover its strength and its inner senses so
   that it can appreciate the things which are above. So learn to withdraw
   from imaginations and the images of physical things, since what pleases
   God above everything is a mind bare of those sorts of forms and
   objects, for it is his delight to be with the sons of men, that is
   those who, at peace from such activities, distractions and passions,
   seek him with a pure and simple mind, empty themselves for him, and
   cleave to him. Otherwise, if your memory, imagination and thought is
   often involved with such things, you must needs be filled with the
   thought of new things or memories of old ones, or identified with other
   changing objects. As a result, the Holy Spirit withholds itself from
   thoughts bereft of understanding. So the true lover of Jesus Christ
   should be so united through good will in his understanding with the
   divine will and goodness, and be so bare of all imaginations and
   passions that he does not even notice whether he is being mocked or
   loved, or something is being done to him. For a good will turns
   everything to good and is above everything. So if the will is good and
   is obedient and united to God with pure understanding, he is not hurt
   even if the flesh and the senses and the outer man is moved to evil,
   and is slow to good, or even if the inner man is slow to feel devotion,
   but should simply cleave to God with faith and good will in naked
   understanding. He is doing this if he is conscious of all his own
   imperfection and nothingness, recognises his good to consist in his
   Creator alone, abandons himself with all his faculties and powers, and
   all creatures, and immerses himself wholly and completely in the
   Creator, so that he directs all his actions purely and entirely in his
   Lord God, and seeks nothing apart from him, in whom he recognises all
   good and all joy of perfection to be found. And he is so transformed in
   a certain sense into God that he cannot think, understand, love or
   remember anything but God himself and the things of God. Other
   creatures however and even himself he does not see, except in God, nor
   does he love anything except God alone, nor remember anything about
   them or himself except in God. This knowledge of the truth always makes
   the soul humble, ready to judge itself and not others, while on the
   contrary worldly wisdom makes the soul proud, futile, inflated and
   puffed up with wind. So let this be the fundamental spiritual doctrine
   leading to the knowledge of God, his service and familiarity with him,
   that if you want to truly possess God, you must strip your heart of all
   love of things of the senses, not just of certain creatures, so that
   you can turn to the Lord your God with a simple and whole heart and
   with all your power, freely and without any double-mindedness, care or
   anxiety, but with full confidence in his providence alone about
   everything.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

    How the heart should be gathered within itself

   What is more, as is said in the book On the Spirit and the Soul (of St.
   Augustine), to ascend to God means to enter into oneself. He who
   entering within and penetrating his inmost nature, goes beyond himself,
   he is truly ascending to God. So let us withdraw our hearts from the
   distractions of this world, and recall them to the inner joys, so that
   we can establish them to some degree in the light of divine
   contemplation. For this is the life and peace of our hearts - to be
   established by intent in the love of God, and to be sweetly remade by
   his comforting. But the reason why we are in so many ways hindered in
   the practical enjoyment of this matter and are unable to get into it is
   clearly because the human mind is so distracted by worries that it
   cannot bring its memory to turn within, is so clouded by its
   imaginations that it cannot return to itself with its understanding,
   and is so drawn away by its desires that it is quite unable to come
   back to itself by desire for inner sweetness and spiritual joy. Thus it
   is so prostrate among the sense objects presented to it that it cannot
   enter into itself as the image of God. It is therefore right and
   necessary for the mind to raise itself above itself and everything
   created by the abandonment of everything, with humble reverence and
   great trust, and to say within itself, He whom I seek, love, thirst for
   and desire from everything and more than anything is not a thing of the
   senses or the imagination, but is above everything that can be
   experienced by the senses and the intellect. He cannot be experienced
   by any of the senses, but is completely desirable to my will. He is
   moreover not discernable, but is perfectly desirable to my inner
   affections. He cannot be comprehended, but can be loved in his fullness
   with a pure heart, for he is above all lovable and desirable, and of
   infinite goodness and perfection. And then a darkness comes over the
   mind and it is raised up into itself and penetrates even deeper. And
   the more inward-looking the desire for it, the more powerful this means
   of ascent to the mysterious contemplation of the holy Trinity in Unity
   and Unity in Trinity in Jesus Christ is, and the more interior the
   yearning, the more productive it is. Certainly in matters spiritual the
   more inward they are the greater they are as spiritual experiences. For
   this reason, never give up, never stop until you have tasted some
   pledge, as I might say, or foretaste of the future full experience, and
   until you have obtained the satisfaction of however small a first
   fruits of the divine joy. And do not give up pursuing it and following
   its scent until you have seen the God of gods in Sion. Do not stop or
   turn back in your spiritual journey and your union and adherence to God
   within you until you have achieved what you have been seeking. Take as
   a pattern of this the example of those climbing an ordinary mountain.
   If our mind is involved by its desires in the things which are going on
   below, it is immediately carried away by endless distractions and side
   tracks, and being to some extent divided against itself, is weakened
   and as it were scattered amongst the things which it seeks with its
   desires. The result is ceaseless movement, travel without an arrival,
   and labour without rest. If on the other hand our heart and mind can
   withdraw itself by its desire and love from the infinite distraction
   below of the things beneath it, can learn to be with itself, abandoning
   these lower things and gathering itself within itself into the one
   unchanging and satisfying good, and can hold to it inseparably with its
   will, it is correspondingly more and more gathered together in one and
   strengthened, as it is raised up by knowledge and desire. In this way
   it will become accustomed to the true supreme good within itself until
   it will be made completely immovable and arrive securely at that true
   life which is the Lord God himself, so that it can now rest in him
   within and in peace without any changeability or vicissitude of time,
   perfectly gathered within itself in the secret divine abode in Christ
   Jesus who is the way for those who come to him, the truth and life.

  Chapter 8

    How a religious man should commit himself to God in all circumstances
    whatsoever

   I am now completely convinced that you will recognise from these
   arguments that the more you strip yourself of the products of your
   imagination and all worldly and created things, and are united to God
   with your intellect by a good will, the closer you will approach the
   state of innocence and perfection. What could be better? And what could
   be more happy and joyful? Above all it is important for you to keep
   your mind bare - without imaginations and images and free of any sort
   of entanglement, so that you are not concerned about either the world,
   friends, prosperity or adversity, or anything present, past or future,
   whether in yourself or in others - not even your own sins. But consider
   yourself with a certain pure simplicity to be alone with God outside
   the world, and as if your mind were already in eternity and separated
   from the body so that it will certainly not bother about worldly things
   or be concerned about the state of the world, about peace or war, about
   good weather or rain, or about anything at all in this world, but with
   complete docility will turn to God alone, be empty for him and cleave
   to him. So now in this way ignore your body and all created things,
   present or future, and direct the high point of your mind and spirit
   directly, as best you can, naked and unencumbered on the uncreated
   light. And let your spirit be cleansed in this way from all
   imaginations, coverings and things obscuring its vision, like an angel
   (not) tied to a body, who is not hindered by the works of the flesh nor
   tangled in vain and wandering thoughts. Let your spirit therefore arm
   itself against all temptations, vexations, and injuries so that it can
   persevere steadily in God when attacked by either face of fortune. So
   that when some inner disturbance or boredom or mental confusion come
   you will not be indignant or dejected because of it, nor run back to
   vocal prayers or other forms of consolation, but only to lift yourself
   up in your intellect by a good will to hold on to God with your mind
   whether the natural inclination of the body wills it or not. The
   religious-minded soul should be so united to God and should have or
   render its will so conformed to the divine will that it is not occupied
   with any created thing or cling to it any more than before it was
   created, and as if nothing existed except God and the soul itself. And
   in this way it should accept everything confidently and equally, in
   general and in particular, from the hand of divine providence, agreeing
   in everything with the Lord in patience, peace and silence. The thing
   is that the most important thing of all for a spiritual life is to
   strip the mind of all imaginations so that one can be united in one's
   intellect to God by a good will, and conformed to him. Besides, nothing
   will then be intermediary between you and God. This is obvious, since
   nothing external will stand between you when by the vow of voluntary
   poverty you will have removed the possession of anything whatsoever,
   and by the vow of chastity you will have abandoned your body, and by
   obedience you will have given up your will and your soul itself. And in
   this way nothing will be left to stand between you and God. That you
   are a religious person is indicated by your profession, your state, and
   now your habit and tonsure and such like, but whether you are only a
   religious in appearance or a real one, you will find out. Bear in mind
   therefore how greatly you have fallen away and sin against the Lord
   your God and all his justice if you behave otherwise and cling with
   your will and love to what is created rather than to the Creator
   himself, putting the created before the Creator.

  Chapter 9

    How much the contemplation of God is to be preferred to all other exercises

   Now since all things other than God are the effect and work of the
   Creator himself, their having ability and being is a limited power and
   existence, and being as they are created out of nothing, they are
   circumscribed by the effects of their nothingness, while their tendency
   of themselves towards nothingness means that we receive our existence,
   preservation and activity moment by moment from the Creator himself,
   along with whatever other qualities created things may have, just as we
   receive their insufficiency to any action of themselves, both with
   regard to themselves and to others, in relation to him whose operation
   they are, they remain as a nothing before something which exists, and
   as something finite before what is infinite. For this reason let all
   our actual contemplation, life and activity take place in him alone,
   about him, for him and towards him who is able and capable to produce
   with a single nod of his will things infinitely more perfect than any
   that exist now. No contemplation and fruition of love, whether
   intellectual or affective, is more useful, more perfect and more
   satisfying than that which is of God himself, the Creator, our supreme
   and true Good, from whom, through whom and to whom are all things. He
   is infinitely satisfying both to himself and to all others, who
   contains within himself in absolute simplicity and from all eternity
   the perfection of all things, in whom there is nothing which is not
   himself, before whom and through whom remain the causes of all things
   impermanent, and in whom dwell the unchanging origins of all changing
   things, while even the eternal reasons of all temporal things, rational
   and irrational, abide in him. He brings everything to completion, and
   fills all things, in general and in particular, completely and
   essentially with himself. He is more intimately and more really present
   to everything by his being than each thing is to itself, for in him all
   things are united together, and live in him eternally. What is more, if
   someone, out of weakness or from lack of intellectual practice, is
   detained longer in the contemplation of created things, this supreme,
   true and fruitful contemplation may still be seen as possible for
   mortal man, so that there may take place an upward leap in all his
   contemplations and meditations, whether about created things or the
   Creator, and the appreciation of God the Creator himself, the One and
   Three, may surge up within so that he come to burn with the fire of
   divine love and the true life in himself and in others, in such a way
   as to make him deserving of the joy of eternal life. Even in this one
   should bear in mind the difference between the contemplation of
   faithful Catholics and that of pagan philosophers, for the
   contemplation of the philosophers is for the perfection of the
   contemplator himself, and consequently it is confined to the intellect
   and their aim in it is intellectual knowledge. But the contemplation of
   the Saints, and of Catholics, is for the love of him, that is of the
   God they are contemplating. As a result it is not confined in the final
   analysis to the intellect in knowledge, but crosses over into the will
   through love. That is why the Saints in their contemplation have the
   love of God as their principal aim, since it is more satisfying to know
   and possess even the Lord Jesus Christ spiritually through grace than
   physically or even really but without grace. Furthermore, while the
   soul is withdrawn from everything and is turned within, the eye of
   contemplation is opened and sets itself up a ladder by which it can
   pass to the contemplation of God. By this contemplation the soul is set
   on fire for eternal things by the heavenly and divine good things it
   experiences, and views all the things of time from a distance and as if
   they were nothing. Hence when we approach God by the way of negation,
   we first deny him everything that can be experienced by the body, the
   senses and the imagination, secondly even things experienceable by the
   intellect, and finally even being itself in so far as it is found in
   created things. This, so far as the nature of the way is concerned, is
   the best means of union with God, according to Dionysius. And this is
   the cloud in which God is said to dwell, which Moses entered, and
   through this came to the inaccessible light. Certainly, it is not the
   spiritual which comes first, but the natural, (1 Corinthians 15.46) so
   one must proceed by the usual order of things, from active work to the
   quiet of contemplation, and from moral virtues to spiritual and
   contemplative realities. Finally, my soul, why are you uselessly
   preoccupied with so many things, and always busy with them? Seek out
   and love the one supreme good, in which is all that is worth seeking,
   and that will be enough for you. Unhappy therefore is he who knows and
   possesses everything other than this, and does not know this. While if
   he knows everything as well as this, it is not from knowing them that
   he is better off but because of This. That is why John says, This is
   eternal life, to know Thee, etc. (John 17.3) and the prophet says, I
   will be satisfied when your glory becomes manifest. (Psalm 17.15)

  Chapter 10

    That one should not be concerned about feeling tangible devotion so much as
    about cleaving to God with one's will

   Furthermore you should not be much concerned about tangible devotion,
   the experience of sweetness or tears, but rather that you should be
   mentally united with God within yourself by a good will in your
   intellect. For what pleases God above everything is a mind free from
   imaginations, that is images, ideas and the representations of created
   things. It befits a monk to be indifferent to everything created so
   that he can turn easily and barely to God alone within himself, be
   empty for him and cleave to him. For this reason deny yourself so that
   you can follow Christ, the Lord your God, in nakedness, who was himself
   poor, obedient, chaste, humble and suffering, and in whose life and
   death many were scandalised, as is clear from the Gospel accounts.
   After all, a soul which is separated from the body pays no attention to
   what is done to its abandoned body - whether it is burned, hanged, or
   reviled, and is in no way saddened by the afflictions imposed on the
   body, but thinks only of the Now of eternity and the One Thing which
   the Lord calls necessary in the Gospel. So you too should treat your
   body as if you were no longer in the body, but think always of the
   eternity of your soul in God, and direct your thoughts carefully to
   that One Thing of which Christ said, For one thing is necessary. (Luke
   10.42) You will experience because of it great grace, helping you
   towards the acquisition of nakedness of mind and simplicity of heart.
   Indeed this One Thing is very much present with you if you have made
   yourself bare of imaginations and all other entanglements, and you will
   soon experience that this is so - namely when you can be empty and
   cleave to God with a naked and resolute mind. In this way you will
   remain unconquered in whatever may be inflicted on you, like the holy
   martyrs, fathers, the elect, and indeed all the saints who despised
   everything and only thought of their souls' security and eternity in
   God. Armed in this way within, and united to God through a good will,
   they spurned everything of the world as if their souls were already
   separated from their bodies. Consider from this how much a good will
   united with God is capable of, when by means of its pressing towards
   God the soul is effectively separated from the body in spirit and looks
   on its outward man as it were from a distance, and as not belonging to
   it. In this way it despises everything that is inflicted on itself or
   on its flesh as if they were happening to someone else, or not to a
   human being at all. For He that is united with the Lord is one Spirit,
   (1 Corinthians 6.17) that is with him. So you should never dare to
   think or imagine anything before the Lord your God that you would blush
   to be heard or seen in before men, since your respect for God should be
   even greater than for them. It is a matter of justice in fact that all
   your thoughts and thinking should be raised to God alone, and the
   highest point of your mind should only be directed to him as if nothing
   existed but him, and holding to him may enjoy the perfect beginning of
   the life to come.

  Chapter 11

    How one should resist temptations and bear trials

   Now there is no one who approaches God with a true and upright heart
   who is not tested by hardships and temptations. So in all these
   temptations see to it that even if you feel them, you do not consent to
   them, but bear them patiently and calmly with humility and long
   suffering. Even if they are blasphemies and sordid, hold firmly on to
   this fact in everything, that you can do nothing better or more
   effective against them than to consider all this sort of fantasy as a
   nothing. Even if they are the most vile, sordid and horrible
   blasphemies, simply take no notice of them, count them as nothing and
   despise them. Don't look on them as yours or allow yourself to make
   them a matter of conscience. The enemy will certainly take flight if
   you treat him and his company with contempt in this way. He is very
   proud and cannot bear to be despised and spurned. So the best remedy is
   to completely ignore all such temptations, like flies flying around in
   front of your eyes against your will. The servant of Jesus Christ must
   see to it that he is not so easily forced to withdraw from the face of
   the Lord and to be annoyed, murmur and complain over the nuisance of a
   single fly, that is, a trivial temptation, suspicion, sadness,
   distraction, need or any such adversity, when they can all be put to
   flight with no more than the hand of a good will directed up to God.
   After all, through a good will a man has God as his defender, and the
   holy angels as his guardians and protectors. What is more, any
   temptation can be overcome by a good will too, like a fly driven away
   from a bald head by one's hand. So peace is for men of good will.
   Indeed we can offer God nothing more valuable than a good will, since a
   good will in the soul is the source of all good things, and the mother
   of all virtues. If any one is beginning to possess that good will, he
   undoubtedly has what is necessary for leading a good life. For if you
   want what is good, but cannot do it, God will make good the deed. For
   it is in accordance with this eternal law that God has established with
   irrevocable firmness that deserts should be a matter of the will,
   whether in bliss or torment, reward or punishment. Love itself is a
   great will to serve God, a sweet desire to please God, and a fervent
   wish to experience God. What is more, to be tempted is not a sin, but
   the opportunity for exercising virtue, so that temptation can be
   greatly to a man's benefit, since it is held that the whole of a man's
   life on earth is a testing. (Job 7.1)
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

    How powerful the love of God is

   All that is said above and whatever is necessary for salvation cannot
   be better, more immediately and more securely achieved than by love,
   through which whatever is lacking of what is necessary for salvation
   can be made good. In love we possess the fullness of all good and the
   realisation of our highest longing is not denied us. After all it is
   love alone by which we turn back to God, are changed into God, cleave
   to God, and are united to God in such a way that we become one spirit
   with him, and are by him and through him made blessed here by grace and
   hereafter in glory. Now love is such that it cannot rest except in the
   beloved, but it does when it wins the beloved in full and peaceful
   possession. For love, which itself is charity, is the way of God to men
   and the way of man to God. God cannot house where there is no love. So
   if we have love, we have God, for God is love. Furthermore nothing is
   sharper than love, nothing is more subtle, nothing more penetrating. It
   will not rest until it has by its very nature penetrated the whole
   power, the depth and the totality of the loved one. It wants to make
   itself one with the beloved, and itself, if it were possible, to be
   what the beloved is too. Thus it cannot bear that anything should stand
   between itself and the beloved object, which is God, but presses
   eagerly towards him. As a result it never rests until it has left
   everything else behind and come to him alone. For the nature of love is
   of a unitive and transforming power which transforms the lover into
   what he loves, or alternatively, makes the lover one with the other,
   and vice versa, in so far as is possible. This is manifest in the first
   place with regard to the mental powers, depending on how much the
   beloved is in the lover, in other words depending on how sweetly and
   delightfully the beloved is recalled in the mind of the lover, and in
   direct proportion, that is, with how much the lover strives to grasp
   all the things that relate to the beloved not just superficially but
   intimately, and to enter, as it were, into his innermost secrets. It is
   also manifest with regard to the emotional and affective powers when
   the beloved is said to be in the lover, in other words when the desire
   to please the beloved is found in the will and established within by
   the happy enjoyment of him. Alternatively, the lover is in the beloved
   when he is united with him by all his desire and compliance in
   agreement with the beloved's willing and not willing, and finds his own
   pleasure and pain in that of the beloved. For love draws the lover out
   of himself (since love is strong as death), and establishes him in the
   beloved, causing him to cleave closely to him. For the soul is more
   where it loves than where it lives, since it is in what it loves in
   accordance with its very nature, understanding and will, while it is in
   where it lives only with regard to form, which is even true for animals
   as well. There is nothing therefore which draws us away from the
   exterior senses to within ourselves, and from there to Jesus Christ and
   things divine, more than the love of Christ and the desire for the
   sweetness of Christ, for the experience, awareness and enjoyment of the
   presence of Christ's divinity. For there is nothing but the power of
   love which can lead the soul from the things of earth to the lofty
   summit of heaven. Nor can anyone attain the supreme beatitude unless
   summoned to it by love and yearning. Love after all is the life of the
   soul, the wedding garment and the soul's perfection, containing all the
   law and the prophets and our Lord's teaching. That is why Paul says to
   the Romans, Love is the fulfilling of the law, (Rom. 13.8) and in the
   first letter to Timothy, The end of the commandment is love. (1 Timothy
   1.5)

  Chapter 13

    The nature and value of prayer, and how the heart should be recollected
    within itself

   Besides this, since we are incapable of ourselves for this and for any
   other good action whatsoever, and since we can of ourselves offer
   nothing to the Lord God (from whom all good things come) which is not
   his already, with this one exception, as he has deigned to show us both
   by his own blessed mouth as well as by his example, that we should turn
   to him in all circumstances and occasions as guilty, wretched, poor,
   beggarly, weak, helpless, subject servants and sons. And that we should
   beseech him and lay before him with complete confidence the dangers
   that are besetting us on all sides, completely grief-stricken in
   ourselves, in humble prostration of mind, in fear and love, and with
   recollected, composed, mature, true and naked, shamefaced affection,
   with great yearning and determination, and in groaning of heart and
   sincerity of mind. Thus we commit and offer ourselves up to him freely,
   securely and nakedly, fully and in everything that is ours, holding
   nothing back to ourselves, in such a complete and final way, that the
   same is fulfilled in us as in our blessed father Isaac, who speaks of
   this very type of prayer, saying, Then we shall be one in God, and the
   Lord God will be all in all and alone in us when his own perfect love,
   with which he first loved us, will have become the disposition of our
   own hearts too. This will come about when all our love, all our desire,
   all our concern, all our efforts, in fact everything we think,
   everything we see, speak and even hope will be God, and that unity
   which now is of the Father with the Son, and of the Son with the
   Father, will be poured into our own heart and mind as well, in such a
   way that just as he loves us with sincere and indissoluble love we too
   will be joined to him with eternal and inseparable affection. In other
   words we shall be united with him in such a way that whatever we hope,
   and whatever we say or pray will be God. This therefore should be the
   aim, this the concern and goal of a spiritual man - to be worthy to
   possess the image of future bliss in this corruptible body, and in a
   certain measure experience in advance how the foretaste of that
   heavenly bliss, eternal life and glory begins in this world. This, as I
   say, is the goal of all perfection, that his purified mind should be
   daily raised up from all bodily objects to spiritual things until all
   his mental activity and all his heart's desire become one unbroken
   prayer. So the mind must abandon the dregs of earth and press on
   towards to God, on whom alone should be fixed the desire of a spiritual
   man, for whom the least separation from that summum bonum is to be
   considered a living death and dreadful loss. Then, when the requisite
   peace has been established in his mind, when it is free from attachment
   to any carnal passion, and clings firmly in intention to that one
   supreme good, the Apostle's sayings are fulfilled, Pray without
   ceasing, (1 Thessalonians 5.17) and, Pray in every place lifting up
   pure hands without anger or dispute. (1 Timothy 2.8) For when the power
   of the mind is absorbed in this purity, so to speak, and is transformed
   from an earthly nature into the spiritual or angelic likeness, whatever
   it receives into itself, whatever it is occupied with, whatever it is
   doing, it will be pure and sincere prayer. In this way, if you continue
   all the time in the way we have described from the beginning, it will
   become as easy and clear for you to remain in contemplation in your
   inward and recollected state, as to live in the natural state.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

    That we should seek the verdict of our conscience in every decision

   While we should strive for spiritual perfection of mind, purity and
   peace in God, it will be found to be not a little beneficial to this
   that we should return quietly into the inner secret place of the mind
   in the face of everything said, thought or done to us. There, withdrawn
   from everything else and completely recollected within ourselves, we
   can place ourselves in the knowledge of the truth before us and
   undoubtedly discover and understand that it does us absolutely no good,
   and rather the contrary, when we are praised or honoured by others
   while we recognise by the knowledge of the truth about ourselves within
   that we are blameworthy and guilty. And just as nothing is any help if
   externally people praise someone if his conscience internally accuses
   him, in the same way on the contrary it does a man no harm to be
   despised, maligned and persecuted when he remains internally just as
   innocent, blameless and without fault. On the contrary he has all the
   more good reason to rejoice in the Lord with patience, in peace and
   silence. After all no adversity can do any harm where evil is not in
   control, and just as no evil goes unpunished, so no good goes
   unrewarded. Nor should we wish a reward with hypocrites or expect and
   receive profit from men, but from the Lord God alone, not in the
   present, but in the future, and not in fleeting time, but in eternity.
   It is clear therefore that nothing is greater, and nothing better than
   to enter into the inner secret place of the mind always and in every
   tribulation and occurrence, and there to call upon the Lord Jesus
   Christ himself, our helper in temptations and tribulations, and to
   humble ourselves there by confession of sin, and praise God and Father
   himself, the giver of correction and the giver of consolation. Above
   all one should accept everything, in general and individually, in
   oneself or in others, agreeable or disagreeable, with a prompt and
   confident spirit, as coming from the hand of his infallible Providence
   or the order he has arranged. This attitude will lead to the
   forgiveness of our sins, the deliverance from bitterness, the enjoyment
   of joy and security, the outpouring of grace and mercy, introduction
   and establishment into a close relationship with God, abundant
   enjoyment of his presence, and firm cleaving and union with him. But
   let us not copy those who from hypocrisy and Pharisaism want to appear
   better and different from what they are, and to make a better
   impression and appearance before men of being something special, than
   they know in truth inside to be so. For it is absolute madness to seek,
   hunger for and aspire to human praise or renown, from oneself or
   others, when one is in spite of it all inwardly full of cravings and
   serious faults. And certainly the good things we have talked about
   above will flee him who chases such vanities, and he will merely bring
   disgrace on himself. So always keep your faults and your own incapacity
   before your eyes, and know yourself, so that you can be humbled and not
   try to avoid being held as the lowest, vilest and most abject scum by
   everyone when you are aware of the grave sins and serious faults in
   yourself. For which reason consider yourself compared to others as
   dross to gold, weeds to the wheat, chaff to the grain, a wolf to the
   sheep, Satan to the children of God. And do not seek to be respected by
   others and given precedence before others, but rather flee with all
   your heart and soul the poison of this disease, the venom of praise,
   the concern for boasting and vanity, lest, as the prophet says, The
   wicked is praised in his own heart's desires, (Psalm 10.4) and Isaiah,
   They who speak good of you, deceive you and destroy the way of your
   feet, (Isaiah 3.12) and the Lord in Luke, Woe to you when men speak
   well of you! (Luke 6.26).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

    How contempt of himself can be produced in a man, and how useful it is

   Furthermore the more a man recognises his own insignificance, the more
   he fully and the more clearly he becomes aware to the divine majesty,
   and the more a man is low in his own eyes for the sake of God, the
   truth and justice, the more precious he is in the eyes of God. For this
   reason let us strive with the whole strength of our desire to consider
   ourselves the lowest of all and to consider ourselves unworthy of any
   favour. We should strive to be displeasing to ourselves and pleasing
   only to God, while regarded as low and unworthy of consideration by
   others. Above all not to be moved by difficulties, afflictions and
   insults, and not to be upset by those who inflict such things on us, or
   entertain evil thoughts against them or be indignant, but to believe
   steadfastly and with equanimity in all insults, slights, blows and
   dereliction that it is only appropriate. For in truth he who is really
   penitent and grieving before God hates to be honoured and loved by all,
   and does not try to manipulate things so as to avoid being to some
   degree hated, neglected and despised right to the end, so that he can
   be truly humbled and sincerely cleave to God alone with a pure heart.
   Indeed, for loving God alone and hating oneself more than anything, and
   desiring to be despised by others we do not require external work or
   physical strength, but rather physical solitude, the labour of the
   heart, and peace of mind so that, as it were, by labour of the heart
   and the disposition of the inmost mind, one may rise up, casting off
   from oneself lower and physical things, and so soar up, ascending to
   things heavenly and divine. For indeed in so doing we are changed into
   God, and this will especially take place when without judgement,
   condemnation or contempt of our neighbour, we choose rather to be
   considered as scum and a disgrace by everyone and to be despised as
   unclean filth by everyone than to experience all sorts of different
   delicacies or to be honoured and exalted by men, or enjoy all sorts of
   transitory physical forms of well-being and comfort. We should not
   desire any pleasure of this present, mortal and physical life but
   rather to mourn, bewail and lament our offences, faults and sins
   without ceasing, and to perfectly despise and annihilate ourselves, and
   from day to day to be considered more and more abject by others, while
   in all our insignificance we become worthless even in our own eyes, so
   that we can be pleasing to God alone, love him alone, and cleave to him
   alone. We should not wish to be concerned about anything except the
   Lord Jesus Christ himself who alone should reside in our affections,
   and we should not be concerned or anxious about anything except him on
   whose dominion and providence everything in general and individually
   depends. So from now on it should not be your aim to seek enjoyment but
   to truly mourn with all your heart. For that reason, if you do not
   mourn, mourn for that, while if you do mourn, mourn especially that you
   have brought the cause of your pain on yourself by your own great
   offences and infinite sins. For just as a condemned man on receiving
   his sentence does not concern himself about the seating of the
   spectators, so he who laments and is genuinely mourning is not
   interested in pleasures, resentment, fame or wrongs or things of that
   sort. And just as townsfolk and contemned criminals have different
   accommodation, the state and position of those who are mourning and
   have committed offences deserving punishment ought to be completely
   different from those who are innocent and under no obligation.
   Otherwise there would be no difference between the guilty and the
   innocent in matters of punishment and reward. The result would be great
   dereliction of duty, and evil behaviour would have more freedom than
   goodness. So everything must be renounced, everything despised,
   everything rejected and avoided, so that we can lay a firm foundation
   of penitent grieving. Then, loving Jesus Christ in reality, yearning
   for him, and holding him in one's heart, in reality experiencing pain
   for one's sins and faults, in reality seeking to know the coming
   Kingdom, while with true faith bearing in mind the reality of the
   torments and eternal judgement, and firmly and fully taking up the
   recollection and fear of one's own death, we should be aware of nothing
   else, and not care or be worried about anything else. For that reason,
   he who hurries towards the blessed state of impassibility and towards
   God should reckon himself to have experienced great loss every day that
   he is not insulted and despised. Impassibility after all is freedom
   from vices and passions and purity of heart and the adornment of all
   virtues. So consider yourself as already dead since there is no doubt
   that you have got to die. And as a final thought let this be the test
   for you of whether any thought, word or action of yours is of God,
   whether you are made more humble because of it, more inward and more
   recollected and established in God. If you find it is otherwise in
   yourself, you should be suspicious about it, whether it be not
   according to God, unacceptable to you and not to your benefit.

  Chapter 16

    How God's Providence includes everything

   Certainly if we are to come directly, safely and nakedly to our Lord
   God without hindrance, freely and peacefully, as explained above, and
   be securely joined to him with even mind in prosperity or adversity,
   whether in life or in death, then our job is to commit everything
   unhesitatingly and resolutely, in general and individually, to his
   unquestionable and infallible providence. This is hardly surprising
   since it is he alone who gives to all things their being, their
   capacity and their action - that is, their strength, operation, nature,
   manner and order in number, weight and measure. Especially since just
   as a work of art presupposes a prior operation of nature, in the same
   way the operation of nature presupposes the work of God, creating,
   sustaining, ordering and administering it, for to him alone belong
   infinite power, wisdom, goodness and inherent mercy, justice, truth,
   love, and unchanging timelessness and omnipresence. So nothing can
   exist or act by its own power unless it acts in the power of God
   himself, who is the prime mover and the first principle, who is the
   cause of every action, and the actor in every agent. For so far as the
   nature of the order of things is concerned, God provides for everything
   without intermediary right down to the last detail. So nothing, from
   the greatest to the smallest things, can escape God's eternal
   providence, or fall away from it, whether in matters of the will, of
   causal events, or even of accidental circumstances outside of one's
   control. But God cannot do anything which does not fall under the order
   of his own providence, just as he cannot do anything which is not
   subject to its operation. Divine providence therefore extends to
   everything, in general and in particular, even including a man's
   thoughts. On which subject Scripture has this to say, Cast all your
   worries upon him, for he takes care of you. (1 Peter 5.7) And again the
   prophet says, Cast your care upon the Lord, and he will feed you.
   (Psalm 55.22) And, Look at the nations of men, my son, and see that no
   one ever put his trust in the Lord, and was disappointed. For who has
   been faithful to his commandments and been abandoned? (Sirach 2.22) And
   our Lord himself said, Do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat?
   (Matthew 6.25) So whatever and however much we can hope from God, we
   shall undoubtedly receive, as Deuteronomy says, Every place where you
   feet tread shall be yours. (Deuteronomy 11.24) For a man shall receive
   all that he is able to desire, and so far as he can reach with his foot
   of faith, even so much shall he possess. That is why Bernard says,
   "God, the maker of everything is so abounding in mercy that whatever
   size grace cup of faith we are able to hold out to him, we shall
   undoubtedly have it filled." And so Mark has it, All that you ask in
   prayer believing that you will receive it, will be given you. (Mark
   11.24) So the stronger and the more vehement our faith in God is, and
   the more reverently and persistently it is offered up to God, the more
   surely, the more abundantly and the quicker what we hoped for will be
   accomplished and obtained. Indeed if in doing this our faith in God is
   weak and slow to rise to God on account of the multitude and magnitude
   of our sins, we should remember this, that everything is possible with
   God, and that what he wishes is bound to take place, while what he does
   not wish cannot possibly happen, and that it is as easy for him to
   forgive and cancel countless sins, however enormous, as to do it with a
   single sin. While a sinner cannot, of himself, rise from innumerable
   sins, and free and absolve himself from them, and not even from just
   one sin. For we are unable not only to do, but even to think anything
   good, of ourselves, but this is from God. Nonetheless it is much more
   dangerous, other things being equal, to be ensnared in many sins than
   in a single one, since no sin is left unpunished, and every mortal sin
   deserves infinite punishment, and this by the rigour of justice since
   any such sin is against God who is indeed worthy of infinite reverence,
   dignity and honour. What is more, according to the Apostle Paul, God
   knows his own (2 Timothy 2.19), and it is impossible for any of them to
   perish by the whirlwinds and floods of any error, scandal, schism,
   persecution, heresy, tribulation, adversity or temptation, for he has
   foreseen from eternity and unchangeably the number of his elect and the
   extent of their merits in such a way that everything good and bad, what
   is theirs and not theirs, prosperity and adversity, all work together
   for them for good, except indeed that they appear even more glorious
   and commendable in adversity. So let us commit everything with full
   assurance, in general and in particular, confidently and unhesitatingly
   to divine providence, by which God permits however much and whatever
   sort of evil to happen to us. For it is good and will lead to good,
   since he permits it to exist, and it would not exist unless he
   permitted it to exist. Nor could it exist otherwise or more than he
   permits it to, because he knows how to, has the power to, and wills to
   change and convert it into something better. For just as it is by
   operation of providence that all good things exist, so it is by its
   permission that all bad things are changed into good. In this way in
   fact God's power, wisdom and mercy are shown forth through Christ our
   redeemer - his mercy and his justice, the power of grace and the
   weakness of nature, the beauty of everything in the association of
   opposites, the approval of the good, and the malice and punishment of
   the wicked. Similarly the contrition of the converted sinner, his
   confession, and penitence, the kindness of God, piety, charity and his
   praise and goodness (all show forth God's power and wisdom). Yet it
   does not always lead to good in those who do ill, but, as is usually
   the case, to great danger and extreme evil, in the loss, that is, of
   grace and their place in glory, and in the incurring of guilt and
   punishment, sometimes even eternal punishment, from which may Jesus
   Christ defend us. Amen.
