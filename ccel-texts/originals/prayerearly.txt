Preface

   Demand for books of prayers has caused this book to be compiled. The
   experience of The Upper Room in publishing Ralph S. Cushman's A Pocket
   Book of Prayer with its sale of over a million copies and the reaction
   from the publication of other prayer books have prompted the editor to
   collect and arrange these prayers. There are prayers of our Lord, the
   apostles, the martyrs, and the saints covering the period of the Early
   Church from its beginning through the fifth century. There are some
   prayers from each of the first five centuries. The treasure house from
   which to choose is almost unlimited. It is a vast and fruitful field
   and anyone is amply rewarded who delves into it.

   The prayers have been selected primarily for their spiritual and
   devotional content. Many have been laid aside with regret that they
   could not be included in this book, but its compass in size is set and
   only so many can be used.

   The prayers are arranged chronologically. Some other method of
   arrangement might have been chosen but this seemed good in order to
   represent each century. There are questions about the date and
   authorship of the prayers. They are the same questions that arise in
   reference to the Books of the Bible.

   This book of prayers is published with the hope and prayer that it may
   have wide use. It has been prepared for individual and family
   devotions. It can be used with prayer groups in prayer meetings, for
   cells, and, of course, for the development of one's own personal
   spiritual life. The material is perfect for use in the devotional
   services of young people's groups, women's groups, and men's clubs. The
   prayers are excellent for insertion in church bulletins. Other ways
   will be found of making these great prayers usable.

   The prayers have been collected from many old books of prayers and
   devotional materials. The editor is deeply indebted to all those who
   have ploughed the field before. They have labored and we have entered
   into their labors. It has been a joy to search out the material, to
   arrange the prayers, to put them in order, and to index them under so
   many subjects.

  The Prayer of Simeon

   Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
   word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared
   before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the
   glory of thy people Israel. --Luke 2:29.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Magnificat

   And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath
   rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his
   handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me
   blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
   is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
   generation. He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
   proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty
   from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the
   hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. He hath
   holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy. --Luke 1:46-54.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane

   O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless
   not as I will, but as thou wilt. O my Father, if this cup may not pass
   away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. --Matt. 26:39, 42.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Jesus' High Priestly Prayer

   These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,
   Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
   glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he
   should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is
   life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus
   Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have
   finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father,
   glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with
   thee before the world was. I have manifested thy name unto the men
   which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest
   them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all
   things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have given unto
   them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and
   have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed
   that thou didst send me. --John 17:1-8.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Jesus Prays From the Cross

   Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. --Luke 23:34.

   Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit. --Luke 23:46.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Prayer of Stephen

   And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus,
   receive my spirit.

   And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this
   sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. --Acts
   7:59-60.
     __________________________________________________________________

  That Christ May Dwell in Your Hearts

   Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and
   love unto all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making
   mention of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding
   being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,
   and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and
   what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe,
   according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in
   Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right
   hand in the heavenly places.

   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would
   grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened
   with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in
   your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may
   be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length,
   and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth
   knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we
   ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be
   glory forever and ever. Amen. --Epistle to the Ephesians 1:15-20;
   3:14-21.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Friends and Relatives

   O God, the Father of glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom
   every family in heaven and earth is named, thou who hast set the
   solitary in families, grant to all members of this family and to all
   the members of our different families, that, according to the riches of
   thy glory, we may be strengthened with might by thy Spirit in the inner
   man; that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith; that we, being
   rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints
   what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the
   love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that we may be filled with all
   the fulness of God; through the eternal Christ our Saviour. Amen.
   --Adapted: Ephesians 1:17; 3:15-19.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For a Knowledge of God's Will

   O Almighty God, we are confident of this very thing, that he which hath
   begun a good work in us, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
   we pray that our love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in
   all judgment; that we may approve things that are excellent; that we
   may be sincere and without offense, till the day of Christ, being
   filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ,
   unto the glory and praise of God. Amen. --Adapted: Philippians 1:6-11.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Persecuted for Righteousness' Sake

   O Lord, our heavenly Father, grant to thy children who are persecuted
   for righteousness' sake that our conversation may be as becometh the
   Gospel of Christ; that we may stand fast in one spirit, with one mind
   striving together for the faith of the Gospel; that in nothing
   terrified by our adversaries we may be steadfast in behalf of Christ,
   not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake, who liveth
   forever and ever. Amen. --Adapted: Philippians 1:27-29.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Spiritual Desires

   Our Father, we most humbly beseech Thee to give unto this house, and
   unto each member of it in particular, to stand fast in the Lord. May we
   be of the same mind in the Lord. May we rejoice in the Lord alway.
   Grant that whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
   whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
   things are lovely, if there be any praise, may we think on these
   things, may we know both how to be abased, and how to abound. May we do
   all things through Christ which strengtheneth us, knowing that God
   shall supply all our need according to his riches in glory by Christ
   Jesus. Amen. --Adapted: Philippians 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Patience and Longsuffering

   For this cause we also, ... do not cease to pray for you, and to desire
   that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
   and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto
   all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the
   knowledge of God; strengthened with all might according to his glorious
   power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; giving
   thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the
   power of darkness, and hath translated us unto the kingdom of his dear
   Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
   of sins.

   Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
   --Adapted: Epistles to the Colossians 1:9-14 and Philippians 4:20.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Begotten to a Lively Hope

   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
   to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
   incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in
   heaven for us. Keep us by the power of God through faith unto
   salvation; that the trial of our faith, being much more precious than
   of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found
   unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
   Amen. --Adapted: First Peter 1:3-7.

2. Other First Century Prayers
     __________________________________________________________________

  For All Kings and Rulers

   Grant unto all Kings and Rulers, O Lord, health, peace, concord, and
   stability, that they may administer the government which Thou hast
   given them without failure. For Thou, O heavenly Master, King of the
   Ages, givest to the sons of men glory and honour, and power over all
   things that are upon the earth. Do Thou, Lord, direct their counsel
   according to that which is good and well pleasing in Thy sight, that
   administering in peace and gentleness, with godliness, the power which
   Thou hast given them, they may obtain Thy favour. O Thou Who alone art
   able to do these things, and things far more exceeding good than these,
   for us, we praise Thee, through the High Priest and Guardian of our
   souls, Jesus Christ; through Whom be the glory and the majesty, unto
   Thee, both now and for all generations, and forever and ever. Amen.
   --Clement of Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Morning Prayer

   O God, Who art the unsearchable abyss of peace, the ineffable sea of
   love, the fountain of blessings, and the bestower of affection, Who
   sendest peace to those that receive it; open to us this day the sea of
   Thy love, and water us with the plenteous streams from the riches of
   Thy grace. Make us children of quietness, and heirs of peace. Enkindle
   in us the fire of Thy love; sow in us Thy fear; strengthen our weakness
   by Thy power; bind us closely to Thee and to each other in one firm
   bond of unity; for the sake of Jesus Christ. Amen. --Syrian Clementine
   Liturgy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Rulers and Governors

   To our rulers and governors on the earth--to them Thou, Lord, gavest
   the power of the kingdom by Thy glorious and ineffable might, to the
   end that we may know the glory and honour given to them by Thee and be
   subject to them, in nought resisting Thy will; to them, Lord, give
   health, peace, concord, stability, that they may exercise the authority
   given to them without offence. For Thou, O heavenly Lord and King
   eternal, givest to the sons of men glory and honour and power over the
   things that are on the earth; do Thou, Lord, direct their counsel
   according to that which is good and well-pleasing in Thy sight, that,
   devoutly in peace and meekness exercising the power given them by Thee,
   they may find Thee propitious. O Thou, who only hast power to do these
   things and more abundant good with us, we praise Thee through the High
   Priest and Guardian of our souls Jesus Christ, through whom be glory
   and majesty to Thee both now and from generation to generation and
   forevermore. Amen. --Clement of Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Blessings

   May God, who seeth all things, and who is the Ruler of all spirits and
   the Lord of all flesh--who chose our Lord Jesus Christ and us through
   Him to be a peculiar people--grant to every soul that calleth upon His
   glorious and holy Name, faith, peace, patience, long-suffering,
   self-control, purity, and sobriety, to the well-pleasing of His Name,
   through our High Priest and Protector, Jesus Christ, by whom be to Him
   glory, and majesty, and power, and honour, both now and forevermore.
   Amen. --Clement of Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Forgiveness

   Thou didst make to appear the enduring fabric of the world by the works
   of Thy hand; Thou, Lord, didst create the earth on which we
   dwell,--Thou, who art faithful in all generations, just in judgments,
   wonderful in strength and majesty, with wisdom creating and with
   understanding fixing the things which were made, who art good among
   them that are being saved and faithful among them whose trust is in
   Thee; O merciful and Compassionate One, forgive us our iniquities and
   offences and transgressions and trespasses. Reckon not every sin of Thy
   servants and handmaids, but Thou wilt purify us with the purification
   of Thy truth; and direct our steps that we may walk in holiness of
   heart and do what is good and well-pleasing in Thy sight and in the
   sight of our rulers. Yea, Lord, make Thy face to shine upon us for good
   in peace, that we may be shielded by Thy mighty hand and delivered from
   every sin by Thine uplifted arm, and deliver us from those who hate us
   wrongfully. Give concord and peace to us and all who dwell upon the
   earth, even as Thou gavest to our fathers, when they called upon Thee
   in faith and truth, submissive as we are to Thine almighty and
   all-excellent Name. Amen. --Clement of Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Prayer Before Partaking of the Holy Sacrament

   O God, who art great, great in name and counsel, powerful in Thy works,
   the God and Father of Thy Holy Son Jesus, our Saviour, look upon us,
   Thy flock, which Thou hast chosen through Him to the glory of Thy Name;
   sanctify us in body and soul, and grant that we, being purified from
   all filthiness of flesh and spirit, may partake of the mystic blessings
   now going before Thee, and judge none of us unworthy of them, but be
   Thou our Supporter, our Helper, and Defender, through Thy Christ, with
   whom glory, honour, laud, praise, thanksgiving, be to Thee and the Holy
   Ghost forever. Amen. --The Clementine Liturgy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Pure Heart

   O God Almighty, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Thine only begotten
   Son, give me a body unstained, a pure heart, a watchful mind, and an
   upright understanding, and the presence of Thy Holy Spirit, that I may
   obtain and ever hold fast to an unshaken faith in Thy Truth, through
   Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord; through whom be glory to Thee in the
   Holy Ghost, forever and ever. Amen. --The Clementine Liturgy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Joy and Gladness

   Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hast nourished me from my youth up, who
   givest food to all flesh. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that
   we, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every
   good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom to Thee be glory,
   honour, might, majesty, and dominion, forever and ever. Amen. --The
   Clementine Liturgy.

SECOND CENTURY PRAYERS
     __________________________________________________________________

  Intercession

   May God the Father, and the Eternal High Priest Jesus Christ, build us
   up in faith and truth and love, and grant to us our portion among the
   saints with all those who believe on our Lord Jesus Christ. We pray for
   all saints, for kings and rulers, for the enemies of the Cross of
   Christ, and for ourselves we pray that our fruit may abound and we may
   be made perfect in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. --Polycarp.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Dying Prayer of Polycarp, the Martyr

   O Father of Thy well-beloved and blessed Son Jesus Christ, through whom
   we have known Thee; O God of the angels and powers and of every living
   creature, and of all sorts of just men which live in Thy presence, I
   thank Thee that Thou hast graciously vouchsafed this day and this hour
   to allot me a portion among the number of martyrs, among the people of
   Christ unto the resurrection of the everlasting life, both of body and
   soul, in the incorruption of the Holy Ghost; among whom I shall be
   received in Thy sight this day, as a fruitful and acceptable sacrifice,
   as Thou hast heretofore prepared, often revealed and now fulfilled,
   most faithful God who canst not lie. Wherefore for all things I praise
   Thee, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee, through the everlasting High
   Priest, Jesus Christ, Thy well-beloved Son, to whom with Thee and the
   Holy Ghost, be all glory, world without end. Amen. --The Martyrdom of
   Polycarp.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Prayer for the Privilege of Martyrdom

   Ask for me this only in your prayers, that strength may be given me of
   the Lord that I may not be called but proved to be a Christian. Then
   shall I be seen to be faithful when the world no longer sees me. For
   nothing that appeareth is eternal. For the things which are perceived
   are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. I write to
   the Churches and charge you all that willingly I die for Christ, if you
   prevent me not. I ask of you that your love for me be not untimely;
   allow me to be devoured of wild beasts, through whom I may attain unto
   God. I am the grain of God ground between the teeth of wild beasts,
   that I may be found to be the pure bread of Christ. Then indeed shall I
   be the true disciple of Christ when the world shall no longer behold my
   body. Beseech Christ on my behalf that through these means I may be
   found a perfect sacrifice. Not as Peter and Paul do I command you. They
   were apostles, I am the least of them; they were free, but I am a slave
   even unto this day, but, if you wish, I shall be the freedman of Jesus
   Christ, and in Him I shall rise again and be free. Amen. --Ignatius.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Soul Cleansing

   O God, who hast taught us Thy divine and saving oracles, enlighten the
   souls of us sinners for the comprehension of the things which have been
   before spoken, so that we may not only be seen to be hearers of
   spiritual things, but also doers of good deeds, striving after
   guileless faith, blameless life, and pure conversation.

   Release, pardon, and forgive, O God, all our voluntary and involuntary
   sins, such as we have committed in action and in word, knowingly and
   ignorantly, by night and by day, in mind and thought, forgive us all in
   goodness and love.

   Sanctify, O Lord, our souls, bodies and spirits; examine our minds and
   search our consciences; take from us all evil imaginations, all
   impurity of thought, all inclinations to lust, all depravity of
   conception, all envy, pride and hypocrisy, all falsehood, deceit and
   irregular living, all covetousness, vain glory and sloth; all malice,
   anger and wrath, all remembrance of injuries, all blasphemy and every
   motion of flesh and spirit that is contrary to the purity of Thy Will.
   Amen. --Liturgy of St. James.
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Witness for Christ

   Grant, O merciful God, that as Thy holy Apostle St. James, leaving his
   father and all that he had, without delay, was obedient to the call of
   Thy son Jesus Christ, and followed Him, and at last cheerfully laid
   down his life for His gospel's sake, so I, forsaking all worldly and
   carnal affections, may be evermore ready to follow Thy holy
   commandments, and, whenever Thy providence shall make it my duty, may
   readily and cheerfully embrace death, though armed with his utmost
   terror, rather than forsake or deny Thee. Let me rejoice in every happy
   occasion of testifying the sincerity of my love, by suffering for Thy
   truth, and let the firm belief of those glorious eternal rewards which
   Thou hast prepared for them who lay down their lives for Thy sake,
   support me under all the cruelties of the most merciless persecutors.
   Grant this, O blessed Lord, who didst die for me, and didst rise again,
   and now sittest at the right hand of the Father, to intercede for me,
   and all Thy faithful disciples. Amen. --Liturgy of St. James.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For a Pure Heart

   O God, the Father of our Saviour Jesus Christ, whose name is great,
   whose nature is blissful, whose goodness is inexhaustible, God and
   Ruler of all things, who art blessed forever; before whom stand
   thousands and thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand, the hosts
   of holy angels and archangels; sanctify, O Lord, our souls and bodies
   and spirits, search our consciences, and cast out of us every evil
   thought, every base desire, all envy and pride, all wrath and anger,
   and all that is contrary to Thy holy will. And grant us, O Lord, Lover
   of men, with a pure heart and contrite soul, to call upon Thee, our
   holy God and Father who art in heaven. Amen. --Liturgy of St. James.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Sanctify Us, O Lord

   God and Father of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, the
   glorious Lord, the blessed essence, the bounteous goodness, the God and
   Sovereign of all, who art blessed to all eternity, who sittest upon the
   cherubim, and art glorified by the seraphim, before whom stand thousand
   thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand hosts of angels and
   archangels: Thou hast accepted the gifts, offerings, and fruits brought
   unto Thee as an odour of a sweet spiritual smell, and hast been pleased
   to sanctify them, and make them perfect, O good One, by the grace of
   Thy Christ, and by the presence of Thy all-holy Spirit.

   Sanctify also, O Lord, our souls, and bodies, and spirits, and touch
   our understandings, and search our consciences, and cast out from us
   every evil imagination, every impure feeling, every base desire, every
   unbecoming thought, all envy, and vanity, and hypocrisy, all lying, all
   deceit, every worldly affection, all covetousness, all vainglory, all
   indifference, all vice, all passion, all anger, all malice, all
   blasphemy, every motion of the flesh and spirit that is not in
   accordance with Thy holy will: and count us worthy, O loving Lord, with
   boldness, without condemnation, in a pure heart, with a contrite
   spirit, with unshamed face, with sanctified lips, to dare to call upon
   Thee, the holy God, Father in heaven. Amen. --Liturgy of St. James.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Stewardship

   O Lord God Almighty, who hast built Thy Church upon the foundation of
   the Apostles, under Christ the head corner-stone, and to this end didst
   endue Thy holy apostle St. Barnabas with the singular gift of the Holy
   Ghost; leave me not destitute, I humbly beseech Thee, of Thy manifold
   gifts and talents, nor yet of grace to make a right use of them always
   without any sordid self-ends, to Thy honour and glory; that, making a
   due improvement of all those gifts Thou graciously entrustest me with,
   I may be able to give a good account of my stewardship when the great
   Judge shall appear, the Lord Jesus Christ, who reigneth with Thee and
   the Eternal Spirit, one God, blessed forever. Amen. --Barnabas.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Stewardship

   O Lord God Almighty, who didst endue Thy holy apostle Barnabas with
   singular gifts of the Holy Ghost; leave us not, we beseech Thee,
   destitute of Thy manifold gifts, nor yet of grace to use them always to
   Thy honour and glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Barnabas.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Prayer to the Teacher

   Be gracious, O Instructor, to us Thy children, Father, Charioteer of
   Israel, Son and Father, both in One, O Lord. Grant to us who obey Thy
   precepts, that we may perfect the likeness of the image, and with all
   our power know Him who is the good God and not a harsh judge. And do
   Thou Thyself cause that all of us who have our conversation in Thy
   peace, who have been translated into Thy commonwealth, having sailed
   tranquilly over the billows of sin, may be wafted in calm by Thy Holy
   Spirit, by the ineffable wisdom, by night and day to the perfect day;
   and giving thanks may praise, and praising thank the Alone Father and
   Son, Son and Father, the Son, Instructor and Teacher, with the Holy
   Spirit, all in One, in whom is all, for whom all is One, for whom is

   All-good, All-lovely, All-wise, All-just One. To whom be glory both now
   and forever. Amen. --Clement of Alexandria.

  For Growth in Grace

   Give perfection to beginners, O Father; give intelligence to the little
   ones; give aid to those who are running their course. Give sorrow to
   the negligent; give fervour of spirit to the lukewarm. Give to the
   perfect a good consummation; for the sake of Christ Jesus our Lord.
   Amen. --Irenaeus, Old Gallican Sacramentary.

   graciously bestowed upon us freedom from slavery, who hast scattered
   the darkness of sin within us, through the presence of Thine
   only-begotten Son, do Thou now also, through the visitation of Thy

   who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
   done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And

  For Divine Strength

   O mightiest King, co-eternal with the Father, who by Thy might hast

   man, and by Thy miraculous power and the enlightening radiance of Thy
   unspeakable Godhead hast raised Adam from the tomb, send forth Thy
   invisible right hand, which is full of blessing, and bless us all.

   We give Thee thanks--yea, more than thanks O Lord our God, for all Thy
   goodness at all times, and in all places, because Thou hast shielded,
   rescued, helped, and guided us all the days of our lives, and brought
   us unto this hour. We pray and beseech Thee, merciful God, to grant in
   Thy goodness that we may spend this day, and all the time of our lives,
   without sin, in fullness of joy, holiness, and reverence of Thee. But
   drive away from us, O Lord, all envy, all fear, and all temptations.
   Bestow upon us what is good and meet. Whatever sin we commit in
   thought, word, or deed, do Thou in Thy goodness and mercy be pleased to
   pardon. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;
   through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only begotten Son. Amen.

   we pray and beseech Thee, O God and loving Lord, grant us to pass this
   day, this year, and all the time of our life without sin, with all joy,
   health, and salvation. But all envy, all fear, all temptation, all the

   Church. Supply us with things good and profitable. Whereinsoever we
   have sinned against Thee, in word, or deed, or thought, be Thou pleased
   in Thy love and goodness to forgive, and forsake us not, O God, who
   hope in Thee, neither lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the
   evil one and from his works; by the grace and compassion of Thine only
   begotten Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. --Liturgy of St. Mark.

   peace, a pure mind, a right and honest heart, a good will, a holy

   Thee. Let not our hearts turn away to words or thoughts of wickedness,
   but keep us from all things that might hurt us; for to Thee, O Lord,
   our eyes look up, and our hope is in Thee: confound us not, O our God;
   for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Eastern Church Vespers.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Ministers

   O God, great in power, unsearchable in understanding, wondrous in
   counsels towards the children of men, do Thou fill with the gift of Thy
   Holy Spirit those whom Thou dost will to undertake the degree of the
   priesthood that they may be worthy to stand before Thy holy altar
   unblamably, to announce the Gospel of Thy kingdom, to administer the
   Word of Thy Truth, to offer gifts and spiritual sacrifices unto Thee,
   and to renew Thy people in the laver of regeneration; that at the
   second coming of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Thine only
   begotten Son, they may go forth to meet Him, and by the multitude of
   Thy mercies receive their reward; for Thy venerable and majestic Name
   is blessed and glorified. Amen. --Eastern Church Liturgy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Illumination

   Shine into our hearts, O loving Master, by the pure light of the
   knowledge of Thyself, and open the eyes of our mind to the
   contemplation of Thy teaching, and put into us the fear of Thy blessed
   commandments; that trampling down all that is worldly, we may follow a
   spiritual life, thinking and doing all things according to Thy good
   pleasure. For Thou art our sanctification, and our illumination, and to
   Thee we render glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and
   unto ages of ages. Amen. --Eastern Church Liturgy.

  For Charity

   O God of love, Who hast given a new commandment through Thine only
   begotten Son, that we should love one another, even as Thou didst love
   us, the unworthy and the wandering, and gavest Thy beloved Son for our
   life and salvation; we pray Thee, Lord, give to us, Thy servants, in
   all time of our life on the earth, a mind forgetful of past ill-will, a
   pure conscience and sincere thoughts, and a heart to love our brethren;
   for the sake of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord and only Saviour. Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

  For Pardon

   O Lord, who hast mercy upon all, take away from me my sins, and
   mercifully kindle in me the fire of Thy Holy Spirit. Take away from me

   for Christ's sake. Amen. --Ambrose.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Merciful Lord, the Comforter and Teacher of Thy faithful people,

   with the eyes of faith, and patiently wait for, the light which as yet
   Thou dost not openly manifest; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
   --Ambrose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Salvation

   O God, Who didst look on man when he had fallen down into death, and
   resolve to redeem him by the advent of Thine only begotten Son; grant,
   we beseech Thee, that they who confess His glorious Incarnation may
   also be admitted to the fellowship of Him their Redeemer; through the
   same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Ambrose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Freedom From Sin

   O Lord, my Saviour, in whose power it is to remit sins, I beseech Thee
   say unto me, "Loose thee from thy chains, come out of the bonds of thy
   sins"; and when Thou sayest it, loose those cords of my errors
   wherewith I am entangled and bound; for, though I am the most wicked of
   all men, and to be abhorred by reason of my continuance in sins, yet
   when thou commandest, I shall be free from them. Amen. --Ambrose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Pardon

   Lord Jesus Christ, who didst stretch out Thine hands on the Cross, and
   redeem us by Thy Blood, forgive me, a sinner, for none of my thoughts
   are hid from Thee. Pardon I ask, pardon I hope for, pardon I trust to
   have. Thou who art pitiful and merciful, spare and forgive me. Amen.
   --Ambrose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Purity

   O Holy Spirit of God, very God, Who didst descend upon Christ at the
   River Jordan, and upon the Apostles in the upper chamber, we have
   sinned against heaven and before Thee; purify us again, we beseech
   Thee, with Thy Divine fire, and have mercy upon us; for Christ's sake.
   Amen. --Nerses of Clajes.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Confession of Sin

   O Thou that beholdest all things, we have sinned against Thee in

   life, for the sake of Christ Jesus our Saviour. Amen. --Nerses of
   Clajes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   from all evil, and have mercy upon us sinners. Amen. --Nerses of
   Clajes.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Prayer for Spiritual Blessings

   Most high God, our loving Father, infinite in majesty, we humbly
   beseech Thee for all Thy servants everywhere, that Thou wouldst give us
   a pure mind, perfect love, sincerity in conduct, purity in heart,
   strength in action, courage in distress, self-command in character. May
   our prayers ascend to Thy gracious ears, and Thy loving benediction
   descend upon us all, that we may in all things be protected under the
   shadow of Thy wings. Grant us pardon of our sins; perfect our work;
   accept our prayers; protect us by Thine own Name, O God of Jacob; send
   us Thy saving help from Thy holy place, and strengthen us out of Zion.
   Remember all Thy people everywhere, give us all the grace of devotion
   to Thy will; fulfill our desires with good gifts, and crown us with Thy
   mercy. When we serve Thee with faithful devotion, pardon our sins and
   correct us with Fatherly tenderness. Grant that, being delivered from
   all adversity, and both here and eternally justified, we may praise
   Thee forever and ever, saying Holy, Holy, Holy; through Jesus Christ
   our Lord and Saviour, Who with Thee and the Holy Ghost, liveth and
   reigneth, ever one God, world without end. Amen. --Gallican
   Sacramentary.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Those Gathered in Worship

   O Lord God, Who hast taught us to pray all together, and hast promised
   to hear the united voices of two or three invoking Thy Name; hear now,
   O Lord, the prayers of Thy servants unto their salvation, and give us
   in this world knowledge of Thy Truth, and in the world to come life
   everlasting; for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Armenian
   Liturgy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Right Blessings

   O Lord our God, teach us, we beseech Thee, to ask Thee aright for the
   right blessings. Steer Thou the vessel of our life toward Thyself, Thou
   tranquil Haven of all storm-tossed souls. Show us the course wherein we
   should go. Renew a willing spirit within us. Let Thy Spirit curb our
   wayward senses, and guide and enable us unto that which is our true
   good, to keep Thy laws, and in all our works evermore to rejoice in Thy
   glorious and gladdening Presence. For Thine is the glory and praise
   from all Thy saints forever and ever. Amen. --Basil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Converts in Mission Fields

   Remember, O Lord, all who in heathen lands are under instruction for
   Holy Baptism; have mercy upon them and confirm them in the faith;
   remove all the remains of idolatry and superstition from their hearts,
   that being devoted to Thy law, Thy precepts, Thy fear, Thy truths, and
   Thy commandments, they may grow to a firm knowledge of the word in
   which they have been instructed, and may be found worthy to be made an
   habitation of the Holy Ghost, by the laver of regeneration, for the
   remission of their sins, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Basil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Light and Guidance

   Eternal God, Thou uncreate and primal Light, Maker of all created
   things, Fountain of pity, Thou Sea of Bounty, fathomless deep of
   Loving-Kindness: lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us!
   Lord, shine in our hearts, true Sun of Righteousness, and fill our
   souls with Thy beauty.

   Teach us always to keep in mind Thy judgments, and to discourse of
   them, and own Thee continually as our Lord and Friend. Govern by Thy
   will the works of our hands; and lead us in the right way, that we may
   do what is well-pleasing and acceptable to Thee, that through us
   unworthy Thy holy name may be glorified.

   To Thee alone be praise and honor and worship eternally. Amen. --Basil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Two or Three

   Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time to make our common
   supplications unto Thee; and dost promise that when two or three are
   gathered together in Thy name Thou wilt grant their requests: fulfill
   now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of Thy servants, as may be most
   expedient for them, granting us in this world knowledge of Thy truth,
   and in the world to come, life everlasting. Amen. --Chrysostom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For All People

   Remember, O Lord, this city wherein we dwell and every other city and
   country, and all the faithful who dwell in them. Remember, O Lord, all
   who travel by land or water, all that labour under sickness or slavery;
   remember them for health and safety. Remember, O Lord, those in Thy
   Holy Church who bring forth good fruit, are rich in good works and
   forget not the poor. Grant unto us all Thy mercy and loving-kindness,
   and grant that we may with one mouth and one heart praise and glorify
   Thy great and glorious name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now,
   henceforth, and forever. Amen. --Chrysostom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Invocation

   Lord God, of might inconceivable, of glory incomprehensible, of mercy
   immeasurable, of benignity ineffable; do Thou, O Master, look down upon
   us in Thy tender love, and show forth, towards us and those who pray
   with us, Thy rich mercies and compassions. Amen. --Liturgy of St.
   Chrysostom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Refreshment

   O Lord our God, under the shadow of Thy wings let us hope. Thou wilt
   support us, both when little, and even to gray hairs. When our strength
   is of Thee, it is strength; but, when our own, it is feebleness. We
   return unto Thee, O Lord, that from their weariness our souls may rise
   towards Thee, leaning on the things which Thou hast created, and
   passing on to Thyself, who hast wonderfully made them; for with Thee is
   refreshment and true strength. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Adoration

   O Thou Good Omnipotent, Who so carest for every one of us, as if Thou
   caredst for him alone; and so for all, as if all were but one! Blessed
   is the man who loveth Thee, and his friend in Thee, and his enemy for
   Thee. For he only loses none dear to him, to whom all are dear in Him
   who cannot be lost. And who is that but our God, the God that made
   heaven and earth, and filleth them, even by filling them creating them.
   And Thy law is truth, and truth is Thyself. I behold how some things
   pass away that others may replace them, but Thou dost never depart, O
   God, my Father supremely good, Beauty of all things beautiful. To Thee
   will I intrust whatsoever I have received from Thee, so shall I lose
   nothing. Thou madest me for Thyself, and my heart is restless until it
   repose in Thee. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Holy Spirit

   O holy Spirit, Love of God, infuse Thy grace, and descend plentifully
   into my heart; enlighten the dark corners of this neglected dwelling,
   and scatter there Thy cheerful beams; dwell in that soul that longs to
   be Thy temple; water that barren soil, over-run with weeds and briars,
   and lost for want of cultivating, and make it fruitful with Thy dew
   from heaven. Oh come, Thou refreshment of them that languish and faint.
   Come, Thou Star and Guide of them that sail in the tempestuous sea of
   the world; Thou only Haven of the tossed and shipwrecked. Come, Thou
   Glory and Crown of the living, and only Safeguard of the dying. Come,
   Holy Spirit, in much mercy, and make me fit to receive Thee. Amen.
   --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Entire Love

   O Lord, my God, Light of the blind and Strength of the weak; yea, also,
   Light of those that see, and Strength of the strong; hearken unto my
   soul, and hear it crying out of the depths.

   O Lord, help us to turn and seek Thee; for Thou hast not forsaken Thy
   creatures as we have forsaken Thee, our Creator. Let us turn and seek
   Thee, for we know Thou art here in our hearts, when we confess to Thee,
   when we cast ourselves upon Thee, and weep in Thy bosom, after all our
   rugged ways; and Thou dost gently wipe away our tears, and we weep the
   more for joy; because Thou, Lord, who madest us dost remake and comfort
   us.

   Hear, Lord, my prayer, and grant that I may most entirely love Thee,
   and do Thou rescue me, O Lord, from every temptation, even unto the
   end. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Steadfastness

   O God, the light of every heart that sees Thee, the Life of every soul
   that loves Thee, the strength of every mind that seeks Thee, grant me
   ever to continue steadfast in Thy holy love. Be Thou the joy of my
   heart; take it all to Thyself, and therein abide. The house of my soul
   is, I confess, too narrow for Thee; do thou enlarge it, that Thou
   mayest enter in; it is ruinous, but do Thou repair it. It has that
   within which must offend Thine eyes; I confess and know it; but whose
   help shall I implore in cleansing it, but Thine alone? To Thee,
   therefore, I cry urgently, begging that Thou wilt cleanse me from my
   secret faults, and keep Thy servant from presumptuous sins, that they
   never get dominion over me. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Perseverance

   I know, O Lord, and do with all humility acknowledge myself an object
   altogether unworthy of Thy love; but sure I am, Thou art an object
   altogether worthy of mine. I am not good enough to serve Thee, but Thou
   hast a right to the best service I can pay. Do Thou then impart to me
   some of that excellence, and that shall supply my own want of worth.
   Help me to cease from sin according to Thy will, that I may be capable
   of doing Thee service according to my duty. Enable me so to guard and
   govern myself, so to begin and finish my course, that, when the race of
   life is run, I may sleep in peace, and rest in Thee. Be with me unto
   the end, that my sleep may be rest indeed, my rest perfect security,
   and that security a blessed eternity. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Mercy

   Come, O Lord, in much mercy down into my soul, and take possession and
   dwell there. A homely mansion, I confess, for so glorious a Majesty,
   but such as Thou art fitting up for the reception of Thee, by holy and
   fervent desires of Thine own inspiring. Enter then, and adorn, and make
   it such as Thou canst inhabit, since it is the work of Thy hands. Give
   me Thine own self, without which, though Thou shouldst give me all that
   ever Thou hast made, yet could not my desires be satisfied. Let my soul
   ever seek Thee, and let me persist in seeking, till I have found, and
   am in full possession of Thee. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Refuge and Peace

   O Thou full of compassion, I commit and commend myself unto Thee, in
   whom I am, and live, and know. Be Thou the Goal of my pilgrimage, and
   my Rest by the way. Let my soul take refuge from the crowding turmoil
   of worldly thoughts beneath the shadow of Thy wings; let my heart, this
   sea of restless waves, find peace in Thee, O God. Thou bounteous Giver
   of all good gifts, give to him who is weary refreshing food; gather our
   distracted thoughts and powers into harmony again; and set the prisoner
   free. See, he stands at thy door and knocks; be it open to him, that he
   may enter with a free step, and be quickened by Thee. For Thou art the
   Well-spring of Life, the Light of eternal Brightness, wherein the just
   live who love Thee. Be it unto me according to Thy word. Amen.
   --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Perfect Love

   Grant me, even me, my dearest Lord, to know Thee, and love Thee, and
   rejoice in Thee. And, if I cannot do these perfectly in this life, let
   me at least advance to higher degrees every day, till I can come to do
   them in perfection. Let the knowledge of Thee increase in me here, that
   it may be full hereafter. Let the love of Thee grow every day more and
   more here, that it may be perfect hereafter; that my joy may be great
   in itself, and full in Thee. I know, O God, that Thou art a God of
   truth, O make good Thy gracious promises to me, that my joy may be
   full. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Perfect Light

   O Thou holy and unspeakable, Thou wonderful and mighty God, whose power
   and wisdom hath no end, before whom all powers tremble, at whose glance
   the heavens and the earth flee away, Thou art Love, Thou art my Father,
   and I will love and worship Thee forever and ever!

   Thou hast deigned to show pity on me, and a ray from Thy light hath
   shone upon mine inward eye. Guide me on into the perfect light, that it
   may illumine me wholly, and that all darkness may flee away. Let the
   holy flame of Thy love so burn in my heart that it be made pure, and I
   may see Thee, O God; for it is the pure in heart who see Thee. Thou
   hast set me free; Thou hast drawn me to Thee; therefore forsake me not,
   but keep me always in Thy grace. Guide me, and rule me, and perfect me
   for Thy kingdom. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For More Love

   Thee, most merciful God, do I now invoke to descend into my soul, which
   Thou hast prepared for Thy reception by the desire which Thou hast
   breathed into it. Ere ever I cried to Thee, Thou, most Merciful, hadst
   called and sought me, that I might find Thee, and finding love Thee.
   Even so I sought and found Thee, Lord, and desire to love Thee.
   Increase my desire, and grant me what I ask. See, I love Thee, but too
   little; strengthen my love. When my spirit aspires to Thee, and
   meditates on Thine unspeakable goodness, the burden of the flesh
   becomes less heavy, the tumult of thought is stilled, the weight of
   mortality is less oppressive. Then fain would my soul find wings, that
   she might rise in tireless flight ever upwards to Thy glorious throne,
   and there be filled with the refreshing solace that belongs to the
   citizens of heaven. Amen. --Augustine.

  For Mercy and Grace

   O God, our true Life, in whom and by whom all things live, Thou
   commandest us to seek Thee, and art ready to be found; Thou biddest us
   knock, and openest when we do so. To know Thee is life, to serve Thee
   is freedom, to enjoy Thee is a kingdom, to praise Thee is the joy and
   happiness of the soul. I praise, and bless, and adore Thee, I worship
   Thee, I glorify Thee, I give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory. I
   humbly beseech Thee to abide with me, to reign in me, to make this
   heart of mine a holy temple, a fit habitation for Thy Divine majesty. O
   Thou Maker and Preserver of all things, visible and invisible! keep, I
   beseech Thee, the work of Thine own hands, who trusts in Thy mercy
   alone for safety and protection. Guard me with the power of Thy grace,
   here and in all places, now and at all times, forevermore. Amen.
   --Augustine.

  For a Safe Voyage

   Blessed are all Thy saints, my God and King, who have travelled over
   the tempestuous sea of mortality, and have at last made the desired
   port of peace and felicity. Oh, cast a gracious eye upon us who are
   still in our dangerous voyage. Remember and succor us in our distress,
   and think on them that lie exposed to the rough storms of troubles and
   temptations. Strengthen our weakness, that we may do valiantly in this
   spiritual war; help us against our own negligence and cowardice, and
   defend us from the treachery of our unfaithful hearts. We are exceeding
   frail, and indisposed to every virtuous and gallant undertaking. Grant,
   O Lord, that we may bring our vessel safe to shore, unto our desired
   haven. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Perfect Love

   Look upon us, O Lord, and let all the darkness of our souls vanish
   before the beams of Thy brightness. Fill us with holy love, and open to
   us the treasures of Thy wisdom. All our desire is known unto Thee,
   therefore perfect what Thou hast begun, and what Thy Spirit has
   awakened us to ask in prayer. We seek Thy face, turn Thy face unto us
   and show us Thy Glory. Then shall our longing be satisfied, and our
   peace shall be perfect. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Obedience and Love

   Thou, O Lord, who commandest me to ask, grant that I may receive; Thou
   hast put me upon seeking, let me be happy in finding; Thou hast bidden
   me knock, I pray Thee open unto me. Be graciously pleased to direct and
   govern all my thoughts and actions, that, for the future, I may serve
   Thee, and entirely devote myself to obeying Thee. Accept me, I beseech
   Thee, and draw me to Thyself, that I may henceforth be Thine by
   obedience and love, who am already all Thine own, as Thy creature. Even
   Thine, O Lord, who livest and reignest forever and ever. Amen.
   --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Light

   O God our Father, who dost exhort us to pray, and who dost grant what
   we ask, if only, when we ask, we live a better life; hear me, who am
   trembling in this darkness, and stretch forth Thy hand unto me; hold
   forth Thy light before me; recall me from my wanderings; and, Thou
   being my Guide, may I be restored to myself and to Thee, through Jesus
   Christ. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Illumination

   Late have I loved Thee, O Thou Eternal Truth and Goodness: late have I
   sought Thee, my Father! But Thou didst seek me, and when Thou shinedst
   forth upon me, then I knew Thee and learnt to love Thee. I thank Thee,
   O my Light, that Thou didst thus shine upon me; that Thou didst teach
   my soul what Thou wouldst be to me, and didst incline Thy face in pity
   unto me. Thou, Lord, hast become my Hope, my Comfort, my Strength, my
   All! In Thee doth my soul rejoice. The darkness vanished from before
   mine eyes, and I beheld Thee, the Son of Righteousness. When I loved
   darkness, I knew Thee not, but wandered on from night to night. But
   Thou didst lead me out of that blindness; Thou didst take me by the
   hand and call me to Thee, and now I can thank Thee, and Thy mighty
   voice which hath penetrated to my inmost heart. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Obligation to Others

   O Lord, our Saviour, who hast warned us that thou wilt require much of
   those to whom much is given; grant that we whose lot is cast in so
   goodly a heritage may strive together the more abundantly to extend to
   others what we so richly enjoy; and as we have entered into the labours
   of other men, so to labour that in their turn other men may enter into
   ours, to the fulfillment of Thy holy will; through Jesus Christ our
   Lord. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Refreshment

   O Holy Spirit, Love of God, infuse Thy grace, and descend plentifully
   into my heart; enlighten the dark corners of this neglected dwelling,
   and scatter there Thy cheerful beams; dwell in that soul that longs to
   be Thy temple; water that barren soil, over-run with weeds and briars,
   and lost for want of cultivating, and make it fruitful with Thy dew
   from heaven. Oh come, Thou refreshment of them that languish and faint.
   Come, Thou Star and Guide of them that sail in the tempestuous sea of
   the world; Thou only Haven of the tossed and ship-wrecked. Come, Thou
   Glory and Crown of the living, and only Safeguard of the dying. Come,
   Holy Spirit, in much mercy, and make me fit to receive Thee. Amen.
   --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Increased Godly Knowledge

   Grant us, even us, O Lord, to know Thee, and love Thee, and rejoice in
   Thee. And if we cannot do these perfectly in this life, let us, at
   least, advance to higher degrees every day, till we can come to do them
   in perfection. Let the knowledge of Thee increase in us here, that it
   may be full hereafter. Let the love of Thee grow every day more and
   more here, that it may be perfect hereafter; that our joy may be great
   in itself and full in Thee. We know, O God, that Thou art a God of
   truth, O make good Thy gracious promises to us, that our joy may be
   full. To Thine honour and glory, Who with the Father and the Holy Ghost
   liveth and reigneth one God, world without end. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Praise

   Great art Thou, O Lord, and greatly to be praised; great is Thy power,
   and Thy wisdom is infinite. Thee would we praise without ceasing. Thou
   callest us to delight in Thy praise, for Thou hast made us for Thyself,
   and our hearts find no rest until we rest in Thee; Who with the Father
   and the Holy Ghost all glory, praise, and honour be ascribed, both now
   and forevermore. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Grace

   We ask not of Thee, O Father, silver and gold, honour and glory, nor
   the pleasures of the world, but do Thou grant us grace to seek Thy
   Kingdom and Thy righteousness, and do Thou add unto us things necessary
   for the body and for this life. Behold, O Lord, our desire; may it be
   pleasing in Thy sight. We present our petition unto Thee through our
   Lord Jesus Christ, Who is at Thy right hand, our mediator and Advocate,
   through Whom Thou soughtest us that we might seek Thee; Thy Word,
   through Whom Thou madest us and all things; Thy only begotten Son,
   through Whom Thou callest us to adoption, Who intercedeth with Thee for
   us, and in Whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; to
   Him, with Thyself and the Holy Spirit, be all honour, praise, and
   glory, now and forever. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Peace

   O Lord God, grant Thy peace to us, for Thou hast supplied us with all
   things--the peace of rest, the peace of the Sabbath, which hath no
   evening; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Evening Prayer

   Watch Thou, dear Lord, with those who wake, or watch, or weep to night,
   and give Thine angels charge over those who sleep. Tend Thy sick ones,
   O Lord Christ. Rest Thy weary ones. Bless Thy dying ones. Soothe Thy
   suffering ones. Pity Thine afflicted ones. Shield Thy joyous ones. And
   all, for Thy Love's sake. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Perfection

   Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint under Thy discipline, nor
   let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercies whereby Thou hast
   drawn me out of all my most evil ways, that Thou mightest become a
   delight to me above all the allurements which I once pursued; that I
   may most entirely love Thee, and clasp Thy hand with all my affections,
   and Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation, even unto the end.
   For lo, O Lord, my King and my God, for Thy service be whatever useful
   thing my childhood learned; for Thy service that I speak, write, read,
   reckon. For Thou didst grant me Thy discipline while I was learning
   vanities; and my sin of delighting in those vanities Thou hast
   forgiven. In them, indeed, I learnt many a useful word, but these may
   as well be learned in things not vain; and that is the safe path for
   the steps of youth. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Light

   O let the Light, the Truth, the Light of my heart, not mine own
   darkness, speak unto me. I fell off into that, and became darkened; but
   even thence, even thence I loved Thee. I went astray, and remembered
   Thee. I heard Thy voice behind me, calling me to return, and scarcely
   heard it, through the tumultuousness of the enemies of peace. And now,
   behold, I return in distress and panting after Thy fountain. Let no man
   forbid me! of this will I drink, and so live. Let me not be mine own
   life; from myself I lived ill, death was I to myself; and I revive in
   Thee. Do Thou speak unto me, do Thou discourse unto me. I have believed
   Thy Books, and their words be most full of mystery. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Communion with God

   O how shall I call upon God, my God and Lord, since, when I call for
   Him, I shall be calling Him into myself? And what room is there within
   me, whither my God can come into me? Whither can God come into me, God
   who made heaven and earth? Is there, indeed, O Lord my God, aught in me
   that can contain Thee? Do, then, heaven and earth, which Thou hast
   made, and wherein Thou hast made me, contain Thee? Or, because nothing
   which exists could exist without Thee, doth therefore whatever exists
   contain Thee? Since, then, I too exist, why do I seek that Thou
   shouldest enter into me, who were not, wert Thou not in me? Why?
   Because I am not gone down in hell, and yet Thou art there also. For if
   I go down into hell, Thou art there. I could not be, then, O my God,
   could not be at all, wert Thou not in me; or rather, unless I were in
   Thee, of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all
   things! Even so, Lord, even so. Whither do I call Thee, since I am in
   Thee? Or whence canst Thou enter into me? For whither can I go beyond
   heaven and earth, that thence my God should come into me, who hath
   said, "I fill the heaven and the earth"?

   O God, the vessels which Thou fillest uphold Thee not, since, though
   they were broken, Thou wert not poured out, on us, Thou art not cast
   down, but Thou upliftest us; Thou art not dissipated, but Thou
   gatherest us.... Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rest in Thee

   O Lord God, give peace unto us (for Thou hast given us all things): the
   peace of rest, the peace of the Sabbath, which hath no evening: Yea,
   give us rest in Thee, the Sabbath of eternal life. For Thou shalt rest
   in us, as now Thou workest in us; and Thy rest shall be through us, as
   Thy works are through us. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Light

   O Lord, who art the Light, the Way, the Truth, the Life; in whom there
   is no darkness, error, vanity, or death--the Light without which there
   is darkness; the Way without which there is wandering; the Truth
   without which there is error; the life without which there is Death;
   say, Lord, let there be Light, and I shall see Light, and eschew
   Darkness; I shall see the way and avoid wandering; I shall see the
   Truth and shun error; I shall see Life and escape Death: Illuminate, O
   illuminate my blind soul which sitteth in darkness and the shadow of
   Death; and direct my feet into the way of peace. Amen. --Augustine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Morning Prayer

   O God, who art faithful and true, who "hast mercy on thousands and ten
   thousands of them that love Thee," the lover of the humble, and the
   protector of the needy, of whom all things stand in need, for all
   things are subject to Thee; look down upon this Thy people, who bow
   down their heads to Thee, and bless them with spiritual blessing. "Keep
   them as the apple of an eye," preserve them in piety and righteousness,
   and vouchsafe them eternal life in Christ Jesus Thy beloved Son, with
   whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee and to the Holy Spirit, now
   and always, and forever and ever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Thanksgiving for the Morning

   O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh, who art beyond compare, and
   standest in need of nothing, who hast given the sun to have rule over
   the day, and the moon and the stars to have rule over the night, do
   Thou now also look down upon us with gracious eyes, and receive our
   morning thanksgivings, and have mercy upon us; for we have not "spread
   out our hands unto a strange God;" for there is not among us any new
   God, but Thou, the eternal God, who art without end, who hast given us
   our being through Christ, and given us our well-being through Him. Do
   Thou vouchsafe us also, through Him, eternal life; with whom glory, and
   honour, and worship be to Thee and to the Holy Spirit forever. Amen.
   --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Morning Prayer

   "Glory be to God in the highest, and upon earth peace, good-will among
   men." We praise Thee, we sing hymns to Thee, we bless Thee, we glorify
   Thee, we worship Thee by Thy great High Priest; Thee who art the true
   God, who art the One Unbegotten, the only inaccessible Being. For Thy
   great glory, O Lord and heavenly King, O God the Father Almighty, O
   Lord God, the Father of Christ the immaculate Lamb, who taketh away the
   sin of the world, receive our prayer, Thou that sittest upon the
   cherubim. For Thou only art holy, Thou only art the Lord Jesus, the
   Christ of the God of all created nature, and our King, by whom glory,
   honour, and worship be to Thee. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  An Evening Prayer

   Save us, O God, and raise us up by Thy Christ. Let us stand up, and beg
   for the mercies of the Lord, and His compassions, for the angel of
   peace, for what things are good and profitable, for a Christian
   departure out of this life, an evening and a night of peace, and free
   from sin; and let us beg that the whole course of our life may be
   unblamable. Let us dedicate ourselves and one another to the living God
   through His Christ. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  An Evening Prayer

   O God, who art without beginning and without end, the Maker of the
   whole world by Christ, and the Provider for it, but before all His God
   and Father, the Lord of the Spirit, and the King of intelligible and
   sensible beings; who hast made the day for the works of light, and the
   night for the refreshment of our infirmity,--for "the day is Thine, the
   night also is Thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun,"--do
   Thou now, O Lord, Thou lover of mankind, and Fountain of all good,
   mercifully accept of this our evening thanksgiving. Thou who hast
   brought us through the length of the day, and hast brought us to the
   beginnings of the night, preserve us by Thy Christ, afford us a
   peaceable evening, and a night free from sin, and vouchsafe us
   everlasting life by Thy Christ, through whom glory, honour, and worship
   be to Thee in the Holy Spirit forever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  An Evening Prayer

   "Ye children, praise the Lord: Praise the name of the Lord." We praise
   Thee, we sing hymns to Thee, we bless Thee for Thy great glory, O Lord
   our King, the Father of Christ the immaculate Lamb, who taketh away the
   sin of the world. Praise becomes Thee, hymns become Thee, glory becomes
   Thee, the God and Father, through the Son, in the most holy Spirit,
   forever and ever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Table Grace

   Thou art blessed, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth, who givest
   food to all flesh. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that having
   always what is sufficient for us, we may abound to every good work, in
   Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom glory, honour, and power be to Thee
   forever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the First-Fruits

   We give thanks to Thee, O Lord Almighty, the Creator of the whole
   world, and its Preserver, through Thy only begotten Son Jesus Christ
   our Lord, for the first-fruits which are offered to Thee, not in such a
   manner as we ought, but as we are able. For what man is there that can
   worthily give Thee thanks for those things Thou hast given them to
   partake of? The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, and of all
   the saints, who madest all things fruitful by Thy word, and didst
   command the earth to bring forth various fruits for our rejoicing and
   our food; who hast given to the duller and more sheepish sort of
   creatures juices--herbs to them that feed on herbs, and to some flesh,
   to others seeds, but to us corn, as advantageous and proper food, and
   many other things--some for our necessities, some for our health, and
   some for our pleasure. On all these accounts, therefore, art Thou
   worthy of exalted hymns of praise for Thy beneficence by Christ,
   through whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee, in the Holy Spirit,
   forever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Thanks For Thy Mercies

   We give Thee thanks for all things, O Lord Almighty, that Thou hast not
   taken away Thy mercies and Thy compassions from us; but in every
   succeeding generation Thou dost save, and deliver, and assist, and
   protect: for Thou didst assist in the days of Enos and Enoch, in the
   days of Moses and Joshua, in the days of the judges, in the days of
   Samuel and of Elijah and of the prophets, in the days of David and of
   the kings, in the days of Esther and Mordecai, and in our days hast
   Thou assisted us by Thy great High Priest, Jesus Christ Thy Son. For He
   has delivered us from the sword, and hath freed us from famine, and
   sustained us; has delivered us from sickness, has preserved us from an
   evil tongue. For all which things do we give Thee thanks through
   Christ, who has given us an articulate voice to confess withal, and
   added to it a suitable tongue as an instrument to modulate withal, and
   a proper taste, and a suitable touch, and a sight for contemplation,
   and the hearing of sounds, and the smelling of vapours, and hands for
   work, and feet for walking. Thou hast instructed [man] by Thy laws,
   improved him by Thy statutes; and when Thou bringest on a dissolution
   for a while, Thou hast promised a resurrection. Wherefore what life is
   sufficient, what length of ages will be long enough, for men to be
   thankful? To do it worthily it is impossible, but to do it according to
   our ability is just and right. Thou hast delivered us from error and
   ignorance; Thou hast sent Christ among men as a man, being the only
   begotten God; Thou hast made the Comforter to inhabit among us; Thou
   hast set angels over us; Thou hast put the devil to shame; Thou hast
   brought us into being when we were not; Thou takest care of us when
   made; Thou measurest out life to us; Thou affordest us food; Thou hast
   promised repentance. Glory and worship be to Thee for all these things,
   through Jesus Christ, now and ever, and through all ages. Amen.
   --Adapted: Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For The Holy Spirit

   O God Almighty, the Father of Thy Christ, Thy only begotten Son, give
   me a body undefiled, a heart pure, a mind watchful, an unerring
   knowledge, the influence of the Holy Ghost for the obtaining and
   assured enjoying of the truth, through Thy Christ, by whom glory be to
   Thee, in the Holy Spirit, for ever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the Faithful

   O Lord Almighty, the Most High, who dwellest on high, the Holy One,
   that restest among the saints, without beginning, the Only Potentate,
   who hast given to us by Christ the preaching of knowledge, to the
   acknowledgment of Thy glory and of Thy name, which He has made known to
   us, for our comprehension, do Thou now also look down through Him upon
   this Thy flock, and deliver it from all ignorance and wicked practice,
   and grant that we may fear Thee in earnest, and love Thee with
   affection, and have a due reverence of Thy glory. Be gracious and
   merciful to them, and hearken to them when they pray unto Thee; and
   keep them, that they may be unmoveable, unblameable, and unreprovable,
   that they may be holy in body and spirit, not having spot or wrinkle,
   or any such thing; but that they may be complete, and none of them may
   be defective or imperfect. O our support, our powerful God, who dost
   not accept persons, be Thou the assister of this Thy people, which Thou
   hast redeemed with the precious blood of Thy Christ; be Thou their
   protector, aider, provider, and guardian, their strong wall of defence,
   their bulwark and security. For "none can snatch out of Thy hand:" for
   there is no other God like Thee; for on Thee is our reliance. "Sanctify
   them by Thy truth: for Thy word is truth." Amen. --Apostolic
   Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  On the Lord's Day

   O Lord Almighty, Thou hast created the world by Christ, and hast
   appointed the Sabbath in memory thereof, because that on that day Thou
   hast made us rest from our works, for the meditation upon Thy laws.
   Thou hast also appointed festivals for the rejoicing of our souls, that
   we might come into the remembrance of that wisdom which was created by
   Thee; how He submitted to be made of a woman on our account; He
   appeared in life, and demonstrated Himself in His baptism; how he that
   appeared is both God and man; He suffered for us by Thy permission, and
   died, and rose again by Thy power: on which account we solemnly
   assemble to celebrate the feast of the resurrection on the Lord's day,
   and rejoice on account of Him who has conquered death, and hast brought
   life and immortality to light. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the Holy Communion

   We thank Thee, our Father, for that life which Thou hast made known to
   us by Jesus Thy Son, by whom madest all things, and takest care of the
   whole world; whom Thou hast sent to become man for our salvation; whom
   Thou hast permitted to suffer and to die; whom Thou hast raised up, and
   been pleased to glorify, and hast set Him down on Thy right hand; by
   whom Thou hast promised us the resurrection of the dead. Do Thou, O
   Lord Almighty, everlasting God, so gather together Thy Church from the
   ends of the earth into Thy kingdom, as this corn was once scattered,
   and is now become one loaf. We also, our Father, thank Thee for the
   precious blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for us, and for His
   precious body, whereof we celebrate this representation, as Himself
   appointed us, "to show forth His death." For through Him glory is to be
   given to Thee for ever. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  After the Holy Communion

   We thank Thee, O God and Father of Jesus our Saviour, for Thy holy
   name, which Thou hast made to inhabit among us; and that knowledge,
   faith, love, and immortality which Thou hast given us through Thy Son
   Jesus. Thou, O Almighty Lord, the God of the universe, hast created the
   world, and the things that are therein by Him; and hast planted a law
   in our souls, and beforehand didst prepare things for the convenience
   of men. O God of our holy and blameless fathers, Abraham, and Isaac,
   and Jacob, Thy faithful servants; Thou, O God, who art powerful,
   faithful and true, and without deceit in Thy promises; who didst send
   upon earth Jesus Thy Christ to live with men, as a man, when He was God
   the Word, and man, to take away error by the roots: do Thou even now,
   through Him, be mindful of this Thy holy Church, which Thou hast
   purchased with the precious blood of Thy Christ, and deliver it from
   all evil, and perfect it in Thy love and Thy truth, and gather us all
   together into Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared. Let this Thy
   kingdom come. Amen. --Apostolic Constitutions.
