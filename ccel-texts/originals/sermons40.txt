A New Year's Retrospect And Prospect

   (No. 2342)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 7, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THE EVENING OF NEW YEAR'S
   DAY, 1871.

   "LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble: You will prepare their
   heart, You will cause Your ear to hear." Psalm 10:17.

   IT has been sometimes said that a good Sabbath makes a good week. Sir
   Matthew Hale long ago said--

   "A Sabbath well spent Brings a week of content," while George Herbert
   quaintly wrote--

   "The Sundays of man's life Threaded together on Time's string,

   Make bracelets to adorn the wife Of the eternal, glorious King. On
   Sunday, Heaven's gate stands ope, Blessings are plentiful and rife;
   More plentiful than hope."

   Sunday is the market day of the week and if a man does well at market,
   he considers that he has done well for all the week. The Sabbath oils
   the wheels of the week--its bodily rest is useful, but its spiritual
   anointing is far more so!

   Now, if that is the case, and I think it is, I might venture to say
   that a good first Sabbath in the year will go a long way towards making
   a good year. Very often things go on as they begin. It is very seldom
   that troubles come alone and it is still more seldom that mercies are
   given to us singly. We may always say, when we get a blessing, "Gad, a
   troop comes." So I would that we might receive a great blessing on this
   first Sabbath of another year, that a troop of blessings might follow
   on the heels thereof, and that a host of mercies might continue to come
   to us even till we reach the last day of the year-- and then that we
   might begin, again, with new tokens of our Lord's loving kindness and
   tender mercy~

   I thought our text might be a very serviceable Word of God for this
   first Sabbath evening in the year of Grace, 1871. It is intended to be
   of use, not only for tonight's sermon, but to be remembered all the
   year round. I think there is something in it which will render it
   suitable to all of us at all times during the next 12 months and,
   indeed, during the whole of the rest of our lives. We do not know, as
   we said in prayer just now, which way our pilgrimage may lead us, but I
   feel persuaded that, with this Inspired passage laid up in our hearts,
   if we make a right use of it, beneath the cover of Jehovah's wings we
   may go happily on from this place till again we pitch our tent upon the
   borders of another year.

   Looking at the text, we may divide it into two parts. In the first
   portion, we have a very blessed fact--"Lord, You have heard the desire
   of the humble." In the second part, we have two very blessed
   assurances--"You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to
   hear."

   I. We will begin with what the text says about A VERY BLESSED
   FACT--"Lord, You have heard the desire of the

   humble."

   I call this a very blessed fact, first, because it always has been a
   fact. In all ages and in all places, wherever there has been a humble
   heart that has lifted up its desire to God, the Lord has heard that
   desire! Whether Jew or Gentile, whether in the palace or in the
   poorhouse, whether in sickness or in health, whether in poverty or in
   wealth, whether in life or in death, no difference has ever been
   made--if the desire has been a humble one, from the first man who ever
   prayed down to this present time--God has always been ready to hear.

   And, blessed be His holy name! It is not only an old fact, it is as
   much a fact, tonight, as it was when David first penned these words,
   "Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble." At this very moment,
   God's ear is hearing the beating of your hearts. O humble Soul,
   Jehovah's heart discerns the throbbing of your desire though they are
   unexpressed in words! His eyes of fire, which pierce us through and
   through, are reading every longing desire of every anxious bosom here.

   It is so now and it will be a fact all through this year, God will hear
   the desire of the humble. It is a fact of the olden times, but it is
   also a fact of present import and of the future, too. Notice how the
   Psalmist puts this fact--"Lord, You have heard the desire of the
   humble." David does not say, "You have heard the prayer of the humble."
   He means that, but he also means a great deal more. Sometimes we have
   desires that we cannot express--they are too big, too deep--we cannot
   clothe them in language. At other times we have desires which we dare
   not express--we feel too bowed down, we see too much of our own
   unworthiness to be able to venture near the Throne of God to utter our
   desires--but the Lord hears the desire when we cannot or dare not turn
   it into the actual form of a prayer. I know you have sometimes said, "I
   wish I could pray like So-and-So." Often you have thought, "If I could
   only put a great many beautiful sentences together into goodly shape,
   then I might be heard." Do not talk so foolishly! If you cannot put two
   words together correctly, if your desire is right, God will hear the
   desire--

   "Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, Uttered or unexpressed."

   Prayer is not in the expression or the non-expression--prayer is the
   soul's sincere desire. The very heart of prayer is in the desire--the
   essence of the whole matter, the kernel of the nut--is the desire of
   the heart, not the utterance of the lips. Words without the desire are
   mere empty husks, but the desire, even without words, is sweet to God,
   and He accepts it. Can you catch the blessedness of this thought? I say
   again, before your desire takes a shape in which language could cover
   it, God will hear it!

   You sometimes can hear people's desires, yourself. Many a mother hears
   her boy's desire. He has gone to sea, but before he went, his mother
   packed his box. She did not tell him all she put into it--there are
   some things there that he has not yet seen and he will not find them
   till he searches to the bottom of the chest. How did she know that he
   would desire those things? Because she foresaw the position in which he
   would be placed and the needs which would arise in such a case--and she
   gathered, from that foresight--what her boy's desire would be. You have
   seen a poor hungry person shivering in the cold. If he has not accosted
   you and asked you for alms, yet you have heard the desire beating
   beneath that ragged coat and you have said to yourself, "That man needs
   help." You have heard his desire by just looking at him--his very
   silence seemed to speak to you of his great need. O Soul, God can hear
   your needs! Jehovah can hear your anguish! The Lord can hear what no
   one else can hear and what you cannot express!

   I have always thought that to be a very clever way of begging, when a
   man sits down and huddles himself up at a street corner and just writes
   on the pavement with a piece of chalk, "I am starving." But perhaps it
   is quite as efficient a plea if the beggar does not write the
   words--but only if his face looks like starvation and his whole body
   appears emaciated with need and hunger. You know the man's desire from
   his very looks. And oh, how sweet it is to think that God looks down
   with a comprehensive glance, upon humble souls, takes in their whole
   condition and position with His compassionate eyes and hears their
   desire though they are unable or afraid to express it!

   Notice, however, that David does not say, "Lord, You will hear the
   desire of the humble," but, "Lord, you have heard the desire of the
   humble. As soon as ever it was born, You heard it." You desire and God
   hears the desire at the same moment! No, let me correct myself and say
   that before it was a desire in your heart, God knew it would be there
   and He heard it. He had looked on you when as yet you had not looked on
   Him and, even then, it might have been truly said, "Lord, You have
   heard the desire of the humble."

   What kind of a desire is it that God hears? He does not accept all
   desires. Some are trifling, some are vain, some are foolish, some are
   wicked and He is not pleased with such desires. It is the desire of the
   humble that the Lord hears. "Ah," says one, "I am afraid I am not
   humble." Brother, Sister, it is one mark of a truly humble man that he
   does not think himself humble. If you meet with a person who says he is
   humble, you may conclude at once that he is proud, for, usually, there
   is no boasting in the world that is so full of pride as the boasting of
   the man who talks of his humility! You humble? Ah, Sir, you need to be
   humbled a great deal before that will be the truth! The very man who
   mourns over his pride is, probably, the really humble man.

   A humble desire, or the desire of a humble man, has this
   characteristic--the man knows there is no merit in his desire. If it is
   a good desire that he has in his heart, he feels, "It will be all
   through the infinite mercy of God if this desire is realized." He does
   not compliment himself and say, "Well done, Self, you have right
   desires in your heart--there is something good in you." No, but he
   fears lest the desire should not be sincere and, when it is deepest and
   truest, he still strips himself of all rags of self-righteousness, for
   he cannot see any good, whatever, in the desire that is in his own
   heart.

   A humble man does not desire anything of God for his own honor. He
   thinks too little of himself to wish to exalt himself and he longs, in
   all things, to glorify God. He desires his own salvation, but he knows
   that he does not deserve it, and he, therefore, gives God all the glory
   even while he rejoices in his own deliverance from going down into the
   Pit. He sings, with Toplady--

   "Not to myself I owe

   That I O Lord, am Thine.

   Free Grace has all the shades broke through

   And caused the light to shine.

   Me You have willing made

   Your offers to receive--

   Called by the voice that wakes the dead,

   I come to You and live."

   A humble desire is one which leaves everything in God's hands. The man
   who has it, says, "Now, though I desire this, it may be it is not a
   right desire. Lord, I desire only to desire what I ought to desire! My
   desire is that Your desire should be written on my heart, that I may
   desire what You desire. Your will be done in my Soul, in my body, in my
   circumstances and in me, in all respects."

   Now, beloved Friends, I think it will not be very difficult for you to
   see whether you have that desire of the humble which God hears. But to
   help you still further, let me give you some of these desires.

   This is one of the desires of the humble--"Lord save me! I am lost
   unless Your mercy comes to my rescue. I am guilty! Forgive me! I have
   been an enemy to You! Reconcile me! I am diseased with sin! Heal me,
   for You are the only Physician!" I cannot hear your desires. Let me
   stop and listen as long as I may, I cannot hear the longings of anyone
   here who wants God to save him, but, oh, dear Soul, wherever you are
   and whoever you are, there is a better ear than mine that has heard
   your desire, and that ear belongs to One who will fulfill your desire!
   Surely, some of you are praying that prayer that I uttered just
   now--perhaps one who seemed least likely to offer it--God has dropped a
   hot coal of desire right into his bosom, right into her soul, and he or
   she is saying, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"

   That is one of the desires of the humble that God hears. I will
   suppose, however, that the Lord has heard that desire in your case and
   that He has graciously fulfilled it. Now I think I hear some humble
   soul saying, "Lord, save my children! Lord, convert my boys and girls!
   I have tried to train them up for You, but I dare not hope that any
   teaching of mine will be effectual for their salvation unless You put
   Your hand to the work." I cannot hear the beating of your hearts as you
   plead for your children. I cannot hear the wife's desires as she
   inwardly cries, "Lord, save my husband!" Neither can I hear that
   Sister's longing as she says within her spirit, "O Lord, let my sister
   live before You! May my brother learn to know Christ!" But, though I
   cannot hear those desires--and no human being can hear them--God hears
   them! "Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble." Make yours a
   large desire, beloved Friends! Take in all your kinsfolk, take in mine,
   take in my hearers, take in all this congregation, take in this city of
   London and let the desire go up that God would save tens of thousands
   of souls, for He will hear the desire of the humble!

   Another desire should be this--"Lord, guide me aright this year!" The
   young man who feels the force of his passion, should pray, "Lord, lead
   me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil!" The merchant who
   knows the deadening influence of the cares of this world, should cry,
   "Quicken me, O Lord, according to Your Word!" The housewife who looks
   forward to, she knows not what, of trouble in the family--a suitable
   prayer for her is, "Let Your Grace, O Lord, be always sufficient for
   me! Guide me, O Lord, lead me in a plain path! Direct my footsteps and
   let me, this year, walk in holiness!" I say again, I do not know who is
   breathing that petition. I hope many of you are doing so, but there is
   One sitting in the highest heavens, hearing the songs of cherubim and
   seraphim, who yet condescends to hear the desire of the humble when it
   takes such a form as this.

   I think I know some of you, tonight, who are saying, "Lord, glorify
   Yourself in me!" I do hear that desire in one heart here, I can hear it
   in my own heart. And God hears it, I trust, in many others. The Sunday
   school teacher is saying, "Lord, honor Yourself in my class this year!
   Bring my boys, my girls, to the Savior's feet." You who are preachers
   are saying, "Lord, glorify Yourself in our ministry. Give us many souls
   that shall be our crown of rejoicing, but Your Glory forever!" You who
   have not had any particular form of duty are saying, "Lord, give me
   something to do this year! Do not let me be an idler--suffer me not to
   be a barren tree--get honor to Yourself out of me this year, I beseech
   You!" Now, wherever such a desire is going up, God hears it! I trust,
   also, that you are not only desiring God's Glory through yourself, for,
   if so, that may not be a humble desire, but that you are also desiring
   God's Glory through all His servants. Let this be your petition, "O
   Lord, prosper every minister of Christ, every Sunday school teacher,
   every visitor of the sick, every tract distributor, everyone who is
   doing anything for You! O Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the
   years! O send out Your Light and Your Truth! Let multitudes of sinners
   be saved!" If that is your heart's desire, be thankful that God hears
   the desire of the humble this night and be earnest in presenting that
   desire at the Throne of Grace.

   Now I will leave this first part of my subject. I really think there is
   much in it which, while it causes you joy as you think of it this
   evening, may also cause you joy tomorrow and every other day in the
   year. Suppose you are in a workshop and cannot kneel down to pray--you
   can desire and God will hear that desire even if it is not expressed in
   words. Perhaps you work where there are ungodly men and you cannot
   vocally offer your petition to the Lord. If so, you can desire.
   Therefore, thank the Lord that He hears the desire of the humble.
   Whatever can stop my voice, nothing can stop my heart's desire! I can
   go on desiring and, Glory be to God, He will go on hearing the desire
   of my heart!

   Now we must pass on to the second part of our subject, TWO VERY BLESSED
   ASSURANCES--"You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to
   hear."

   The first assurance is this, "You will prepare their heart." Turn this
   declaration into a prayer, "Lord, prepare my heart!" We ought all to
   make some sort of preparation for coming days as far as prudence
   suggests and circumstances allow. There is a laying up in store for a
   rainy day that every sensible man will make as far as he is able, but,
   Brothers and Sisters, the best preparation for the future lies in
   having a prepared heart! If you get all else prepared, but the heart is
   not, you have left the major part undone. But if the heart is prepared
   and a good deal else, unprepared, things may yet come right in the end.
   All gets right when the heart is right. Out of the heart are the issues
   of life and those issues of life are true and good when the heart is
   right. God only can prepare the heart for that which is right--He alone
   can prepare it for holy living, for happy dying--and for eternity! I
   want you to get hold of this assurance as a promise for you all through
   this year, "You will prepare their heart." How shall we understand this
   expression?

   First, God will prepare the heart of the humble to receive Christ.
   "Oh," says one, "I do not feel fit to come to Christ." All the fitness
   that is needed, God will give you. "You will prepare their heart." You
   need to be empty, to be broken, to be wounded--all this, the Spirit of
   God will work upon your conscience by the operation of the Law of the
   Lord. Do not stand back from Christ because you are unprepared to come
   to Him. God will prepare you for Christ as He has already prepared
   Christ for you.

   Next, "You will prepare their heart" to receive more of Christ. Those
   of us who have had Christ as our hope and our trust want to get more of
   Him. I should be very sorry if I thought that, this year, I should not
   learn something more of my Master than I have known before. I should
   think it a dreary year if it should pass over my head and I should have
   no fresh instruction concerning the beauties of His Person and the
   excellence of His Character. Oh, that we might all receive Christ more
   fully into our heart! The heart needs sweeping, cleaning and
   preparing--and here is the promise that this work shall be Divinely
   performed! "You will prepare their heart." Not only for Grace, but for
   more Grace, will God prepare the heart of the humble!

   This year, dear Brothers and Sisters, we shall need heart-preparation
   for the many duties we shall have to perform for God. Look forward to
   them with trust in God. Those who examine the palms of the hand and
   pretend to foretell the future are fools! Those who believe them are
   not wise. We cannot tell what a day may bring forth, but we know that
   every day will bring its need of service. Well then, God will prepare
   our hearts for it. "You will prepare their heart." I like to think that
   nothing shall come for me to do but God will fit me for it. I may be
   called to a work that I have never attempted before. If so, I shall
   have Grace given which I never had before! You may change your
   condition of life this year, my dear Friend, but you shall be prepared
   for that change! You may have to emigrate to the other side of the
   world and find fresh

   duties awaiting you there--but you shall be prepared for your new
   sphere of service. You may be called from being a servant to be a
   master, or you may have to come down in the world and from being a
   master, you may have to become a servant, yet, whatever God shall put
   before you to do, He will prepare your heart for it. Only plead this
   declaration in prayer and you may expect to have it fulfilled!

   In addition to our active service, there may be and probably will be,
   for many of us, a great deal of passive service--we may have to endure
   suffering this year. Poverty may fall upon some who are now in a
   comfortable position in life. Bereavement may make a widow of that
   smiling sister, or that happy father over yonder may be left childless.
   Before the year has run its course, who of us may have to toss upon the
   bed of sickness by the month, together? Who may be slandered? Who may
   be persecuted? It is not for us to know, but here is something we may
   know--"You will prepare their heart." It is wonderful how God gets His
   people ready for trouble when it is coming. You remember what Solomon
   said about the wise woman? "She is not afraid of the snow for her
   household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet." She has
   made such warm garments for them that she says, "Let the snow come if
   it likes. They are prepared to resist the cold." So God's wisdom and
   Grace will clothe us all with such warm garments of consolation that,
   when trouble comes, we shall be fully prepared to bear it. For duty, or
   for suffering, "You will prepare their heart."

   And ah, this year, some of us may have to die. Many of our members
   passed away last year. Some dear sweet souls--the very pick of this
   Church--were taken up to Heaven. It may be my lot, it may be your lot,
   dear Brother or Sister, to go Home this year, but we will fall back on
   this gracious assurance, "You will prepare their heart." Why, it seems
   to me that if I can keep this Word of God in my heart and on my tongue
   all this year, nothing shall be able to disturb me! I shall be like the
   man of whom it is written, "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings--his
   heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." "You will prepare their heart"
   and, therefore, they shall not be afraid of all the enemies that can
   come against them! You shall not be afraid of sickness, of famine, or
   of death, itself, for God will prepare your heart to meet it! Slip
   aside, now and again, during this year, when an unexpected trouble
   comes, and say, "Lord, prepare my heart for this sorrow!" When you meet
   with a strong temptation that comes all of a sudden, hasten away into
   some quiet corner and pray, "Now, my Master, prepare my heart to resist
   this assault of the adversary!" He will keep your sword sharpened for
   you! He will have your shield well bossed for you! He will keep you
   strong, He will keep you happy, He will keep you blessed, He will
   prepare your heart!

   Now for the last part of my text. You do not know, perhaps, that I have
   a license to keep on as long as I like, to-night, for my pulpit clock
   has stopped! I am obliged to look round to see how the time flies.
   Before I close, I should like to say a little about this last part of
   my subject, the second blessed assurance--"You will cause Your ear to
   hear." I think, Brothers and Sisters, that this preparation of the
   heart means, in the first place, that God will prepare His people's
   hearts to pray and then He will cause His ear to hear their prayers.
   But I will take it out of its connection for just a minute or two.

   "You will cause Your ear to hear." I understand by this phrase that the
   Lord will hear us soon. Sometimes, when we pray, the answer does not
   come directly. Pray again, Brother, Sister, for if God has not caused
   His ear to hear, yet, He will cause His ear to hear! The answer to your
   prayer shall come speedily. Do not postpone your expectations too long.
   Prepare to wait if God tarries, but be prepared for the reply if He
   does not tarry. Some Christians do the first, but not the sec-ond--they
   seem so ready to wait that God makes them wait! Oh, prepare with such
   vigor and earnestness, when you are pleading for your own salvation, or
   for the salvation of others, that God shall make haste and at once
   cause His ear to hear! He will hear you soon--expect, during this year,
   many speedy answers to your prayers!

   "You will cause Your ear to hear." That means, next, I think, that the
   Lord will always hear us. He will, as it were, exert Himself to hear
   your supplication. "You will cause your ear to hear." This is a blessed
   Word of God for this new year! My God, how earnestly I will pray, now
   that I know I have Your ear! I remember that dear Mr. Cowper said, when
   he was in despondency and distress, writing to Mr. Bull, of Newport
   Pagnell, "You have advised me to pray, but there is no reason in the
   world in my praying, there is no passage of Scripture that gives me any
   right to pray." He was, of course, insane at the time. Yet he said, "If
   there were such a text, I would never leave off praying as long as I
   lived. You tell me that Jonah prayed in the whale's belly, but I am in
   a worse plight than he was in. If I were only as bad as Jonah was, I
   would pray to God night and day."

   I catch at that thought--if I am permitted to pray, then I will pray.
   And if I may have whatever I ask of God in the name of Jesus, oh, I
   will ask! Do use your privilege in praying to the Lord, for He will
   cause His ear to hear. If you had the

   ear of the great ones at court and could get whatever you liked, I am
   sure that you would use the privilege! And now that you have the ear of
   the great King of Kings, O you intercessors, you who are the Lord's
   remembrancers, plead with Him day and night "and give Him no rest till
   He establishes, and till He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth," for
   He will cause His ear to hear you! The Lord will always hear you,
   Sinner, if you call upon Him! He will soon hear you--He will
   effectually hear you.

   When it is said, "You will cause Your ear to hear," does it not mean
   that the Lord will so hear as to answer ourpetitions? As a Church we
   have prospered by prayer. Glasgow flourished by the preaching of the
   Word and the Tabernacle has flourished by the prayers of Believers.
   That has been the secret of our strength! Therefore let us still
   believe in the efficacy of prayer. God listens to the voices of His
   children. He regards the cry of the humble. He is moved by the desires
   of His own people. Let us, then, during this year, be more in prayer
   than ever! Let us pray in faith, pleading the precious blood of Jesus
   and the promises of God's Word. And let us hear the Lord saying to us,
   "Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel and his Maker, Ask me of
   things to come concerning My sons and concerning the work of My hands,
   command you, Me." There is need of a great revival of religion--the
   wave of the late revival has gone and now we need another. We have had
   a long winter, spiritually--we need to have an awakening springtime, a
   glorious summer and a golden autumn in the Church. Let us pledge
   ourselves to pray for it--and not merely pledge ourselves, but really
   pray! Let us cry mightily till the Lord shall hear us and bring in tens
   of thousands who shall be the reward of the Savior's sufferings and
   death! The Lord bless you, dear Friends, and make this year to be very
   rich in fruit-bearing to God's Glory in every one of us!

   And as for such as were not saved when they came into the Tabernacle
   this evening, I trust that God will, this very night, make them desire
   to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ--and He will hear their desire and
   lead them to look to the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the
   world! As we who love the Lord come to the Communion Table, we can use
   our text, for I am sure the desire of the humble is that they may see
   Christ in the Supper. "Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble:
   You will prepare their heart." Oh, it is sad to go to the Lord's Table
   with an unprepared heart! Lord, prepare our heart to come to Your
   banqueting table, tonight and then, "You will cause Your ear to hear."
   You will grant us Grace to feed upon Christ and to be satisfied! May it
   be so to every communicant! The Lord bless you all, for Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM103.

   One's heart naturally turns to this passage when one desires to magnify
   the Lord. It is specially suitable for a New Year's meditation.

   Verse 1. Bless the Lord, O my Soul: and all that is within me, bless
   His holy name. Come, my Soul, wake up! Bestir yourself! You have great
   work to do, such work as angels do forever and ever before the Throne
   of God. Let no power or faculty exempt itself from this Divine service!
   Come, my memory, my will, my judgment, my intellect, my heart--all that
   is in me, be stirred up to magnify and bless His holy name! "Bless the
   Lord, O my Soul"--for the music must begin deep down in the center of
   my being--it must be myself, my very self, that praises God!

   2. Bless the LORD, O my Soul, and forget not all His benefits. This
   shall be the first note--"We love Him because He first loved us." We
   have not to go abroad for materials for praise, they lie at home.
   Forget not all His benefits to you, my Soul--His overwhelming, His
   innumerable benefits which have to be summed up in the gross as "all
   His benefits"--forget them not!

   3. Who forgives all your iniquities. Come, come, my Soul, can you not
   praise God for sin forgiven? That is the first note, and it is the
   sweetest note in our song of praise. "Who forgives all your
   iniquities"--not some of them but the blessed Scapegoat has carried
   into the, "No man's land of oblivion," the whole mass!

   3. Who heals all your diseases. He is the Physician for you, my
   Soul--your diseases are the worst of all diseases, for they would drag
   you down to Hell if they were not cured. But Jehovah Rophi heals all
   your diseases!

   4. Who redeems your life from destruction. Oh, my Soul, praise God for
   redemption! If you cannot sing about anything else, sing of Free Grace
   and dying Love. Keep on ringing those charming bells.

   4. Who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies. What? Can
   you wear a crown and not praise Him who placed it on your head? Can you
   wear such a crown as this, made up of loving kindness and tender
   mercies, and not bless the Lord? Oh, let it not be so! Let us each
   break forth in spirit in one song, tonight, and say, "My soul does
   magnify the

   Lord."

   5. Who satisfies your mouth with good things; so that your youth is
   renewed like the eagle's. Heavenly feasting on heavenly bread! Divine
   satisfaction from the finished work of Christ! Oh, my Soul, pray to God
   to give you new life, tonight, so that your youth may be renewed, so
   that your wing feathers may grow, again, and that you may mount as
   eagles do! Surely, dear Friends, this little list of mercies, so small
   in number, contains an immensity of mercy! Let us bless the Lord for
   every one of them.

   6. The LORD executes righteousness and judgment for all that are
   oppressed. Let the poor and the down-trodden sing unto the Lord. He
   will take care of you! He is the Executor of the needy and the
   Executioner of the proud. "The Lord executes righteousness and judgment
   for all that are oppressed."

   7. He made known His ways unto Moses, His acts unto the children of
   Israel. Therefore, let us bless Him, the God of Revelation, who does
   not hide Himself from His creatures, but who makes known His ways and
   His acts unto His people! An unknown God is an unpraised God, but when
   He shows Himself to His people, they cannot refrain from blessing His
   name.

   8. The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
   mercy. Praise Him for this! Bless His name at every single mention of
   His Divine attributes. Let your hearts beat to the music of praise
   tonight!

   9. He will not always chide: neither will He keep His anger forever.
   Let the afflicted praise Him! Let the downcast and the despondent
   sinner praise Him! If he cannot sing about anything else, let him bless
   the name of the Lord that He will not keep His anger forever.

   10. He has not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according
   to our iniquities. Let us thank God we are not in Hell--we are yet on
   praying ground and on pleading terms with Him. Some of us will never go
   into Perdition, for He has saved us with an everlasting salvation.
   Truly, if we did not bless Him, every timber in this building and every
   iron column beneath this roof might burst out in rebukes for our
   ingratitude! We must bless His name!

   11. For as the Heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy
   toward them that fear Him. Look up into the blue sky--up, up beyond the
   stars and say to yourself--"So great is His mercy." Let us, therefore,
   praise Him accordingly. "Loud as His thunders, shout His praise and
   sound it lofty at His Throne."

   12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our
   transgressions from us. There is neither latitude nor longitude for
   praise. God's Grace is boundless! Let us, therefore, unstintedly praise
   Him.

   13. Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that
   fear Him. He has a tender heart. He never strikes without regret, but
   His love always flows freely. No father or mother is half so mild and
   loving as is the Lord of Hosts!

   14. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust. Our bodies
   are but animated dust and even our souls might be compared to dust in
   His sight. Not iron or granite, but we are mere dust. It is a wonder
   that men live so long when there are such mighty forces, even in
   Nature, arrayed against them. Who can control earthquakes and
   volcanoes? And when men Cross the sea in times of storm, it is a wonder
   that they come to land, again!

   15. As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he
   flourishes. You are like the primrose by the river's brim, or the
   buttercup and the daisy in the field that is visited with the scythe.
   That is all we are--not cedars, not oaks, not rocks--but flowers of the
   field.

   16. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof
   shall know it no more. Some of the hot winds of the East come over a
   meadow and it is immediately burned up. I have seen the fairest and
   loveliest flowers look, in a short time, as if they had been burned
   with a hot iron when the Sirocco had blown across from Africa--and such
   are we. We speak of the breath of the pestilence--it is but a puff of
   wind--and we are gone.

   17. 18. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
   upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto children's children
   to such as keep His Covenant, and to those that remember His
   Commandments to do them. "But"--and this is a blessed, "but." "But the
   mercy of the Lord"--that is not a fading flower, that is not a
   withering wind--"But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to
   everlasting." Here are ten thousand blessings in one! You have
   everlasting mercy,

   Covenant mercy. Oh, if we do not praise God when we think of the
   Covenant, what has happened to us? We must be possessed with a dumb
   devil if we do not praise the name of Him whose mercy is from
   everlasting to everlasting!

   19. The LORD has prepared His Throne in the heavens; and His Kingdom
   rules over all. Now, children of a King, will you go mourning all your
   days? You that dwell in the Light of His Throne, will you not be glad?
   Rejoice, O Zion, for your King lives and reigns forever! "The Lord
   reigns, let the earth rejoice."

   20. Bless the LORD, you His angels, that excel in strength, that do His
   commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His word. "Bless the Lord,
   you His angels." We cannot do it well enough, but help us, then, you
   angels that excel in strength. Put out all your strength when you
   praise Him, "you that do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of
   His word." Your actions are your praises, O you angels! Would God that
   we had learned to do His commandments as you do them! We are praying
   for this, even as our Lord taught His disciples to say, "Your will be
   done in earth, as it is in Heaven."

   21. Bless you the LORD, all you His host; you ministers of His, that do
   His pleasure. All living things, and all the forces and powers of
   Nature are calling upon men to praise the Lord! And all the hosts of
   God, the organs of Omnipotence, ring out the grand chorus, "Bless you
   the Lord."

   22. Bless the LORD, all His work, in all places of His dominion: bless
   the LORD, O my Soul. I must not go grumbling up to Heaven, nor
   stumbling among the works of God. I must gratefully come to Him and,
   myself, praise Him! And so, with the Psalmist, I cry, "Bless the Lord,
   O my Soul."

Faint--but Not Faint-Hearted

   (No. 2343)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 14, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   17, 1889.

   "Faint, yet pursuing." Judges 8:4.

   THESE three hundred men, though faint, were not faint-hearted. If they
   had been cowards, they would have left Gideon when he made the
   proclamation, "Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart
   early from Mount Gilead." Twenty-two thousand accepted that permission
   and left their general with ten thousand. Out of that smaller company,
   which was yet too large, these 300 had been selected as the men that
   lapped. While others unloosed their helmets and lay prone upon the
   grass to take a luxurious drink, these men acted like a hasty dog who,
   running by the side of a stream, laps and runs, and laps and runs--and
   wastes no time in drinking. They were men who had given themselves
   wholly up to this holy war and who were determined to smite these foes
   of God and His people--and yet they were faint. They were not faint
   because they were dispirited, for they had just won a great victory.
   They had broken the pitchers, unveiled the lamps, blown the trumpets
   and had shouted, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon," and they had
   seen the vast host of Midian melt away before their eyes! They had
   plunged with fervor into the battle, chasing the flying foe and laying
   tens of thousands dead at their feet. Every man among them was a
   hero--and yet they were faint.

   When you see men faint, do not blame them. Perhaps, by their faintness,
   they have proved of what true stuff they are made. They have done as
   much as flesh and blood can do and, therefore, they are faint. They may
   not have been defeated-- they may have gained a glorious victory--and
   yet, for the moment, they may be faint. Faintness, by itself, is a poor
   thing, but if you can truly say, "Faint, yet pursuing," faintness
   becomes the foil to set off perseverance--and the man is all the nobler
   because, when faint, he still pursues.

   I am going to talk, tonight, to some of God's people who may be in the
   condition which the text describes--"Faint, yet pursuing." I shall
   dwell a little, in the first place, upon the weakness of the
   flesh--"Faint." Secondly, I shall ask you to admire the strength of
   Divine Grace--"Faint, yet pursuing." When we have done that, I trust
   that we shall have a few minutes in which to learn the lessons of
   example, for these men shall be our schoolmasters.

   I. First, let us think about THE WEAKNESS OF THE FLESH. What is man,
   after all, at his very best? The best of men, at their best, are but
   men, and human nature, even at its best, is but a poor thing. And the
   strongest man may very soon be too weak to do anything and the heroic
   man, who could stand against the shock of arms, may lie upon the
   ground, weary, and unable to go a step further. Why were these brave,
   strong men of Gideon's band faint? I shall mention certain reasons
   which apply to us as well as to them.

   Well, first, they grew faint because they had lost their rest. It was
   at night that they broke the pitchers, at night that they made that
   surprising attack upon the camp of their enemies and they had, ever
   since, with hot feet, been pursuing the flying crowd. There had been no
   time for them to have any sleep, that "tired nature's sweet restorer"
   which is so necessary to us all. And there are Christian minds that
   have not rested--they have not had time to rest. And upon some there
   comes what is called insomnia, the inability to sleep. This, of course,
   is a physical malady, and overburdened men may be afflicted by it, but
   Christian men may suffer from spiritual insomnia. They may get so
   exercised about their work, so worried about the Lord's work--they may
   lay so much to heart the needs and woes of men, they may be so fretted
   about how little they can do, and how feebly they do it, and how small
   is the result that follows from all they have done--that they may get
   into a state of spiritual insomnia and restlessness.

   Now, this is always evil. Christ would have Martha care and to serve,
   but He would not have her cumbered with much serving--He would prefer
   that she should sit, like Mary, at His feet. We can do much for our
   Lord--some can do a great deal more than they are now doing--but it is
   very possible to attempt too much and really to do next to nothing
   because we have put ourselves into a condition in which we cannot do
   anything well! You may see a man who is strong and vigorous achieve
   with one blow what another cannot accomplish with 20 feeble strokes. It
   is not the doing much that is the important matter--it is the doing
   what you do with real force and power. You lose the ability to work
   unless you have necessary rest. Did you never notice how the Master
   makes rest a privilege of the worker? "Take My yoke upon you, and learn
   of Me...and you shall find rest unto your souls." You will never work
   like Christ unless you can rest like Christ! He had a great capacity
   for resting as well as great power for working. When He was in that
   little boat which was tossed in the storm, He was asleep in the back
   part of the vessel while the storm was at its height! To go to sleep
   was the best thing that He could do and, at certain times, the best
   thing that a Christian can do is to "rest in the Lord, and wait
   patiently for Him," for in that way he will get back his lost strength
   and power for service. If he neglects to rest in Christ, he will become
   faint. But it will be a happy circumstance if, when faint, he is still
   pursuing!

   In addition to losing their rest, these men had endured a very heavy
   strain. There is much work to be done that we might go on doing for a
   century if we lived so long, yet we should never be worn out by it--the
   ordinary everyday work does not kill men. But there are superhuman
   efforts to be made on special occasions and those extraordinary tasks
   put a tremendous strain upon the soul. It was a superhuman effort when
   the 300 brave warriors remained with Gideon--over thirty thousand of
   his first great army melted away--but the 300 stalwarts stood fast. It
   may seem to you to be simple enough to stand fast when thirty thousand
   flee, but you will not find it so if ever you are put to the test! And
   then to go down, in the dead of night, under Gideon's
   leadership--against at least a hundred and fifty thousand
   Midianites--with lamps, pitchers, and trumpets as their only weapons,
   might seem a small thing to do, but it took courageous men to do such a
   daring deed as that, and to believe that by such a simple stratagem God
   would defeat their numerous foes! O Sirs, believe me, faith is not
   child's play! And though a simple faith, exercised from day to day
   about ordinary things, is not to be despised, yet there come special
   moments when you must have the faith of God's elect, and an elect
   faith, too, and a high degree of it! And if you have that and exert it
   to the fullest, you will find that it will tell upon your whole frame.

   These men had also experienced the strain of great success. Stand still
   and see that mighty host dividing into parties and beginning to slay
   one another! Behold the whole power of Midian suddenly broken! Oh, the
   joy that must have filled the hearts of Gideon's three hundred! Their
   spirits must have leaped within them with ecstasy and delight--they
   must have felt that they could hardly contain themselves for very joy
   while God was working such a glorious deliverance! And if you have ever
   been indulged by your heavenly Father with some great success in
   service for the King, you have felt, afterwards, as if your moisture
   was turned into the drought of summer! It takes the very soul out of a
   man to see God at work and himself to be the instrument in the Lord's
   hands, of accomplishing some high and wondrous purpose of judgment or
   mercy! These three hundred men had endured a great strain upon their
   faith and they had also had that which is a greater strain, still--the
   triumph of their faith in God! And so, exhausted and worn out, they
   were ready to faint.

   Beside that, remember, dear Friends, that these men had put forth great
   strength. It was not merely mental wear and tear that they had to
   endure, but there was much actual conflict with the enemy. At first the
   Midianites killed one another, but after they took to flight, Gideon's
   men pursued them up hill and down dale, slaying them wherever they
   could, for they would not leave one of these enemies of their country
   who had dared to invade the land of the holy. They resolved to cut them
   all off. It was a hard day's work and they had done many deeds of
   daring and now, as they go by Succoth, they are faint though they are
   still pursuing the flying foe. If you, dear Brothers and Sisters, will
   give yourselves wholly to God's work, although you will never get tired
   of it, you will often get tired in it. If a man has never tired himself
   with working for God, I should think he never has done any work that
   was worth doing. If a Sister has never spent herself in trying to win
   souls, I should suppose that the number of souls which she will win
   will be very few, indeed. We can never expect God's blessing on our
   work till every faculty of our being is awakened and the whole of our
   strength is put forth in the Divine service. Now, if this is the case
   with us, it is no wonder if sometimes we get weary and feel ready to
   faint.

   Note, also, that these brave men had endured a long march. They had
   first fought the battle in the night and this had been followed by the
   pursuit of the enemy during the day. They needed to prevent them from
   crossing the fords and, all along that forced march there had been
   fighting--and the fighting after a battle is often the most severe.
   Many generals

   have been able to win a battle, but they have not known how to use it
   after they have won it. The toughest part of the fight full often is
   after the enemy begins to flee--and these men had endured a long day of
   this trying work. Now, dear Friends, I believe that it is very often
   not the pace, but the time that makes Christian people tired. When I
   have thought the matter over, I have many times said that I could die
   for Christ, by His Grace, if I might lay my head down on a block and
   have it chopped off at once. I think that I could endure that. But what
   about being roasted alive by a slow fire? Well, that is a different
   matter. One might feel, in such a case, that human strength would very
   soon be dried up. Ah, dear Friends, to stand bravely for Christ for a
   week or two is a simple matter--but to keep on, month after month, and
   year after year, is another affair!

   It is the length of life that tries the reality of religion. Some are
   able to stand against the temptations of youth and yet succumb amid the
   business of middle life. And alas, as many horses fall at the bottom of
   the hill, so we have known many men who have sinned sadly in old age.
   In fact, as nearly as I can recollect, all the great falls recorded in
   Scripture are those of old men, or of persons far beyond the age of
   youth--as if to teach us that when we think that we have grown wise by
   experience, we shall be great fools if we trust, even then, to
   ourselves. But it is that length of endurance, that year after year of
   trial, that long fight of affliction, or that long-continued temptation
   that tries the man--and it is of little wonder if, sometimes, the very
   heroes of the Cross are faint and weary.

   And, once more, these brave men had taken no refreshment. We read that
   the people took victuals in their hand when they went down to the
   fight, but that food was all gone, for soldiers have fine appetites
   when they have had much to do, and they grow very faint if they cannot
   get refreshment. Ah, dear children of God, if you live where you do not
   hear the Gospel faithfully preached, I do not wonder if you faint! Or,
   if you have given up hearing the Word, and have been busying yourself,
   always teaching, it may be that you have been giving out too much and
   taking in too little. I like the plan adopted by many of our dear
   friends who come here on Sunday mornings--they are always here in the
   morning, but they are never here on Sabbath evenings. Where are they?
   They are happily engaged in some good and gracious work! But they will
   not give up the hearing in the morning, for that, they say, is their
   week's meal and strengthens them for service during the rest of the
   day. I think that they do wisely.

   Young Christians, especially, cannot do without their food. There are
   not many of us who would be in vigorous health if we did not have our
   regular food and I do not think that the majority of Christians can
   afford to be so busy in the Master's service as not to get
   opportunities for meditation, contemplation and hearing and studying
   the Word of God. Perhaps some Brother here may be faint, tonight, for
   that very reason, and he may receive a hint that it is necessary for
   him to take refreshment if he is to go on with his work. "Come you,
   yourselves apart, into a desert place, and rest awhile," said Christ to
   His disciples and, as to the people who followed Him, when He saw them
   hungry and faint, He multiplied the loaves and fishes and fed them to
   the fullest, and they were revived.

   But, Beloved, what child of God, who engages faithfully in the work and
   warfare of this life, does not, at times, feel ready to faint? Stand in
   the position of one who finds himself deserted by those who seemed to
   be his friends but who prove faithless and, without a protest for the
   Truth of God, glide away in the general current of error--your heart
   grows sick as you think of the cowards who ought to have been at your
   side in the battle for the standard. Your soul is ready to faint as you
   note the slackness of others whom you do not suspect of going astray,
   but who, in the day of battle, are like Meroz and come not up to the
   help of the Lord against the mighty! Battling for Christ in the midst
   of the crowd where you need hundreds of helpers, but can scarcely find
   one--trying to carry the Light of God into some of the dark slums of
   London, thinking that every Christian will sympathize with you, but
   finding that none do so--these are the trials that make even brave
   hearts feel faint!

   Well, Brothers and Sisters, I think I have said enough, and, perhaps,
   too much, upon that first point--the weakness of the flesh--so I turn
   with great pleasure to the next point.

   II. In the second place, let us admire THE STRENGTH OF DIVINE GRACE.
   These 300 men were "faint, yet pursuing." They could march but slowly,
   but they did march! They could strike but feebly, but they did strike!

   Observe that although they were faint, they were not faint in heart.
   They still believed. They still had a brave stomach for the fight. They
   had not wavered in their resolution--they meant to still go
   forward--they intended to conquer the enemies of their country before
   them, or die in the attempt, and not one of them proposed to turn back!
   They were "faint, yet pursuing." Every man of them kept on the track of
   the Midianites. They were still determined to go forward. They did

   not demand substitutes, saying, "We have done so much, now let somebody
   else come in and finish the work." No, no, they were still pursuing,
   each man resolved that his own right arm should wield his weapon till
   the fray was over.

   Nor did they rest on their laurels. Some of us, perhaps, would have
   done so if we had been in their places. We might have said, "We have
   done bravely, we have already broken the neck of Midian, we are
   victors--there is no need to do more." No, but they reckoned that
   nothing was done while there was anything undone! They were not content
   while a single enemy lived! They must carry the warfare right through
   to the bitter end and they meant to do it. Sternly resolved were they
   that though they were faint, and even if they died, they would die with
   their faces to the enemy, fighting for the Lord God of Israel! Brothers
   in Christ, is not that our resolve tonight? My Christian Sisters, do
   you not feel the same? We have lifted our hands to the Lord and we will
   never go back--we could not give up His Truth, His love His service! To
   whom should we go if we left our Lord? If we did not keep on pursuing,
   what would we do? Lie still we cannot--there is a something in us which
   will not let us rest while there is work to be done for God--by which
   Christ can be glorified!

   These men were driven forward by hope. Although they were faint, they
   felt that He who had brought them so far would bring them through to
   the end. He had done so much for them that they might have said--

   "His love in time past forbids us to think He'll leave us, at last,
   with hunger to sink," and so they kept on, hopeful, still, that they
   should win a complete victory! They were resolved that if it were not
   so, yet they would still keep on. So let it be with us. If I am faint,
   I will still continue fighting against sin. If everybody else forsakes
   the Cross, yet a genuine Christian cannot. If every flag were taken
   away and rolled in the mire, our Master should still find us, by His
   Grace, prepared to bear disgrace and dishonor for His sake, and to
   still cling to the grand old cause, "faint, yet pursuing."

   Now, Beloved, you who are here, tonight, may belong to various classes
   and faintness may come upon you in reference to different things. Let
   me just mention them in the hope that the strength of Grace may come to
   you even as it did to Gideon's band.

   Are you a student, my dear Brother? Are you studying the Scriptures?
   Are you endeavoring to learn the deep things of God? Do you know that
   you have learned very little as yet? Do the great mysteries stagger
   you? Are you driven to feel what a fool you are? Have you come to those
   great deeps where such as you can never see the bottom? Ah, well,
   though you are faint in your study of the Scripture, still pursue it!
   Get close to the Word of God--search it through and through, study it,
   meditate on it, give yourself wholly to it, seek to know all that God
   has revealed--for the things which are revealed, however mysterious
   they are, belong to you. If you are faint in the pursuit of Divine
   Truth, yet continue to pursue

   it!

   Perhaps you are fighting against some inbred sin. It may be that I
   address some who see a swarm of sins within their nature. By God's
   Grace you have determined to put every sin to the sword, but you have
   been baffled by their numbers and their strength. This very morning,
   when you got up, you thought that you would make this the holiest day
   you have ever lived, but it has been a very poor day, after all. The
   other week, when you went to business, you said to yourself, "By God's
   help, I will show all I meet today how a Christian can live." But you
   tripped and stumbled very sorrowfully. Well now, my dear Brother, you
   are faint because of these failures. Yet, I pray you, do not give up
   the struggle, for God will help you! In the power of His Spirit you are
   able to overcome these sins and you may yet sing, "Thanks be to God,
   which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." Up and at
   them, Brothers! If faint, yet still be pursuing! The Lord help you in
   this

   battle!

   Possibly, you are a worker for Christ. You have begun well--I am
   thankful that you have begun. After continuing a little time in the
   Lord's service, you do not want to give it up, but you do not seem to
   get on at it, and Satan has been saying to you, "You might as well give
   it up, for you are doing no good. Do not worry yourself with that work
   any longer." There is a friend who is not Satan, but perhaps Satan is
   using that friend and getting that friend to say to you, "This work
   will be too much for you. I know it will. You are not adapted for it,
   why do you not take things more easily?" Ah, but, dear Friend, permit
   me to say to you, "If you are faint, yet still be pursuing. There is a
   great blessing coming and the devil does not want you to receive it.
   Defeat the devil by giving yourself more earnestly than ever to the
   cause of your Lord, for, depend upon it, there is something going to
   happen, soon, that will abundantly repay you and the arch-enemy wants
   to prevent you from getting the blessing."

   Is the conflict concerning prayer? Have you been pleading for a soul
   and you have not yet won the victory? Is it your husband? Is it your
   wayward boy? Is it a friend? Have you been at Jabbok, near where Gideon
   was at this very time? Have you wrestled with the Angel? Have you been
   expecting to prevail and have you not yet been successful, and has
   something said to you, "Do not pray about it any more"? Oh, Beloved, if
   that is the case, I beg you to pluck up courage! Though faint, yet
   still be pursuing! Continue pleading with God and do not let the Angel
   go until He blesses you!

   Or, once more, have you been bearing witness for the Truth of God and,
   in bearing witness for it have you met with losses and crosses? Have
   you been brought under suspicion and misrepresentation? Have you lost
   some of your dearest friends and have they even become your bitter
   enemies? Do you get very faint and are you tempted to say, "Why should
   I protest? Let things go as they will. The age is rotten through and
   through--what is the use of my standing out?" Oh, say not so! Where
   would the Reformation have been if it had not been for two or three
   brave hearts? How will any Truth of God be preserved in the world if
   men are craven and chicken-hearted? No, my Brother, speak not so, but
   rather say, tonight, "Though I may appear to achieve nothing by my
   protest, that is not my affair. My business is to do my duty-- results
   must rest with God and, by His Grace, faint as I am, I will still be
   pursuing."

   III. Now I close by pointing out to you THE LESSONS OF EXAMPLE that we
   may learn from Gideon's brave men.

   The first lesson is this--Serve the Lord. Brothers and Sisters, we are
   saved by Grace. Some of us were saved years ago. We were washed in the
   blood of the Lamb and clothed in the righteousness of Christ. We
   rejoice in a finished work whereby we are saved. Now let us serve
   because we have been saved and let us serve our Lord to the last
   fragment of strength! I do not think that Christ can be rightly served
   with half our manhood--it must be with the whole of our powers. All my
   goods, all my alms, all my talents, all that I can invent, all that I
   can achieve I must give to Him. Is there any part of us that we dare
   reserve for self? Shall the broad arrow of the King never be stamped on
   this or that portion of our being? Ah, then, a curse will come upon us!
   No, let it not be so, but let us give Him all the strength we have
   until we become fairly exhausted and are ready to faint--and even then
   let us be pursuing!

   Let us also serve the Lord when every movement is painful, when even to
   think is wearisome. These men were faint. You know what it is for a
   soldier to be faint--it is no nonsense, no pretence, it is real
   fainting. To go running on when you are ready to faint--to keep right
   on when you are ready to drop--this is very trying work, but let us do
   it, Brothers and Sisters, by God's Grace! Some people only pray when
   they feel like praying, but we need most to pray when we feel that we
   cannot pray. If we were only to preach--some of us--when we felt like
   preaching, we would not often preach! If some people I know would only
   give when they felt like giving, they would never give! Perhaps, for
   that matter, they never do. But you are not to do a thing merely when
   it is a pleasure to you. Do it when it is a pain to you! When faint,
   yet be pursuing! When, instead of your legs carrying you, you have to
   drag your legs along the ground, yet still pursue the enemy! When you
   feel that, absolutely, you could not go another foot, yet still go many
   another yard, for there is such a thing as doing as much as you can and
   yet, by Divine Power and Grace, keeping on after that. The work that
   you felt you could not do will have more acceptance with God than that
   which you performed in your ordinary strength.

   Serve the Lord when every movement is painful and serve Him when
   difficulties thicken. There were only 300 of Gideon's men and there
   were fifteen thousand of the enemy--and the people who ought to have
   been their friends would not even give them a loaf of bread to eat.
   Then is the time to serve the Lord! There is little in your service
   when everybody says, "Hurrah"--but there is something in the man who
   can follow the Lord when they cry, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" To run
   with the crowd--any fool can do that. But to face that crowd and go the
   other way. To stand alone, like a bronze pillar that cannot be stirred
   though the whole earth should push against you--there is something in
   such action that is worthy of the Grace of God! And it is true Grace,
   alone, that helps a man to act thus. Brothers and Sisters, do not count
   the difficulties--count your God as everything and let the rest go
   which way they will. The more difficulties there are, the better, and
   the fewer friends, the better--there shall be the more glory to the
   Grace that helps you in your loneliness to stand firm and to be
   faithful to your God.

   Next, be stimulated by past success. Success for God is good. You win a
   victory over the Midianites and you feel faint. Do not faint. Why? It
   does not become you to faint after that victory. You who are red to the
   elbows with the blood of the enemy, are you going to faint? You who
   just now smote Oreb and Zeeb, are you going to turn cowards? You know
   what confusion there is in battle when a standard-bearer faints. Look,
   the standard begins to tremble! It falls almost down. Somebody holds it
   up, but the standard-bearer faints, and down goes the banner and
   everybody thinks that the battle is

   lost! Standard-bearer, standard-bearer, I beseech you, do not faint!
   Cry to your God, standard-bearer, for so many depend upon you! Teacher
   of a class, minister of a congregation, leader of a clan--stand in the
   strength of Jehovah, Himself, and having done all, stand!

   Lastly, be hopeful when you are feeblest, just as these men were.
   "Faint, yet pursuing." When there were so very, very, very few of them,
   and they were faint, then they expected victory! And when there are
   very, very few of us, and we, too, are weary and fainting, then,
   perhaps, our extremity will be God's opportunity. Watch the hourglass.
   How fast the sands are falling! The time is almost up--there are only
   two or three grains, yet, to trickle down. Just so, but when the hour
   is up, then God's eternity comes in! When our time comes to an end,
   then God's great leisure shall come to an end, too, and He will pluck
   His right hand out of His bosom and He will do a work in our day that
   shall make the ears of them that hear thereof to tingle! Therefore,
   beloved Brothers and Sisters, let us give ourselves more to Christ than
   ever!

   As for you who do not belong to Jesus, to whom do you belong? You who
   are not servants of Christ, whose servants are you? Tremble, I pray
   you, for your master pays terrible wages--"The wages of sin is death."
   Remember the rest of the verse, "but the gift of God is eternal life
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." God grant us that glorious gift, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON: Judges 7:19-25; Judges 8:1-27.

   Judges 7:19-21. So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came
   unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and
   they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke
   the pitchers that were in their hands. And the three companies blew the
   trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left
   hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they
   cried, The sword of the LORD and of Gideon! And they stood, every man
   in his place, round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried,
   and fled. This was in the dead of night, when the hosts of Midian were
   fast asleep. They were startled from their slumbers by the blast of 300
   trumpets, and the flaming of 300 torches. They gathered that these were
   only the bugles and the lamps at the head of vast regiments of the
   Israelites and they hardly dared to calculate how great the whole host
   must have been! Filled with fear--astonished at the sound of the
   trumpets and the shouting of Gideon's band all round their camp, they
   took to their heels--"all the host ran and cried and

   fled."

   22. And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every
   man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host. They were
   a motley company, every man afraid of his fellow. They had gathered
   together to share the spoil and now, when fear demoralized them, the
   hordes of wild warriors began to destroy one another!

   22-23. And the host fled to Beth-Shittim in Zererath, and to the border
   of Abel-Meholah, unto Tabbath. And the men of Israel gathered
   themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all
   Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. If some have the courage to
   strike the enemy, there are others who will come out of their hiding
   places to hunt the beaten foe. When you really need help, often you
   cannot get it. But when you can afford to do without assistance, you
   will sometimes be embarrassed by it.

   24. And Gideon sent messengers throughout all Mount Ephraim, saying,
   Come down against the Midianites, and take them before the
   waters--"Secure the fords in the streams which flow into the Jordan
   from the mountainous region of Eph-raim so that the refugees cannot get
   away."

   24-25. Unto Beth-Barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered
   themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-Barah and Jordan.
   And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they
   slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of
   Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
   Gideon on the other side Jordan. So that, though they had been very
   backward at the first, yet, when they were once awakened, these men of
   Ephraim did their part in ridding the land of the common foe and, among
   the trophies of war, the heads of two of the princes of the Midianites
   fell into their hands.

   Judges 8:1. And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why have you served
   us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the
   Midianites. And they did chide with him sharply. We have some friends
   like these men of Ephraim who do not like being left out of the battle
   for the Lord. They say, "Why are we not asked for our help? Why are we
   not allowed to

   take our share?" These are very good people, but we have known some of
   them who have made these enquiries rather late in the day! These
   Ephraimites knew all about the war and they might have volunteered to
   help Gideon--and we would have been glad of the earlier help of some
   who tarried till the victory was won!

   2. And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?
   Gideon answered them very kindly and very wisely. He flattered them. He
   attached great importance to what they had done and took little credit
   to himself for his valiant service. In this he showed his self-command
   and his discretion. When persons chide sharply, it is a pity to chide
   back-- the best way of dealing with them is with a soft answer to turn
   away their wrath.

   2-5. Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the
   vintage of Abi-Ezer? God has delivered into your hands the princes of
   Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?
   Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. And
   Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men
   that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. And he said unto the men
   of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that
   follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and
   Zalmunna, kings of Midian. This was a very natural and a very
   reasonable request. Gideon did not ask the men of Succoth to come with
   him, nor even to give a lodging to his soldiers. The fear of Midian was
   upon Israel and the people were afraid to do anything against their
   oppressor, but surely they might have relieved the hunger of their
   fellow countrymen. Instead of doing so, they answered Gideon with
   arrogant and cruel words.

   6. And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
   now in your hands, that we should give bread unto your army? As much as
   to say, "What have you done, after all? There are fifteen thousand men
   with Zebah and Zal-munna, and there are only 300 of you. You have not
   even captured the leaders yet." They forgot that Gideon's band had
   slain a hundred and twenty thousand already--they underrated and mocked
   him--and would not give him the help he asked for.

   7. And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and
   Zalmunna into my hands, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of
   the wilderness and with briers. Some have said that this showed
   resentment and harshness, but when a man is at war, he is not in the
   habit of sprinkling his adversaries with rosewater. War is, in itself,
   so great an evil that there are many other evils necessarily connected
   with it. It seems to me that if, when Gideon was trying to deliver his
   own countrymen, they scoffed at him and refused him bread for his
   soldiers in the day of their hunger, they deserved to be punished with
   great severity.

   8. 9. And he went up to Penuel, and spoke unto them, likewise: and the
   men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him. And
   he spoke, also, unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in
   peace, I will break down this tower. They took liberty to speak rudely
   because theirs was a fortified city, guarded by a strong tower. And
   Gideon, not doubting that he would come back that way, God having given
   him the victory, said, "When I come again in peace, I will break down
   this tower."

   10, 11. Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
   them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts
   of the children of the East: for there fell an hundred and twenty
   thousand men that drew sword. And Gideon went up by the way of them
   that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Joybehah, and smote the
   host: for the host was secure. He went by an unusual route and took
   them at night, again unawares when they felt perfectly safe, and were
   sound asleep-- "for the host was secure." As I read these words, I
   think, what a pity it is ever to fancy ourselves secure while we are
   really in peril! Carnal security is a great danger. To be "safe in the
   arms of Jesus," is a most blessed condition, but to be secure in
   self-confidence is a thing that has a curse upon it.

   12. And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took
   the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the
   host. That was the end of the tyranny of the Midianites. Gideon slew
   great numbers of them and drove away such as yet remained alive.

   13-17. And Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from battle before the
   sun was up, and caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired
   of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
   elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men. And he came unto the
   men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom you did
   upbraid me, saying, are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your
   hands, that we should give bread unto your men that are weary? And he
   took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers,
   and with them he taught the men of Succoth. And he beat down the tower
   of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. He probably slew the most
   public revilers, the leading men of Penuel, even as he had chastised
   the princes and elders of Succoth with thorns and briers. I have often
   observed that you and I have

   been taught a great many things, "with the thorns of the wilderness and
   with briers." If we refuse to help God's weary and tried people, it is
   highly probable that, one of these days, we may have to learn a great
   deal from the thorns of the wilderness and from the briers! Do we ever
   learn much apart from the thorns of the wilderness? Surely, trials and
   troubles have been our great instructors from the first day even until
   now.

   18, 19. Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
   they whom you slew at Tabor?" And they answered, As you are, so were
   they; each one resembled the children of a king. And he said, They were
   my brothers, even the sons of my mother. In the East, there is much
   greater affection between those who are the sons of one mother than
   between those who are only sons of one father.

   19. As the Lord lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay
   you. But now it devolved upon him to be an avenger of blood according
   to Oriental law, and to put to death those who had slain his brothers.

   20-22. And he said unto Jether, his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
   the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a
   youth. Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall upon us: for as
   the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and
   Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
   Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule you over us, both you,
   and your son, and your son's son also: for you have delivered us from
   the hand of Midian. There was always an itching among the Israelites to
   have a king, an earthly monarch to rule over them, but God did not so
   design it. It was lack of loyalty and love to God that led them to make
   this request.

   23-27. And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
   shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. And Gideon
   said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give
   me, every man, the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings,
   because they were Ishmaelites). And they answered, We will willingly
   give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein, every man,
   the earrings of his prey. And the weight of the golden earrings that he
   requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside
   ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
   Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. And
   Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah:
   and all Israel went there whoring after it: which thing became a snare
   unto Gideon, and to his house. He did not set up an idol, but he made
   an ephod--an imitation of that wonderful vestment worn by the High
   Priest. Perhaps he made it of solid gold, not to be worn, but to be
   looked at, simply to remind the people of the worship of God and not to
   be, itself, worshipped. But ah, dear Friends, you see here that if we
   go half an inch beyond what God's Word warrants, we always get into
   mischief! You hear people say, "We have such and such symbols, not to
   worship, but to help us in worship." Ah, yes, but the tendency of the
   symbol is to act as a dam to the stream of devotion and to make it end
   there! God forbid that we should ever violate the rules that Christ has
   laid down for us! The slightest deviation from the simplicity of the
   Gospel may lead us away into sheer apostasy! Where have all the errors
   of Rome come from but from little accretions and alterations? A little
   ornament here, a little symbol there, and a little variation of the
   Truth of God yonder and the gigantic system of Romanism has thus been
   created! Gideon probably meant well and we may do wrong even though we
   mean well. May the Lord preserve us from the smallest departure from
   the Way that He has marked out for us in his Holy Word! Amen.

Christ's Dying Word for His Church

   (No. 2344)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 21, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 3, 1889.

   "It is finished." John 19:30.

   IN the original Greek of John's Gospel there is only one word for this
   utterance of our Lord. To translate it into English, we have to use
   three words, but when it was spoken, it was only one--an ocean of
   meaning in a drop of language, a mere drop, for that is all that we can
   call one word! "It is finished." Yet it would need all the other words
   that ever were spoken, or ever can be spoken, to explain this one word.
   It is altogether immeasurable! It is high--I cannot attain to it. It is
   deep--I cannot fathom it. "Finished." I can half imagine the tone in
   which our Lord uttered this word, with a holy glorying, a sense of
   relief, the bursting out of a heart that had long been shut up within
   walls of anguish. "Finished." It was a Conqueror's cry--it was uttered
   with a loud voice! There is nothing of anguish about it, there is no
   wailing in it. It is the cry of One who has completed a tremendous
   labor and is about to die--and before He utters His death-prayer,
   "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit," He shouts His life's
   last hymn in that one word, "Finished."

   May God the Holy Spirit help me to handle aright this text that is at
   once so small and yet so great! There are four ways in which I wish to
   look at it with you. First, I will speak of this dying saying of our
   Lord to His Glory. Secondly, I will use the text to the Church's
   comfort. Thirdly, I will try to handle the subject to every Believer's
   joy. And fourthly, I will seek to show how our Lord's Words ought to
   lead to our own awakening.

   I. First, then, I will endeavor to speak of this dying saying of Christ
   TO HIS GLORY. Let us begin with that.

   Jesus said, "It is finished." Let us glory in Him that it is finished.
   You and I may well do this when we remember how very few things we have
   finished. We begin many things and, sometimes, we begin well. We
   commence running like champions who must win the race, but soon we
   slacken our pace and we fall exhausted on the course. The race
   commenced is never completed. In fact, I am afraid that we have never
   finished anything perfectly. You know what we say of some pieces of
   work, "Well, the man has done it, but there is no, 'finish,' about it."
   No, and you must begin with, "finish," and go on with, "finish," if you
   are, at last, able to say broadly as the Savior said without any
   qualification, "It is finished."

   What was it that was finished? His lifework and His atoning Sacrifice
   on our behalf. He had interposed between our souls and Divine Justice
   and He had stood in our place to obey and suffer on our behalf. He
   began this work early in life, even while He was a Child. He persevered
   in holy obedience 33 years. That obedience cost Him many a pang and
   groan. Now it is about to cost Him His life and, as He gives away His
   life to finish the work of obedience to the Father, and of redemption
   for us, He says, "It is finished." It was a wonderful work, even to
   contemplate--only Infinite Love would have thought of devising such a
   plan! It was a wonderful work to carry on for so long--only boundless
   patience would have continued at it--and now that it requires the
   offering of Himself and the yielding up of His earthly life, only a
   Divine Savior, very God of very God, would or could have consummated it
   by the surrender of His breath! What a work it was! Yet it was finished
   while you and I have lots of little things lying about that we have
   never finished. We have begun to do something for Jesus that would
   bring Him a little honor and glory, but we have never finished it. We
   did mean to glorify Christ--have not some of you intended, oh, so much?
   Yet it has never come to anything. But Christ's work, which cost Him
   heart and soul, body and spirit--cost Him everything--even His death on
   the Cross! He pushed through all that till it was accomplished and He
   could say, "It is finished."

   To whom did our Savior say, "It is finished"? He said it to all whom it
   might concern, but it seems to me that He chiefly said it to His
   Father, for, immediately after, apparently in a lower tone of voice, He
   said, "Father, into Your hands I com-

   mend My spirit." Beloved, it is one thing for me to say to you, "I have
   finished my work"--possibly, if I were dying, you might say that I had
   finished my work--but for the Savior to say that to God, to hang in the
   Presence of Him whose eyes are as a flame of fire, the great Reader and
   Searcher of all hearts. For Jesus, I say, to look the dread Father in
   the face and say, as He bowed His head, "Father, it is finished; I have
   finished the work which You gave Me to do"--oh, who but He could
   venture to make such a declaration as that? We can find a thousand
   flaws in our best works! And when we lie dying, we shall still have to
   lament our shortcomings and excesses. But there is nothing of
   imperfection about Him who stood as Substitute for us and, unto the
   Father, Himself, He can say, concerning all His work, "It is finished."
   Therefore, glorify Him tonight! Oh, glorify Him in your hearts,
   tonight, that even in the Presence of the Great Judge of all, your
   Surety and your Substitute is able to claim perfection for all His
   service!

   Just think also, for a minute or two, now that you have remembered what
   Jesus finished, and to whom He said that He had finished it, how truly
   He had finished it. From the beginning to the end of Christ's life
   there is nothing omitted, no single act of service ever left undone!
   Neither is there any action of His slurred over, or performed in a
   careless manner. "It is finished," refers as much to His Childhood as
   to His death. The whole of the service that He was to render to God,
   when He came here in human form, was finished in every single part and
   portion of it. I take up a piece of a cabinet-maker's work and it bears
   a good appearance. I open the lid and am satisfied with the
   workmanship. But there is something about the hinge that is not
   properly finished. Or, perhaps, if I turn it over and look at the
   bottom of the box, I shall see that there is a piece that has been
   scratched, or that one part has not been well planed or properly
   polished.

   But if you examine the Master's work right through--if you begin at
   Bethlehem and go on to Golgotha and look minutely at every portion of
   it, the private as well as the public, the silent as well as the spoken
   part--you will find that it is finished, completed, perfected! We may
   say of it that, among all works, there is none like it! It is a
   multitude of perfections joined together to make up one absolute
   perfection! Therefore, let us glorify the name of our blessed Lord.
   Crown Him! Crown Him, for He has done His work well! Come, you saints,
   speak much to His honor and in your hearts keep on singing to the
   praise of Him who did so thoroughly, so perfectly, all the work which
   His Father gave Him to do!

   In the first place, then, we use our Lord's words to His Glory. Much
   might be said upon such a theme, but time will not permit it.

   II. Secondly, we will use the text TO THE CHURCH'S COMFORT.

   I am persuaded that it was so intended to be used, for none of the
   Words of our Lord on the Cross are addressed to His Church but this
   one. I cannot believe that when He was dying He left His people, for
   whom He died, without a word. "Father, forgive them; for they know not
   what they do," is for sinners, not for saints. "I thirst," is for
   Himself, and so is that bitter cry, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" "Woman, behold your son!" is for Mary. "Today shall you
   be with Me in Paradise," is for the penitent thief. "Into Your hands I
   commend My spirit," is for the Father. Jesus must have had something to
   say, in the hour of death, for His Church and, surely, this is His
   dying word for her! He tells her, shouting it in her ear that has
   become dull and heavy with despair, "It is finished." "It is finished,
   O My redeemed one, My bride, My well-beloved for whom I came to lay
   down My life. It is finished, the work is done!"--

   "Love's redeeming work is done.

   Fought the fight, the battle won." "Christ loved the Church and gave
   Himself for it." John, in the Revelation, speaks of the Redeemer's work
   as already accomplished and, therefore, He sings, "Unto Him that loved
   us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings
   and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion
   forever and ever. Amen." This Truth of God is full of comfort to His
   people.

   And, first, as it concerns Christ, do you not feel greatly comforted to
   think that He is no longer to be humiliated? His suffering and shame
   are finished. I often sing, with sacred exultation and pleasure, those
   lines of Dr. Watts--

   "No more the bloody spear!

   The Cross and nails no more,

   For Hell itself shakes at His name

   And all the heavens adore.

   There His full glories shine

   With uncreated rays,

   And bless His saints' and angels' eyes

   To everlasting days." I also like that expression in another of our
   hymns--

   "Now both the Surety and sinner are free." Not only are they free for
   whom Christ became a Surety, but He, Himself, is forever free from all
   the obligations and consequences of His Suretyship. Men will never spit
   in His face again! The Roman soldiers will never scourge Him again!
   Judas, where are you? Behold the Christ sitting upon His Great White
   Throne, the glorious King who was once the Man of Sorrows! Now, Judas,
   come and betray Him with a kiss! What, man, dare you not do it? Come,
   Pilate, and wash your hands in pretended innocence and say, now, that
   you are guiltless of His blood! Come, you scribes and Pharisees, and
   accuse Him and oh, you Jewish mob and Gentile rabble, newly risen from
   the grave, shout now, "Away with Him! Crucify Him!" But look! They flee
   from Him! They cry to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us
   from the face of Him that sits on the Throne!" Yet that is the face
   that was more marred than any man's--the face of Him whom they once
   despised and rejected. Are you not glad to think that they cannot
   despise Him now, that they cannot entreat Him now?--

   "'Tis past--that agonizing hour

   Of torture and of shame" and Jesus says of it, "It is finished."

   We derive further comfort and joy as we think that not only are
   Christ's pangs and sufferings finished, but His Father's will and Word
   have had a perfect completion. Certain things were written that were to
   be done and these are done. Whatever the Father required has been
   rendered. "It is finished." My Father will never say to me, "I cannot
   save you by the death of My Son, for I am dissatisfied with His work."
   Oh, no, Beloved, God is well pleased with Christ and with us in Him!
   There is nothing which was arranged in the eternal mind to be done! No,
   not a jot or tittle--Christ has done it all! As His eyes, those eyes
   that often wept for us, reads down the ancient writing, Christ is able
   to say, "I have finished the work which My Father gave Me to do.
   Therefore, be comforted, O My people, for My Father is well pleased
   with Me and well pleased with you in Me!"

   I like, sometimes, when I am in prayer, to say to the great Father,
   "Father, look on Your Son. Is He not all loveliness? Are there not in
   Him unutterable beauties? Do You not delight in Him? If You have looked
   on me and grown sick of me, as well You may, now refresh Yourself by
   looking on Your Well-Beloved. Delight Yourself in Him--

   "'Him, and then the sinner see, Look through Jesus' wounds on me.'" The
   perfect satisfaction of the Father with Christ's work for His people so
   that Christ could say, "It is finished," is a ground of solid comfort
   to His Church forevermore!

   Dear Friends, once more, take comfort from this, "It is finished," for
   the redemption of Christ's Church is perfected! There is not another
   penny to be paid for her full release. There is no mortgage upon
   Christ's inheritance. Those whom He bought with blood are forever clear
   of all charges, paid for to the utmost! There was a handwriting of
   ordinances against us, but Christ has taken it away, He has nailed it
   to His Cross. "It is finished," finished forever. All those
   overwhelming debts which would have sunk us to the lowest Hell have
   been discharged--and they who believe in Christ may appear with
   boldness even before the Throne of God, itself. "It is finished." What
   comfort there is in this glorious Truth of God!--

   "Lamb of God! Your death has given Pardon, peace, and hope of Heaven!
   'It is finished,'let us raise Songs of thankfulness and praise!" And I
   think that we may say to the Church of God that when Jesus said, "It is
   finished," her ultimate triumph was secured. "Finished!" By that one
   Word He declared that He had broken the head of the old dragon. By His
   death Jesus has routed the hosts of darkness and crushed the rising
   hopes of Hell. We have a stern battle yet to fight--nobody can tell
   what may await the Church of God in years to come--it would be idle for
   us to attempt to prophesy. But it looks as if there are to be sterner
   times and darker days than we have ever yet known, but what of that?
   Our Lord has defeated the foe and we have to fight with one who is
   already vanquished! The old serpent has been crushed, his head is
   bruised, and we have, now, to trample on him. We have this sure Word of
   promise to encourage us, "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under
   your feet shortly." Surely, "It is finished," sounds like the trumpet
   of victory! Let us have faith to claim that victory

   through the blood of the Lamb! And let every Christian, here--let the
   whole Church of God, as one mighty army take comfort from this dying
   Word of the now risen and ever-living Savior--"It is finished." His
   Church may rest perfectly satisfied that His work for her is fully
   accomplished!

   III. Now, thirdly, I want to use this expression, "It is finished," TO
   EVERY BELIEVER'S JOY. When our Lord said, "It is finished," there was
   something to make every Believer in Him glad. What did that utterance
   mean? You and I have believed in Jesus of Nazareth. We believe Him to
   be the Messiah, sent of God. Now, if you will turn to the Old
   Testament, you will find that the marks of the Messiah are very many
   and very complicated. And if you will then turn to the life and death
   of Christ, you will see in Him every mark of the Messiah plainly
   exhibited. Until He had said, "It is finished," and until He had
   actually died, there was some doubt that there might be some one
   prophecy unfulfilled--but now that He hangs upon the Cross, every mark,
   every sign and every token of His Messiahship has been fulfilled and He
   says, "It is finished." The life and death of Christ and the types of
   the Old Testament fit each other like hand and glove. It would be quite
   impossible for any person to write the life of a man, by way of
   fiction, and then in another book to write out a series of types,
   personal and sacrificial, and to make the character of the man fit all
   the types--even if he had permission to make both books, he could not
   do it. If he were allowed to make both the lock and the key, he could
   not do it, but here we have the lock made beforehand! In all the Books
   of the Old Testament, from the prophecy in the Garden of Eden right
   down to Malachi, the last of the Prophets, there were certain marks and
   tokens of the Christ. All these were so very singular that it did not
   appear as if they could all meet in one Person. But they did all meet
   in One--every one of them--whether it concerned some minute point or
   some prominent characteristic! When the Lord Jesus Christ had ended His
   life, He could say, "It is finished; My life has tallied with all that
   was said of it from the first Word of prophecy even to the last." Now,
   that ought greatly to encourage your faith! You are not following
   cunningly-devised fables, but you are following One who must be the
   Messiah of God since He so exactly fits all the Prophecies and all the
   Types that were given before concerning

   Him!

   "It is finished." Let every Believer be comforted in another respect,
   that every honor which the Law of God could require has been rendered
   to it. You and I have broken that Law, as all the race of mankind has
   broken it! We have tried to thrust God from His Throne. We have
   dishonored His Law. We have broken His Commandments willfully and
   wickedly. But there has come One who is, Himself, God, the Law-Giver,
   and He has taken human Nature, and in that Nature He has kept the Law
   perfectly! And, inasmuch as the Law had been broken by man, He has in
   the Nature of man borne the sentence due for all man's transgressions.
   The Godhead, being linked with the Manhood, gave supreme virtue to all
   that the Manhood suffered. And Christ, in life and in death, has
   magnified the Law and made it honorable. And God's Law at this day is
   raised to even greater honor than it had before man broke it! The death
   of the Son of God, the Sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, has
   vindicated the great moral principle of God's government and made His
   Throne to stand out gloriously before the eyes of men and angels
   forever and ever! If Hell were filled with men, it would not be such a
   vindication of Divine Justice as when God spared not His own Son, but
   delivered Him up for us all, and made Him to die, the Just for the
   unjust, to bring us to God! Now let every Believer rejoice in the great
   fact that, by the death of Christ, the Law of God is abundantly
   honored! You can be saved without impugning the holiness of God! You
   are saved without putting any stain upon the Divine statute-book! The
   Law is kept and mercy triumphs, too.

   And, Beloved, here is included, of necessity, another comforting Truth.
   Christ might well say, "It is finished," for every solace conscience
   can need is now given. When your conscience is disturbed and troubled,
   if it knows that God is perfectly honored and His Law vindicated, then
   it becomes easy. Men are always starting some new theory of the
   Atonement and one has said, lately, that the Atonement was simply meant
   as an easement to the conscience of men. It is not so, my Brothers and
   Sisters--there would be no easing of the conscience by anything that
   was meant for that, alone. Conscience can only be satisfied if God is
   satisfied! Until I see how the Law is vindicated, my troubled
   conscience can never find rest. Dear Heart, are your eyes red with
   weeping? Look to Him who hangs on the tree! Is your heart heavy, even
   to despair? Look to Him who hangs on the tree and believe in Him! Take
   Him to be your soul's atoning Lamb, suffering in your place. Accept Him
   as your Representative, dying your death that you may live His life,
   bearing your sin that you may be made the righteousness of God in Him!
   This is the best quietus in the world for every fear that conscience
   can raise--let every Believer know that it is so.

   Once more, there is joy to every Believer when he remembers that, as
   Christ said, "It is finished," every guarantee was given of the eternal
   salvation of all the redeemed. It appears to me that if Christ finished
   the work for us, He will finish the work in us. If He has undertaken so
   supreme a labor as the redemption of our souls by blood and that is
   finished, then the great, but yet minor labor of renewing our natures
   and transforming us even unto perfection, shall be finished, too! If,
   when we were sinners, Christ loved us so as to die for us, now that He
   has redeemed us, and has already reconciled us to Himself, and made us
   His friends and His disciples, will He not finish the work that is
   necessary to make us fit to stand among the golden lamps of Heaven and
   to sing His praises in the country where nothing that defiles can ever
   enter?--

   "The work which His goodness began,

   The arm of His strength will complete!

   His promise is yes and Amen,

   And never was forfeited yet!

   Things future, nor things that are now,

   Not all things below nor above,

   Can make Him His purpose forego,

   Or sever my soul from His love!" I believe it, my Brothers and Sisters.
   He who has said, "It is finished," will never leave anything undone! It
   shall never be said of Him, "This Man began, but was not able to
   finish." If He has bought me with His blood and called me by His Grace,
   and I am resting on His promise and power, I shall be with Him where He
   is, and I shall behold His Glory, as surely as He is Christ the Lord
   and I believe in Him! What comfort this Truth of God brings to every
   child of God!

   Are there any of you, here, who are trying to do something to make a
   righteousness of your own? How dare you attempt such a work when Jesus
   says, "It is finished"! Are you trying to put a few of your own merits
   together, a few odds and ends, fig leaves and filthy rags of your own
   righteousness? Jesus says, "It is finished." Why do you want to add
   anything of your own to what He has completed? Do you say that you are
   not fit to be saved? What? Have you to bring some of your fitness to
   eke out Christ's work? "Oh," you say, "I hope to come to Christ one of
   these days when I get better." What? What? What? What? Are you to make
   yourself better and then is Christ to do the rest of the work? You
   remind me of the railways to our country towns! You know that, often,
   the station is half-a-mile or a mile out of the town, so that you
   cannot get to the station without having an omnibus to take you there.
   But my Lord Jesus Christ comes right to the town of Mansoul! His
   railway runs close to your feet and there is the carriage door wide
   open--step in! You have not even to go over a bridge, or under a
   subway--there stands the carriage just before you. This royal railroad
   carries souls all the way from Hell's dark door, where they lie in sin,
   up to Heaven's great gate of pearl where they dwell in perfect
   righteousness forever! Cast yourself on Christ! Take Him to be
   everything you need, for He says of the whole work of salvation, "It is
   finished."

   I recollect the saying of a Scotchwoman who had applied to be admitted
   to the communion of the Church. Being thought to be very ignorant and
   little instructed in the things of God, she was put back by the elders.
   The minister also had seen her and thought that, at least for a while,
   she should wait. I wish I could speak Scotch, so as to give you her
   answer, but I am afraid that I would make a mistake if I tried it. It
   is a fine language, doubtless, for those who can speak it. She said
   something like this, "Aweel, Sir; aweel, Sir, but I ken ae thing. As
   the lintbell opens to the sun, so my heart opens to the name of Jesus."
   You have, perhaps, seen the flax flower shut itself up when the sun has
   gone and, if so, you know that whenever the sun has come back, the
   flower opens itself at once. "So," said the poor woman, "I know one
   thing, that as the flower opens to the sun, so my heart opens to the
   name of Jesus." Do you know that, Friends? Do you know that one thing?
   Then I do not care if you do not know much else! If that one thing is
   known by you, and if it is really so, you may be far from perfect in
   your own estimation, but you are a saved soul!

   One said to me, when she came to join the Church, and I asked her
   whether she was perfect, "Perfect? Oh, dear no, Sir! I wish that I
   could be." "Ah, yes!" I replied, "that would just please you, would it
   not?" "Yes, it would, indeed," she answered. "Well, then," I said,
   "that shows that your heart is perfect and that you love perfect
   things; you are pining after perfection--there is a something in you,
   an, 'I' in you, that sins not, but that seeks after that which is holy.
   And yet you do that which you would not, and you groan because you do,
   and the Apostle is like you when he says, 'It is no more I, the real I,
   that do it, but sin that dwells in me.'" May the Lord put that "I" into
   many of you, tonight, that "I" which will hate sin, that "I" which will
   find its Heaven in being perfectly free from sin, that "I" which will
   delight itself in the Almighty, that "I" which will sun itself in the
   smile of Christ, that "I" which will strike down every evil within as
   soon as ever it shows its head! So will you sing that familiar prayer
   of Toplady's that we have often sung--

   "Let the water and the blood From Your riven side which flowed, Be of
   sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power!" IV. I close
   by saying, in the fourth place, that we shall use this text, "It is
   finished, TO OUR OWN AWAKENING. Somebody once wickedly said, "Well, if
   Christ has finished it, there is nothing for me to do, now, but to fold
   my hands and go to sleep." That is the speech of a devil, not of a
   Christian! There is no Grace in the heart when the mouth can talk like
   that. On the contrary, the true child of God says, "Has Christ finished
   His work for me? Then tell me what work I can do for Him!" You remember
   the two questions of Saul of Tarsus. The first enquiry, after He had
   been struck down, was, "Who are You, Lord?" And the next was, "Lord,
   what will You have me to do?" If Christ has finished the work for you
   which you could not do, now go and finish the work for Him which you
   are privileged and permitted to do. Seek to--

   "Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,

   Snatch them in pity from sin and the gra ve. Weep over the erring one,
   Lift up the fallen,

   Tell them of Jesus, the Mghty to save." My inference from this saying
   of Christ, "It is finished," is this--Has He finished His work for me?
   Then I must get to work for Him and I must persevere until I finish my
   work, too--not to save myself, for that is all done--but because I am
   saved! Now I must work for Him with all my might and if there comes
   discouragements, if there comes sufferings, if there comes a sense of
   weakness and exhaustion, yet let me not give way to it, but, inasmuch
   as He pressed on till He could say, "It is finished," let me press on
   till I, too, shall be able to say, "I have finished the work which You
   gave me to do." You know how men who go fishing look out for the fish.
   I have heard of a man going to Keston Ponds on Saturday to fish and
   staying all day Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday! There was
   another man fishing there and the other man had only been there two
   days. He said, "I have been here two days and I have only had one
   bite." "Why," replied the other, "I have been here ever since last
   Saturday and I have not had a bite yet! But I mean to keep on." "Well,"
   answered the other, "I cannot keep on without catching something'"
   "Oh!" said number one, "but I have such a longing to catch some fish
   that I shall stay here till I do." I believe that fellow would
   ultimately catch some fish if there were any to be caught! He is the
   kind of fisherman to do it and we need to have men who feel that they
   must win souls for Christ--and that they will persevere till they do!
   It must be so with us, Brothers and Sisters--we cannot let men go down
   to Hell if there is any way of saving them!

   The next inference is that we can finish our work, for Christ finished
   His. You can put a lot of "finish" into your work and you can hold on
   to the end and complete the work by Divine Grace! And that Grace is
   waiting for you, that Grace is promised to you. Seek it, find it, get
   it! Do not act as some do, ah, even some who are before me now! They
   served God, once, and then they ran away from Him. They have come
   back--God bless them and help them to be more useful! But future
   earnest service will never make up for that sad gap in their earlier
   career. It is best to keep on, and on, and on, from the commencement to
   the close. May the Lord help us to persevere to the end, till we can
   truly say of our lifework, "It is

   finished"!

   One word of caution I must give you. Let us not think that our work is
   finished till we die. "Well," says one, "I was just going to say of my
   work, 'It is finished.'" Were you? Were you? I remember that when John
   Newton wrote a book about Grace in the blade, and Grace in the ear, and
   Grace in the full corn in the ear, a very talkative body said to him,
   "I have been reading your valuable book, Mr. Newton. It is a splendid
   work and when I came to that part, 'The full corn in the ear,' I
   thought how wonderfully you had described me." "Oh," replied Mr.
   Newton, "but you could not have read the book rightly, for it is one of
   the marks of the full corn in the ear that it hangs its head very low."
   So it is and when a man, in a careless, boastful spirit, says of his
   work, "It is finished," I am inclined to ask, "Brother, was it ever
   begun? If your work for Christ is finished, I should think that you
   never realized what it ought to be." As long as there is breath in our
   bodies, let us serve Christ! As long as we can think, as long as we can
   speak, as long as we can work, let us serve Him! Let us

   even serve Him with our last gasp and, if it is possible, let us try to
   set some work going that will glorify Him when we are dead and gone!
   Let us scatter some seed that may spring up when we are sleeping
   beneath the hillock in the cemetery. Ah, Beloved, we shall never have
   finished our work for Christ until we bow our heads and give up the
   ghost!

   The oldest friend here has a little something to do for the Master.
   Someone said to me, the other day, "I cannot think why old Mrs.
   So-and-So is spared--she is quite a burden to her friends." "Ah," I
   replied, "she has something yet to do for her Lord, she has another
   word to speak for Him." Sister, look up your work and get it done! And
   you, Brother, see what remains of your lifework yet incomplete. Wind
   off the ends, get all the little corners finished. Who knows how long
   it may be before you and I may have to give in our account? Some are
   called away very suddenly--they are apparently in good health one
   day--and they are gone the next! I should not like to leave a
   half-finished life behind me. The Lord Jesus Christ said, "It is
   finished," and your heart should say, "Lord, and I will finish,
   too--not to mix my work with Yours, but because You have finished
   Yours, I will, by Your Grace, finish mine."

   Now may the Lord give us the joy of His Presence at His Table! May the
   bread and wine speak to you much better than I can! May every heir of
   Heaven see Christ, tonight, and rejoice in His finished work, for His
   dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 121. AND 122.

   Psalm 121:1. I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from where comes my
   help. No help comes from anywhere else but from the eternal hills. Let
   us lift up our eyes, therefore, hopefully expecting help from the
   hills--it is on the road--it "comes." The Psalmist, with the eye of
   faith, could see it coming, so he watched its approach.

   2. My help comes from the LORD, who made Heaven and earth. He would
   sooner unmake them than desert His people. He that made Heaven and
   earth could certainly find shelter for us either in Heaven or in earth.
   He cannot, He will not leave us, He will make room for us in Heaven
   when there is no room for us here. What a blessed thing it is to look
   right away from the creature to the Creator! The creature may fail you,
   but the Creator is an ever-springing well of all-sufficient Grace.

   3. He will not suffer your foot to be moved. He will not endure it, He
   will not suffer it. Many would like to trip you up, but He will not
   allow it--He loves you too well.

   3. He that keeps you will not slumber. You may slumber, for you are
   frail, but He is a Watchman to whose eyes sleep never comes. You are
   always safe. Alexander went to sleep, he said, because Parmenio
   watched. And you may take the sleep of the beloved because Jehovah
   watches over you.

   4. Behold, He that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. Behold
   it, that is, mark it--put a nota bene at the side of it, take
   cognizance of this as a great and sure Truth of God! Jacob went to
   sleep with a stone for his pillow, but He that kept him did not sleep.
   He came to him in the night watches and revealed to him His Covenant.

   5. The Lord is your keeper: the LORD is your shade upon your right
   hand. Oh, what a Keeper we have! Can you not trust Him? Will you not be
   at peace in your mind if it is, indeed, true that Jehovah keeps you and
   is your Guard in the hour of danger?

   6. The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. Then,
   when can you get hurt? If you are protected both day and night, these
   make up all the time! God does not make a new sun for His people, the
   sun would smite us as well as others, but He takes the sting out of the
   sun's excessive brightness. And we have the same sickly moon as others
   have, with the same influences over us, but God takes care that the
   moonbeams do not harm His people. Neither the sun of prosperity nor the
   night of adversity--neither the light of Truth of God nor even the
   dimness of mystery shall injure one of the chosen seed.

   7. The LORD shall preserve you from all evil: He shall preserve your
   soul. That is the soul of our preservation--if the life, the soul, is
   kept, then are we altogether kept.

   8. The LORD shall preserve your going out and your coming in--Your
   early days of youth, when you are going out into life--and your coming
   in when the older days creep over you and you are coming into God and
   Heaven. Your going out into business and your coming in to private
   devotion.

   8. From this time forth, and even forevermore. Let us, therefore, feel
   restful at this time, and even forevermore, having the Lord for our
   Keeper and Preserver.

   Psalm 122:1. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the
   house of the LORD. I was glad for their sake, glad to think they were
   so willing to go. I was glad, also, for my own sake, for I was glad to
   go, too.

   2. Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem. Happy men who
   were citizens of such a city! Happy worshippers coming together to the
   place whose very name signifies the vision of peace, the metropolis of
   God, type of the New Jerusalem which is from above!

   3. Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together. Not a
   conglomeration of huts, but built as a city with substantial
   structures. And not a straggling city, like some we read of, that have
   been called, "cities of magnificent distances"--but it was "compact
   together." Happy is the Church that is at peace--blessed are the people
   who are joined together by a gracious brotherly love.

   4. Where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony
   of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. The Church is the
   point of meeting--"Where the tribes go up." The Church is the place of
   "testimony"--and saints go to hear testimony and to bear it. I wish
   there was more of this bearing testimony among Christian people and
   that they looked upon it as a sacred duty to tell others what God has
   told them. "To give thanks unto the name of the Lord"--that is another
   part of true worship--praise, joyful thanksgiving should be one of the
   saints' continual avocations. Let us not forget it at this time. Some
   are here who have been sick--let them give thanks unto the name of the
   Lord. Some are here who are still weak, yet able to come up with God's
   people--let us give thanks unto the name of the Lord. We have all some
   special mercy, some choice favor for which to praise His name. Then let
   us all give thanks unto the name of the Lord!

   5. For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of
   David. If any of the people had been wronged by the petty magistrates,
   they went up to Jerusalem and made their appeal to the king. Here may
   we bring our suit before God and order our case before Him, for He is
   true and just, and nothing shall go amiss that is left with Him.

   6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Pray for it now, breathe a silent
   prayer to God.

   6. They shall prosper that love You. God loves those who love His
   Church and love His cause--and He rewards them with prosperity, as much
   of earthly prosperity as they can bear, and prosperity to their souls
   beyond measure.

   7. Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palace. The
   Psalmist bade us pray and now he, himself, prays. He who bids others do
   a thing should be prepared to set the example.

   8. For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now pray, Peace be
   within you. Let us say it, for the sake of beloved ones in Heaven, and
   dear ones on earth who are on the way there, "Peace be within you."

   9. Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek your good. Not
   only pray for it, but work for it, give for it, live for it! "I will
   seek your good!" God bless to us these two Psalms and put us all in a
   right state of heart tonight! Amen.

Moses' Dying Charge to Israel

   (No. 2345)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 28, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   17, 1888.

   "And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you
   these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you,
   to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His
   commandments, or no." Deuteronomy 8:2.

   These are the words of Moses, the man of God, when he was near his
   departure. They make up a part of what has been called his "swan song."
   He did not often sing--he did give us at least one song, but when he
   came near the time he was to die, like the fabled swan, he began to
   sing--and most sweetly did he sing!

   Notice the intense earnestness of this address. It is, every way, that
   of a saint who has spent his life in loving anxiety for the people
   committed to his charge. And the ruling passion is very strong upon him
   to the last. He knows that he is about to depart from them, for he has
   had his marching orders--"Get you up into the top of Pisgah and lift up
   your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
   behold it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan."
   Knowing that he is about to leave the people, he is very anxious about
   their welfare and he addresses them with this deep earnestness.

   Note, also, how practical his earnestness is--it is concerning their
   lives that he speaks to the children of Israel. He knows how liable
   they are to fall into the superstitions of their neighbors, how likely
   they, who made a golden calf and angered the Lord and His servant, will
   be to turn, again, unto graven images and strange gods. And so he
   beseeches them, as with his dying breath, to observe all the
   Commandments of the Lord and to cleave closely unto Jehovah, their God.

   Then, like an old man, again, for this is a point that would be sure to
   come out in a venerable, soon-departing saint, he talks about the past.
   He has been preserved by his God for 120 years and, during the last 40
   of those years, he has been king in Jeshurun and the Lord has made him
   ride upon the high places of the earth in the wonders that he has
   worked by His hand. And he cannot help reminding the people that the
   marvels God has accomplished must not be dead things to them, not
   things to be laid by like mummies wrapped up in sere clothes--and
   hidden away in a sarcophagus--but they must be living mercies to them,
   still, since they came from a living God and they must continue to
   produce in them living gratitude and living service. I like this
   thought--it seems to teach us how, as we mature in life, we shall
   become more and more anxious about practical holiness and we shall,
   more and more, draw the argument for it from our own experience of the
   goodness of God. With the Psalmist, we shall cry, "Bind the sacrifice
   with cords, even with cords to the horns of the altar," and what cords
   can be stronger than the cords of love and the bands of a man, even
   gratitude at the remembrance of all the loving kindness of the Lord? I
   cannot imagine that the iron chains of necessity, or the steel bonds of
   fear can ever hold men so firmly to duty and virtue as these silken
   bands of thankfulness at the recollection of all the Lord's Grace and
   mercy to us. May we feel these love-bands about us as we meditate upon
   these words of Israel's great leader!

   I invite you, then, first of all, to consider the leading of God which
   is to be remembered. And, secondly, the objectives of that leading,
   which also are well worthy of remembrance.

   I. First, then, consider THE LEADING TO BE REMEMBERED--"You shall
   remember all the way which the Lord your God led you these forty years
   in the wilderness." Some of you can knock out that word, "forty," and
   put in, "fifty," or, "sixty." I know some here who can say, "seventy!"
   I can even see some who can put in, "eighty," years, not of life,
   merely, but of Divine leading, for there are some, here, who have been
   led of the Lord, in their own experience, no less a space than that
   longest period I have named!

   The first thing that we note, here, about the children of Israel is
   that they had a God. And the first thing for us to remember, tonight,
   is that God ever had anything at all to do with us, that we ever had a
   God. "You shall remember all the way which the Lord your God led you."
   We have not been led by a stranger, but by our own God! And we have not
   been led by a human shepherd, but the Lord has been our Shepherd!
   Though He counts the number of the stars and calls them all by their
   names, and leads the hosts of Heaven in their marches through
   illimitable space, yet has He not disdained to lead us! Unhappy men,
   who have no God! Saints are poor, sometimes, but they do not know the
   poverty of the man who has no God! No gold, no silver--this is an
   inconvenience, but no God--this is death in the midst of life! Glory be
   to God, there are some of His people who, though they have barely
   sufficient food and raiment, and though scant is the portion of their
   lot below, yet they have a God--and he who has a God is rich to all the
   intents of bliss! There are infinite mines of unfailing wealth just
   beneath his feet--he has but to dig a little to find all that he needs
   in God. It is a blessed thing to have God when you have all things
   beside, and to find God in all things, but it is an equally blessed
   thing to have God when you have nothing else and to find all things in
   God! There is but a slight change in the order of the words and I think
   there is not much change in the real sense as to true happiness.

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, what a wonder it is that God should have
   looked upon you and me with eyes of love! Well, I can leave off
   wondering that He should have loved some of you, but I never shall
   leave off being astonished that He should ever have regarded me with
   complacency and love! Nobody in this place sings with greater emphasis
   than I do, that verse of which many of you are also so fond--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem,

   Or give the Creator delight?

   'Twas even so, Father,'you always must sing,

   'Because it seemed good in Your sight.'" The Sovereign Mercy of God,
   born in His own bosom, nurtured from His own heart, could only have
   induced Him to look with love upon us!

   But what love it has been! No commonplace love, no ordinary affection.
   Mothers have loved us, fathers have loved us. We know the love of a
   fond spouse and the love of children and of friends, but these are only
   like twinkling glowworm sparks, while the love of God seems, to us, to
   be the very sun, blazing in full glory in the heavens! He loved us--to
   what shall I compare His love? He loved us as He loved His
   only-begotten Son. No, He seemed to love us even more than that, for He
   spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all. He loved us
   better than He loved Himself, for, in order that we might live, He put
   Himself to that great loss of tearing His Only-Begotten from the place
   of His everlasting abode in peace. Oh, wonder of wonders, that God
   should ever have loved us so! "God so loved the world, that He gave His
   only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but
   have everlasting life." This glorious Truth of God is enough to make us
   all spring to our feet, feeling that we are in the Presence of the
   miraculous and the Divine, as, indeed, we are!

   More than that, if more can be, we have to tell the wonderful story of
   the love of God, the Son, and of the love of the Spirit, which made the
   love of the Father and the love of the Son to be effectual, for the
   Spirit came to us and turned our hearts into the way of faith and we
   embraced the Son, whom, in our blindness we had despised. Oh, let us
   tell, tonight, tell to our own hearts if we cannot speak it out, the
   wondrous love which has given us a God at all, that Father, Son and
   Holy Spirit should have such condescending dealings with us!

   In the next place, Moses not only said that Israel had a God, but that
   God had led them. I am not going to preach, tonight--I am only going to
   try to get you to think of how God has led you--and you will do that
   all the better if I keep gratefully thinking in my own mind of how He
   has led me. Oh, how He led some of us--

   "When Satan's blind slaves, We sported with death "!

   We would have damned ourselves before conversion if we had been left to
   ourselves, but God, every now and then, held back our rebellious hand
   and checked our wayward will. "I girded you," said He to Cyrus, "though
   you have not known Me." And so it was with us, full often, the Lord
   girded us--what if I say that He put the bit in our mouth when we were
   like leviathan and a hook in our jaws when we were like a crocodile and
   wildly refused to know anything that could tame us? He held us back
   from evil and led us in the right way and oh, the sweet way in which He
   led us to the Cross! He drove us

   and he drew us/ With the Law He sternly lashed us. With His love He
   deftly drew us. And oh, the Glory of the Light when He brought us to
   it! Yet we shut our eyes and rushed back into the darkness!

   But He would have us see the Light of God, so we were sweetly forced to
   come and the scales dropped off our eyes and we saw that sight, the
   like of which we have often seen since then, but the like of which we
   never imagined in our blind estate! Oh, to be led to Jesus! If there
   were nothing else for us but just to be led to lie at His feet and weep
   ourselves away in penitence, and get back, again, to joyous communion
   with Him by a believing confidence--If there were no other leading than
   that, we might well ask for a well-tuned harp and never wish to rest
   our fingers, but continue forever to smite its strings in sweetest
   minstrelsy of praise!

   Many days have passed since then, Beloved, with some of us, since those
   early days when we hoped for salvation, when we grasped the promises,
   when we rested on the finished work of Christ, when we had our first
   trembling joy in believ-ing--and all the way we have been led so
   singularly. I could not tell you how I came to be where I now am except
   by saying, "He leads me! He leads me!" Could you tell how you came to
   be where you are? Was there not a time when, if anyone had said you
   would be what you are, and where you are, you would have despised him,
   for you hated the thought of it? And was there not another time when
   you would have laughed outright and said, "It can never be. What? I
   have a good hope of Heaven? I who now stand trembling on the brink of
   the abyss? What? Be numbered with the children, when it will be a
   marvel of mercy if I am ever allowed to eat a crumb with the dogs under
   the table?" Yet it is so and the Lord has led you. He has led some of
   us where the track was as narrow as a razor's edge. He has led us where
   black darkness was on either side and with half a slip we would have
   been in Hell! He has led us where we could not see our way and where,
   if we could have seen it, we might have swooned for very fright, yet we
   are safe. He has led us through the furnace and not so much as a smell
   of fire has been upon us! He has led us when we have been, like Jonah,
   in the depths of the sea in very despair! And yet we are safe on dry
   land. Glory be to the Divine Leader who has led us by a right way,
   bringing us by a way that we knew not, thus far en route for the City
   that has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God! We praise Him
   tonight for having led us thus far.

   But that is not all. Moses bade the Israelites remember that they had a
   God and that He had led them. But he also wanted the people to remember
   that their way had been through the wilderness--"You shall remember all
   the way which the Lord your God led you these forty years in the
   wilderness." So far as any ministry to our spiritual needs is
   concerned, this world is a wilderness. There is every temporal comfort
   provided for us and yet, with all those temporal comforts, there is
   such a thing as having a starved soul. What is there in this world that
   can minister to the requirements of a spiritual man? Nothing! As well
   might Israel in the wilderness have devoured the stones of the desert
   as any man live upon what this world can furnish him of spiritual meat.
   It is a wilderness and there are scorpions in it, perhaps one of them
   has bitten you today. And there are fiery serpents--you may meet a lot
   of them tomorrow. And there are Amalekites that seek to destroy the
   hindmost of us!

   And there are all kinds of other evils and mischiefs in this
   wilderness. Do not let us imagine that we have got to Heaven just yet!
   I think I have known some Brothers and Sisters who have thought that
   they were almost there. They have taken off their winterproofs and
   overcoats, and laid them by, thinking they would never need them again.
   Ah, my good mariner, you will need that oilskin suit yet! There may be
   many a rough night for you, yet, before you cross the narrow sea! We
   have not yet come unto the fair havens of eternal peace. You sing,
   sometimes--

   "My willing soul would stay In such a frame as this."

   Well, perhaps you would like to stay there, but you are not to do so.
   "Go forward," says the Lord, and in going forward, you may have to
   endure many trials of which you have never dreamed--for it is still a
   wilderness through which you are journeying.

   Now, I want you to remember that all these years God has led you
   through the wilderness and, still being in the wilderness, this fact
   ought to comfort you. If you should be in the wilderness for another 20
   years, the God who has led you 40 years can lead you another twenty.
   The God who has led some of you dear Sisters here present 80 years--can
   you not trust Him for the other four, five, 10, or whatever number it
   may be? You do not expect to reach a thousand years old, I am sure, but
   if you did, the God who kept Methuselah could also keep you! And if
   Enoch could walk with God for 300

   years at a stretch, so may we, with God leading us! If we live as many
   years as there are days in the year, God has said, "As your days, so
   shall your strength be," and He will bring us safely through. Let us
   not forget that.

   Then we have to remember something more about the children of Israel
   and that I have already anticipated, namely, that God had led them
   forty years in the wilderness. It is often the length of an experience
   that is the trial of it. "In the wilderness"--that is bad enough, but,
   "forty years in the wilderness"--that is the test of endurance! Plenty
   of people seem to start rightly but they have no staying power. With
   all the foes we have to face in the wilderness, who is able to endure?
   Who? Why, the man who has God with him and God within him! He will
   endure to the end and, "He that endures to the end shall be saved." But
   here is that which makes a long life so trying--that all the while you
   are in the wilderness. Yet here is, also, your consolation, for, long
   as your life has been, yet the Lord has led you through that very
   respectable period of 40 years. Surely you cannot, now, doubt as to His
   ability to lead you and keep you even to the end! Remember those past
   40 years--do not forget them, I pray you. If you have an old friend
   whom you have tried and tested for a long period, if you are a wise
   man, you will grapple him to your soul with hooks of steel and, as to
   your God in Heaven, who has been with you all these years and kept you
   from childhood, even until now, you will say, "I cannot doubt Him! I
   cannot look elsewhere for a leader. I remember the God who has led me
   through the wilderness these 40 years."

   Again, according to the text, all the way that God had led His people
   was worth remembering--"And you shall remember all the way which the
   Lord your God led you." "All the way." It is always a pity to look at
   things only in parts. If we would see them aright, we must examine them
   as a whole. Sometimes it is our lack of dealing with things as a whole
   that leads us to make mistakes. "All things work together for good to
   them that love God." Not this thing, that thing and the other thing, by
   themselves, but all things put together work together for good. Now,
   remember, "all the way" whereby the Lord has led you. I know you
   remember the day when God led you by that grave, where half your heart
   and all your joy seemed buried--you went to see it, the other day, in
   the cemetery. Now you remember that part of the way--but the
   exhortation is to remember, "all the way," whereby the Lord has led
   you. Put this and that together, and you will have something more to
   remember than that one grave and that dark day when they said that
   everything was lost--when your household goods were sold and you were
   left penniless. Yes, and the Lord led you through even that trial! You
   must remember all the way He led you--how He helped you and brought you
   through that dark day into the light again-- "Remember all the way
   which the Lord your God led you."

   I would desire, tonight, to think of all the loving kindness of God. I
   think it is worth while to remember those rough bits of road, for we
   are to remember all the way, but remember, also, those beautiful walks
   by the river of the Water of Life and those happy climbs to the top of
   Mount Clear. Yes, you may remember Giant Despair's Castle and By-Path
   Meadow, to sorrow over them, but then God did not lead you there! You
   had better remember the Interpreter's House and the Delectable
   Mountains where He did lead you, for where He led you all was well! As
   to where you went of your own accord, the only leadings that you can
   remember with joy were those in which He led you back with weeping and
   supplication, till you were almost glad to kiss every flint that cut
   your feet, so long as you really felt that you were back in the old
   road, again, for there you loved to be, and anywhere else you knew you
   were in great danger! Let us sing of mercy and of judgement! Unto You,
   O God, will we sing with mingled strains! We will run up the scale to
   the highest notes of a joyous Hallelujah and every note shall be for
   You! But we will go down to the deepest tones as well, and still, every
   note shall be unto You, O God! "Remember all the way which the Lord
   your God led you these forty years in the wilderness."

   Observe this one thing more, dear Friends, that the children of Israel
   were commanded to remember the Lord's leading, and I do not, this
   evening, merely invite you to remember all the way that the Lord has
   led you, but, as my text puts it as a command, so I give it to you as a
   command from God! There is a, "you shall" to it and, therefore, I leave
   my text in your hands, not to be accepted or rejected at your option,
   but as a positive command binding upon every man, woman, or child who
   has been led of God. If you are, indeed, the sheep of His pasture, this
   command comes to you with all the force of Divine authority!

   II. Now, in the second place, I ask you to think upon THE OBJECTIVES OF
   THAT LEADING THROUGH THE

   WILDERNESS--"To humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your
   heart, whether you would keep His Commandments, or no."

   God has led you and the time--the 40 years. The place--the wilderness.
   And the method of His leading have all cooperated to erect two
   purposes.

   First of all, to humble you. In the review of your life of mercy, do
   you not feel humbled? I think that there is everything about it to make
   us all feel humble.

   The first thing to humble us is the remembrance that we have, all
   along, been receiving gifts. That is always a humbling experience. We
   like better to give than to receive. There is great pride about giving,
   but all this while, as far as God is concerned, we have been what one
   called, "gentlemen commoners upon the Lord's bounty." We have been
   pensioners at His gate, we have been beggars at His door and the only
   garments that we could put on and call our own are the garments of a
   beggar. We have been allowed to beg and we have always had alms given
   to us according to our faith. That ought to humble us. We have not
   earned a penny, but have been always living on charity. We have been
   supported on Divine alms all this while.

   I will tell you what often humbles me. If I attempt any work for God
   and I do not succeed at it, I am disappointed, but I make up my mind to
   try again. But if I succeed, then do I not begin to boast? Certainly
   not! Have you ever noticed what Peter did when he went fishing and got
   his boat full? The boat began to go down as soon as it was loaded with
   fish--and so did Peter till he went down so low that he cried out to
   Jesus, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!" He felt that he
   was not worthy to have Christ in the same boat with him! The more God
   blesses you, if you are a man of God, the humbler you will be. It is
   His mercies, His favors, His loving kindnesses that will tend to humble
   you, and make you say with Jacob, "I am not worthy of the least of all
   the mercies, and of all the truth which You have shown unto Your
   servant." God humbles some of His people with favor and love. Others,
   who may not be humbled that way, have to be brought low in another
   manner.

   Now, in looking back, do not your prayers humble you? Is there one
   prayer you have prayed of which you dare to be proud? Do not your
   sweetest communings with God humble you? In hearing of Him by the
   hearing of the ear, you may not be humbled, but when your eyes see Him,
   you lie low, with Job, and abhor yourself and repent in dust and ashes.
   Are you not humbled at the recollection of what you have not done, your
   sins of omission? How many they have been! Are you not humbled at the
   thought of the many other people's sins, as well as your own, that are
   laid to your charge--sins that grew out of your example, or that were
   not rebuked as they ought to have been--so that you became, by your
   negligence, a partaker in them? Ah, dear Sirs, if we have anything of
   which we think we could glory for a moment, it must be because we have
   forgotten all those 40 years in the wilderness, for there is a crowd of
   memories that will come before the mind of any thoughtful man to humble
   him!

   The point that humbles one most is to think that we should need all
   this humbling, that God should have to put us in a wilderness for 40
   years to humble us! What proud wretches we must be--pride must be
   ingrained in us if we need all this discipline to get it out! The
   children of Israel were proud and when I mention the ways in which they
   manifested their pride, I think that I shall only be holding the mirror
   up to ourselves. They were proud because they murmured. As soon as they
   began to be a little thirsty or hungry, they complained--and what was
   that murmuring but a proof of their pride? "I am such a very great
   person that I ought not to suffer hunger! I am such an important
   individual that I ought not to endure thirst!" That was part of the
   Israelites' pride. And then they began to doubt God. They had scarcely
   heard the last rattle of the chariots of the Egyptians when they said
   to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us
   away to die in the wilderness?" They pretended that they knew better
   than God! And unbelief is only a kind of veiled pride in which we begin
   to set up our own judgment against the wisdom of God. They were also
   very proud because they were so hot and fiery--and passionate and
   eager. Moses had only been gone from them 40 days when they said to
   Aaron, "Up, make us gods which shall go before us; for as for this
   Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not
   what is become of him." So they must have a god of their own making, a
   molten calf, to take the place of Jehovah who had delivered them from
   the hand of Pharaoh! If God waited, they could not wait--not they! All
   this was the effect of pride.

   Now, do you not find murmuring, unbelief and a wicked impetuosity still
   clinging to you? Well then, that is what God is trying to get out of
   you. All the experience of the 40 years in the wilderness has been
   meant to humble us and if it does not humble us, what is to become of
   us? If our experience of God's love and of our own frailty does not lay
   us in the dust, what must we be? O God, by Your blessed Spirit, cause
   all these experiences to be effectual that we may be really humble
   before You! Yet I am afraid, that, if the Lord does not work another
   miracle, we shall still get more proud, for we are very apt, as we grow
   in years, to think, "Well now, I am an experienced person. I shall not
   fall like those silly boys."

   The man who talks like that is the very man who does fall! I have often
   had to tell you that, in Scripture, you have scarcely an instance of a
   young Believer falling into sin, but nearly all the cases of
   backsliding recorded are those of old men and, "old fools are the worst
   fools." We who are getting on in years and have had a long experience
   are just the kind of stone that the devil likes to carve into monuments
   of our own folly! Do not, therefore, think that because any of you know
   more than you did, and are walking nearer to God than you used to,
   there is anything for you to glory in! No, the distinct tendency of all
   this should be, by Divine Grace, to make us more cautious, more
   timorous, more trembling, more fearful of ourselves and, at the same
   time, more confident in God, more humble and, therefore, more
   believing, for I think that until self-confidence is emptied out of us,
   there is no room for confidence in God. Pride is the enemy of faith and
   humility is the brother of true assurance. God bless, then, all our
   wilderness experience to our humbling!

   The second objective of the Lord's leading appears to be, according to
   our text, to prove us. Does not the Lord know us? Yes, He does, but He
   still wants to know us, in another sense, by actual tests. God has
   given us these 40 years in the wilderness on purpose to test us. Will
   Richardson, a friend of mine, an old farm laborer in Essex, said to me,
   once, "Do you know, Sir, all through the winter I am thinking that when
   the hay-time comes, I will earn a good lump of money at haymaking. I am
   thinking about how well I will use my scythe and make a long day's
   work. And then I think I will reap many an acre when it gets to
   harvest-time. But," he added, "I have not been in the field above
   half-an-hour before my poor old back aches and I begin to find that
   Will cannot do much, now that he is getting on to eighty-six." He said,
   "It is wonderful what strength I have when there is not any grass to
   cut and when there is no corn to get in." So is it with many of us--we
   have a lot of faith till the trouble comes--and God, therefore, leads
   us, again, into the wilderness, and leaves us there, just to prove us
   and to show us that we are not the rich people, the great people and
   the believing people that we fancied we were! Thus the Lord tests us
   and, in the testing, 99 parts out of a hundred evaporate, perhaps 999
   parts out of a thousand vanish away, and we have to bless God if there
   is even a thousandth part left of what we thought we had!

   Well, Brothers and Sisters, beside this testing of our faith, and our
   love, and our graces, of which I have not time to speak, the Lord also
   leads us through the wilderness in order to point out to us something
   of the mischief that lurks within our nature. We have no idea what bad
   folk we are. I do not think there are any men or women here who have
   the slightest idea of what evil they may be capable of if they are only
   put under certain conditions and the Grace of God is taken away from
   them! Blasphemies, murders and foul lusts still lurk within that old
   mind of the flesh that abides even in the nature of the regenerate! And
   if those vile dogs once get loose, oh, Sirs, they will bite like the
   dog of the most unrenewed man! Every now and then, even we who are
   God's children find out what we can do, what we can say, and what we
   can feel. Oh, I wish we would believe in the sanctifying power of the
   Word of God and the Holy Spirit--and have no confidence in self at
   all-- but cry for its mortification, its death and its burial with
   Christ, for that is the only thing to be done with it! While there is
   any life in the old flesh, the flesh is still flesh and none of us can
   tell what evil it will work if it once gets the opportunity! God leads
   us through the wilderness that we may discover this.

   And, once more, I'm sure that the Lord also leads us through the
   wilderness as He led Israel, that He may see whether we really will
   keep His Commandments, or not. Yes, you have behaved well as an
   apprentice, so the Lord lets you become a journeyman. You have done
   well as a journeyman, but yet you may fail when you come to be a
   master. There was a young man who attended this House of Prayer
   regularly. He was much persecuted by his father and mother, but all the
   while he seemed wonderfully earnest. His parents are dead and he is his
   own master and the possessor of a good deal of wealth but, alas, I do
   not think he ever goes to the House of God, now, or has any care about
   it. I have often noticed that persons, downtrodden and oppressed, will
   hold on to Christ--but when they get their liberty, they will run away
   from Him! It is an amazing thing, but it is true.

   Some seem to change their religion with their coats. When their coat is
   half-worn out, they do not mind mixing up with all classes of people
   that worship God. But when they wear respectable broadcloth and
   especially when Her Ladyship puts on satin, then they want to go
   somewhere else. Now, the Lord leads people about, up high and down low,
   to see whether they will keep His Commandments, for that religion that
   will not stand the test of all weathers is worth nothing! If we do not
   so love God that whether He puts a hedge about us, or whether He
   permits Satan to break through the hedge and take away all that we
   have--if we do not still cling to Him, fair or foul--we do not love Him
   at all! And to separate between the precious and the vile is often the
   reason of the working of the hand of the God of Providence towards
   professors of religion. O God, help us to know ourselves and to know
   You--and make us right towards You!

   I have not spoken much directly to unconverted people, tonight, yet my
   subject has all been for them as well as for the Lord's people. I
   should like them to look back over the years in which they have lived
   without God, yet God has not left them, altogether, and He has,
   tonight, brought them into this Tabernacle where there sounds forth a
   silver trumpet of which this is the note, "Turn unto Me and live!
   Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus Christ has everlasting life! Believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. Let the wicked forsake
   his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto
   the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will
   abundantly pardon." May you, tonight, as you take a review of your past
   life, be moved to feel, "Surely, God must mean to bless me, or He would
   not have been so good to me!"

   I was speaking with an officer who rode in the charge at Balaclava, one
   of the very few who came out alive, and, though I had not seen him
   before, I could not help putting my hand on his shoulder and saying to
   him, "Surely, the rest of your life, so strangely spared, must be
   dedicated to God." It may be that you have been in a shipwreck and that
   you barely escaped. Or you were in a terrible collision on the railway.
   Possibly you have had typhoid fever. It may be that you were laid low
   the last time the cholera was raging here, or you have been kicked by a
   horse, or you have escaped from all sorts of tragedies--yet here you
   are. Should not the life which has been so specially spared be
   dedicated to God? We read of John Bunyan, that in his godless days he
   was foolhardy to the last degree, and once, when a serpent came in his
   way, he took it up and plucked out the poison gland from it. It was a
   wonder that he was not stung, but he was not--and the reason was that
   God meant him to write The Pilgrim's Progress--and he could not die
   till he had done that.

   And I believe that the Lord has some design of love towards some of you
   who are here, tonight. Go and seek His face and cry to Him for mercy
   and He will grant it to you tonight! We prayed that all who came in
   here might be saved. I trust they will be. I believe they will be. What
   a joyous thing it would be for all of us to be bound for Glory! Let us
   begin to praise the Lord's name that all of us are to go to Heaven in
   answer to that prayer! Well, as you are going there, you had better
   begin to learn something about it and get ready for it--and I invite
   you to do so. Let us begin the music of Heaven by singing this one
   verse--

   "All hail the po wer of Jesus 'name, Let angels prostrate fall! Bring
   forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM139:1-18.

   Verse 1. O LORD, You have searched me, and known me. "You have explored
   me, as men dig in mines and make subterranean excavations. You have
   searched into my secret parts and known me."

   2. You knew my sitting down and my raising up. "My simplest acts, those
   which I scarcely premeditated."

   2. You understand my thoughts afar off. "Before I think it, when I
   think it, and when I forget it, You understand my every thought."

   3. You compass my path and my lying down. "Making a ring around me, so
   that I am entirely under Your observation. My roving and my resting are
   both known to You."

   3. And are acquainted with all my ways. "My habits, and the exceptions
   from my habits, are all known to You."

   4. For there is not a word on my tongue, but, You, O LORD, You knew it
   altogether. "When it is on my tongue, and not spoken, like a seed sown,
   hidden away, not yet sprouted, You, O Jehovah, knew it altogether!"

   5. You have beset me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me. "I
   am like a prisoner, with guards before me and behind me, and the
   officer's hand upon my shoulder all the while. You have arrested me, O
   Lord. I can never get away from

   You."

   6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain
   up to it. "I believe it, but I cannot understand it; even my
   imagination cannot picture it to me."

   7. Where shall I go from Your Spirit? "If I want to do so. If I desire
   to avoid You, where can I go to escape from Your Omnipresent Spirit?"

   7, 8. Or where shall I flee from Your Presence? I ascend up into
   Heaven, You are there. The true glory of that bright world.

   8, If I make my bed in Hell, behold, You are there. "The terror of that
   place of woe, in the land of death-shadow and darkness, You are living,
   whoever else is dead. If I make my abode in Hades, in Hell, You are
   there."

   9, 10. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost
   parts of the sea; even there shall Your hand lead me. "If the breath of
   the morning breeze should bear me far away across the pathless sea, You
   are there before me. If I ride upon a flash of light, You are swifter
   than the sunbeam--even there shall Your hand lead me." The lone
   missionary in the furthest parts of the earth is led by God. When he
   knows not his way, God leads him, and when he has no companion to cheer
   him, God's hands upholds him. What a comfort to any of you who have to
   journey far away from your kindred! You cannot be alone, for God is
   there! Be of good comfort and go as bravely as if you walked the
   crowded streets of this great city!

   10-12. And Your right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the
   darknesses cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yes, the
   darkness hides not from You, but the night shines as the day: the
   darkness and the light are both right to You. It is impossible to
   conceive that God should need the light in order to see. He can see as
   well in the midnight shades as in the blaze of noon. Let no man think
   that he may sin in secret because he is not seen of the eyes of
   man--God's eyes are on him in the dark as much as in the light.

   13, 14. For You have possessed my reins: You have covered me in my
   mother's womb. I will praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully
   made: marvelous are Your works; and that my soul knows right well. He
   was no Agnostic, he never dreamed of being a know-nothing.

   15-17. My substance was not hid from You, when I was made in secret,
   and curiously worked in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes did
   see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in Your book all my members
   were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there
   was none of them. How precious, also, are Your thoughts unto me, O God!
   How great is the sum of them! How sweet to be thought of by God! How
   charming and how cheering to be the perpetual object of the Lord's
   thoughts! The Psalmist does not tell us how precious are God's
   thoughts, but he sets a note of admiration to them--"How precious,
   also, are Your thoughts unto me, O God!" He does not try to calculate
   the total of their value, but he says, "How great is the sum of them!"

   18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when
   I awake, I am still with You. "You have thought of me when I was
   asleep--and when I wake, I think of You." Happy living, happy dying, to
   feel that, if we never wake again on earth, we shall wake up with God!
   How precious it is to think that when good and useful men fall asleep,
   when they awake, they are forever with the Lord! Our turn will come
   soon, my Brothers and Sisters. May it be our portion to die in harness
   and to be taken away while yet we have the Light of God's sustenance
   resting upon our work!

Earth's Vanities and Heaven's Verities

   (No. 2346)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING NOVEMBER
   7, 1889.

   "Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in
   vain: he heaps up riches and knows not who shall gather them. And now,
   Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in You. Deliver me from all my
   transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish." Psalm 39:6-8.

   These are solemn words. Sometimes we have a more joyful theme than
   this, but I believe that, spiritually, as well as naturally, it is
   better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting. A
   meditation of a quiet kind, on things not as they are in fiction, but
   as they prove to be in fact, is always salutary. There is a great mass
   of sorrow in the world and all of us meet with something, every now and
   then, to calm our spirit and cool our blood. So, tonight, if we think a
   little of the fleeting character of this world, and of the real world
   where certainty, alone, is to be found--and if we school ourselves to
   learn facts and realities, by the blessing of God's Spirit--we may go
   away even more lastingly refreshed than if our hearts were made to leap
   for joy by meditation upon some transporting theme.

   I will have no further preface. There is too much in the text, itself,
   to allow time for a lengthy introduction. Therefore, notice, first,
   that David records his view of human life--"Surely every man walks in a
   vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up riches and
   knows not who shall gather them." Then, next, David expresses his own
   emotions in contemplation of these things--"And now, Lord, what wait I
   for? My hope is in You." And, then, in the third place, David offers an
   appropriate and necessary prayer, for he cries, "Deliver me from all my
   transgressions: make me not the reproach of the

   foolish."

   I. First, then, let us notice that in our text DAVID RECORDS HIS VIEW
   OF HUMAN LIFE.

   You will notice that he puts, "surely," twice over in this verse, and
   with the, "verily," of the fifth verse, which has the same meaning, but
   might have been translated, "surely," he has uttered the same word
   three times, "surely, surely, surely," or, if you please, "verily,
   verily, verily." He half reminds us of his greater Son, the Son of
   David, whose speech was often emphasized with that sacred assuring
   word, "Verily, verily, I say unto you." David here seems to tell us
   that there is nothing sure except that nothing is sure. "Surely," he
   says, "nothing on earth is sure. Verily there is not verity, or
   happiness, anywhere here below." There is a land of verities. There is
   a home of "surelies"--some of us are on the way there and already have
   the earnest of our inheritance. But as for you who have your portion in
   this life, you have vanity, not verity-- change is written on
   everything earthly.

   Having thus given us the keynote of certainty--for the Psalmist did not
   write haphazardly, but he wrote what he knew. He wrote what he had
   experienced and he wrote under the Inspiration of the Spirit of God--we
   should the more carefully look at what he has written. If it is so,
   surely, let us be sure to know what it is.

   And, first, he seems to me to speak of life as a walk. And of that he
   says, "Surely every man walks in a vain show." Then he speaks of life
   as a worry. And of that he says, "Surely they are disquieted in vain."
   And then he speaks of life as a success, as men call it. And of that he
   says, "He heaps up riches and knows not who shall gather them."

   David first speaks of life as a walk. He seems to have had in his mind
   the idea of a great procession--"Surely every man walks in a vain
   show." If you choose to go to the Lord Mayor's show next Saturday, you
   may see a vain show, and may know precisely what David meant. Such
   things were more common in Oriental countries than they are with us,
   but whether it is the Lord Mayor's show or any other, it is a picture
   of what this mortal life is! The procession, if you see it, or if you
   do not see it, but only read and hear of it, may remind you of what
   life is--what you see of it is all show. There are

   kings in the show, princes in the show and heroes of old time in the
   show. But there are neither kings, nor princes, nor heroes there in
   reality! It is all show and such is this mortal life to a large extent.

   Among some classes of society, show is everything--they must "keep up
   appearances." Just so and, all the world over, that is about all there
   is--"appearances"--a vain show! If you want reality, you cannot see
   it--only the unseen is real. If you want shadow, you can see it--"the
   things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen
   are eternal."

   1 wish we could get a hold of that idea as a practical thing--that
   everything we can see is shadow, but what we cannot see is the real
   substance. When we talk about faith, men call us "visionary." Well,
   well, you may call us that if you like, for we have a vision of a very
   high order. But we beg to return the word to you in its ordinary
   meaning, for if you make your treasure of what you can see and handle,
   you are the visionaries--for this is but a vain show in which you
   rejoice and that which you see with your eyes is but a vision--a dream
   that vanishes when one awakens! Earthly life is only a show.

   Oh, Friends, I wish we really thought this! We would not be so
   hot-brained as we are if we said to ourselves, "These are only
   shadows." We would not be so vexed and worried as we are if we often
   said to ourselves, "These are shadows. I could not see them if they
   were not. If they were real, they would not be perceptible to my
   senses--they would only be perceptible by the higher faculty of faith."
   "Surely every man walks in a vain show." It is a show and nothing more.

   But it is a passing show, for David does not say, "Surely every man
   sits down in a vain show and remains in the same place," but, "every
   man walks in a vain show." It is with life as with a procession which
   passes before your eyes. It comes-- listen to the shouts of the people!
   It is here in a few minutes. There are the people crowding the streets!
   But presently it has vanished and is gone. Does not life strike you as
   being just that? I remember, oh, I remember so many figures in the
   procession! I have seemed to stand as at a window, though that, itself,
   has been but seeming, for I also have been in the procession. I
   remember the great hearty men of my boyhood, whom I used to hear
   pray--they are now singing up yonder! Then, when I think of you, dear
   Friends, I remember a long procession of saintly men and godly women
   who have all passed before me and have gone into Glory. What a host of
   friends we have in the unseen world, "gone over to the majority!" As we
   get older, they really are the majority, and our friends on earth are
   outnumbered by our friends in Heaven! Some of you will fondly remember
   dear ones who have passed away in the procession, but please remember
   that you, also, are in the procession. Though they seem to have passed
   before you, you have been passing along with them and you may reach the
   vanishing point before long! And then there will be this talk among the
   brotherhood you love, "he, too, has gone," or, "she has fallen asleep,"
   for we are all walking as in a procession and passing away to the land
   of substance and reality!

   A show which is passing away is, in itself, if it is measured by this
   mortal life, vain--"a vain show." To a man who has no hope hereafter,
   it is all, "vanity of vanities; all is vanity." Within the narrow
   compass of this poor globe there is nothing that is worth a man's
   opening his mouth to ask for or to receive. Take the broader, larger
   circle of the heavens and there, within that boundless circumference,
   there is something to be found that is worth finding! Dwell in God and
   you have something substantial! Dwell out of God and you make "much ado
   about nothing." Life is a vain show when it is lived apart from God.

   If you will only consider, for a minute, you will see that it is so.
   Think of the armies of Babylon and Assyria, the palaces their kings
   built, the mighty cities that they built--where are they now? Think of
   the Medes and Persians, with all their pomp and power--where are their
   glories now? And Greece--her palaces and her temples are a desolation.
   Listen to the tramp of Roman armies up the Via Sacra--listen to the
   acclamations of the people as they climb the very chimney-tops to see
   the conquerors come home--where have they all gone? Fame did but blow
   one blast upon her bronze trumpet and the echoes sounded, for a while,
   and then there was silence. "Surely every man walks in a vain show."
   Get the idea of a procession and you have caught the thought which
   David would convey to you. Such, too often, is the whole of a man's
   life-- just the passing of a pageant--and nothing more.

   The Psalmist then speaks of life as a worry, and he says, "Surely they
   are disquieted." So they are. How few people are so free from the
   spirit of the things of this world as to pass through this life
   quietly? If we could once live in the eternities, we would be calm,
   still and restful. But we live by the moment and the day and we are all
   on the worry, the fidget, the fret, the fume and we know no real rest.
   The work of this world, if carried on only as for this world, is well
   described here-- "Surely they are disquieted in vain." See how they
   begin life, eager for its joys, its honors, its wealth. Note how they
   plod, toil and labor. How much of brain-work is done by the light of
   the midnight oil! Many a man agitates his mind and wearies his spirit
   till his life is lost in finding a livelihood. They are trying to live
   and lo, life is gone! And they wake up and

   wonder how it is that they have let it go and have not really lived at
   all. Some are all for getting, never for enjoying in any measure. When
   such men get wealth, it is not sufficient for them. When they get twice
   that, they are still eager for more and live on in a perpetual worry.

   Then one has more than another and envy comes in--of all passions, one
   of the most wearing--and when a man has, at last, all he thought he
   would ever need, then he is afraid of losing it! Now he is anxious
   about this and worried about that, and fretting about the other.
   Believe me, there are no people who take the fret of life so much as
   those who ought to have sense enough not to--"having food and raiment"
   they are not "therewith content"--and having taken all that is good for
   them to carry, they are like a traveler who, having one good
   substantial staff to help him in his walking, must carry a bundle of
   sticks with him, and so loads himself unnecessarily. Is it not so?

   Did you ever stand in the Bourse at Paris, or did you ever, by any
   chance, hear the noise of our own Stock Exchange? The latter place is
   more difficult to see than the former, but when I have stood upstairs
   in the Bourse in Paris, and have looked down upon the raving multitude
   below, I have wondered whether if bedlam had been emptied out, there
   would be more noise, more uproar, more calling out, more pushing and
   rushing, first this way, and then that way! I could not understand what
   they were doing! Perhaps that made the scene appear the more maddening.
   Every man seemed all alive and as though he would eat up every other
   man in the place!

   And I believe that the Bourse is but a picture of mercantile life
   everywhere--competition, competition, everybody buying cheaply and
   grinding down everybody that works, and then complaining that, in his
   turn, he is ground, too--his own measure being measured back to him! Ah
   me, what a life it is! Had David penned this Psalm, today, he might
   have written in capital letters, "SURELY THEY ARE DISQUIETED IN VAIN!"
   Oh, for a little quiet! Oh, for time to think! Oh, for opportunities to
   get near to God and unload all your thoughts and all your cares before
   Him--and then to go away feeling patience mingled with joy, and joy
   with the expectation of unutterable bliss, helping us to really live,
   instead of being disquieted in vain!

   Well, next, David passes on to speak of life as a success, and he
   mentions those who were supposed to have been successful in life,
   though, mark you, it is not success in life, after all, to accumulate
   riches. When you read in The Illustrated London News that somebody
   died, "worth" such and such, do not believe it! A man is not worth what
   he has when he dies! A man may not be worth two-pence--although he may
   possess a million, he, himself, is worth nothing--poor grabber of
   everything! But you say such and such a man died and left £200,000.
   Yes, there are several of us who, when we die, will leave much more
   than that. I shall leave all the world behind me and there are many
   others here who will do the same-- and leave all the millions that
   there are, all the estates that ever were and all the treasures of the
   world! And I suppose that every one of us, when he dies, will leave
   everything behind him, for shrouds have no pockets and men carry
   nothing with them into their graves.

   But even when a man is successful in heaping up riches, see how David
   describes it--"He heaps up riches." That is all--he does not partake of
   them. He does not use them, he merely heaps them up. He accumulates
   without enjoyment. When a man has food and raiment, and has what he
   needs for comfort, all that he has beyond, if counted by thousands,
   might as well be a thousand pins as a thousand pounds, so far as any
   good it is to him! But the bigger heap will not give more comfort, for
   there is the additional anxiety of taking care of it. When riches are
   consecrated to God's Glory, they assume quite another character, but I
   am now talking about this world and the mere possession of its
   treasures. David calls it the heaping up of riches and that is all that
   it is, getting a big heap, like children do at the seaside--one gets a
   bigger heap of sand than another has, but what is the good of that?

   The Psalmist also says that when the man heaps up riches, he, "knows
   not who shall gather them." He hoards without security. This is
   probably an allusion to the husbandman who has cut down his corn and
   put the sheaves together. And then at night, before he can gather them
   into the garner, much less before he can thresh out the grain and grind
   it, some marauder comes and runs off with it all. The miser heaps up
   his gold, but he does not know who may gather it. Have we not seen the
   fruit of many years toil vanish in an hour? The reaping of a lifetime
   has disappeared by a panic in a moment.

   "He heaps up riches and knows not who shall gather them." He leaves his
   wealth without pleasure. The Psalmist alludes to the fact that men
   cannot tell what will become of their possessions when they die. I am
   sure that there is many a man who would turn in his grave if he knew
   what was being done with his hard-earned wealth! To live wholly to
   enrich somebody about whose character you know so little seems a poor
   objective in life. And yet it is the only objective which

   many are pursuing. Without chick or child, it may be, still men will go
   on scraping together riches for some unknown heir who, if they knew
   him, would be, perhaps, beneath their contempt--yet they go on working
   like slaves for one who will never be grateful to them when they are
   dead!

   Now does not the whole of this put together make up a very sorry
   picture? Yet it is true of the worldling, of the man who has no hope
   hereafter--of the man who has never projected his soul, by Grace, into
   the spiritual and the heavenly realm!

   II. And now, glad to get away from this part of our subject, we notice
   how DAVID EXPRESSES HIS OWN EMOTIONS IN CONTEMPLATION OF THESE THINGS.

   And first, he has come to a decision. Having turned these matters over,
   he begins the expression of his own feelings, thus, "And now, Lord." I
   like that mode of speech. It is a great thing to come to God with a,
   "now." You know how the Lord comes to us. He says, "Come now, and let
   us reason together, says the Lord." I like a man, sometimes, to come
   close up to God and sit down, and seem to say, "Now, Lord, You see that
   I have realized the vanity of this world. I may well let it all go, for
   it melts away in my hands--it is a mere shadow which is not worth
   living for--and I have to live in eternity with You. I have to live in
   Heaven or in Hell. O my God, bring me to my bearings! Bring me close up
   to You and let us reason together, and have the question out. And now,
   Lord." Every moment is solemn if we would but make it so, but there are
   certain turning points in life when a man has had his eyes opened to
   see the fallacy of his former pursuits, when, stopping where the roads
   meet, he looks up to the signpost and says, "And now, Lord, guide me.
   Help me to take the right turn, to avoid the shadow and to seek after
   that which is substantial. Now, Lord."

   I also like this expression of David's emotions because he consults
   with God. "Every man walks in a vain show, but," he says, "and now,
   Lord, there is no vanity with You, no deception, no delusion with You,
   behold, I turn away from this mirage, which just now deluded me, to
   You, my God, the Rock of my salvation, and I look to You. And now,
   Lord." I would to God that somebody here would say, "I have to spend
   eternity somewhere. I will not waste this present time and live as if
   this world were all, but I will lift up my prayer, tonight, and say,
   Now, Lord. Now that I have passed my childhood and am a young man. Now
   that I have reached my 21st birthday. Now that I am 30, forty,
   fifty--now that my hair is turning gray it is time for me to be wise if
   ever. Now, Lord." And if I am so unhappy as to have a person here who
   has advanced to the very end of his lease and has become 70 and yet is
   still living for a world that is slipping away from him, I would to God
   that the Holy Spirit would make him say, tonight, "And now, Lord. Now I
   seek You, now I turn to You."

   You can see at once that David feels that he is out ofplace, for he
   says, "Lord, what wait I for?" He says, "What wait I for? I can see
   what these fools are waiting for--they are waiting to take their place
   in the show. They put on their masquerading garments and go out there
   to take part in the pageant. But I will not go there. I do not belong
   to any of the classes that make up that show. What wait I for, then? I
   see the men worried in vain, but, Lord, I have learned to trust in You.
   Then, what wait I for? And, O my God, I see how others clutch the
   treasure which they cannot keep, which is not worth the having, for
   they are soon to leave it, or it quickly leaves them. By Your Grace I
   am not after that kind of thing. Now, Lord, what wait I for?" He is
   like a fish out of water, he is a man out of his native country,
   evidently a stranger and an exile, who is turning to his God. He is a
   fellow-stranger with his God and he says to Him, "Now, Lord, what wait
   I for?"--a question only God, Himself, can fully answer!

   You observe, also, that he has his eye on the future. He is a man who
   is waiting for something. Faith is a high virtue. And waiting upon God
   is a flower that grows out of it. "What wait I for? I have not found it
   yet. I am waiting for it, for here we have no continuing city, but we
   seek one to come." Our treasure is not here--it is away there upon the
   eternal hills, where Christ sits at the right hand of God! The man
   described in our text is a waiting man whose chief delight is now in a
   world that is to come.

   And you observe, lastly, on this point, that he is a man whose hope is
   in God. "My hope is in You." I have no earthly expectations, but I say,
   "My Soul, wait you only upon God, for my expectation is from Him."
   "Hopes of ever finding anything here which can fill me, or content me,
   I have long ago abandoned. And now, Lord, my hope is in You. It is only
   You, my God, that I desire, and if I get You, if I am filled with You,
   if You abide in me, if You transform me into Your image. If You deign
   to use me for Your Glory. If You will take me Home to dwell with You
   where Jesus is, this is what I wait for, and I wait for nothing else."
   We are expectant of good things to come. We are not inhabitants of this
   country, we are citizens of the New Jerusalem which is above! We are
   only shipwrecked, here, for a while, and exiled from Home until the
   boat

   shall come to ferry us across the stream to the land where our true
   possessions lie and where our best Beloved is! Life, light, love and
   everything to us is He who has gone as our Forerunner to the place
   which He has prepared for them that love

   Him.

   III. Now I close by noticing that DAVID OFFERS AN APPROPRIATE AND
   NECESSARY PRAYER. "Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not
   the reproach of the foolish." After all, we are here, Brothers and
   Sisters. We do not know how long we may have to stay here and there are
   things which we need while we are here. Well, what are they? Send in
   your requests! What do you need?

   David puts down what he needs. "He needs, first, to be delivered from
   trouble," says somebody. No, he does not say anything about that. He
   prays, "Deliver me from all my transgressions." "He needs to be
   delivered from that headache, that heartache, that pain in the limbs,
   that depression of spirit." Nothing of the sort! The prayer of this
   godly man is, "Deliver me from all my transgressions."

   That is, first, he prayed for deliverance from sins committed. "Lord,
   put all my sin away, so that I may be clean every whit from every sin
   that I have ever committed." Can that be? Oh, yes, it is so with many
   of us! We are washed in the blood of the lamb and that washing is
   perfect washing--it leaves no stain behind it! If you believes in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, He has taken your sin upon Himself--He has put your
   sin away by the great blood shedding! It is not on you any longer. It
   has even ceased to be, according to that wonderful text, "The iniquity
   of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none; and the sins of
   Judah, and they shall not be found." What a blessed thing it is to live
   with no cloud, whatever, between your soul and your God--to know that
   every sin is blotted out by the Atonement of Christ and that your
   heavenly Father looks upon you with delight and favor--even as a child
   of God and does not chide you! O happy, happy, happy man who walks in
   the Light of God, as God is in the Light, and so has fellowship with
   God while the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses him from all
   sin! David's first prayer is for deliverance from sins committed. If
   you get it answered in your case, you will not walk in any vain show
   and you will not be worried at all, much less, "disquieted in vain."

   Next, he prays to be delivered from the assaults of sin. Who is there,
   here, that is not tempted? If anyone says, "I am above temptation, or
   beyond temptation," well, that person must have gone far in pride and
   carnal security--he is eaten up with the leprosy of self-deceit! We are
   all tempted and every day we need to pray, "Lead us not into
   temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One." "Deliver me from all my
   transgressions. Lord, do not let me sin; let me not in heart, or
   thought, or word, or deed, offend You." Oh, if we could but be perfect,
   so that we could never manifest an ugly temper, never speak a wry word,
   never have an evil thought! Oh, if we could but be perfect! Ah, Sirs,
   this is the riches we covet, to be perfectly free from every tendency
   to sin! If we could but get to that, then we should have got to Heaven,
   for that is Heaven--to be perfectly delivered from sin! Well, well, we
   shall have that perfection! God will give it to us, but let us make
   this the subject of our daily prayer, "Deliver me from all my
   transgressions."

   David also prayed for deliverance from peculiarly dangerous sins. Allow
   me to put an emphasis on one little word in my text, "Deliver me from
   all my transgressions." I am afraid that we all have some special sin
   that is our sin more than it is anybody else's--some tendency,
   hereditary--perhaps some liability to a particular form of sin. I
   believe that if some Brothers and Sisters were ever tempted to
   hilarity, they would not transgress in that direction, for they were
   born in November, and they have a fog in their very soul! There are
   some others, who, if they were tempted to great depression, would not
   transgress in that way, for they have sunlight in their souls and their
   eyes always twinkle with a natural merriment! Some men are not tempted
   to be misers--it would be a mercy if they were, for they are such
   dreadful spendthrifts! Some men are never tempted to be lavish--I half
   wish that the devil or someone better would tempt them, that way, for
   they are so mean and it is so hard to get even a three penny piece from
   them to help the best of causes! Satan is pretty well acquainted with
   us--he sees the joints in our harness, he knows to what sins we are
   specially inclined--and if it is so in sinners, it is also so in
   saints! We all have need to pray, "Deliver me from all my
   transgressions, especially from the sins to which I am most liable.
   Lord, save me from them." I invite you, dear Friends, to pray this
   prayer of David.

   And then, also pray the other--"Make me not the reproach of the
   foolish. If I am to be reproached, let me be reproached by wise men.
   Make me not the reproach of the foolish."

   Thus, David prayed for deliverance from deserved dishonor. Oh, may God
   grant that none of you, whom He has called to a higher and better life,
   and made to long for Glory and eternity, may ever make the enemy to
   blaspheme, or give them real reason for despising you! God keep us from
   falling! O Christian men, women, Christ has been more wounded by His
   friends

   than by His foes! We do not mind what the infidel has to say. At least
   we would not mind it if we did not, at times, help him to say sad
   things by our inconsistency. We feel the point of the arrow and the
   smart of the wound is acute, but far keener is it to feel that our own
   wrong-doing feathered the arrow which the enemy shot from his bow! God
   keep us from that evil! May we never lend a feather from our wings with
   which to furnish an arrow against Christ or His cause!

   David also prayed to be preserved from undeserved defamation. "Make me
   not the reproach of the foolish." If you live the life of an angel,
   foolish persons will soon spread an evil story against you. Unless the
   Lord holds their tongues, they will not hold them. Pray, then, that you
   may be preserved from slander. If it comes, may it be real slander,
   with no truth in it, but may God preserve you even from that, for it is
   a cruel thing and cuts to the quick!

   Again, David prayed for deliverance from spiritual disappointment. And
   may we also be preserved from all disappointments concerning our trust
   in God! If we trusted in God and He did not deliver us, we would be,
   indeed, the reproach of the foolish. We come out boldly for the Truth
   of God and stand alone--and yet that Truth never vindicates us! Why,
   then, we shall be the reproach of the foolish! We pray that we may not
   be put to shame and that God's bare arm may defend His own cause and we
   believe it will be so.

   And last of all, in his prayer, "Make me not the reproach of the
   foolish," David pleads for deliverance from dreadful taunts at the
   last. May I never be lost and then forever have to bear this reproach!
   You know, the thought has sometimes come to me that if I am not true,
   and if at the Last Great Day the Master should say, "I never knew you,
   depart, you cursed" how will those who have to depart with me turn
   round, and say, "And you, and you? You talked to us! You preached to
   us! And yet you, yourself, are here?" This would be to suffer shame as
   did the king of Babylon when he went down to the Pit and the kings whom
   he had slain began to say to him, "Have you become like one of us?" How
   they gloried over their conqueror, himself, shut up in Hell, conquered
   by the Almighty God! Professors, I beseech you to pray this prayer,
   tonight, "Make me not the reproach of the foolish." Be sincere, true
   men, lest on the last day you not only have the wrath of God to bear,
   but the shame and the everlasting contempt which your fellow sinners
   will heap upon you while you lie there, after all your profession, a
   castaway!

   The Lord grant His blessing to those who are to be baptized tonight!
   May they be faithful to the end and may others of us, who have
   confessed Christ years ago, be kept from sin! May we all trust Christ
   tonight! If we never trusted Jesus before, let us begin at once, each
   one saying, "Now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in You." May we all
   come to Jesus and find eternal life in Him! Amen, and amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM39

   To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

   David dedicated some Psalms to Asaph and one or two to Jeduthun. Some
   of this chief musician's family appear to have remained singers as late
   as the time of Nehemiah. It is a great honor to be a singer in the
   House of God. Ungodly men have no right to lead the Psalmody--only
   redeemed lives can sing aright the song of redemption. I reckon that it
   is almost as wrong to have an unconverted person to lead the singing as
   it would be to have an unconverted man to preach the Gospel. David was
   in a great heat of spirit, and much tried, when he wrote this Psalm.
   There is little that is cheerful in it, yet there is much that may
   cheer us. Sometimes, when we are unusually thoughtful, we are more
   likely to be blessed than at other times. Specific gravity is better
   than specific levity--there are some who have a great deal of the
   latter quality.

   Verse 1. I said. "I thought it, and at last I said it. I resolved. I
   determined upon it and I registered the vow."

   1. I will take heed to my ways. Men never go right by accident--he who
   is heedless is graceless. A holy life is a life that comes of taking
   heed.

   1. That I sin not with my tongue. He who keeps his tongue can keep all
   the rest of his body. The tongue is the helm of the ship and if that is
   well managed, the ship will be steered aright. How many sins of the
   tongue there are--proud words, false words, trifling words, unclean
   words! I cannot mention the whole list. The tongue is the best thing in
   the world or the worst thing, according to how it is used.

   1. I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
   "I may feel free when I am with God's people. Then I may wear my heart
   upon my sleeve, for there are no claws to scratch at it. But when I am
   with the wicked, I must not cast my pearls before swine. I must be
   careful what I say, for they will be sure to misunderstand and
   misrepresent me."

   2. I was dumb with silence. Ah, me! How often we do wrong even when we
   try to do right! He tried not to sin with his tongue, so he was silent,
   but silence, itself, may be a sin of the tongue! God forgive our idle
   silence and silence our idle words! I do not think we often sin this
   way, but silence may sometimes be more wicked than speech even though
   at other times, speech is silver and silence is golden. If silence is
   sometimes better than speech, it may also be worse. So poor David, like
   a pendulum, swings first, this way, and then the other way. Yet he went
   too far in the silent direction.

   2. I held my peace, even from good. Which he should not have done. A
   dumb sorrow is a heavy sorrow.

   2. And my sorrow was stirred. Or "troubled." Water, while it is quiet,
   may look clear, the sediment lies still at the bottom. But if you stir
   it, you see all there is in it. So is it with sorrow--when it is
   stirred, you find its bitterness.

   3. My heart was hot within me. The fire was kept in his heart--it was
   not allowed space to break forth--so his heart was hot as an oven.

   3. While I was musing, the fire burned. He grew so hot with grief that
   he was compelled to speak.

   3. Then spoke I with my tongue. I am not sure that he did not sin then.
   We sin if we are silent and we sin if we speak, for we are such sinful
   creatures. It would have been better, perhaps, if David had said,
   "Lord, help me to take heed to my ways and rule, You, over my tongue,"
   for as it was, you see, he could not manage his tongue. He was either
   too fast or too slow. However, this time he spoke well, for he spoke to
   God. More talk to God and less chat to men--and we would be wiser and
   better!

   4. LORD, make me to know my end. It is greatly wise for us to be
   familiar with our last hours. There is much to be discovered in the
   shroud, the mattock and the spade.

   4. And the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I
   am. A bubble is more substantial than I am--a little handful of dust,
   easily blown in the wind--rather an appearance than a reality! Ah, me,
   little do we know, any of us, how frail we are!

   5. Behold You have made my days as an handbreadth. How short is our
   life! It is just a span and no more,

   5. And my age is as nothing before You. What multitudes of generations
   of men have come and gone! An angel might have cried, long before, "Man
   is but a thing of yesterday compared with the eternal God." God created
   the first star that twinkled out of the primeval darkness. "The
   everlasting hills," as we call them, are but infants of a day compared
   to Him. Therefore, man may truly say, "My age is as nothing before
   You."

   5. Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah. The
   best man is only man at the best and when he is at his best, he is
   nothing but vanity. It is strange that he should get vain of his best
   state, when his best is only vanity!

   6. Surely every man walks in a vain show. He is a shadow walking among
   shadows. 6. Surely they are disquieted in vain. They fret and fume
   about nothing.

   6. He heaps up riches and knows not who shall gather them. He is busy
   with a rake, but another will be busy with a fork. What the miser
   gathers the spendthrift scatters.

   7. And now, Lord, what wait I for. "Do I wait to gather riches for
   another to squander? Do I wait to worry myself? Do I wait here to walk
   as a vanity in the midst of vanities? No, Lord, I am waiting for
   something better than that!"

   7. My hope is in You. Here the Psalmist steps off the sand and puts his
   foot on the Rock. Happy is the man who can say to the Lord, "My hope is
   in You."

   8. Deliver me from all my transgressions. When he gets near to God, he
   sees himself to be a sinner.

   8, 9. Make me not the reproach of the foolish. I was dumb, I opened not
   my mouth because You did it. That is fine silence when a man will not
   complain because his affliction comes from the hand of God! There is
   something better, even, than that--when a man breaks the silence and
   begins to praise God under the rod! A mute Christian smarting under the
   rod is a wonder of Grace, but a singing Christian under a cutting
   stroke is a still greater miracle of mercy! Such ought all Christians
   to be.

   10. Remove Your stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of Your
   hand. When God smites, He never plays at chastisement and there are
   times when His blows are very heavy, and then the smitten one cries
   out, "Remove Your stroke away from me. I am consumed by the blow of
   Your hand."

   11. When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty
   to consume away like a moth. Stout, he is reduced to a shadow. Comely
   and beautiful, he is wrinkled and looks like a skeleton. Joyful and
   blithe, he ends his day in mourning. Ah, dear Friends, we who have joy,
   calm and peace ought to be very grateful! Praise God while you can, for
   it may be that a dark night will follow the bright day. Oh, for Grace
   to praise God even then! That is the best of music that comes from
   God's nightingales! Music by night is music, indeed. But when God
   corrects men, how soon He takes them down!

   11, 12. Surely every man is vanity. Selah. Hear my prayer, O LORD. "If
   I cannot do anything else, I can pray, and I will pray." That is the
   best relief that mourners have--"Hear my prayer, O Lord."

   12. And give ear unto my cry; hold not Your peace at my tears. "Do not
   see me weeping and yet refuse me comfort and relief. Do not, I pray
   You, hear my cry, and yet turn Your back upon me."

   12. For I am a stranger with You. Notice, not a stranger to You, but,
   "a stranger with You. You are a stranger in Your own world and I, also,
   am a stranger here." Men will not entertain the King, for they know Him
   not, therefore--

   "'Tis no surprising thing, That we should be unknown: The Jewish world
   knew not their King God's everlasting Son."

   "I am a stranger with You." There is a sweet familiarity about this
   expression, as if the Psalmist said, "Lord, I am not at home. I am a
   stranger here and You, too, are a stranger. Men will not acknowledge
   You. Therefore, Lord, sympathize with me. Hold not Your peace at my
   tears, for I am a stranger with You."

   12. And a sojourner, as all my fathers were. "You are my Host. I am
   Your guest. You entertain me. Lord, look at my tears! When the good man
   entertains a stranger, he is kind--he pours oil and wine into his
   wounds. Lord, do so with me! You are the Good Samaritan and I am a
   stranger with You--a sojourner, a temporary guest with You in this
   world--as all my fathers were."

   13. O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be
   no more. There is much sweet comfort, here, though the Psalm reads like
   a dirge, rather than a hymn. God give us, if we are obliged to sing
   such words as these, to sing them with a full belief that the Lord will
   hear us, will bless our trials to us and make them work our lasting
   good!

The Lord's Famous Titles

   (No. 2347)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 10, 1889.

   "The LORD looses the prisoners: the LORD opens the eyes of the blind:
   the LORD raises them that are bowed down: the LORD lo ves the
   righteous: the LORD preserves the strangers, He relie ves the
   fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked He turns upside down."
   Psalm 146:7-9.

   This morning as well as I could, looking to God for help, I tried, in
   Christ's place, to persuade men to be reconciled to God. I showed that
   there was a great spiritual drought and neither dew nor rain to be had
   except as God should send it. And I tried to press my hearers to go to
   God, to wait upon Him, to look to Him and, through the mediation of the
   Lord Jesus Christ, to seek and find in God all that would be necessary
   for their eternal blessedness. [Sermon #2115, Volume

   35-The Drought Of Nature, the Rain Of Grace and the Lesson Thereof] I

   pressed hard and some yielded, not to my pressure, but to a Divine
   impulse that went with my pleading! But there were some who did not
   yield, this morning, so I am going to make another attempt to win them,
   now, calling in our August Ally, even the Divine Spirit, without whom
   we can do nothing! May He bring many to God in penitence tonight!

   You know that it helps men to come to a person when they know who he
   is, how good he is and how likely it is that they will find benefit by
   coming to him. My text tells us something about God, the Lord Jehovah.
   Five times the word occurs at the head of a sentence, Jehovah, Jehovah,
   Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah. Sometimes, when a great king or prince has a
   high day, a herald proclaims the titles of His Majesty. He is prince of
   this, and lord of that, and emperor of the other--too often a lot of
   empty sounds. But when we come to speak of God, every title of His
   falls short of what is His real Glory and honor! Tonight we have five
   of His titles put together, five wonderful achievements of God, five
   things for which the Lord would have Himself noted. I want each one of
   you here to hear about them and to say, "That encourages me," or, "That
   cheers me," or, "That helps me." At any rate, out of the five great
   magnets that I will try to use, tonight, may one or other draw all our
   reluctant hearts to God, that we may find rest and peace in Him!

   I. There are five famous titles of God here. The first one is, THE
   EMANCIPATOR. Read the latter part of the seventh verse--"The Lord
   looses the prisoners."

   It is God's Glory that He is an Emancipator. How often, in the Old
   Testament, and in the New, too, you find the Lord loosing the
   prisoners! It was so notably in the case of Joseph, when God brought
   him out of the prison and set him up as Lord over all Egypt. And it is
   still more notable in the case of Israel in Egypt when, with a high
   hand, and a stretched-out arm, the Lord brought forth His people from
   all the tyranny of Pharaoh, whom He destroyed in the Red Sea. You may
   keep on reading Scripture and you will continually find that it is
   true, "The Lord looses the prisoners."

   I want some of you who are here to catch at that thought. Are you
   mentally a prisoner under gloom, tonight? Did a cloud come over you a
   little while ago? Does it still rest upon your mind? Can no physician
   remove it? Listen to this word--"The Lord looses the prisoners." Are
   you in the bondage of error? Have you been misled by false teachers?
   Have you fallen into mistakes about the Word of God? Are you denying
   the great Truths of God which would comfort you? Are you believing the
   great errors which becloud your spirit? Come to God for teaching! He
   can emancipate you from any form of error, even though you have been
   brought up in it from a child. "The Lord looses the prisoners." Or have
   you come under some gross delusion? Are you the victim of some false
   impression which you cannot shake? I pray you, if you are harried and
   worried by temptations of Satan and he seems to have a firm foothold in
   your spirit, and cannot be driven out, let

   this text, like a silver bell, ring out comforting music to you, "The
   Lord looses the prisoners." Oh, that you who are in mental bonds might
   be set free tonight!

   There are, however, worse bonds than those, the chains of moral
   slavery. This man is a drunk and though he has taken the pledge, he
   cannot escape from the terrible craving which intemperate habits have
   brought upon him. Ah, Friend, come to Christ! He can take away the love
   of strong drink and set you free! "The Lord looses the prisoners" and
   He can do that for men and women who have given themselves up as lost.
   God have mercy upon wretched women when they become the prey of strong
   drink! To my certain knowledge, this evil is becoming much more common
   than it was a few years ago. More frequently do we have to mourn over
   fallen sisters than we did some years back. It is sad that it should be
   so, but the glorious fact remains that "the Lord looses the prisoners."
   Do not despair, poor women! Have hope of deliverance! God can yet loose
   you from the bonds of strong drink.

   Has anyone here fallen into bondage to a lust? Has some evil passion
   got a tight hold on you and you cannot break the bonds? There is One
   who can set you free! Yes, though you have been indulging in the evil
   for many years and seem to be wedded to an evil habit from which you
   cannot escape, still is it true, "The Lord looses the prisoners." Do
   not trust in yourself to get rid of the evil, but look to Him who died
   for sin upon the Cross and trust in Him, for it is written, "He shall
   save His people from their sins." I cannot stay, tonight, to mention
   all the kinds of moral bondage into which men and women fall, but let
   this sweet message be like a stray note from the harps of angels to all
   who are in bondage, "The Lord looses the prisoners."

   Perhaps you are held fast in spiritual bondage. This is where we are
   all by nature--we are born slaves. Are you, tonight, my Friend,
   conscious that you are a slave to sin? Are you fast bound by your
   trespasses? O spiritual slave, there is an Emancipator who can take
   your chains from you! "If the Son shall make you free, you shall be
   free, indeed, "and He is able to do it with a single word! Only trust
   Him, only yield yourselves up to Him as willing captives, and you shall
   be free from that moment! God make you free tonight! Yes, and He can
   loose you from every iniquity in which you may be enslaved!

   There is another kind of emancipation which the Lord is constantly
   giving to the prisoners of hope, even deliverance from this present
   evil world. You are sick, tonight. You are sad, you are cast down and
   troubled because of the burden of the flesh. "The Lord looses the
   prisoners." There is many a prisoner who has been loosed during the
   last week or two-- dear members of this Church who had been confined to
   sick beds. The Lord has opened the cage door and the bird, set at
   liberty, has gone caroling up to the skies! The body has been put into
   the grave and lies imprisoned there in vile durance, but He shall come,
   who, Himself, rose from the dead, and when His feet shall touch the
   earth, again, and the angelic trumpet shall sound the summons, their
   bodies shall come forth--

   "From beds of dust and silent clay To realms of everlasting day," for
   "the Lord looses the prisoners!"

   Here is a theme for a whole evening's discourse, but I do not want to
   take up any more time over this point. I wish rather to drive home this
   wedge--if you are prisoners, if you are under any form of bondage--come
   to God in Christ Jesus and put your trust in Him, for, "the Lord looses
   the prisoners."

   II. We must hasten on to notice a second famous title for the Lord,
   that is, THE ILLUMINATOR--"The Lord opens the eyes of the blind."

   If you will kindly look at your copies of the Bible, you will find that
   the words, "the eyes of," are inserted in italics by the translators,
   so that the text really is, "The Lord opens the blind." Ah, He opens
   the very soul of the blind and lets the Light of God in where there are
   no eyes! Have you not noticed that it is so? If anybody were to say to
   me, "Mr. Spurgeon, pick out a dozen of the happiest people that you
   know," ten of them would be blind people! We have some dear Friends,
   members of this Church, who are among the happiest souls that God has
   ever made! It is long since they saw the light, but God has opened
   their hearts in such a way that they enjoy a wonderful quietness of
   spirit, great placidity of mind and an inward Light and splendor which
   persons with eyes might well envy! I have noticed that blind people are
   often among the happiest people and blind Christians certainly might
   take the chief place among us for their quiet and rest of mind! The
   Lord Jesus Christ opens the blind--He comes and sheds a Light when the
   windows of the body are closed--and gives Light within, so that they
   are full of brightness.

   But if you like to take the text as it is in our translation, it will
   do very well. When the Lord Jesus Christ was here, He opened the eyes
   of the blind. He touched many a sightless eye, and the light streamed
   in! Read the Evangels through and you will find this miracle constantly
   recurring. Blindness is a very common ailment in the East and the
   miracle of recovering the sight of the blind was, therefore, frequent
   with our Lord.

   Next, the Lord enables blind souls to see. Here is a great mercy. The
   Lord has opened the eyes of many a man who could not see himself and so
   proved how blind he was--and could not see the Lord and so showed,
   still more, how blind he was. The Lord has given the inner sight to
   many a man who was without spiritual understanding, to whom the Gospel
   seemed a great mystery, of which he could make neither heads nor tails.
   The Lord has made the scales to fall from many blind mental eyes and
   enabled those who were blind, first, to see themselves, and then to see
   their Savior. Blessed be His name!

   And whenever the blind of the earth fall asleep in Jesus and enter into
   Heaven, they shall have no blindness in Glory. There, their eyes shall
   see the King in His beauty--they shall behold His face and rejoice in
   His love. Jehovah is a great Eye-Opener--cannot some of you blind
   people catch at this Truth of God and say--"Then we will come to Him,
   for we need to have our eyes opened"?

   Perhaps someone says, "Sir, I do not quite comprehend all that you say.
   I have been a hearer for some time and I want to understand the Gospel.
   I try to grasp it, but, somehow, I cannot get at the Truth of God."
   Come, in prayerful faith, to God, Himself, tonight, and He will explain
   it to you! I can hold the Light of God to your eyes, but, if they are
   blind, I cannot make you see. But the Lord can give the sight as well
   as the Light and I beseech you to ask it at His hands, tonight. There
   is nothing really difficult in the Gospel and if you will come to Jesus
   like a teachable child and ask to be instructed of Him, you will find
   that it is all plain to him that believes. Of the way of holiness it is
   written, "The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein."

   If you come to God for Grace, dear Friend, He will never limit you. You
   need not be poor Christians--you may be "rich to all the intents of
   bliss." You need not have shallow Grace--you may, if you wish, get into
   "waters to swim in." Giving will not impoverish Him, withholding will
   not enrich Him, but, rather, giving enriches Him, it enriches His very
   heart with great joy, for He delights to give! Come, and take freely,
   and learn the liberality of God! I remember one who called himself, "a
   gentleman-commoner upon the bounty of God." Some of us can take the
   same title. We have had a hand basket portion for many years--not a
   sack full at a time, but a full hand basket! That is a good way of
   living. If a girl gets a portion from her father and the old gentleman
   never gives her anything else, she does not receive so much as her
   sister who has a hand basket portion many days in the week. A present
   often comes to her from the old house at home. Father sends it every
   time with his love and she receives more love and more thought, and he,
   too, receives more gratitude in return, perhaps, than if he had given
   his daughter one lump sum, and then his generosity was all over. It is
   a blessed way of learning the liberality of God, to be receiving freely
   and receiving continually from Him! "He gives more Grace."

   Come, then, to God by Jesus Christ, because He is, first, the
   Emancipator and, secondly, the Illuminator.

   III. Now for the third bright title of the Lord. That is, THE
   COMFORTER. Read the middle sentence of verse eight--"The Lord raises
   them that are bowed down."

   Some are bowed down with bereavement. Well may she be bowed down who
   has just committed to the earth the beloved of her heart. And well may
   he go mourning whose first-born son has been taken from him by a sudden
   stroke. Well may some lament who have lost the choicest friend that man
   ever had, and find that half their life is gone in the death of that
   beloved one, yet, "The Lord raises them that are bowed down." Come,
   tell your grief to Him who pitied the widow at the gate of Nain! Come,
   pour out your sorrow before Him who wept with the beloved sisters at
   Bethany when Lazarus was dead! He can help you, for He, "raises them
   that are bowed down."

   Some are bowed down sadly by the burdens of life. They have more to
   carry than most men have. They stagger along, from day to day, beneath
   a load that threatens to crush them into the dust. Oh, come to my Lord
   who gives new strength to bear burdens, for He raises up those that are
   bowed down! It is amazing what a man can do when God has laid His hand
   on him and said to him, "Be strong." You are faint and you will faint
   without your God, but you will be strong if you come and trust Him,
   for, "Jehovah raises them that are bowed down."

   Maybe you are bowed down with inward distress. Ah, there is no cure for
   some forms of distress but to go straight away to God! The scandal of
   our ministry is the despondency that we cannot disperse. How often I
   have come down from talking with some dear friends, here, whose minds
   have been distracted, and I have had to confess myself, "dead beat."
   God has

   helped me to comfort many--it is my lot, almost wherever I may be, to
   be followed by persons suffering in mind. I sometimes laugh and tell
   them that "birds of a feather flock together" and that they must think
   me half-cracked and so they come to me to sympathize with them! Well,
   so be it--there is a kind of sympathy between me and them. But I have
   learned this lesson, that to bring comfort to a diseased mind is not
   within the preacher's power except his Master shall specially qualify
   him for the task and, in any case, I say to you, dear troubled Friends,
   go straight away to Him of whom you read these sweet words, "The Lord
   raises them that are bowed down."

   Have I the extreme joy, tonight, of addressing in this congregation one
   who is bowed down by a sense of sin? Where are you, Magdalene, hiding
   your face in tears? Where are you, poor erring prodigal, longing to
   come back to your Father, but too bowed down to start upon the journey?
   Listen--"The Lord raises them that are bowed down." He loves to find
   the poor sinner crouching on the dunghill, putting his head into the
   dust in very despair of heart, and He delights to come and put His hand
   upon him and say, "Stand upon your feet; fear not." There is a great
   God of mercies who glories in doing wonders of Grace, forgiving even
   the blackest sin! I say again, I would like to ring this text like a
   silver bell in the ears of every penitent sinner here, and say, "The
   Lord raises them that are bowed down."

   IV. We are getting on with our text, for we have come to the fourth
   great title. God is THE REWARDER--"The Lord loves the righteous." Come,
   dear Friends, here is a wafer made with honey! Here is a feast of fat
   things, full of marrow for you who are the people of God, you whom He
   has accounted righteous because the perfect righteousness of Christ has
   been imputed to you!

   First, "the Lord loves the righteous" with a love of complacency. He
   takes delight in them. He loves them, not merely with a love of
   benevolence that desires their good, but He looks with pleasure and
   delight at righteous men, those whom He has made righteous, those who
   love Him because they are righteous and who are like He in being
   righteous. The Lord looks at them and rejoices over them. How that
   ought to cheer any of you who have been made holy by God's Grace! The
   Lord's delight is in you! He calls you His Hephzibahs, saying, "My
   delight is in them." Wherever there is anything of Christ, anything of
   righteousness, anything of holiness, there is evidence of the Lord's
   love! So, in the first place, "the Lord loves the righteous" with a
   love of complacency.

   He does more than that. He loves the righteous with a love of
   communion. Remember how the Lord puts it, by the mouth of Isaiah, "For
   thus says the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is
   Holy. I dwell in the high and holy place, with him, also, that is of a
   contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
   revive the heart of the contrite ones." I doubt not that God often
   talks with righteous men. "The secret of the Lord is with them that
   fear Him." He lets them speak to Him and He speaks to them in return.
   Do you know anything about this communion with God? If you do not,
   never say that others do not, for we are as honest and truthful as you
   are--and we bear our testimony that there is such a thing as walking
   with God! We declare, from happy, heart-felt experience, that there is
   such a thing as talking with God, knowing that He loves us and that His
   love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given
   unto us.

   God also loves His people with a love of favor. He loves them so that
   He will give them anything that they need. Yes, He has said, through
   the Psalmist, "No good thing will He withhold from them that walk
   uprightly." He loves the righteous so that, when they go into their
   chamber to pray to Him, He may let them plead a little while because it
   is for their good to do so, but He will always yield to their desires.
   He has said, "Delight yourself, also, in the Lord, and He shall give
   you the desires of your heart." He does that with His people. The Lord
   loves the righteous so as to favor them with extraordinary blessings,
   things of which I cannot talk, here, for there is many a love-passage
   between Christ and the righteous soul that must never be told. We do
   not talk of our love-passages in the streets--that would be half
   profane. Nor can we even tell of them here. There are favors which the
   Lord shows to His righteous people, which they know, and He knows, but
   which no one else can know till that day when all things shall be
   revealed!

   And once more, the Lord loves the righteous so that He will honor them.
   If men are righteous, the world will hate them and, as a proof of its
   hatred, it will begin to splatter them. There are always some in the
   world who say, "Throw plenty of mud, some of it will stick," and oh,
   how they delight to throw it! Their hands seem to take to the dirt
   naturally. But, Beloved, if you follow God fully, your character will
   never be long tarnished. Do not try to answer those who slander you. If
   a donkey kicked you, would you kick the donkey? If a fool brings a
   charge against you, do not reply to him. Let him rail on--God will
   vindicate you. Remember that Psalm from which I quoted just now, the
   thirty-seventh--"commit

   your way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to
   pass. And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and
   your judgment as the noonday." It may even happen to a man that he may
   perform an action that will never be understood while he lives. But the
   true man of God lives for eternity, not for time. He says, "I do not
   care if it takes 500 years for the righteousness of my action to be
   seen by my fellow men, it will not make it any more righteous when they
   do see it, nor will it be any less righteous while they do not see it!
   What have I to do with men? I serve the living God." If you get into
   that condition of heart, you can trust your reputation, your life, your
   usefulness entirely with God, for "the Lord loves the righteous." A day
   shall come when all the world shall know it, when they who are
   righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father,
   and God shall say of them, "Well done, good and faithful servants,
   enter into the joy of your Lord."

   Now, then, will you not come to Him, since His favorites are the best
   people in all the world? Kings and princes have often been known to
   choose their associates among the worst of their subjects--men who
   ministered to their baser passions. The favorites of kings have often
   been the offscouring of the earth, but our King loves the righteous! He
   will have none to be His courtiers, to come near to Him, to dwell
   before His face, but those who walk uprightly through His mighty Grace!
   I think that there is something very inviting there to you who are of a
   true heart, something which ought to induce you to come to such a God
   as this--the Lord who loves the righteous.

   V. But now, last of all, and, perhaps, sweetest of all, the fifth name
   of God is THE PRESERVER--"The Lord preserves the strangers; He relieves
   the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked He turns upside
   down." My time is so nearly gone that I can only just ask you to apply,
   by God's help, the few words that I shall say.

   Notice, first, that God preserves strangers. In all nations, in the
   olden times, strangers were driven out. They did not want any
   foreigners settling among them. In this country, in almost every
   village, it used to be the practice for a stranger to be regarded as a
   kind of mad dog. And if he happened to wear a different garb from that
   of the villagers, all the boys hooted him. It seems that our depraved
   humanity is naturally unkind to strangers! I often hear people say,
   even now, "Oh, he is a foreigner!" O you proud Englishman! Is he not as
   good as you? You are a foreigner when you get to the other side of the
   English Channel! It was God's order to His ancient people that they
   were to be kind to strangers. Wherever they came, they were to be
   allowed to dwell and were to be taken care of. God put it thus to
   Israel--"You shall neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him, for you
   were strangers in the land of Egypt." And because God loved them when
   they were strangers in Egypt, they were to take special care of
   strangers and foreigners who came into their midst.

   What a grand trait this is in God's Character, "The Lord preserves the
   strangers!" If any of you feel to be strangers here, tonight. If you
   are strangers to religion, strangers to religious observances,
   strangers to everything that is good. If you feel, when you hear the
   Gospel, that you are altogether a stranger to it--it sounds so odd in
   your ears, come along, dear Stranger, "The Lord preserves the
   strangers!" Come under the shadow of His wings and you shall find
   shelter there. Father is dead, mother is dead, friends are all gone and
   even in the very village where you were born you are a stranger-- come
   along, your God is not dead, your Savior lives--"The Lord preserves the
   strangers."

   Then notice the next sentence in our text--"He relieves the fatherless
   and widow." If you turn to the first Books of the Bible, you will see,
   there, God's great care of the fatherless and the widow. Who had the
   tithes? Well, the Levites, but also the poor, and the stranger, and the
   fatherless and the widow! If you look at Deuteronomy 14:28, or 26:12,
   you will find that the tithes were not exclusively for the priests, but
   they were also for the widow, the fatherless and the strangers. Besides
   this, the Israelites were never to glean their fields twice, for the
   gleanings were for the widow and the fatherless. And they were never to
   shake the olive tree or any fruit tree twice, but to leave what
   remained upon it for the widow and the fatherless. There was also this
   Law of God made, that they should never take as a pledge the raiment of
   a widow. That is pretty often done in London, but it might not be done,
   then--the garment of the widow might never be taken in pledge. Wherever
   the legislation of God for His people touched upon the widow and the
   fatherless, it was immeasurably kind. Now, then, you who feel like
   widows. You who have lost your joy and earthly comfort. You who feel
   like the fatherless and say, "No man cares for my soul," oh, may the
   sweet Spirit of the Lord entice you to come to Him, for, as I reminded
   you in the reading, "A father of the fatherless and a judge of the
   widows is God in His holy habitation."

   But the view of God's Character would not be complete if it were not
   added, "The way of the wicked He turns upside down." You see, the godly
   and they who trust God are always in danger from the wicked, but He
   turns the way of the wicked upside down! Take an example. Joseph's
   brothers sell him into Egypt and make a slave of him. God turns this
   ar-

   rangement upside down and makes a prince of him! Think of Mordecai.
   Haman will have him hanged--he has the gallows ready, but Haman is
   hanged on his own gallows! God knows how to make the malice of men
   promote the benefit of those against whom they turn their cruelty! "The
   way of the wicked He turns upside down."

   Be you just and fear not! Rest in Christ's atoning Sacrifice! Trust Him
   only! Come to your God and be His servant from this day and forever,
   and you shall see how He will break your bonds, open your eyes, cheer
   your spirit, indulge you with His love and preserve you even to the
   end! "There shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come
   near your dwelling." God bless you, dear Friends, and may you all come
   to God, tonight, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM146; LUKE 17:11-19

   Psalm 146:1. Praise you the LORD. Or, "Hallelujah." I am sorry to see
   that great word, Hallelujah, Hallelu-Jah, praise to Jah, Jehovah,
   become so hackneyed as it is, by talk about "Hallelujah lasses," and
   Hallelujah--I know not what. The Jews will not even pronounce the word
   Jah, or write it. It seems a great pity that it should be thus dragged
   in the dirt by Gentiles. "Praise you the Lord." Whenever you make use
   of the word Hallelujah, let it be with the due reverence which should
   be given to that blessed name, for remember, "the Lord will not hold
   him guiltless that uses His name in vain."

   1. Praise the LORD, O my Soul. Whatever we exhort others to do, we
   should be ready to do ourselves. Yes, our own soul should praise the
   Lord most of all, since, if we rightly know our obligations, no one in
   the world is so much indebted to God as each one of us should feel
   himself to be. "Praise the Lord, O my Soul." Not my lips, only, but my
   innermost spirit, for soul-music is the soul of music--"Praise the
   Lord, O my Soul."

   2. While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God
   while I have any being. I will lisp His praises when I can do no more.
   When my being seems to be dried up, in the weakness of the death-throe,
   still, "I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being."

   3. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there
   is no help. What is the connection, here, between praising God and not
   trusting man? Why, this connection, that we never praise God better
   than by exercising faith in Him! Quiet trust is among the sweetest
   music that reaches the heart of God and when we put our trust in man,
   we rob God of His Glory--we are giving to others the confidence which
   belongs, alone, to Him.

   4. His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his
   thoughts perish. What is man--with a life dependent upon his breath,
   such a vapory thing, such a thin, unsubstantial thing is human
   life--what is he that we should trust in

   him?

   5. Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in
   the LORD his God. He is the happy man who has learned to trust in the
   invisible God.

   6. Which made Heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is:
   which keeps the Truth of God forever. Never did His promise fail.
   Perhaps, dear Brothers and Sisters, you have not pleaded the promises
   enough of late. Then the Mercy Seat is the place where promises must be
   pleaded, with the certainty that then they shall be fulfilled.

   7. Which executes judgment for the oppressed: which gives food to the
   hungry. The LORD looses the prisoners. Souls that are in bondage will
   never get freedom till the Lord looses them! Oh, that prisoners of
   hope, who are here, this evening, might have Grace to look to God! You
   cannot pick the lock of your prison, yourself, nor forge your way
   through the iron bars of despair, but, "the Lord looses the prisoners."
   Yes, but when they get loose, they are blind, for man, by nature, is
   blinded by sin! Therefore the Psalmist adds--

   8. The LORD opens the eyes of the blind. He will not only give you
   liberty, but understanding, insight into His Word, a knowledge of
   Himself! Yes, but when men get their eyes opened, they see much to make
   them sorry and He that increases knowledge often increases sorrow! Yes,
   but look at the next words--

   8. The LORD raises them that are bowed down. He can take away
   depression of spirit and relieve the heart of its burdens and, as the
   woman who was bowed down for many years, was made straight by the word
   of Christ, so can those that suffer from mental infirmity be restored.
   And best of all--

   8. The LORD loves the righteous. He loves them and His love is wealth
   and health. The love of God is all a creature needs.

   9. The Lord preserves the strangers. When our eyes are opened and we
   are no more bowed down, but feel we have a sense of God's love, yet we
   still know that we are exiles, banished ones, strangers and foreigners,
   as all our fathers were. It is comforting, therefore, to be assured
   that, "the Lord preserves the strangers."

   9. He relieves the fatherless and widow. He does so literally--"A
   Father of the fatherless, and a Judge of the widows is God in His holy
   habitation." He also relieves such spiritually. When any feel
   themselves to be poverty-stricken and unable to help themselves, let
   them look to Him who is both able and willing to succor them, for, "He
   relieves the fatherless and the widow."

   9. But the way of the wicked He turns upside down. Where they looked
   for joy, they experienced disappointment. Where they expected success,
   they met with defeat, and whereas they thought to heap to themselves
   pleasures according to their lusts, they find that they have only
   increased their misery.

   10. The LORD shall reign forever, even your God, O Zion, unto all
   generations. Praise you the LORD. The Sovereignty of God should be the
   delight of His people. God anywhere is blessed, but God on His Throne
   should make His people shout their Hallelujahs with all their heart.
   Now let us read in the New Testament about one who glorified God and
   gave thanks to Jesus.

   Luke 17: 11, 12. And it came to pass, as He went to Jerusalem, that He
   passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as He entered into
   a certain village, there met Him ten men that were lepers, which stood
   afar off: Lepers were allowed to enter villages, but not to go into the
   large walled towns. They were, however, commanded to stand at a certain
   distance from other people--and these men did so. This must have been a
   terrible sight! Ten men afflicted with such a horrible disease, all in
   one group! It shows how prevalent, at that time, was this disease, now
   happily so rare, at least among us--"Ten men that were lepers." It
   seemed as if the effect of sin in men became more conspicuous in the
   day when the Great Healer of men was here in Person. Then Satan's chain
   was lengthened that he might have greater power over the bodies of men,
   that his Master might subdue him and that Christ Jesus the Lord might
   have the greater victory over the Prince of Darkness.

   13, 14. And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have
   mercy on us! And when He saw them, He said unto them, go show
   yourselves unto the priests. There was a tacit promise in that that
   they should be healed, for, of course, the showing themselves to the
   priests was not that they might be pronounced unclean, for they were so
   pronounced already by their own confession, but that they might be
   pronounced clean! They were to go to the priests and there was an
   implied promise that if they so went, when the priests looked upon them
   they would be healed.

   14-16. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. And
   one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and, with a
   loud voice, glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet,
   giving Him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. He was probably the only one
   out of the 10 that was a Samaritan. Though Jews and Samaritans did not
   usually agree, yet, as sorrow brings a man strange bedfellows, so in
   this case, these partners in a general sorrow forgot their sectarianism
   and were blended into one sad company. Now that they were all healed,
   only one felt true gratitude to God, and to his Benefactor--"and he was
   a Samaritan."

   It is very singular to notice that Luke tells us that this man
   glorified God, "with a loud voice." We have, sometimes, heard
   complaints that, at certain revival meetings, the singing was very loud
   and there was even shouting. Let the converts shout, Brothers and
   Sisters, let them shout! They have good reason to shout, for Christ has
   made them whole. We have a great deal too much of respectable death
   about us--let us have a little noisy life. I would sooner by half hear
   the praises of God shouted with a loud voice than hear the mockery of
   praise in a tone that is scarcely to be heard, while some machine
   grinds out music to God's glory--and men forget to sing or are drowned
   in loud bursts of wind from the instrument! Do not be ashamed to let it
   be known that you are saved. Praise the Lord with all your might and,
   if they say that you are excited, tell them that you are and that you
   wonder if anybody could help being excited if he had been healed of
   leprosy or had his sins forgiven!

   But, at the same time, note the humility as well as the zeal of this
   man--he "fell down on his face at His feet." I would like to see more
   of this action. In some revivals, there is plenty of shouting, but very
   little falling down on the face at Christ's feet. Oh, for deep
   prostration of spirit, a humble waiting upon God, a gracious, tender
   confession of thanks to Him for all that He has done for poor leprous
   sinners!

   17, 18. And Jesus answering, said, Were there not ten cleansed? But
   where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to
   God, save this stranger? Often those who are thought to be the worst of
   people turn out the best. Many of the

   most precious pearls have been found in the deepest sea and some of the
   most grateful hearts have been discovered among those who were most
   immersed in sin and error.

   19. And He said unto him, arise, go your way; your faith has made you
   whole. Christ uses the word, "whole," in an emphatic sense--"Not only
   your body, but also your soul is made whole, and you are holy from this
   day." There is a wonderful connection between these two words, "whole,"
   and, "holy." A holy man is a whole man, but he who is not holy is
   unsound and not whole in the sight of God. The Lord make us wholly holy
   for Christ's sake! Amen.

The Lord Leading--David Following

   (No. 2348)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 14, 1889.

   "And let it be, whien you hiear he sound of a going in he tops of he
   mulberry trees, hat hen you shiall bestir yourself: for hen shiall he
   LORD go out before you, to smite he hiost of he Phiilistines. And David
   did so, as he LORD haadd commanded Aim and smote tie Phiilistines from
   Geba until you come to Gazer." 2 Samuel 5:24,25.

   In anticipation of an Evangelistic Mission to be conducted by Messrs.
   Fullerton and Smith.

   DAVID'S life was a life of war. The Christian life wears other aspects,
   but still, in very deed and in truth, spiritually, it, also, is a life
   of war. Our Lord spoke the Truth when He said, "Think not that I am
   come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."
   The end of all His great work will be universal peace and the lion
   shall lie down with the lamb, but, for the present, men fight against
   the principles which Christ brought into the world and all who become
   the followers of Christ must expect to be soldiers of One whose life
   was one great conflict and who died upon the battlefield, yes, and was
   crowned upon the battlefield, too! Expect, then, to war a good warfare
   as long as you are here.

   David had won one great victory over the Philistines, but he was not
   permitted to sit down and congratulate himself upon his triumph. The
   Philistines were upon him again. Those Philistines took a great deal of
   beating, but the powers of evil are not content anywhere with being
   defeated once or twice. They are up and at us again--they challenge us
   afresh, they hope to overthrow us sooner or later! And again and again
   we must be ready to resist them with this as our warcry, "They
   compassed me about; yes, they compassed me about: but in the name of
   the Lord I will destroy them." There must be war even after
   victory--and we must stand prepared for it.

   Note well, however, that before David went to war, in each case, he
   waited upon God--"David enquired of the Lord." Whenever we have any
   enterprise on hand, it is wise to wait upon God for direction and for
   help. David had received Divine Guidance before, but counsel in one
   dilemma is not guidance for another. Though David had been led of God
   the first time to fight the Philistines, he did not consider that the
   direction then given would apply again, so he went a second time. And
   it is written, "David enquired of the Lord." The answers which David
   received on these two occasions were different. The first time, the
   Lord said, "Go up." The second time, he said, "You shall not go up."
   Had David been content with his former waiting upon God, he would have
   made a great mistake. What you have to do, today, you may not have to
   do tomorrow. And what you did yesterday may have been right enough for
   yesterday, but it may be as wrong as possible for today! Wait more
   continually upon God, dear Friends. Be not satisfied with what you have
   received of direction and support, but go to God again and again. If
   you go to Him daily for manna, you may well go to Him daily for
   counsel. David did this and he acted wisely.

   I am afraid, dear Friends, that many Christians go carelessly
   blundering on, as we say, "neck or nothing." They do the first thing
   that comes to hand and do not wait, and pause, and consider as they
   ought. I know some friends who seem to me to enter into great
   speculations which they had much better let alone, and who venture into
   various schemes which they would be much wiser to leave to other
   people. If they would only wait upon God, they would find themselves
   restrained from many things which now they attempt and, impelled to
   other things which now they neglect. The old proverb says that
   "kneeling does not spoil silk stockings." I am not so sure about that.
   The silk stockings do not matter, but we may say that kneeling does not
   hurt a man's knees! Kneeling makes him strong in the feet, brave in the
   heart and often clear in the brain. If a man will only wait upon God,
   it will help his own mind to form a correct judgment and, besides that,
   the Lord

   will give him guidance of which he never dreamed. He may have a token
   which shall be to him the very "clue of the maze." He may get a word
   from God which will make him wiser than the ancients and it shall be as
   though the Urim and the Thummim still spoke out of the sanctuary to
   guide the saints of the Most High!

   Tonight I shall speak about David's experience, as recorded in this
   remarkable verse, in the following way. There is, first, a prime
   necessity promised. God promises that He will be with David. No, that
   He will go before him in this holy war! "Then shall the Lord go out
   before you, to smite the host of the Philistines." But, secondly, here
   is a consequent action commanded. "Then you shall bestir yourself: for
   then shall the Lord go out before you." Thirdly, here is a hopeful sign
   afforded. "When you hear the sound of a going (or marching) in the tops
   of the mulberry trees, then you shall bestir yourself." And, lastly,
   but very briefly, there is a sure result following--"And David did so,
   as the Lord had commanded him and smote the Philistines from Geba until
   you come to Gazer."

   I. Well now, to begin with, here is A PRIME NECESSITY PROMISED--"Then
   shall the Lord go out before you."

   This was a necessity to David, for he had long ago learned that all his
   dependence must be upon God. It is also a necessity to us, for if we
   are to have a single soul converted, it must be the work of God. Yes,
   and if a single holy thought is begotten in this place, or any other,
   and fires the heart of any saint, and leads to holy service, it must be
   the work of God's Grace! Without Him we can do nothing and we shall be
   nothing. What we especially need, just now, is for the Lord to go
   before us in our contemplated mission. In what way?

   Well, first, the Holy Spirit must go before us to prepare the minds of
   the people. When our Lord came into the world, the world was prepared
   for His coming. There had been certain things done, all over the globe,
   that made the time of His coming the best time at which He could come.
   But it has also been noticed by our missionaries, especially in the
   South Sea islands, that before they arrived, certain changes had taken
   place and certain movements in the minds of the people, that made the
   missionaries feel that they had come just in the nick of time. God had
   gone before them in Providence and in Grace, making ready a people
   prepared for the Word. Now, I want you to pray the Lord to do so with
   all the congregations that shall be gathered in this place and, indeed,
   with all congregations. What can a preacher do if his hearers should
   come and God has left them to themselves? He would have to plow an iron
   soil that would break his plowshare and break his heart. How different
   it is where God has been at work with the hearers! A child has been
   taken to Heaven. The mother's heart is breaking with sorrow and she is
   tender and ready to hear of Jesus and the Heaven to which her babe has
   gone. Then a man has been ill. He had been a thoughtless, careless man,
   but in his sickness he has peered into eternity and he is now
   thoughtful and prepared for the preacher's message. Often have I said
   to myself, as I have come along to this place, "I shall have a picked
   congregation." The Lord has an election of Grace and He has also an
   election of hearers!

   You cannot tell, dear Friends, how much the conversion of sinners is
   due to antecedent action on the part of God before the saving moment
   came. There is a fire and you say that the fire was made when the match
   was struck and applied to the wood. Well, that is true, but long before
   that moment, he who split the wood and he who made the match had
   something to do with preparing for the fire, had they not? Where had
   been your fire if the wood had not been dried and ready for the
   kindling and deftly laid in its place? And where had been your light if
   it had not been for the phosphorus and all else that was used to make
   the match? So does the Lord prepare for the fire of holy service. God
   is at work, dear Friends, in London as well as elsewhere. Sad is the
   poverty in this great Babylon, but, oh, if men could all be rich and
   wicked, how would they ever be saved? Grievous is the disease that
   follows sin, but if men could sin and never smart for it, what evil we
   should see! God is at work in Providence and, with tender touches, here
   and there, He is making men thoughtful, constraining them to feel, in a
   word, making them ready before the time of the preaching!

   And then the Holy Spirit must go before us to prepare the preacher.
   Preachers may think themselves thoroughly prepared for their work, but
   the smallest thing may put them out--some little disarrangement of
   their dress, something in the pulpit not quite right, or somebody
   dropping an umbrella in the aisle--(as is so common, here, on Thursday
   nights), or some person in the congregation who does not seem in the
   least bit impressed. Oh, shame upon us that we, who have such a message
   to deliver, should be affected by such very little things! Yet
   preachers are so affected and often they cannot help it. Even before
   the preacher enters his pulpit, he may get out of order for preaching.
   Poor man that he is, something may happen to him that may quite put him
   out of harmony with the Truth of God he has to deliver. Pray God to
   make our Brothers, Fullerton and Smith, preachers fit for their
   work--and the best preparation will be the Lord going before them! May
   the prophet have his vision before he speaks! May the hand of the Lord
   press heavily upon him before he lifts up his hand to

   point men to the Lamb of God! May his lips be blistered with the live
   coal from off God's altar before he opens his mouth to speak words of
   flame in the name of the Lord!

   Pray, Brothers and Sisters, pray! Pray much that the Lord may go before
   to prepare the hearers, but equally that He may go before to prepare
   the preachers!

   I will suppose that the hearers are present. In doing so, I only
   anticipate a few days. I hope that this house will be very full. The
   speakers are also here and ready for their work. They have come forward
   attended by your prayers. Now is the moment when we need the Spirit of
   God to go before us to deal with men. A single word, spoken in the
   strength of God, will effect far more than ten thousand words uttered
   in the power of mere reasoning, or eloquence, or even earnestness. When
   God goes before us, wonders are accomplished by sentences that seem
   very simple and trite--you have heard them many times, before, but now
   you hear them in a very different way! They fell, before, like flakes
   of snow. But now they come like flashes of fire! They burn into your
   bosom. They set your heart on fire!

   What is the secret of this power? God is in it! God is working with it!
   He is proving His Presence with His people. It is a strange thing, but
   it is strangely true, that by the foolishness of preaching it pleases
   God to save them that believe. And, while His power is never promised
   to go with the most gorgeous ceremonies, or with the most beautifully
   artistic effect, it is pledged to go with the simple declaration of the
   Gospel of Christ and the preaching of His Holy Word! It is the Gospel
   of Christ that is "the power of God unto salvation to everyone that
   believes." Though I have said this ten thousand times, before, and you
   are always hearing it, and do not doubt it, yet for that very reason I
   say it, again, with all the emphasis with which I can--the prime
   necessity for every holy work is for God to go before--for the Lord to
   make bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the people! And if we have
   not that Divine Leader, we have nothing at all that is of real service
   in holy work.

   II. Secondly, there is, in the text, A CONSEQUENT ACTION
   COMMANDED--"Then you shall bestir yourself: for then shall the Lord go
   out before you."

   God could do without us if He chose to do so, but God is pleased not to
   do without us. What a mercy it is that God deigns to use us! What a
   happiness for us! God might have gone forth with thunder and lightning
   against the Philistines and scattered them in a moment--but that was
   not His way of winning the victory. It was to be a fight between David
   and the Philistines and, therefore, God went before him to be the
   Source of David's strength.

   But David must follow. When will some of our Brothers and Sisters learn
   the fact that God's working is not a reason for our sitting still? It
   is not written, "The Lord will go before you and then you shall rest,"
   or, "The Lord shall go before you and then you shall sit still and be
   grateful." No, no! "Then you shall bestir yourself." Now, David, if you
   ever did move quickly, bestir yourself, now that God has gone before
   you! If you ever did use a sword with all your heart, soul and
   strength, do it now! "Then you shall bestir yourself." "Look sharp."
   That would be a very good translation, indeed. "Then you shall be all
   awake, and all alive. Then you shall rush upon the Philistines and
   destroy them. God has gone before you. Will you not follow?" What a
   mercy, what a privilege, what a blessing God confers on His people that
   though He could do very well without them, He does not please to do so.
   But where He goes as the Leader, He bids them at once heartily and
   earnestly follow Him!

   Now, the doctrine that "Salvation is of the Lord"--that glorious
   doctrine which I believe with all my heart and which I desire to preach
   all my days--the doctrine that salvation is of God and God alone, from
   first to last, in every point of the compass, was never intended to be
   a soporific and to discourage the action of man. The fact that God goes
   before us does not encourage us in sloth. Yet some talk as if it did.
   Take the doctrine of Election, for instance. "God has a chosen people,
   therefore I need not preach to them." No, no, Sir! God has a chosen
   people--therefore I preach to them! It would not be of any use for me
   to preach if He had not ordained any unto eternal life. But as He has a
   people who shall assuredly be saved, I will thrust the Gospel magnet in
   among the mass--and those people whom the Lord has chosen shall be
   attracted by it! "The Lord Jesus Christ will not die in vain."
   Precisely so and, therefore, I need not preach Him, I suppose? But the
   very reason why I do preach Him is because He did not die in vain! The
   death of Christ that does not effect its purpose is not worth
   preaching. But the death of Christ that is effectual for the end for
   which it was designed is worth preach-ing--and more and more do we
   rejoice to preach it! The grand doctrines of the Gospel are not
   doctrines that lead men to slumber!

   There are some who pervert them, as they do the other Scriptures, and
   it will be so throughout all time, for men will turn the holiest things
   into reasons for sloth and sin. We cannot help that, but there is
   nothing in the Truths, themselves, that should produce such effects.
   Our forefathers of the olden times who went everywhere preaching the
   Word, the Calvin-ists of France who, in the desert and wherever they
   went, hazarded their lives unto the death--the Huguenots, who could
   bravely do and dare and die for Christ--were, to a man, believers in
   these principles which are supposed by some to send men to sleep! The
   most energetic Christianity that ever was upon the face of the earth
   has been just this form of Christianity and, therefore, it cannot
   possibly be that the doctrine rightly used will encourage idleness or
   sloth! How can it? If you, yourself, were told, tonight, "Proceed on
   such an errand and your God will go with you," would that be a reason
   why you should not go? If you were bid to fight a battle and you were
   told, "God will be with you in the battle," would the fact that God
   would be with you and would win the victory, be a reason why you should
   not fight? You must be made of strange material if that were to be the
   result of the promise of victory and the assurance of the Divine
   Presence! Nothing makes man labor so energetically as the expectation
   of success! And the certainty of succeeding because God is with them
   nerves their arms and makes them do what otherwise would be impossible!

   No, dear Friends, we are not among these who say, "God will have His
   own and, therefore, I shall not pray or do anything." Listen, Friend,
   if that is your language--God will have His own, but He will never have
   you, for you are clearly not one of them! God's own never talk in such
   a style as that. God's own have a very different kind of voice. You are
   not of His sheep, for you do not follow Him. The Christ--to what did He
   go? To slumber and idleness? No, but to incessant service--

   "Cold mountain, and tie midnighit air Witnessed tie fervor of His
   prayer."

   He knew that the Lord would give Him the heathen for His inheritance
   and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession and, therefore,
   He prayed for all who had been given to Him by His Father! His life was
   a consecrated one spent in burning zeal and constant devotion to His
   great Father's cause. And if you are one of the Lord's own, it will be
   your mission to follow the Christ in this and, as He was, so will you
   be in this world. Come, Brothers, God is going to bless you! Do you
   draw back because of that fact? If so, surely there are two more
   lunatics than those in Bethlehem Hospital. No, no! Because God is going
   to be with you, therefore every man says, "I will follow where God
   leads. I will take my share in this grand fight, since the Lord,
   Himself loads the van."

   III. Well now, thirdly, in our text there is A HOPEFUL SIGN
   AFFORDED--"When you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the
   mulberry trees, then you shall bestir yourself."

   Whether these were mulberry trees or balsams, I do not know. It is very
   difficult to discover what trees they were. It does not matter, much,
   but David was to get round to the back of the Philistines instead of
   attacking them in front and he was to lie quietly in ambush till he
   heard a rustling in the tops of the trees when there was no wind, as
   though they were trodden by the foot of angels and God's host was
   hurrying to the fray. Perhaps this sign, while it was intended to
   encourage David and his people, was meant to intimidate the
   Philistines. They would say, one to another, "What is that noise? What
   is that rustling? There is a sound of something traveling along the
   tops of yonder trees! There is not a breath of wind, but you can hear
   the leaves moving. Listen to the rustling! Something strange is
   happening." The Philistines were most superstitious and would be ready
   to take to their hoofs very speedily! However, whatever it was to them,
   to David it was to be the signal for attacking them. "Now, up and at
   them, with sword and spear, and bow and arrow. Smite the Philistines
   when you hear the sound of the mysterious marching in the tops of the
   mulberry trees."

   Now, what are our signs that we ought to be up and doing for Christ?
   Well, we ought to be up and doing for Him without any signs. Every
   minute men are dying--every hour their souls are passing into eternity
   unsaved--every day Christ is pleading that He may be recompensed for
   His passion. Christians should always be smiting the Philistines of
   sin, but there are certain times that call us to unusual action. And
   what are they?

   To me they are, first, when we see earnestness among God's people. When
   we hear them say, one to another, "Oh, I wish we had a great blessing!"
   When we hear them talk, as one did to me the other day, "God is with
   us. We do have souls converted, but we do not see the great work that
   we long for, the hundreds of thousands brought in, the whole nation
   struck to the heart by a sight of the power of God. Oh, that we could
   see better days, brighter days!" I know many here whom I

   am now looking upon and I remember what they have said to me of their
   own groaning before God for a greater display of His saving power. That
   is to me the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees!

   Again, it is a hopeful sign, when God gives us useful preachers. Oh,
   what a blessing a true Gospel minister is! A man whom God has made for
   Himself is one of the Ascension gifts of Christ. And when you see, as
   you do in our two Brothers, Evangelists Fullerton and Smith, men who
   seem made by God on purpose for their work, suiting each other exactly
   and during those many years God has made them to be like a great cloud
   scattering showers of blessing wherever they go, I think, when I see
   these good men and others being prepared by the Lord, my heart says,
   "That is the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees. God is
   going to bless us."

   There was no better proof of the Reformation having begun than when
   Luther began to speak out against the abominations of Rome, and Zwingli
   lifted up his voice, and Farel proclaimed the old faith, and Calvin
   came forth to declare the Truth of God, and Beza and multitudes of
   others gave their testimony. Those were the birds that sang because the
   sun was rising! And when God gives us useful preachers, they are among
   the signs that He is coming near us to bless the people!

   Well, when the preachers are there, with a praying people at their
   back, then, when you see crowds come together to hear the Word, do you
   not think that there is the sound of a going in the tops of the
   mulberry trees? Oh, what would some preachers do to get the people to
   hear them at all? Ah, what are they not doing, dear Friends? As things
   now go, I would not wonder at all if we were to have, in some of our
   places of worship, a part of Mr. Barnum's circus in order to attract a
   congregation! We have all kinds of fiddling, tinkering and I know not
   what, going on to get people to come and hear what is called the
   Gospel. "Oh," said one, "but he brought so many to the place!" Yes, if
   they had had a clown out of the theater, he would, no doubt have
   brought still more. If that is all that you need--simply to gather
   together a crowd--it is not so very difficult if you are not squeamish
   about the means you employ. But, oh, when God sends the people to hear
   the Gospel and nothing else--and they come and listen to what a man has
   to say to them about Heaven and Hell, life and death, the Cross of
   Christ and the way of salvation--that is the sound of a going in the
   tops of the mulberry trees!

   And, Beloved, we may say the same as soon as there is interest felt in
   the Lord's work, as soon as people begin to talk about it and say, one
   to another, "What did you hear, there?" or, "What did the preacher say
   about the way of salvation?" Better still, when some begin to be
   impressed, when you find, after the meeting, some in tears who do not
   know much about the Gospel, yet, but who want to know. And when, here
   and there, you see signs of deep repentance for sin and a humble
   trembling, about which, perhaps, you hardly dare say much, but you
   rejoice that it is there--all these are tokens for good! What a comfort
   it is to see, in boys and girls, even in little children, some desire
   towards God! This is the going in the tops, the green shoots of the
   trees, this is the treading of angel's footsteps where one would think
   footsteps could never be! This is what we need and as we have seen a
   good deal of it of late, we are looking for more of it!

   And whenever you Christian people begin to see that there is some
   impression made upon the person sitting with you in the pew, edge up to
   that individual and begin to speak to him quietly but earnestly about
   his soul. Do not let anybody go away from the services without having a
   personal application of the Truth of God made to them. Here I stand in
   the pulpit and fire my guns, yet the shot may hit nobody. But if each
   one of you would carry his own private pocket-pistol and just apply it
   to the ear of every hearer before he goes away, there would be a good
   deal more execution done! There is many a man who is not startled by
   the firing of the Woolwich Infant, one of the biggest guns in the
   world, but he would be very much astonished if he had that kind of
   private, personal dealing with his own soul, here, from you, man to
   man, and hand to hand! Try that plan during the special services--ask
   the Lord to enable you to summon up courage enough to do it.

   And you, good Sisters, who are too timid, as, yet to attempt that good
   work, break the ice, once, and there will not be much difficulty after
   that. You will find it to be a happy thing to speak about Jesus to
   souls that come in your way. "When you hear the sound of a going, then
   you shall bestir yourself." My aged Brother, you have been attending
   here for many years and you are rather an old saint, but you are also
   rather an old sinner for never having spoken to other people about
   their souls! I want to urge even you to begin, you who know most and
   say most, you who actually have had a long experience of the things of
   God, but have pocketed it and kept it to yourself. Now I earnestly say
   to you, as God did to David, "When you hear the sound of a going in the
   tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall bestir yourself."

   "That is right, Mr. Spurgeon," says one, "stir them up." I did not say
   "them." I said, and my text says, "Then you shall bestir yourself."
   Dear Friends, it is all very well to say, "I like to see an earnest
   Church." So do I, but it is better to have every member zealously
   seeking the souls of others, for that is the way to have an earnest
   Church, and that is the way

   the blessing comes. David, you must bestir yourself! Then the soldiers
   who are with you will catch the fire from their leader and they will
   bestir themselves.

   IV. Now I finish by saying just a little, in the fourth place, about A
   SURE RESULT FOLLOWING--"And David did so, as the Lord had commanded
   him," and "smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer."

   The result was all that David could have expected and more. Obedient
   action secured it. David simply "did so, as the Lord had commanded
   him," but he, "smote the Philistines from Geba till you come to Gazer."
   They could not stand before him--he won an overwhelming victory and you
   do not hear much more about the Philistines after this. That final
   stroke had crushed them down. So, Beloved, may the Lord send us a great
   victory this next week if so it pleases Him! Cry to Him for it, pray
   for it believingly and it must be granted to us!

   "David did so, as the Lord had commanded him." I wonder of how many of
   my dear friends it may be said as of David, "he did so, as the Lord had
   commanded him." I know that it will be said of many, that you have
   thought about it. But David did so, not merely thought about it! He
   probably thought, but he also "did so." He came to the practical point.
   "I shall try and do a little something to help the mission," says
   someone. "I did give away one handbill the other night." Yes, yes, that
   is all right, but, "David did so," that is, he did bestir himself and
   he did bestir himself most when he saw the signs and tokens of the
   Divine Power being put forth. "David did so, as the Lord had commanded
   him."

   If I habitually look after others and speak individually to them about
   their souls, and if I bring the Gospel before them, either in a printed
   form or voice--if I keep on testifying of Christ to everybody who will
   give me a hearing--I shall have conversions as surely as I am a living
   man. It cannot be otherwise. If you continue looking to God to go
   before you and follow after Him with that part of the work which He has
   put into your hands, and which is a great privilege to be engaged in,
   you shall not labor in vain, nor spend your strength for nothing!

   "Paul planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase." How many
   times I have heard that text mangled and destroyed by being misquoted,
   "Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but except God give the
   increase, all the labor is in vain." There is no such text in the
   Bible, although the statement happens to be true for all that! The
   other Truth of God, which is in the Bible, is Paul's declaration, "I
   have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase." You, Paul,
   go on planting. You, Apollos, go on watering. And if God does not give
   the increase, let us know. What will we do when we hear it? Why, we
   will seek to learn the reason why and we will go to His Throne with
   tears and cries and say, "Lord, You have changed the whole business! It
   used to be, 'Paul planted, Apollos watered; and God gave the increase,'
   but now Paul plants, and Apollos waters, and there is no increase!
   Lord, what hinders the blessing?" And we will keep on crying to Him and
   never let Him go until He blesses us.

   My dear Hearers, you who are unconverted, if you feel any spiritual
   emotions in your hearts, if you feel any desires towards God, if you
   feel any softening, if you feel any quickening, then bestir yourselves!
   And if ever, on brighter days than usual, you get just a little hope of
   salvation, then bestir yourselves! Oh, I pray you, you who are seeking
   the Lord, when there is any encouragement given to you--and how often
   encouragement does come--do not miss it! Take the tide at the flood.
   Come to Jesus just as you are. Trust Him and find in Him eternal life.
   May his blessing be with you all for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 144; 2 Samuel 5:17-25.

   Psalm 144. A Psalm of David. No doubt written after some great victory
   and also before another severe struggle. The Christian man seldom
   escapes from one difficulty without falling into another. Thanks be
   unto God, He that is with us in six troubles will not forsake us in the
   seventh!

   Verse 1. Blessed is the LORD my strength, which teaches my hand to war,
   and my fingers to fight. David does not ascribe any honor to himself.
   Human strength is from within, from the nerves, sinews and muscles, but
   the Believer's strength is from without--"Blessed is Jehovah my
   strength." Now, if Jehovah is our strength, then nothing can be too
   difficult for us, for he whose strength is the Omnipotence of God can
   do all things. "Which teaches my hands to war." Just as the young
   soldier was, as it were, bound apprentice to the old warrior, went out
   to learn the drill and, afterwards, was taken by him into the battle,
   so does the Lord by Providence and by experience train His people's
   hands to war and their fingers to fight.

   2. My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my
   shield, and He in whom I trust. Here are six names, or rather, five
   titles of God and then an inference from them--"He in whom I trust."
   Oh, I know, you people of God, you can say of Jehovah, "He is the One
   in whom I trust." Rely upon anyone else and your hopes are doomed to
   disappointment--as a bowing wall shall he be--and as a tottering fence.
   Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his refuge! Mind that you
   stand to this and never depart from it.

   2. Who subdues my people under me. Probably this Psalm was written
   after the crushing out of the great revolt under Absalom, and well
   might David ascribe to the Divine hand his deliverance from that trial.
   It seemed as if the kingdom had gone from him--his ungrateful son had
   stolen the people's hearts and yet God was pleased to give him back his
   kingdom--and to set him upon his throne yet more firmly than before.
   "Who subdues my people under me." Christian, say that it is God who
   subdues your troubles, God who conquers your sins, God who enlightens
   your darkness, God who does all things for you! Give Him all the praise
   for every deliverance!

   3. LORD, what is man that You take knowledge of him! Or the son of man,
   that You make account of him! Have you not often felt like this? You
   have said, "Lord, how could You have bestowed such favors upon me, so
   utterly unworthy, so insignificant, so unknown, so worthless?" "What is
   man, that You take knowledge of him?"

   4. Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passes away.
   You know that a shadow is nothing. It is rather the absence of
   something than anything in itself. Shadow is the absence of light and
   what is man but, as it were, the absence of light, the absence of
   anything that is substantial? He is but the fleeting shadow of some
   earthly object which soon passes away. Having thus magnified God for
   the past and marveled at His loving kindness, the Psalmist now turns to
   prayer--

   5. Bow Your heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and
   they shall smoke. God did but set one foot upon Mount Sinai and it
   became altogether on a smoke. "The hills melted like wax at the
   Presence of the Lord." Well, Believer, you have many mountains, but you
   can ask God to "touch the mountains, and they shall smoke." No matter
   what the mountains may be--high as the heavens your troubles may
   ascend, till they even seem to block up your pathway to the skies--yet
   one touch of the Divine finger shall make them melt away like wax
   before the fire--and you shall march on triumphantly to your God.

   6. 7. Cast forth lightning and scatter them: shoot out Your arrows, and
   destroy them. Send Your hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
   great waters, from the hand of strange children. Moses, you know, was
   called, "one drawn out of the water," so are all Gods people--they are
   drawn out of floods of tribulation. They are surrounded by those floods
   as though deserted and left there to perish, but keen is the eye that
   watches over them, strong is the hand that preserves them and sure is
   the arm that delivers them!

   8. Whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
   falsehood. They swear, but they perjure themselves. They lift up the
   right hand but they lie all the while. Rid me, O God, from such men,
   for, of all enemies, those that can lie are the worst, for you never
   know where you are with such people. Snakes in the grass are the most
   dangerous reptiles and enemies who will do any evil thing in order to
   ruin you, and who will tell any lie in the world in order to injure
   you, are the hardest to overthrow.

   9-11. I will sing a new song unto You, O God: upon a psaltery and an
   instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto You. It is He that
   gives salvation unto kings: who delivers David, His servant, from the
   hurtful sword. Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange
   children, whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right
   hand offalsehood. You see, good men sometimes repeat their
   prayers--they present the same petition over, again, and they thus
   follow the example of Christ, who prayed three times, "saying the same
   words."

   12. That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth, that our
   daughters may be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a
   palace. Or, rather, "of a temple." This should be the prayer of every
   parent, that his sons may be bringing forth fruit unto God, that his
   daughters may be fixed as polished stones in the Church of God to form
   a part of the great spiritual temple.

   13. That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store. When
   this is the case, spiritually--when there is milk for babes, meat for
   strong men and not a little of each, but more than enough for all--then
   are we very happy.

   13. That our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
   streets. Spiritual fertility is a blessed thing, when each Christian,
   each of the Lord's sheep, becomes prolific in increasing Christ's
   flock.

   14. That our oxen may be strong to labor. That the ministers of God may
   be mighty. That Sunday school teachers and all earnest laborers may
   have strength given to them.

   14. That there is no breaking in, nor going out. That there are no
   wolves to destroy by breaking in and that there are no sheep to suffer
   injury by going astray.

   14, 15. That there is no complaining in our streets. Happy are the
   people who are in such a case: yes, happy are the people whose God is
   the LORD. May this be our case! And if it is our case, then the Lord is
   our God even at this day!

   Now let us read about two interesting incidents in David's warrior
   life.

   2 Samuel 5:17. But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed
   David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David. To
   thrust him down and kill him if they could--and so put an end to his
   prosperous reign!

   17-20. And David heard of it, and went down to the hold. The
   Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
   And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
   Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hands? And the LORD said
   unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
   your hands. And David came to Baal-Perazim, and David smote them there,
   and said, The LORD has broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the
   breach of waters. As a flood breaks forth and carries all before it!

   20,21. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-Perazim. And
   there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. The
   Philistines brought their gods with them, in the hope of being,
   thereby, defended. But, "David and his men burned them." That was the
   very best thing to do with them. What a pity they did not save them for
   aesthetic purposes! Thus do men with fine old works of art, like
   pictures of the Virgin Mary. No, no, burn them! That is the very best
   thing to do with anything that ever has been worshipped by mortal man.
   If they have ever been set up in the place of God, they are cursed from
   that moment--let them be burned, or dashed in pieces--or in some way
   destroyed. "There they left their images and David and his men burned
   them."

   22-24. And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in
   the valley of Rephaim. And when David enquired of the LORD, He said,
   You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon
   them over against the mulberry trees. And let it be, when you hear the
   sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall
   bestir yourself. Or be sharp and go at them!

   24, 25. For then shall the LORD go out before you, to smite the host of
   the Philistines. And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him. I
   hope that may be said of you and me all our lives!

   25. And smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer. That
   is, he utterly overthrew them and drove them away.

All Comers To Christ Welcomed

   (No. 2349)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 17, 1889.

   "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." John 6:37.

   EOD CHRIST will not die in vain. His Father gave Him a certain number
   to be the reward of His soul travail and He will have every one of
   them, as He said, "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me."
   Almighty Grace shall sweetly constrain them all to come. My father
   recently gave me some letters which I wrote to him when I began to
   preach. They are almost boyish epistles, but, in reading through them,
   again, I noticed in one of them this expression, "How I long to see
   thousands of men saved, but my great comfort is that some will be
   saved, must be saved, shall be saved, for it is written, 'All that the
   Father gives Me shall come to Me.'"

   The question for each of you to ask is, "Do I belong in that number?" I
   am going to preach with the view of helping you to find out whether you
   belong to that, "all," whom the Father gave to Christ--the "all" who
   shall come to Him. We can use the second part of the verse to help us
   to understand the first. "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast
   out," will explain our Savior's previous Words, "All that the Father
   gives Me shall come to Me."

   I shall have no time for any further preface. I must at once get to my
   subject and try to put everything in a condensed form. Kindly give heed
   to the word, think about it, pray over it--and may God the Holy Spirit
   apply it to all your hearts!

   I. First, notice in the text THE NECESSITY OF CHARACTER--"Him that
   comes to Me." If you want to be saved, you must come to Christ. There
   is no other way of salvation under Heaven but coming to Christ. Go
   wherever else you will, you will be disappointed and lost--it is only
   by coming to Him that you can by any possibility have eternal life!

   What is it to come to Christ? Well, it implies leaving all other
   confidences. To come to anybody is to leave everybody else. To come to
   Christ is to leave everything else--to leave every other hope, every
   other trust. Are you trusting to your own works? Are you trusting to a
   priest? Are you trusting to the merits of the Virgin Mary, or the
   saints and angels in Heaven? Are you trusting to anything but the Lord
   Jesus Christ? If so, leave it, and have done with it! Come away from
   every other reliance and trust to Christ Crucified, for this is the
   only way of salvation, as Peter said to the rulers and elders of
   Israel, "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
   other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."--

   "To Jesus bleeding on the tree, Turn you your eye, your heart," and
   come to Him at once and your soul shall live forever!

   To come to Jesus means, in brief, trusting Him. He is a Savior--that is
   His business--come to Him and trust Him to save you. If you could save
   yourself, you would not need a Savior, and now that Christ has set up
   to be a Savior, let Him do the business. He will. Come and lay all your
   needs at His feet and trust Him. Resolve that, if lost, you will be
   lost trusting alone in Jesus, and that can never be! Tie up all your
   hopes into one bundle and put that bundle upon Christ. Let Him be all
   your salvation, all your desire and you will be surely saved!

   I have sometimes tried to explain to you what the life of faith is
   like. It is very much like a man walking on a tight rope. The Believer
   is told that he shall not fall, He trusts in God that he shall not, but
   every now and then he says, "What a way it is down there if I did
   fall!" I have often had this experience. I have gone up an invisible
   staircase--I could not see the next step, but when I put my foot down
   on it, I found that it was solid granite. I could not see the next step
   and it seemed as

   if I should plunge into an abyss. Yet have I gone on upward, steadily,
   one step at a time, never able to see farther into absolute darkness,
   as it seemed, and yet always with a light just where the light was
   needed.

   When I used to hold a candle for my father, in the evening, when he was
   sawing wood out in the yard, he used to say, "Boy, hold the candle
   where I am sawing, don't look over there." And I have often thought to
   myself, when I wanted to see something in the middle of next week, or
   next year, that the Lord seemed to say to me, "Hold your candle on the
   piece of work which you have to do today--and if you can see that, be
   satisfied, for that is all the light you need just now." Suppose that
   you could see into next week? It would be a great mercy if you lost
   your sight a while, for a far-seeing gaze into care and trouble is no
   gain! "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof"--as sufficient unto
   the day will be the good thereof.

   But the Lord does train His people for the skies by testing their faith
   in the matter of His daily care of them. Often a man's reliance upon
   God for the supply of his earthly needs proves that he has trusted the
   Lord for the weightier affairs relating to his soul's salvation. Do not
   draw a line between the temporal and the spiritual and say, "God will
   go just so far--and I must not take such and such a thing to Him in
   prayer." I remember hearing of a certain good man, of whom one said,
   "Why, he is a very curious man--he prayed about a key the other day!"
   Why not pray about a key? Why not pray about a pin? Sometimes it may be
   as important to pray about a pin as to pray about a kingdom! Little
   things are often the linchpins of great events. Take care that you
   bring everything to God in faith and prayer. "Be careful for nothing;
   but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God."

   I have turned aside from my subject for a minute, but let us now think,
   again, of this matter of coming to Christ. To come to Jesus not only
   implies leaving all other confidences and trusting Christ, it also
   means following Him. If you trust Him, you must obey Him. If you leave
   your soul in His hands, you must take Him to be your Master, and your
   Lord, as well as your Savior. Christ has come to save you from sin, not
   in sin. He will, therefore, help you to leave your sin, whatever it is.
   He will give you the victory over it! He will make you holy. He will
   help you to do whatever you should do in the sight of God. He is able
   to save unto the uttermost them who come unto God by Him--but you must
   come to Him if you would be saved by Him.

   To put together all I have said--you must quit every other hope; you
   must take Jesus to be your sole confidence--and then you must be
   obedient to His command and take Him to be your Master and Lord. Will
   you do that? If not, I have nothing to say to you except this--He that
   believes not in Him will perish without hope! If you will not have
   God's remedy for your soul malady, the only remedy that there is, there
   remains for you nothing but blackness and dismal darkness forever and
   ever for you!

   II. But, now, secondly, while there is this necessity of character,
   notice, also, THE UNIVERSALITY OF PER-SONS--"Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out."

   Granted that he comes to Christ, that is all that is needed. Does
   someone say, "Sir, I am a very obscure person. Nobody knows me. My name
   was never in the papers and never will be. I am a nobody"? Well, if Mr.
   Nobody comes to Christ, He will not cast him out! Come along, you
   unknown person, you anonymous individual, you that everybody but Christ
   forgets! If even you come to Jesus, He will not cast you out.

   Another says, "I am so very odd." Do not say much about that, for I am
   odd, too. But, dear Friends, however odd we are, though we may be
   thought very eccentric and some may even consider us a little touched
   in the head, yet, nevertheless, for all that, Jesus says, "Him that
   comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." Come along with you, Mr.
   Oddman! You shall not be lost for lack of brains, nor even for having
   too many--though that is not a very common misfortune! If you will but
   come to Christ, though you have no talent, though you are but poor and
   will never make much headway in the world, Jesus says, "Him that comes
   to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   "Ah," says a third friend, "I do not mind about being obscure, or being
   eccentric, but it is the greatness of my sin that keeps me back from
   Christ." Let us read the text again--"Him that comes to Me I will in no
   wise cast out." If he had been guilty of seven murders and all the
   whoredoms and adulteries that ever defiled mortal man! If impossible
   sins could be charged against him--yet if he came to Christ, mark you,
   if he came to Christ--the promise of Jesus would be fulfilled even in
   his case, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   "But," says another, "I am completely worn out. I am good for nothing.
   I have spent all my days and years in sin. I have come to the very end
   of the chapter, I am not worth anybody's having." Come along with you,
   you derelict of life! Jesus

   says, "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out." You have to
   walk with two sticks, do you? Never mind, come to Jesus! You are so
   feeble that you wonder that you are alive at your advanced age? My Lord
   will receive you if you are a hundred years of age--there have been
   many cases in which persons have been brought to Christ even after that
   age! There are some very remarkable instances of that fact on record.
   Christ says, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." If he
   were as old as Methuselah, if he did but come to Christ, he would not
   be cast out!

   "Alas," says one, "I am in a worse case than even that aged friend, for
   beside being old, I have resisted the Spirit of God! I have been many
   years troubled in my conscience, but I have tried to cover it all up. I
   have stifled every godly thought." Yes, yes, and it is a very sad
   thing, too. But for all that, if you come to Christ, if you can even
   make a dash for salvation and come to Jesus, He cannot cast you out!

   Perhaps One friend says, "I am afraid that I have committed the
   unpardonable sin." If you come to Christ, you have not, I know--for him
   that comes to Him, Jesus will in no wise cast out! He cannot,
   therefore, you have not committed the unpardonable sin. Come along with
   you, man, and if you are blacker than all the rest of the sinners in
   the world, so much the more glorious shall be the Grace of God when it
   shall have proved its power by washing you whiter than snow in the
   precious blood of Jesus!

   "Ah," says one, "you do not know me, Sir." No, dear Friend, I do not.
   But, perhaps, one of these days I may have that pleasure. "It will not
   be any pleasure to you, Sir, for I am an apostate. I used to be a
   professor of religion, but I have given it all up, and I have gone back
   to the world, willfully and wickedly doing all manner of evil things."
   Ah, well, if you can but come to Christ, though there were seven
   apostasies piled, one upon another, still His promise stands true, "Him
   that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." Whatever the past, or
   whatever the present, backslider, return to Christ, for He stands to
   His solemn promise, and there are no exceptions mentioned in my
   text--"Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   "Well, Sir," cries another, "I should like to come to Christ, but I do
   not feel fit to come." Then, come all unfit, just as you are! Jesus
   says, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." If I were
   awakened in the middle of the night by a cry of, "Fire!" and I saw that
   someone was at the window with a ladder, I do not think that I would
   stay in bed, and say, "I have not my black necktie on," or, "I have not
   my best waistcoat on." I would not speak in that way at all! I would be
   out of the window as quickly as ever I could, and down the ladder! Why
   do you talk about your fitness, fitness, fitness? I have heard of a
   cavalier, who lost his life because he stopped to curl his hair when
   Cromwell's soldiers were after him. Some of you may laugh at the man's
   foolishness, but that is all that your talk about fitness is! What is
   all your fitness but the curling of your hair when you are in imminent
   danger of losing your soul? Your fitness is nothing to Christ. Remember
   what we sang at the beginning of the service--

   "Let not conscience make you linger,

   Nor of fitness fondly dream!

   All the fitness He requires

   Is to feel your need of him!

   This He gives you

   'Tis the Spirit's rising beam!"

   Come to Christ just as you are--foul, vile, careless, godless,
   Christless! Come now, even now, for Jesus said, "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out."

   Is there not a glorious width about my text? "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out." What, "him," is this? It is, "him that
   comes!" What, "him that comes"? Any "him that comes" in all the world!
   If he comes to Christ, he shall not be cast out! A red man, or a black
   man, or a white man, or a yellow man, or a copper-colored man--whatever
   he is, if he comes to Jesus, he shall in no wise be cast out!

   When you mean to put a thing broadly, it is always best to state it and
   leave it. Do not go into details! The Savior does not. Some years ago
   there was a man, a kind, loving husband, who wished to leave to his
   wife all his property. Whatever he had, he intended her to have it all,
   as she ought. So he put down in his will, "I leave to my beloved wife,
   Elizabeth, all that I have." That was all right. Then he went on to
   describe in detail what he was leaving her, and he wrote, "All my
   freehold and personal estate." The most of his property happened to be
   leasehold, so the wife did not get it because her husband gave a
   detailed description! It was in the detail that the property slipped
   away from the good woman.

   Now, there is no detail at all here--"Him that comes." That means that
   every man, woman and child beneath the broad heavens, who will but come
   and trust in Christ, shall in no wise be cast out! I thank God that
   there is no allusion to any particular character, in order especially
   to say, "People of that character shall be received," for then the
   characters left out might be supposed to be excluded. But the text
   clearly means that every soul that comes to Christ shall be received by

   Him!

   III. The flight of time hurries me on! I therefore beg you to listen
   earnestly while I speak to you, in the third place,

   about THE UNMISTAKEABLENESS OF THE PROMISE--"Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise"--that is, for no

   reason, under no circumstances, at no time, under no conditions
   whatever--"I will in no wise cast out." And which means, being
   interpreted, "I will receive him, I will save him, I will bless him."

   Then if you, my dear Friend, come to Christ, how could the Lord cast
   you out? How could He do it in consistency with His truthfulness?
   Imagine my Lord Jesus making this declaration and giving it to us as an
   inspired Scripture, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out,"
   and yet casting out somebody, even that unknown somebody up in the
   corner! Why, it would be a lie! It would be a gross lie! I pray you,
   blaspheme not my Lord, the truthful Christ, by supposing that He could
   be guilty of such conduct as that! He could do as He liked about whom
   He would receive until He made the promise--but after He had pledged
   His word, He bound Himself by the veracity of His Nature to keep it
   and, as long as Christ is the truthful Christ, He must receive every
   soul that comes to Him.

   But let me also ask you, suppose that you came to Jesus and He cast you
   out, with what hands could He do it? "With His own hands," you answer.
   What? Christ coming forward to cast out a sinner who has come to Him? I
   ask again, with what hands could He do it? Would He do it with those
   pierced hands that still bear the marks of the nails? The Crucified
   rejecting a sinner? Ah, no, He has no hand with which to do such a
   cruel work as that, for He has given both His hands to be nailed to the
   tree for guilty men! He has neither hand, nor foot, nor heart with
   which to reject sinners, for all these have been pierced in His death
   for them! Therefore He cannot cast them out if they come to Him.

   Let me ask you another question, What profit would it be to Christ if
   He did cast you out? If my dear Lord, with the crown of thorns, the
   pierced side and the wounded hands, were to cast you away, what glory
   would it bring to Him? If He cast you into Hell, you who have come to
   Him, what happiness would that bring to Him? If He were to cast you
   away, you who have sought His face, you who trust His love and His
   blood, by what conceivable method could that ever render Him the
   happier or the greater? It cannot be!

   What would such a supposition involve? Imagine for a moment that Jesus
   did cast away one who came to Him. If it were ascertained that one soul
   came to Christ and yet He had cast him away, what would happen? Why,
   there are thousands of us who would never preach again! For one, I
   would have done with the business. If my Lord can cast away a sinner
   who comes to Him, I cannot, with a clear conscience, go and preach from
   His Words, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." Moreover,
   I should feel that if He failed in one promise, He might fail in
   others! I could not go and preach a possible but doubtful Gospel! I
   must have, "shalls," and, "wills," from the eternal Throne of God--but
   if it is not so, our preaching is in vain--and your faith is also in
   vain.

   See what would follow if one soul came to Christ and Christ cast him
   out. All the saints would lose their confidence in Him. If a man breaks
   his promise once, it is of no use for him to say, "Well, I am generally
   truthful." You have caught him false to his word, once, and you will
   not trust Him again, will you? No! And if our dear Lord, whose every
   Word is Truth, could break one of His promises only once, He would not
   be trusted by His people any more--and His Church would lose the faith
   that is her very life.

   Ah, me, and then they would hear of it up in Heaven. And one soul that
   came to Christ, and was cast away, would stop the music of the harps of
   Heaven, would dim the luster of the Glory Land, and take away its joy,
   for it would be whispered among the glorified, "Jesus has broken His
   promise! He cast away a praying, believing soul! He may break His
   promise to us--He may drive us out of Heaven!" When they began to
   praise Him, this one act of His would make a lump come in their throats
   and they would be unable to sing. They would be thinking of that poor
   soul that trusted Him and was cast away-- how could they sing, "Unto
   Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood," if
   they had to add--"But He did not wash all that came to Him, though He
   promised that He would"?

   I do not even like to talk of all that the supposition would involve!
   It is something so dreadful to me, for they would hear of it in
   Hell--and they would tell it to one another and an awful glee would
   take possession of the fiendish hearts of

   the devil and all his companions! And they would say, "The Christ is
   not true to His Word! The boasted Savior rejected one who came to Him.
   He used to receive even harlots--He even let one wash His feet with her
   tears! And publicans and sinners came and gathered about Him and He
   spoke to them in tones of love. But here is one--well, he was too vile
   for the Savior to bless! He was too far gone, Jesus could not restore
   him! Christ could not cleanse him. He could save little sinners, but
   not great ones! He could save sinners eighteen hundred years ago. Oh,
   He made a fine show of them, but His power is now exhausted! He cannot
   save a sinner now!" Oh, in the halls of Hell, what jests and ridicule
   would be poured upon that dear name and, I had almost said, justly, if
   Christ cast out one who came to Him! But, Beloved, that can never be!
   It is as sure as God's oath, as certain as Jehovah's Being that he who
   comes to Christ shall in no wise be cast out! I gladly bear my own
   witness before this assembled throng that--

   "I came to Jesus as I was Weary and worn, and sad. I found in Him a
   resting place, And He has made me glad."

   Come, each one of you, and prove the text to be true in your own
   experience, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 89:1-37; John 6:22-40.

   Psalm 89. Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. That is to say, an instructive
   Psalm, written by or for one Ethan, one of the great singers of David's
   day. He sings of the Covenant, the Covenant with David, ordered in all
   things and sure. There is no higher theme for song than the Covenant of
   God's Grace. One marvels that it has not more often been sung by those
   who are the gifted children of poesy.

   Verse 1. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever. Another
   subject might wear out, but this glorious topic will never be
   exhausted! Here is a theme which we can sing of in eternity as well as
   in time. Let others choose what subject they may, "I will sing of the
   mercies of Jehovah forever."

   1. With my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness to all
   generations. God's faithfulness is the mercy of His mercy! It is the
   center point of His goodness that His goodness endures forever. We are
   not only to sing, we are to teach. The Psalmist says, "With my mouth
   will I make known Your faithfulness to all generations." In telling his
   own experience, narrating what he had observed, as well as what he had
   proved of God's faithfulness to His promise and His Covenant, he would
   do this so that following generations should know about it. We are the
   schoolmasters of the ages to come--I mean, saints who have experienced
   the mercy and the faithfulness of God. We ought to make known Jehovah's
   faithfulness to all generations that are yet to come.

   2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever. What a
   building--Mercy! God's mercy is to be built up forever.

   2. Your faithfulness shall You establish in the very heavens. Like the
   great arch you see in the firmament on high, un-buttressed and
   unpillared, yet it stands fast. So shall God's faithfulness be built
   up, settled and established in the very heavens. And now God speaks--

   3. I have made a Covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My
   servant. Well might the Psalmist say, in the second verse, "I have
   said," when God in the third verse says, "I have sworn." It is ours to
   say, but it is God's to say with such tremendous solemnity that doubt
   cannot be tolerated! "I have made a Covenant with My chosen," King
   David, who is, however, but the type of his greater Son, our Lord Jesus
   Christ, the heir of the dynasty of David. With Him is this Covenant
   made forever.

   4. Your seed will I establish forever, and build up your throne to all
   generations. Selah. Whatever may happen in the world, David's Seed is
   always reigning. Whatever kings may lose their crowns, King Jesus will
   never lose the many crowns that are on His head! God has sworn
   it--"Your seed will I establish forever, and build up your throne to
   all generations." Then comes the word, "Selah." Rest. Meditate. And
   truly, here is enough to rest and meditate upon for many a day, if we
   went no farther into the Psalm!

   5. And the heavens shall praise Your wonder, O LORD: Your faithfulness,
   also, in the congregation of the saints. The Psalmist meant to praise
   God at such a rate that the sun, moon and stars should hear his song,
   while angels and the host re-

   deemed by blood should learn to praise God better than ever. "Your
   faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints"-- one saint begins
   to sing of God's faithfulness and the others take it up--for God is not
   faithful to one, only, but to all His people. This is a subject which,
   when once started, will produce an echo in every Believer's heart.

   6. 7. For who in the Heaven can be compared unto the LORD? Who among
   the lions of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? God is greatly to
   be feared in the assembly of the saints. The holiest are always the
   most reverent. There is no fear of God in the assembly of the sinners,
   but, "He is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints."

   7. And to be had in reverence of all them that are about Him. The
   nearer they came to Him, the more is their awe of Him! The greater
   their love, the deeper is their humility. God will not have those about
   Him who are flippant and irreverent! He is "to be had in reverence of
   all them that are about Him."

   8. O LORD God of Hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto You? Or to Your
   faithfulness round about You? Note how the Psalmist harps upon that one
   string--"faithfulness." Ah, dear Friends, there are times when this is
   the sweetest note in the whole scale! "Your faithfulness"--we have a
   God who never forgets His promises, but keeps them to the moment--a God
   who never changes! We have a God who never turns away from His Word.
   "Your faithfulness." Oh, what a blessed virtue is this in God! Let us
   praise Him for it forever. "Your faithfulness round about You"--as if
   the Lord never went outside the ring of faithfulness, never did
   anything that broke His promises, or that made any of His children to
   doubt. And it is even so!

   9. You rule the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof rise, You
   still them. Are you now in a storm, my Brother? My Sister, are you now
   tempest-tossed? Listen to this Word of God and remember the Lord High
   Admiral of the fleet on the Lake of Galilee and how, after He had been
   asleep for awhile, He arose and rebuked the winds and the waves! "You
   rule the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof rise, You still
   them."

   10. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; You have
   scattered Your enemies with Your strong arm. Rahab was Egypt. The word
   means, "strong," "mighty," "proud"--all of which were the
   characteristics of Egypt--which God broke in pieces at the Red Sea.
   Pharaoh was the greatest of monarchs at the time, but, oh, how soon he
   had to yield when God's right arm was bared for war!

   11. The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours: as for the world
   and the fullness thereof, You have founded them. Sometimes we are
   tempted to think that the earth cannot be God's--all over the globe man
   is the master. He claims everything. If men could map out the heavens,
   we would have owners for every single twinkling star and, if they could
   have their way, we would have to buy our light by measure, and our
   sunshine by weight. But, "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness
   thereof." And the heavens are also His.

   12. The north and the south You have created them: Tabor and Hermon.
   East and West, as well as North and South-- 12. Shall rejoice in Your
   name. There is not a place where God is not to be found! All the points
   of the compass are

   compassed by God. You cannot go where the Lord's love reigns not, nor
   where Providence will not follow you.

   13-15. You have a mighty arm: strong is Your hand, and high is Your
   right hand. Justice and judgment are the habitation of Your Throne:
   mercy and truth shall go before Your face. Blessed is the people that
   know the joyful sound. There are some who hear it and yet are not
   blessed. Blessed are they who "know" it, know its peculiar accent, know
   its inward power, know its Omnipotence, know its unchangeableness, know
   it by having tried it and proved it and rested in it! "Blessed is the
   people that know the joyful sound."

   15. They shall walk, O LORD, in the light of Your Countenance. It is
   all the light they need. Let God but smile, it makes their day! If
   every candle were blown out, yet the favor of God would make life
   bright enough for them.

   16. In Your name shall they rejoice all the day: and in Your
   righteousness shall they be exalted. Even in God's righteousness! Until
   we know the Lord, we are afraid of His righteousness, but when we come
   to know Him, His righteousness, which once frowned upon us, becomes our
   Heaven! "God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love."
   God is not unrighteous to cast away a soul that puts its trust in
   Christ. God is one with His people. When we rejoice all the day in His
   name, we are exalted in His righteousness.

   17-19. For You are the glory of their strength: and in Your favor our
   horn shall be exalted. For the LORD is our defense; and the Holy One of
   Israel is our King. Then You spoke in Vision to Your holy one, and
   said, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
   chosen out of the people. This is David first, but it is Christ high
   above David. One of ourselves,

   the carpenter's Son, yet has God made Him to be the Head over all
   things for His Church--"I have exalted one chosen out of the people."

   20, 21. I have found David, My servant, with My holy oil have I
   anointed him: with whom My hand shall be established: My arm, also,
   shall strengthen him. The full power of God is with Christ. That same
   arm that bears up the earth's huge pillars and spreads the heavens
   abroad, is engaged on behalf of the cause and Kingdom of the Son of
   David.

   22. The enemy shall not exact upon Him; nor the son of wickedness
   afflict Him. He had enough of that when He was upon the earth, but it
   is all over now. He has gone into His Glory and the enemy cannot touch
   Him.

   23. And I will beat down His foes before His face and plague them that
   hate Him. This is the portion of all haters of Christ. God will,
   somehow or other, in the order of His Providence, bring the evil home
   to them. If they will not have God's Son, they shall not have His
   mercy--they shall, sooner or later, be beaten down before His face.

   24. 25. But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with Him: and in My
   name shall His horn be exalted. I will set His hand also in the sea,
   and His right hand in the rivers. He shall reign "from sea to sea, and
   from the river unto the ends of the earth." We may go on to fight for
   Him, for His triumph is sure!

   26. 27. He shall cry unto Me, You are My Father, My God, and the rock
   of my salvation. Also I will make Him My firstborn, higher than the
   kings of the earth. So He is! First-born among men, first-born of
   kings, His Throne is loftier than the most imperial power on the earth.
   Blessed be His name! Let us adore Him tonight and here, in the midst of
   His people, let us crown Him Lord of All!

   28-36. My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, and My Covenant shall
   standfast with him. His seed also will I make to endure forever, and
   his throne as the days of Heaven. If his children forsake My Law, and
   walk not in My judgments; if they break My statutes, and keep not My
   Commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and
   their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless My loving kindness will I not
   utterly take from them, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail. My Covenant
   will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips. Once
   have I sworn by My holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed
   shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me. The Son of
   David is still King in the midst of the true Israel. Still Jesus reigns
   and on and on, forever and forever, great David's greater Son shall be
   King of Kings, and Lord of Lords!

   37. It shall be established forever as the moon, and as a faithful
   witness in Heaven. Selah. Now let us read a passage from the New
   Testament showing how the Lord Jesus dealt with the crowds that came to
   Him.

   John 6:22-26. The day following, when the people which stood on the
   other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save that
   one whereunto His disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with
   His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples were gone away
   alone; (howbeit there came other boats from Tiberius near unto the
   place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks)
   when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither His
   disciples, they also took shipping and came to Capernaum, seeking for
   Jesus. And when they had found Him on the other side of the sea, they
   said unto Him, Rabbi, when did You comer here? Jesus answered them and
   said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, You seek Me not because you saw
   the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
   Mixed motives bring multitudes together. How true our Master was! How
   outspoken! He never tried to win a disciple by holding back the
   truth--and often He spoke very plainly, indeed, as on this
   occasion--"You seek Me not because you saw the miracles, but because
   you did eat of the loaves, and were filled."

   27. Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which
   endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto
   you: for Him has God the Father sealed. He seemed to say to them, "Do
   not come to Me for bread and fish. I have given you that. Come for
   something better. Come to Me for spiritual food--food for your
   souls--food for eternity!" It is with that objective that we should go
   to the House of God--not to listen to this preacher or that--but to
   hear the Word of God, that we may live thereby.

   28. Then said they unto Him, What shall we do, that we might work the
   works of God? "What are the best works that we can do? What are the
   most acceptable?" I wonder what they expected Christ to say? I am sure
   they did not look for the answer that they received.

   29. Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that
   you believe on Him whom He has sent. The greatest, the best, the most
   acceptable work in all the world is that you come and trust Christ!
   This saves you--nothing else will do so. "This is the work of God, that
   you believe on Him whom He has sent."

   30, 31. They said therefore unto Him, What sign do You show, then, that
   we may see and believe You? What do You work? Our fathers did eat manna
   in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.
   See how they came round to the old subject, again--bread to eat? The
   Lord Jesus Christ may point them to something higher and better, but
   their carnal minds always return to that congenial topic--something to
   eat. Their stomach was lord of their heart!

   32. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
   gave you not that bread from Heaven; but My Father gives you the true
   Bread from Heaven. "That which will really feed you and feed you for
   all eternity." Moses could not give the people that bread--only the
   Father can give "the true Bread from Heaven."

   33. For the Bread of God is He which comes down from Heaven and gives
   life unto the world. "The Bread of God is He." What a strange
   expression, yet what a true one! The Bread of Heaven is Christ,
   Himself! You must come and take Him to yourself and trust Him for your
   salvation--and in that way feed upon Him, or you can never have the
   heavenly Bread which both gives life and sustains life.

   34-39. Then said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And
   Jesus said unto them, I am the Bread of life. He that comes to Me shall
   never hunger; and He that believes on Me shall never thirst. But I said
   unto you, That you also have seen Me and believe not. All that the
   Father gives Me shall come to Me, and him that comes to Me I will in no
   wise cast out. For I came down from Heaven, not to do My own will, but
   the will of Him that sent Me. And this is the Father's will which has
   sent Me, that of all which He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but
   should raise it up again at the last day. See how the salvation of
   Christ reaches right to the end of all things? You and I may die, but
   though we lie a while in the grave, the salvation of Christ will
   preserve us, to raise us up, again, at the Last Day! There shall not be
   a bone nor a piece of a bone, of a true Believer, left in the enemies'
   land. All Israel and all that belongs to Israel shall come out of this
   Egypt, through the blood of the Lamb--not a hoof shall be left behind.

   40. And this is the will of Him that sent Me that everyone which sees
   the Son, and believes on Him, may have everlasting life: and I will
   raise him up at the Last Day. May all of us see the Son and believe on
   Him, that we may have everlasting life, and that He may raise us up at
   the Last Day, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

"Take, Eat"

   (No. 2350)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 4, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 8, 1888.

   "And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke
   it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My
   body." Matthew 26:26.

   WE are all agreed upon this one point, that the Lord's Supper is an
   emblem of the death of Jesus Christ and of the way by which we receive
   benefit from Him. The bread sets forth His broken body and the cup His
   shed blood. These, separated from each other, show forth His death. The
   way by which we receive this bread and this wine is by eating and
   drinking-- and this sets forth the way by which we receive the merit
   and the virtue of the Lord Jesus Christ--by a faith which is like
   eating, by a trust which is like drinking, by the reception of Christ
   spiritually into our hearts, even as we naturally receive the bread and
   the fruit of the vine into our bodies.

   These two words, then, "Take, eat," are the practical directions
   concerning the Lord's Supper and, spiritually understood, they are the
   Gospel of the Grace of God. Every disciple of the Lord Jesus may hear a
   spiritual voice saying to him, concerning Christ, "Take, eat." And you
   who fear that you are not His disciples, if you wish to be, if there is
   a craving in your heart to possess Him, if you are beginning to feel
   after Him, I venture to say to you, also, "Take, eat." This is the way
   to have Christ--take Him--partake of Him and He is yours.

   You probably remember the extraordinary story of the conversion of
   Augustine, who, after a life of sin, was stricken with compunction of
   conscience. His sorrow of heart was very great and he could not find
   peace till he heard a voice, which may possibly have been that of a
   child on the other side of the wall--I cannot tell--but such a voice he
   heard, saying over and over again, "Tolle, lege; tolle, lege; tolle,
   lege," that is, "Take and read; take and read." And he took the Book
   and read it, studied it believingly, and found peace with God. I have
   prayed that there may be some young Augustine here tonight. If present,
   his name may be, "disgusting," for he is living in sin and iniquity. I
   pray that he may be troubled in his conscience and that he may be led
   to Christ by these words of the text, "Take, eat." May this command
   come home to you and may you catch at it, and put it in practice, and
   may my Master make a great saint out of some great sinner, even an
   Augustine, who shall valiantly defend the Gospel of God's Grace though
   now he sins desperately against Almighty Love! Oh, that it may be so!

   With that end in view, I come to my text. We cannot have many divisions
   to it, can we? There are but two words on which I wish, especially, to
   speak, so they shall be the divisions of my subject. First, "take," and
   secondly, "eat." I. The first word I want you to notice is, "TAKE."

   Just as a doctor might write at the beginning of a prescription, "Take
   such and such things," so the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Take."
   The word is often translated in our New Testament, "Receive." Jesus
   holds out the bread in His hand and says, "Receive it; let it come into
   your hand." "Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it," and then,
   holding it out to His disciples, He said, "Take, take, take," and they
   took it, and the bread became theirs. This is the way that saints get
   blessings--they take them. This is the way that sinners also get
   blessings, by the Grace of God--they take them. They do not make them,
   nor earn them, nor deserve them, but they take them. Jesus Christ says
   to them, "Take," and they obey His voice and take.

   Nobody at the table said, "Lord, I dare not take." But when Jesus said,
   "Take," they took. Nobody said, though perhaps everybody felt, "I am
   not worthy to take," but as Jesus said, "Take," they took. It is always
   the best plan to accept any good thing that is offered to you. If you
   are a very poor man and someone offers you a shilling, I venture to
   give you

   this piece of advice--take it! Do not stand and say to him, "My dear
   Sir, I think that indiscriminate charity is wrong. You have never
   enquired into my character. You do not know whether I really am one of
   the unemployed." If there is a shilling held out to you, my Friend, you
   had better take it. If you are very hungry and there is bread about,
   you had better eat it if it is given to you. If it is freely presented
   to you, freely take it! If that were my case, I would ask no questions,
   not only for conscience's sake, but for my necessity's sake, and
   especially would I do so when, by the Grace of God, the gift is
   presented to me by the Lord Jesus Christ! If He says, "Take," I will
   take! There is nothing freer than a gift, surely, except that perhaps I
   should be freer to take than I might be to give, for our poor natures
   are contracted and we may not always be free in giving, but, surely,
   even selfishness might make us free in taking. A holy desire for your
   own good and your own salvation might prompt you to say, "Yes, Lord, if
   You freely give, I without question will freely take!"

   And I do not suppose that the Master stood holding that piece of bread
   to Peter for half-an-hour. He said, "Take" and Peter took it. "Take,"
   He said to John, and John took it. "Take," He said to Philip, and
   Philip took it at once. Blessed are they who accept Christ the first
   time they hear about Him! Blessed are all they who accept Him at all,
   but thrice blessed are they who, when He says, "Take," through His
   Grace, promptly answer, "Yes, Lord, that I will, and thank You, too,
   most heartily!" Remember those words that we have so often sung--

   "Life is found alone in Jesus,

   Only there 'tis offered you--

   Offered without price or money,

   'Tis the gift of God sent free--

   Take salvation,

   Take it now, and happy be."

   I anticipate that someone will say, "Am I, then, to have Jesus Christ
   by only taking Him?" Just so! Do you need a Savior? There He is--take
   Him! Do you desire to be delivered from the power of sin? He can
   deliver you--take Him to do it! Do you desire to lead a holy, godly
   life? Here is One who can wash you and enable you to live thus. Take
   Him, He is as free as the air--you have no more to pay for Christ than
   you have to pay for the next breath that goes into your lungs! Take Him
   in! Take Him in! That is all that you have to do. If I hear you say, "I
   can hardly think that I, a poor unworthy sinner, such as I am, and just
   as I am, may take Christ," I answer--That is the Gospel which I have to
   give you, for Jesus said,

   "Take, eat."

   The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Take, eat; this is My body."
   Well, then, first of all, see how free Christ must be to sinners,
   because He had a body. Once He had no body--the blessed Son of God was
   pure spirit--but He condescended to be born of Mary. I think I see Him
   as an infant cradled in the manger. The Lord of All stooped so low that
   He hung upon a woman's breast and allowed Himself to be swaddled like
   any other babe! The Lord of Life and Glory has taken human nature! He
   lives at Nazareth as a Child. He grows up as a laboring Man, the
   reputed Son of a carpenter. Working man, your God became a Carpenter
   for you! Take Him! Surely, the very fact that He came among men and
   took a body like our own should encourage us to feel that we may freely
   take Him! His name is Emmanuel, God With Us--and if He is God with us,
   bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh--if He has come so far to bless
   us, let us not doubt that we may freely take what He has come to bring!

   Having taken a body, moreover, remember, next, that in that body He
   suffered. If I had to tell you that Jesus Christ would die to redeem
   you, I would, perhaps, try your faith. But when I have to tell you that
   He has died, that the work of your redemption is accomplished, that
   Jesus cried, "It is finished," before He bowed His head, and gave up
   the ghost. When I tell you that to the utmost farthing He has paid your
   debt and borne your sins in His own body on the tree, this is good
   news, indeed, for it leads me to further say that if He has done all
   this and died, "the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God," we may
   freely take Him, depend upon that! God has set forth His Son to be the
   Propitiation for sin, therefore let us hear Him say, "Take, take,
   take," and let us take what is so freely presented to us!

   My dear Friends, remember, also, that, as Jesus Christ had a body, and
   in that body died, the objective of that death must be outside of
   Himself. He could not have become a Man to gain anything by it. He
   could not have died for any purpose that had to do with only His own
   Glory! He was under no necessity to veil the splendors of His Godhead
   in a mortal body and, in that body, to die. So He must have died for
   other people and, therefore, take Him, take Him! Do you not see that
   these fruits are not on the tree for the tree, itself, but for the
   passerby who, being hungry, may lift his hand and take

   and eat? Oh, that you might have the sense to see that Christ, for sins
   not His own, has died to atone and that, therefore, you may take Him
   and take Him most freely!

   Besides, Jesus Himself gives what we are told to take. Note how this
   verse runs--"Jesus took bread and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it
   to the disciples, and said, Take, eat." What Jesus gives, you may truly
   take. I may not go and take another man's goods, but I may take what He
   gives me. If I were arrested for stealing something and I could truly
   say, "This man gave it to me," I would be no thief, would I? And if
   Jesus Christ gives you Grace and you take it, you are no thief--in
   fact, no man ever lays hold on Christ without a lawful right to do so.
   If a dog runs into a butcher shop and steals a joint of meat, the
   butcher may, perhaps, take it from him and not let him eat what he has
   stolen, but there was never a dog of a sinner who came and laid hold on
   Christ's mercy and then Christ took it away from him! Take it, Sinner,
   and you have secured it! If you dare to seize it, God makes the seizing
   by faith to be a proper thing, for He bids you do it. You can never
   have any right to Christ except this right--that He does freely give to
   those who need, according to the riches of His Grace. Therefore, hear
   this Word of God which says, "Take, take, take." Receive, accept,
   grasp, appropriate, take!

   Jesus Christ, when He said to His disciples, "Take," was their Master,
   and Christ's Word was Law to the disciples. There was not one of them
   who could have said, "I will not take," without being guilty of
   disobedience! Oh, that some poor soul here, tonight, would say, "Is
   there a Savior? Then I will have Him! I will take Him." May the Spirit
   of infinite Love move upon your mind to make you say, as by a kind of
   holy desperation, "I will even now take Him. Whether I may or may not,
   I will take Him! Though my sense of sin says, 'You must not,' and
   though the devil says, 'You dare not,' yet I will take Him! I do
   believe, I will believe, I must believe that Jesus died for me--and I
   will take Him to be my Savior. I will rest myself wholly and alone on
   Him!" If you do this, you shall never perish, for to you and to
   everyone who is Christ's disciple, or who will become His disciple,
   there comes this word of command, "Take, take, take, take, take." Oh,
   blessed news and sweet command! May the Divine Spirit lead you to obey
   it, now, and to take Christ as your Savior!

   II. The second head of the sermon is, EAT. "Take, eat." Eating is such
   a very simple thing that I do not think I shall try to explain it. Go
   home to your supper and you will understand it. Every hungry man, no,
   every living man, knows what it is to eat. Well, what is eating?

   To eat is the innermost kind of reception. It is taking into your very
   self the food set before you. Well, now, take Christ, you who are His
   disciples--take Christ, Himself, His work, His blood, His
   righteousness--take them right into you! Say, "This is for me. I take
   it for myself." I have no partner in anything I eat. What I have eaten,
   I have eaten for myself. You cannot eat for your wife or your child.
   You have to do that for yourself. Now, dear Heart, be brave enough to
   take Christ all to yourself! Say, "This dying Savior is mine, this
   risen Savior is mine. I hope that multitudes of others will have Him,
   but, as for myself, I am going to have Him." When I eat, I am doing an
   action for myself--it must be so. And now, by faith, I take this
   blessed Son of God who became Man, living, dying, risen, I take Him for
   myself unto myself. I beseech you to do that tonight. "It is a selfish
   action," you say. Ah, but it is a necessary action! You have personally
   sinned and you must personally take Christ. You are personally hungry
   and you must personally eat. Who is to condemn you for that? You cannot
   act unselfishly towards others if you do not, yourself, eat, because
   you will not long be alive to be either selfish or unselfish! See to
   this, then. "Take, eat." Receive Christ by the innermost kind of
   reception.

   Eating is also a very familiar kind of reception. It is a thing that
   can be as well performed by a workingman as by a nobleman. Indeed, I
   think it is often better done by the workingman than by the nobleman.
   How they can eat, some of them! And how simple-hearted people, when
   they come to Christ, can eat! If you want to see eating, do not bring
   "My Lord and My Lady" to the choice dainties of a feast, but invite a
   lot of poor, hardworking men! I mean men who have not had enough to eat
   for a month--and there are plenty of that sort about. Set them down to
   a good joint of meat and see how they will eat! Eating is a very
   familiar kind of action and, therefore, we say, concerning the great
   salvation of Jesus Christ, "Take, eat." Take Him right into you! You
   can do this as you take your meals, as you hungry, famished ones devour
   your food--so take in the Lord Jesus Christ--trusting Him, receiving
   Him into yourself and saying, "He is, He shall be altogether mine."

   Now, when food is to be eaten, it is not only taken in, but it has to
   be masticated. It is in the mouth and it is turned over and over so
   that the flavor of it is discerned. Now, in this way, think much of the
   Lord Jesus Christ and His redeeming work. Read, mark, learn and
   inwardly digest the Truth of God. If you feel that you cannot believe,
   think much of what is to be believed and of Him in whom you are to
   believe. That mastication will be an admirable way of feeding upon the
   heav-

   enly food! Jesus died for sinners. Jesus died for sinners! Jesus died
   in the place of sinners! Masticate that great Truth of God and turn it
   over and over--chew that great doctrine with the teeth of your thought
   until you get the very marrow and essence of it into your soul!

   Then there is an inward assimilation that goes on with food. Passing
   into our innermost parts, it begins to build up our body till the food
   that was bread a little while ago becomes flesh and blood. Retain
   Christ in your thought, in your faith, in your heart till, at last,
   Christ gets to be one with you and nourishes your soul, even as your
   food builds up your body. "Take, eat." You know, the whole business of
   eating is, after all, to get the food into yourself. That is the main
   point--to get it so into you that it becomes your own and becomes part
   of yourself. Now, do that with the blessed Lord, Christ, and all His
   wonderful work for sinners! Take it till it gets right into yourself
   and becomes part and parcel of your-self--and you live through it.
   "Take, eat."

   I imagine that I hear someone saying, "Oh, but it seems too
   extraordinary that I, a poor, unworthy one, am to take Christ to be
   mine, as much as I take a piece of bread to be my food!" Well,
   listen--He bids you do it--that is warrant enough! If I am the most
   unworthy one yet out of Hell, if Jesus bids me trust Him, I may trust
   Him! His bidding is sufficient warrant for my doing it! O child of God,
   O you who desire to be His child--He bids you eat! I beseech you,
   hesitate not, but let His bidding be your warrant!

   Jesus Christ condescends to compare Himself to bread, but what is the
   good of bread except for it to be eaten? Why is it made into bread
   except that it should be eaten? Why does it stand in rows in the
   bakers' shops? To be looked at? What? Hungry men in the streets and
   bread, there, as an ornament to be looked at? No, the very making of
   bread means food for men--and when the Lord Jesus Christ compares
   Himself to bread, He means that He has put Himself into such a shape
   and form, in the Covenant of Grace--that He intends us to receive Him.
   Bread that does not get eaten, what can become of it? The manna in the
   wilderness that was not eaten, but laid up, bred worms and stank. Our
   Lord Jesus Christ is of no use unless sinners are saved by Him! A
   Savior who saves nobody? Why, He is like a man who opens a shop and
   never sells any goods. Or a doctor who comes to a town and never has
   any patients! Christ must save sinners! He needs sinners! He longs to
   save sinners! Come and take Him, then. Come and eat of that bread which
   misses its purpose, design and end if it is not eaten! Christ as bread,
   yet not eaten, becomes Christ dishonored.

   "Take, eat." Well, what does this mean--this eating? I will tell you.
   When two men, in the East, took a piece of bread and broke it, and one
   ate one piece, and the other another piece, it meant friendship. I go
   into an Arab's tent and I cannot tell what kind of a fellow he may be.
   He may kill me in the night and rob me--but if he hands me a piece of
   bread and I eat with him--he will not hurt me. The rights of
   hospitality have secured my safety. There is friendship between him and
   me. Now, look--God takes a great delight in Jesus Christ--will you not,
   also, take delight in Him? Then, you see, you have broken bread,
   together, for you delight in the same Person! God trusts His honor with
   Christ--will you trust your soul with Christ? Then you have broken
   bread with God! "Take, eat," says Jesus, and the moment that you have
   done it, there is the friendship, no, there is the Covenant established
   between you and the great Father! I know that God loves Jesus Christ
   better than I do, but I think that I can almost say that He does not
   more truly love Him than I do. Oh, what a Christ He is to my Soul! And
   God loves Him, too--He and I are agreed about one thing--we are agreed
   about a precious Savior and there is a place where we strike hands and
   are friends forever! Our Covenant is made over the Sacrifice of Christ!
   The moment that you have eaten Christ by faith, there is an eternal
   friendship established between you and your God!

   Again, when Jesus says, "Take, eat," His words set forth to us that He
   is to become the true Nourishment of our soul. Souls have to be
   nourished by the Truth of God, that is their spiritual meat, and the
   Lord Jesus Christ--when we think of Him, meditate upon Him, believe in
   Him and receive Him--becomes the food of our heart, the sustenance of
   our spirit. Think much of Him, then! Trust Him much! Meditate upon Him
   much, for thus shall you grow strong in the Lord and be built up so as
   to attain unto the stature of a perfect man in Christ Jesus. This is
   what is meant by the text, "Take, eat."

   This also pictures the wonderful union that there is between Christ and
   His people. That which a man has fed upon becomes indissolubly joined
   to himself. You cannot get away from him that which he ate
   yesterday--it has become a part of himself. I have heard of a priest
   who took away the New Testament from a little Irish boy. The boy said,
   "There are 10 of the chapters you cannot take away." "Why?" asked the
   priest. "Because I have learned them by heart." And so, when you
   receive Christ into your heart, He cannot be taken away from you! Who
   shall separate us from the love of Christ? There is such a union
   between Christ and the Believer that there cannot be a separation
   between them without the destruction of

   Christ and the man, too. They are so interwoven, intertwisted and
   intermingled, that there is no possibility of separating them! So, the
   Savior says to you, who are His disciples, and to you who wish to be,
   "Take, eat." As you will see us, presently, at the Communion Table,
   take the bread and eat it, so do you take Christ and feed upon Him, for
   He commands you so to do! "Take, eat." Dear Hearts, there is nothing
   said about earning it, nothing said about buying it, nothing said about
   being prepared for it! Come, then, take the Lord Jesus Christ and He is
   yours!

   "Oh!" says one, "I will trust Christ, I will take Him now!" You young
   men and young women here, tonight, the first Sabbath of my return after
   my rest, it would be a very happy night for me if you would dare to
   take Christ. When I was in distress of soul, it seemed to me as if I
   must not take Christ. Years ago, when I was a boy of fifteen, that used
   to be my trouble. I dared not think that Christ died for me and I was
   afraid to trust Him with my soul. It gradually dawned upon me that if I
   dared to do it, I might do it--and that if I did do it, it would be
   done and never would be undone! It dawned on me that if I seized the
   opportunity of Jesus Christ passing by and touched the hem of His
   garment, though it would be an awful piece of presumption, as it
   seemed, yet it would be a holy and hallowed presumption and Christ
   would not be angry with me for it! And I know that, when first I
   believed, I seemed as if I were a thief and had stolen a cure, but then
   the Lord Jesus never took it away from me! I ventured, I risked, I
   dared to say, "I believe that He can save me and that He has saved me."
   I rested myself on Him and then I found peace!

   Do so tonight! Jesus said, "He that believes in Me has everlasting
   life." He has it now and it is everlasting. He shall never lose it. He
   that believes in Jesus Christ is not condemned, notwithstanding all his
   past guilt and sin. "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved."
   Now I have given you the whole Gospel. That is how the Master put it
   and I have left out no clause of it. "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." "If you shall confess with your mouth, the Lord Jesus,
   and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead,
   you shall be saved. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness;
   and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

   "Take, eat! Take, eat! Take, eat!" I should like to say those words so
   that you people up there in the top gallery would hear them in 20
   years' time, if you are alive, so that, as you recollect these lamps
   and these tiers of people, you might still seem to hear a voice crying,
   perhaps, from my grave, "Take, eat!" But do not wait 20 years! "Take,
   eat!" Do it tonight! God help you all to do it, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 107; Matthew26:6-30.

   Psalm 107:1. Praise you the LORD. This Psalm begins and ends with
   Hallelujah. So may this service, and so may our lives commence and
   conclude with Hallelujah,

   1. 2. For it is good to sing praises unto our God, for it is pleasant;
   and praise is comely. The LORD does build up Jerusalem. Oh, that the
   Lord would do so here tonight!

   2. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel. We need that blessing,
   too. Oh, that some outcasts might be gathered together! It shall make
   our hearts cry, "Hallelujah," indeed, if there is a building up of the
   Church and an ingathering of the outcasts.

   3. He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. As we read
   that, we may well say again, "Hallelujah,"

   4. He counts the number of the stars: He calls them all by their names.
   And the Hallelujah is not louder because of that fact than it is for
   the other Truth! What a condescending God--"He heals the broken in
   heart." How infinite is His mind--"He counts the number of the stars."

   5. 6. Great is our Lord and of great power: His understanding is
   infinite. The LORD lifts up the meek. How wonderful it is that the Lord
   should use the greatness of His power and the infinity of His
   understanding for the lifting up of those whom men often despise--"the
   meek"!

   6-11. He casts the wicked down to the ground. Sing unto the LORD with
   thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: who covers the
   Heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to
   grow upon the mountains. He gives to the beast his food, and to the
   young ravens which cry. He delights not in the strength of the horse:
   He takes not pleasure in the legs of a man. The LORD takes pleasure in
   them that fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy. Other kings tell
   of their cavalry and infantry, they boast of their regiments of horses
   and foot soldiers, but our great God finds His delight in

   them that fear Him and even in the feebler sort of these--"those that
   hope in His mercy." These are the courtiers of Jehovah. These are the
   forces of our God, through whom He will win great victories!

   12-15. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion. For He
   has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children
   within you. He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the
   finest of the wheat. He sends forth His commandment upon earth: His
   Word runs very swiftly. Our King's warrant runs everywhere, all over
   the world. He has universal power in Nature, in Providence and in
   Grace--"His Word runs very swiftly."

   16. He gives snow like wool: He scatters the hoarfrost like ashes. The
   Hebrews saw God in all the phenomena of Nature--let us do the same. Let
   us attribute every snowflake to the Divine hand and every breath of
   frost to the Divine mouth.

   17. 18. He casts forth His ice like morsels: who can stand before His
   cold? He sends out His Word, and melts them. It is just as easy for Him
   to send warm weather as to give us the chill of winter.

   18. He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow. His own soft south
   wind comes and the fetters of frost dissolve, and the waters flow. It
   is the Lord that does it all! He is not far from any of us. Therefore
   let us not forget Him.

   19. He shows His Word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto
   Israel. The rest of the world can only see Him in Nature, but His own
   people see Him in Revelation, in the movements of His Holy Spirit.

   20. He has not dealt so with any nation: and as for His judgments, they
   have not known them. Praise you the Lord. Therefore, you who are
   favored with His special manifestations of love, take up the joyous
   song even if others do not. Hallelujah, "Praise you the Lord." Now let
   us read in the Gospel according to Matthew, chapter twenty-six,
   beginning at the sixth verse.

   Matthew 26:6, 7. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon
   the leper, there came unto Him a woman having an alabaster box of very
   precious ointment, and poured it on His head, as He sat at meat. This
   is not the woman who anointed Christ's feet with ointment, but another
   of the holy women who ministered to Him. I believe this was Mary, the
   sister of Lazarus, who came to Jesus, "having an alabaster box of very
   precious ointment, and poured it on His head, as He sat at meat."

   8, 9. But when His disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To
   what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for
   much, and given to the poor. When you do the best you can from the
   purest motives, and your Lord accepts your service, do not expect that
   your Brothers will approve all your actions. If you do, you will be
   greatly disappointed. There was never a more beautiful proof of love to
   Christ than this anointing at Bethany, yet the disciples found fault
   with it. As they could not object to the action, itself, they objected
   that there might have been another thing done that would have been
   better. There is a great deal of that kind of wisdom in the world which
   can always teach you how you might have done something better! but if
   you wait until you learn that wisdom, you will never do anything for
   your Lord! If this devoted and enthusiastic woman had waited for the
   advice of these prudent people, she would neither have sold the
   ointment, nor poured it out. She did well to take council with her own
   loving heart and then to pour the precious oil upon that dear head
   which was so soon to be crowned with thorns! She thus showed that there
   was at least one heart in the world that thought nothing was too good
   for her Lord, and that the best of the best ought to be given to Him!
   May she have many imitators in every age until Jesus comes again!

   10. When Jesus understood it, He said unto them, Why trouble you the
   woman? She had been very happy in the act. Probably it was the happiest
   hour in all her life when she gave this costly gift to the Lord she
   loved so well! But a cloud passed over her bright face as the whispered
   complaints reached her ears. She was evidently a tender-hearted soul,
   so the Savior said to the disciples, "Why trouble you the woman?"

   10. For she has worked a good work upon Me. We cannot do what this
   woman did, but we can perform good works upon others for Christ's
   sake--and He will accept them as though they were done unto Himself.

   11-13. For you have the poor always with you; but Me you have not
   always. For in that she has poured this ointment on My body, she did it
   for My burial. Verily I say unto you, Wherever this Gospel shall be
   preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has
   done, be told for a memorial of her. She probably did not know all that
   her action meant when she anointed her Lord for His burial. We often do
   much more than we think we do. The consequences of the simplest action
   done for Christ may be much greater than we suppose. This woman is
   preparing Christ's body for His approaching burial. Little did she
   dream that it was so, but so it was. Go, my Sister, and do what God
   bids you, and it shall be seen that you

   have done far more than you knew! Obey the holy impulse within your
   spirit, my Brother, and you may do ten thousand times more than you
   have ever imagined to be possible! This woman's outburst of affection,
   this simple-hearted act of love to Christ, Himself, is one of those
   things which are to live as long as the Gospel lives. The aroma of this
   loving deed is to abide as long as the world, itself, endures!

   14, 15. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
   chief priests, and said unto them, What will you give me, and I will
   deliver Him unto you? Out of 12 Apostles, one was a Judas Iscariot.
   Marvel not, therefore, if, among your friends and kinsfolk, you have
   one who turns against you and betrays you to your enemies!

   15. And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. The price
   of a slave, thus they were fulfilling the ancient prophecy--"So they
   weighed for My price, thirty pieces of silver."

   16. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him. The traitor
   sold his Master for 30 pieces of dirty silver-- yet many have sold
   Jesus for a less price than Judas received--a smile or a sneer has been
   sufficient to induce them to betray their Lord!

   17, 18. Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
   disciples came to Jesus, saying unto Him, Where will You that we
   prepare for You to eat the Passover? And He said, Go into the city to
   such a man, and say unto him, The Master says, My time is at hand; I
   will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples. How truly royal
   was Jesus of Nazareth even in His humility! He had only to send two of
   His disciples "into the city to such a man," and the guest chamber,
   furnished and prepared, was at once placed at His disposal! He did not
   take the room by arbitrary force, as an earthly monarch might have
   done, but He obtained it by the more Divine compulsion of Almighty
   Love! Jesus knew something about this man that you and I do not know,
   so He said to His disciples, Just go and say to him, 'The Master says,
   My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My
   disciples.'"

   Was he not, himself, a disciple? I cannot say, but this I do know, that
   the Lord Jesus has a certain number who are willing to help His cause
   even though, as yet, they hardly call themselves His disciples. I
   should think, however, that after this man had once had the Master and
   His disciples in his house, there must have been a blessing left
   behind, and he would want to become one of that goodly company! It is
   well, dear Friend, that you are willing to have the Prayer Meeting in
   your house. It is well that you will stand up on the side of the Truth
   of God, even if you have no share in it as yet, for maybe--and I hope
   the, "maybe," will become a certainty--you will yet be one of Christ's
   disciples.

   19. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
   ready the Passover. They went to this man, delivered Christ's message,
   and he showed them a large upper room, furnished and prepared. If
   Christ's disciples always loyally did as Jesus appointed them, they
   would always speed well on His errands. There are many more people in
   the world ready to yield to Christ than some of us think. The person
   sitting or standing by your side is quite unknown to you, but, if you
   will speak to him about the Savior, he will probably respond to your
   words. At any rate, try him, and see if it is not so. Whether standing
   or sitting, there must be someone here not yet a disciple who only
   needs for you to speak a kind word, and the deciding work will be done!

   20, 21. Now when the even was come, He sat down with the twelve. And as
   they did eat, He said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall
   betray Me. "One of you"--and His eyes would glance round the table as
   He said it--"one of you shall betray Me."

   22. And they were exceedingly sorrowful and began, every one of them,
   to say unto Him. Lord, is it I? No one said, "Lord, is it Judas?"
   Perhaps no one of the 11 thought that Judas was base enough to betray
   the Lord who had given Him an honorable place among His Apostles. It is
   certainly a mark of Grace that "every one" of the Apostles put to their
   Lord the question, "Is it I?"

   23, 24. And He answered and said, he that dips his hand with Me in the
   dish, the same shall betray Me. The Son of Man goes as it is written of
   Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had
   been good for that man if he had not been born. We learn from our
   Lord's words that Divine decrees do not deprive a sinful action of its
   guilt--"The Son of Man goes as it is written of Him: but woe unto that
   man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! "The criminality of Judas was
   just as great as though there had been no "determinate counsel and
   foreknowledge of God" even as it was with those to whom Peter spoke so
   boldly on the day of Pentecost, when he charged them with the murder of
   Jesus!

   25. Then Judas, which betrayed Him, answered and said, Master, is it I?
   He said unto him, You have said. What a chill that answer must have
   cast over the little band around the table, especially when Judas rose
   and started off, to carry out his dreadful purpose of staining his soul
   with the blood of his Lord!

   26-29. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
   broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is My
   body. And He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
   saying, Drink you all of it; for this is My blood of the new testament,
   which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I
   will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when
   I drink it new with you in My Father's Kingdom. Thus Jesus took the
   great Nazarite vow never to drink of the fruit of the vine till He
   should drink it new with His disciples in His Father's Kingdom. O Lord,
   You have pledged us in this cup, and You will return before long, and
   then what festivals we will hold with You! What joy we shall have in
   You forever and ever!

   30. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out unto the Mount of
   Olives. Was it not truly brave of our dear Lord to sing under such
   circumstances? He was going forth to His last dread conflict, to
   Gethsemane, Gabbatha and Golgotha--yet He went with a song on His lips!
   The door opens, they go downstairs, they are in the open air--that
   night of the full moon--and they wend their way to the Mount of Olives.
   Then came that desperate struggle in which the great Captain of our
   salvation wrestled even to a bloody sweat and prevailed!

Prayer, The Cure for Care

   (No. 2351)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 11, 1984.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   12, 1888.

   "Be careful for nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication,
   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made kno wn unto God. And the
   peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus." Philippians 4:6, 7.

   We have the faculty of forethought, but, like all our faculties, it has
   been perverted, and it is often abused. It is good for a man to have a
   holy care and to pay due attention to every item of his life, but,
   alas, it is very easy to make it into an unholy care and to try to
   wrest from the hand of God that office of Providence which belongs to
   Him and not to ourselves. How often Luther liked to talk about the
   birds and the way God cares for them! When he was full of his
   anxieties, he used to constantly envy the birds because they led so
   free and happy a life. He talks of Dr. Sparrow, Dr. Thrush and others
   that used to come and talk to Dr. Luther and tell him many a good
   thing! You know, Brothers and Sisters, the birds out in the open,
   yonder, cared for by God, fare far better than those that are cared for
   by man. A little London girl, who had gone into the country, once said,
   "Look, mamma, at that poor little bird. It has not got any cage!" That
   would not have struck me as being any loss to the bird--and if you and
   I were without our cage, and the box of seed, and glass of water, it
   would not be much of a loss if we were cast adrift into the glorious
   liberty of a life of humble dependence upon God!

   It is that cage of carnal trust and that box of seed that we are always
   laboring to fill, that makes the worry of this mortal life. But he who
   has Grace to spread his wings and soar away--and get into the open
   field of Divine trustfulness--may sing all the day and always have this
   for his tune--

   "Mortal, cease from toil and sorrow; God provides for the morrow."

   Here, then, is the teaching of the text--"Be careful for nothing." The
   word, "careful," does not now mean exactly what it did when the Bible
   was translated. At least it conveys a different meaning to me from what
   it did to the translators. I would say that we should be careful. "Be
   careful," is a good lesson for boys and young people when they are
   starting in life, but, in the sense in which the word, "care-full," was
   understood at the time of the translators, we must not be careful, that
   is, full of care. The text means, be not anxious--be not constantly
   thinking about the needs of this mortal life. I will read it again,
   stretching the word out a little, and then you will get the meaning of
   it--"Be care-full for nothing." Oh, that God might teach us how to
   avoid the evil which is here forbidden, and to live with that holy
   carelessness which is the very beauty of the Christian life--when all
   our care is cast on God, and we can joy and rejoice in His Providential
   care of us!

   "Ah," somebody says, "I cannot help caring." Well, the subject,
   tonight, is to help you to leave off caring or worrying and, first,
   consider, here, the substitute for care. Be careful for nothing, but be
   prayerful for everything--that is the substitute for care, "prayer and
   supplication." Secondly, note the special character of this prayer
   which is to become the substitute for anxiety--"In everything, by
   prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made
   known unto God." And then I hope we shall have a few minutes left in
   which to consider the sweet effect of this prayer--"The peace of God,
   which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds
   through Christ Jesus."

   I. To begin, then, here is, first, THE SUBSTITUTE FOR CARE OR ANXIETY.

   I suppose it is true of many of us that our cares are numerous. If you
   once become careful, anxious, fretful, you will never be able to count
   your cares, even though you might count the hairs of your head. And
   cares are apt to multiply to

   those who are care-full and when you are as full of care as you think
   you can be, you will be sure to have another crop of cares growing up
   all around you. The indulgence of this evil habit of anxiety leads to
   its getting dominion over life, till life is not worth living by reason
   of the care we have about it. Cares are numerous and, therefore, let
   your prayers be as numerous. Turn everything that is a care into a
   prayer. Let your cares be the raw material of your prayers and, as the
   alchemists hoped to turn dross into gold, so you, by a holy alchemy,
   actually turn what naturally would have been a care into spiritual
   treasure in the form of prayer! Baptize every anxiety into the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit--and so make it into
   a blessing!

   Have you a care to get? Take heed that it does not get you! Do you wish
   to make gain? Mind you do not lose more than you gain by your gains. I
   beseech you, have no more care to gain than you dare turn into a
   prayer! Do not desire to have what you dare not ask God to give you.
   Measure your desires by a spiritual standard and you will thus be kept
   from anything like covetousness. Cares come to many from their
   losses--they lose what they have gained. Well, this is a world in which
   there is the tendency to lose. Ebbs follow floods and winters crush out
   summer flowers. Do not wonder if you lose as other people do, but pray
   about your losses. Go to God with them--and instead of fretting, make
   them an occasion for waiting upon the Lord and saying--"The Lord gave,
   and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. Show me
   why You contend with me, and deliver Your servant, I pray You, from
   ever complaining of You, whatever You permit me to lose!"

   Perhaps you say that your care is neither about your gaining nor your
   losing, but about your daily bread. Ah, well, you have promises for
   that, you know! The Lord has said, "So shall you dwell in the land, and
   verily you shall be fed." He gives you sweet encouragement when He says
   that He clothes the grass of the field--and shall He not much more
   clothe you, O you of little faith? And the Lord Jesus bids you consider
   the fowls of Heaven, how they sow not, neither do they gather into
   barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Go, then, to your God
   with all your cares! If you have a large family, a slender income and
   much ado to make ends meet, and to provide things honest in the sight
   of all men, you have so many excuses for knocking at God's door--so
   many more reasons for being often found at the Throne of Grace! I
   beseech you, turn them to good account. I feel free to call upon a
   friend when I really have some business to do with him--and you may be
   bold to call upon God when necessities press upon you. Instead of
   caring for anything with anxious care, turn it at once into a reason
   for renewed prayerfulness.

   "Ah," one says, "but I am in perplexity. I do not know what to do."
   Well, then, dear Friend, you should certainly pray when you cannot tell
   whether it is the right hand road, or the left hand, or straight on, or
   whether you should go back! Indeed, when you are in such a fog that you
   cannot see the next lamp, then is the time that you must pray. The road
   will clear before you very suddenly. I have often had to try this plan,
   myself--and I bear witness that when I have trusted to myself, I have
   been a gigantic fool! But when I have trusted in God, then He has led
   me straight on in the right way, and there has been no mistake about
   it! I believe that God's children often make greater blunders over
   simple things than they do over more difficult matters. You know how it
   was with Israel, when those Gibeonites came, with their old shoes and
   clothes, and showed the bread that was moldy, that they said they took
   fresh out of their ovens. The children of Israel thought, "This is a
   clear case. These men are strangers, they have come from a far country,
   so we may make a league with them." They were certain that the evidence
   of their eyes proved that these were no Canaanites, so they did not
   consult God! The whole matter seemed so plain that they made a league
   with the Gibeonites, which was a trouble to them ever afterwards! If we
   would, in everything, go to God in prayer, our perplexities would lead
   us into no more mistakes than our simplicities--and in simple things
   and difficult things we should be guided by the Most High.

   Perhaps another friend says, "But I am thinking about the future." Are
   you? Well, first, I beg to ask you what you have to do with the future?
   Do you know what a day will bring forth? You have been thinking about
   what will become of you when you are old, but are you sure that you
   will ever be old? I knew one Christian woman who used to worry herself
   about how she would get buried. That question never troubled me and
   there are many other matters about which we need not worry ourselves.
   You can always find a stick with which to beat a dog and, if you need a
   care, you can generally find a care with which to beat your own souls!
   But that is a poor occupation for any of you. Instead of doing that,
   turn everything that might be a subject of care into a subject of
   prayer. It will not be long before you have a subject of care, so you
   will not be long without a subject of prayer. Strike out that word,
   "care," and just write in the place of it this word, "prayer"--and
   then, though your cares are numerous, your prayers will also be
   numerous.

   Note, next, dear Friends, that undue care is an intrusion into God's
   province. It is making yourself the father of the household instead of
   being a child--it is making yourself the master instead of being a
   servant for whom the master provides his rations. Now, if, instead of
   doing that, you will turn care into prayer, there will be no intrusion,
   for you may come to God in prayer without being charged with
   presumption. He invites you to pray. No, here, by His servant, He bids
   you, "in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let
   your requests be made known unto God." Once more, cares are of no use
   to us, and they cause us great damage. If you were to worry as long as
   you wished, you could not make yourself an inch taller, or grow another
   hair on your head, or make one hair white or black! So the Savior tells
   us and He asks, if care fails in such little things, what can care do
   in the higher matters of Providence? It cannot do anything! A farmer
   stood in his fields and said, "I do not know what will happen to us
   all. The wheat will be destroyed if this rain keeps on. We shall not
   have any harvest at all unless we have some fine weather." He walked up
   and down, wringing his hands, fretting and making his whole household
   uncomfortable. And he did not produce one single gleam of sunlight by
   all his worrying--he could not puff any of the clouds away with all his
   petulant speech, nor could he stop a drop of rain with all his
   murmurings.

   What is the good of it, then, to keep gnawing at your own heart, when
   you can get nothing by it? Besides, it weakens our power to help
   ourselves and especially our power to glorify God. A care-full heart
   hinders us from judging rightly in many things. I have often used the
   illustration (I do not know a better) of taking a telescope, breathing
   on it with the hot breath of our anxiety, putting it to our eye and
   then saying that we cannot see anything but clouds! Of course we
   cannot, and we never shall while we breathe upon it. If we were but
   calm, quiet, self-possessed and God-possessed, we would do the right
   thing. We would be, as we say, "all there," in the time of difficulty.
   That man may expect to have presence of mind who has the Presence of
   God. If we forget to pray, do you wonder that we are all in a fidget
   and a worry, and we do the first thing that occurs to us--which is
   generally the worst thing--instead of waiting till we saw what would be
   done and then trustfully and believingly doing it as in the sight of
   God? Care, or worry, is injurious, but if you only turn this care into
   prayer, then every worry will be a benefit to you.

   Prayer is wonderful material for building up the spiritual fabric. We
   are, ourselves, edified by prayer. We grow in Grace by prayer and if we
   will but come to God every moment with petitions, we shall be fast
   growing Christians! I said to one this morning, "Pray for me, it is a
   time of need," and she replied, "I have done nothing else since I
   awakened." I have made the same request of several others and they have
   said that they have been praying for me. I felt so glad, not only for
   my own sake, who had received benefit from their prayers, but for their
   sakes, because they are sure to grow thereby! When little birds keep
   flapping their wings, they are learning to fly. The sinews will get
   stronger and the birds will leave the nest before long. That very
   clapping of their wings is an education--and the attempting to
   pray--the groaning, the sighing, the crying of a prayerful spirit, is,
   itself, a blessing! Leave off, then, this damaging habit of worry and
   take to this enriching habit of prayer! See how you will thus make a
   double gain--first, by avoiding a loss, and secondly, by getting that
   which will really benefit you and others, too!

   Then, again, cares are the effect of forgetfulness of Christ's
   closeness to us. Did you notice how the context runs? "The Lord is at
   hand. Be careful for nothing." The Lord Jesus Christ has promised to
   come again and He may come tonight. At any moment He may appear! So
   Paul writes, "The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing; but in
   everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your
   requests be made known unto God." Oh, if we could but stand on this
   earth as upon a mere shadow! If we could but live as those who will
   soon have done with this poor transient life! If we held every earthly
   thing with a very loose hand, then we would not be caring, and
   worrying, and fretting--but we would take to praying, for thus we would
   grasp the real, and the substantial, and plant our feet upon the
   invisible, which is, after all, the eternal! Oh, dear Friends, let the
   text, which I have read to you over and over again, now drop into your
   hearts as a pebble falls into a mountain lake and, as it enters, let it
   make rings of comfort upon the very surface of your soul!

   II. Now we need to look into the text a little more closely to see, in
   the second place, THE SPECIAL CHARACTER OF THIS PRAYER. What sort of
   prayer is that which will ease us of care?

   Well, first, it is a prayer which deals with everything. "In
   everything" "let your requests be made known unto God." You may pray
   about the smallest thing and about the greatest thing--you may not only
   pray for the Holy Spirit, but you may pray for a new pair of boots. You
   may go to God about the bread you eat, the water you drink, the garment
   you wear and pray to Him about everything. Draw no line and say, "So
   far is to be under the care of God." Dear me, then, what are you going
   to do with the rest of life? Is that to be lived under the withering
   blight of a sort of atheism? God forbid! Oh, that we might live in God
   as to the whole of our being, for our being is such that we cannot
   divide it! Our body, soul and spirit are one, and while God leaves us
   in this world and we have necessities which arise out of the condition
   of our bodies,

   we must bring our bodily necessities before God in prayer. And you will
   find that the great God will hear you in these matters. Say not that
   they are too little for Him to notice--everything is little in
   comparison with Him! When I think of what a great God He is, it seems
   to me that this poor little world of ours is just one insignificant
   grain of sand on the seashore of the universe--and not worth any notice
   at all. The whole earth is a mere speck in the great world of Nature
   and, if God condescends to consider it, He may as well stoop a little
   lower and consider us! And He does so, for He says, "Even the very
   hairs of your head are all numbered." Therefore, in everything let your
   requests be made known unto God.

   The kind of prayer that saves us from care is prayer that is
   repeated--"In everything, by prayer and supplication." Pray to God and
   then pray again--"by prayer and supplication." If the Lord does not
   answer you the first time, be very grateful that you have a good reason
   for praying again! If He does not grant your request the second time,
   believe that He loves you so much that He wants to hear your voice
   again! And if He keeps you waiting till you have gone to Him seven
   times, say to yourself, "Now I know that I worship the God of Elijah,
   for Elijah's God let him go, again, seven times before the blessing was
   given." Count it an honor to be permitted to wrestle with the Angel of
   God! This is the way God makes His princes! Jacob had never been Israel
   if he had obtained the blessing from the Angel at the first asking--but
   when he had to keep on wrestling till he prevailed, then he became a
   prince with God! The prayer that kills care is prayer that is continued
   and importunate.

   Next, it is intelligent prayer--"Let your requests be made known unto
   God." I heard of a Muslim who spent, I think, six hours in prayer each
   day and, lest he should go to sleep when on board a ship, he stood
   upright and only had a rope stretched across, so that he might lean
   against it. And if he slept, he would fall. His objective was to keep
   on for six hours with what he called prayer. "Well," I said to one who
   knew him, and who had seen him on board his boat on the Nile, "What
   sort of prayer was it?" "Why," my friend replied, "he kept on
   repeating, 'There is no God but God, and Mohammed is the prophet of
   God,' the same thing over, and over, and over again." I said, "Did he
   ask for anything?" "Oh, no!" "Was he pleading with God to give him
   anything?" "No, he simply kept on with that perpetual repetition of
   certain words, just as a witch might repeat a charm."

   Do you think there is anything in that style of praying? If you go on
   your knees and simply repeat a certain formula, it will be only a
   mouthful of words. What does God care about that kind of praying? "Let
   your requests be made known unto God." That is true prayer! God knows
   what your requests are, but you are to pray to Him as if He did not
   know. You are to make known your requests, not because the Lord does
   not know, but, perhaps, because you do not know. And when you have made
   your requests known to Him, as the text tells you, you will more
   clearly have made them known to yourself. When you have asked
   intelligently, knowing what you have asked, and knowing why you have
   asked it, you will, perhaps, stop and say to yourself, "No, I must not,
   after all, make that request." Sometimes, when you have gone on praying
   for what God does not give you, it may be that there will steal over
   your mind the conviction that you are not on the right track and that
   result of your prayer will, in itself, do you good, and be a blessing
   to you.

   But you are to pray making your requests known unto God. That is, in
   plain English, say what you need, for this is true prayer. Get alone
   and tell the Lord what you need--pour out your heart before Him. Do not
   imagine that God needs any fine language! No, you need not run upstairs
   for your prayer book, and turn to a collect--you will be a long time
   before you find any collect that will fit you if you are really
   praying! Pray for what you need just as if you were telling your mother
   or your dearest friend what your need is. Go to God in that fashion,
   for that is real prayer, and that is the kind of prayer that will drive
   away your cares.

   So, dear Friends, again, the kind of prayer that brings freedom from
   care is communion with God. If you have not spoken to God, you have not
   really prayed. A little child has been known (I daresay your children
   have done it) to go and put a letter down the grating of a drain and,
   of course, there was never any reply to a letter posted in that way. If
   the letter is not put into the postbox, so that it goes to the person
   to whom it is addressed, what is the use of it? So, prayer is real
   communication with God. You must realize that He is and that He is the
   Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him, or else you cannot pray. He
   must be a reality to you, a living reality, and you must believe that
   He hears prayer, and then you must speak with Him and believe that you
   have the petition that you ask of Him--and so you shall have it. He has
   never yet failed to honor believing prayer. He may keep you waiting for
   a while, but delays are not denials, and He has often answered a prayer
   that asked for silver by giving gold! He may have denied earthly
   treasure, but He has given heavenly riches of ten thousand times the
   worth--and the suppliant has been more than satisfied with the
   exchange! "Let your requests be made known unto God."

   I know what you do when you are in trouble--you go to your neighbor,
   but your neighbor does not want to see you quite so often about such
   business. Possibly you go to your brother, but there is a text that
   warns you not to go into your brother's house in the day of your
   calamity. You may call on a friend too often when you are hard up--he
   may be very pleased to see you till he hears what you are after! But if
   you go to your God, He will never give you the cold shoulder. He will
   never say that you come too often. On the contrary, He will even chide
   you because you do not come to Him often enough!

   There is one word which I passed over, just now, because I wanted to
   leave it for my last observation on this point-- "By prayer and
   supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto
   God." Now what does that mean? It means that the kind of prayer that
   kills care is a prayer that asks cheerfully, joyfully, thankfully.
   "Lord, I am poor. Let me bless You for my poverty and then, O Lord,
   will You not supply all my needs?" That is the way to pray. "Lord, I am
   ill. I bless You for this affliction, for I am sure that it means some
   good thing to me. Now be pleased to heal me, I beseech You!" "Lord, I
   am in a great trouble, but I praise You for the trouble, for I know
   that it contains a blessing though the envelope is black-edged! Lord,
   help me through my trouble!" That is the kind of prayer that kills
   care--"supplication, with thanksgiving." Mix these two things well! One
   drachma--no, two drachma of prayer--prayer and supplication, then one
   drachma of thanksgiving! Rub them together and they will make a blessed
   cure for care. May the Lord teach us to practice this holy art of the
   apothecary!

   III. I finish with this third point, THE SWEET EFFECT OF THIS
   PRAYER--"And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall
   keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."

   If you can pray in this fashion, instead of indulging evil anxiety, the
   result will be that an unusual peace will steal over your heart and
   mind. Unusual, for it will be "the peace of God." What is God's peace?
   The unruffled serenity of the infinitely happy God, the eternal
   composure of the absolutely well-contented God! This shall possess your
   heart and mind. Notice how Paul describes it--"The peace of God, which
   passes all understanding." Other people will not understand it. They
   will not be able to make out how you can be so quiet. What is more, you
   will not be able to tell them, for if it surpasses all understanding,
   it certainly passes all expression! And what is even more amazing--you
   will not understand it yourself!

   It will be such a peace that it will be to you, unfathomable and
   immeasurable. When one of the martyrs was about to burn for Christ, he
   said to the judge who was giving orders to light the pile, "Will you
   come and lay your hand on my heart? "The judge did so. "Does it beat
   fast?" enquired the martyr. "Do I show any sign of fear?" "No," said
   the judge. "Now lay your hand on your own heart and see whether you are
   not more excited than I am." Think of that man of God, who, on the
   morning he was to be burned, was so soundly asleep that they had to
   shake him to wake him--he had to get up to be burned! And yet knowing
   that it was to be so, he had such confidence in God that he slept
   sweetly. This is "the peace of God, which passes all understanding." In
   those old Diocletian persecutions, when the martyrs came into the
   amphitheatre to be torn by wild beasts--when one was set in a red-hot
   iron chair, another was smeared with honey to be stung to death by
   wasps and bees--they never flinched!

   Think of that brave man who was put on a gridiron to be roasted to
   death, who said to his persecutors, "You have done me on one side. Now
   turn me over to the other." Why this peace under such circumstances? It
   was "the peace of God, which passes all understanding." We do not have
   to suffer like that, nowadays, but if it ever comes to anything like
   that, it is wonderful what peace a Christian enjoys! After there had
   been a great storm, the Master stood up in the prow of the vessel and
   said to the winds, "Be still." And we read, "there was a great calm."
   Have you ever felt this? You feel it tonight if you have learned this
   sacred art of making your requests known unto God in everything and the
   peace of God which passes all understanding is keeping your hearts and
   minds through Christ Jesus.

   This blessed peace keeps our hearts and minds--it is a guardian peace.
   The Greek word implies a garrison. Is it not an odd thing that a
   military term is used here and that it is peace that acts as a guard to
   the heart and to the mind? It is the peace of God that is to protect
   the child of God--strange but beautiful figure! I have heard that fear
   is the housekeeper for a Christian. Well, fear may be a good guardian
   to keep dogs out, but it has not a full cupboard! But peace, though it
   seems weakness, is the essence of strength and, while it guards, it
   also feeds us and supplies all our needs.

   It is also a peace which links us to Jesus--"The peace of God which
   passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds." That is,
   your affections and your thoughts, your desires and your
   intellect--your heart--so that it shall not fear.

   Your mind, so that it shall not know any kind of perplexity--"the peace
   of God shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." It is
   all, "through Christ Jesus" and, therefore, it is doubly sweet and
   precious to us!

   O my dear Hearers, some of you come in here on Thursday nights and you
   do not know anything about this peace of God and, perhaps, you wonder
   why we Christian people make such a fuss about our religion! Ah, if you
   knew, you would, perhaps, make more fuss about it than we do, for if
   there were no hereafter--and we know that there is--yet the blessed
   habit of going to God in prayer and casting all our care upon Him helps
   us to live most joyfully, even in this life! We do not believe in
   secularism, but if we did, there would be no preparation for the
   earthly life like this living unto God and living in God! If you have a
   sham god and you merely go to Church or Chapel and carry your prayer
   book or your hymn book with you and, therefore, think you are
   Christians, you are deceiving yourselves! But if you have a living God
   and you have real fellowship with Him and constantly, as a habit, live
   beneath the shadow of the wings of the Almighty, then you shall enjoy a
   peace that shall make others wonder and make you, yourself, marvel,
   too, even, "the peace of God, which passes all understanding." God
   grant it to you, my beloved Hearers, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Philippians 4

   Verse 1. Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
   and crown, do stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. You know that
   the Church at Philippi was very dear to the Apostle's heart. He could
   never forget the time when he and Silas prayed with the women at the
   riverside and afterwards prayed and sang praises unto God in the
   prison, when the prisoners heard them. Lydia and her household and the
   Philippian jailor were among the first fruits of Paul's work at
   Philippi and there was always a very intimate love between him and the
   members of the Church in that place. They cared for him and he cared
   for them. Twice in this one verse he speaks of them as his, "dearly
   beloved." He says that he "longed for them, longed to come and see them
   face to face, longed that they might be happy in the Lord to the very
   highest degree. So he says, "my brethren, dearly beloved and longed
   for, my joy." It was such a joy to him, even, to think of them as his
   spiritual children and especially to see after what a godly and
   generous fashion they behaved themselves. Yes, and he calls them his,
   "crown"--a garland which he had won in spiritual wrestling! The
   Christian's converts are his joy, here, and they will be his crown
   forever in Heaven. Paul bade these Philippians, "stand fast in the
   Lord." It looks like a very simple thing to stand fast, but they who
   try to do it know how difficult a task it is.

   2. I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
   mind in the Lord. Only two women who had fallen out with one another,
   but the Apostle is so anxious for perfect unity that he puts in a,
   "beseech," for each of them. He does not say which was right and which
   was wrong, but he would have them, "of the same mind in the Lord."
   Little differences, even between obscure members of the Church, may
   hinder the work of the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is like a dove--
   and doves love quiet places--they do not come where there is noise and
   strife. Oh, let us cultivate love towards one another! And if in
   anything we have disagreed at any time, let us think that we hear Paul
   saying, tonight, "I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, that they
   be of the same mind in the Lord." Make up, my Sisters! Make up, my
   Brothers! Whatever the quarrel is, end it and, "be of the same mind in
   the Lord." Bought with the same precious blood, robed in the same
   perfect righteousness, on the way to the same Heaven, "be of the same
   mind in the Lord."

   3. And I entreat you also, true yokefellow, help those women which
   labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement, also, and with other of my
   fellow laborers, whose names are in the Book of Life. We do not know
   who this "true yokefellow" was. Very likely it was Epaphroditus who
   carried this Epistle to Philippi. Whoever it was, it was someone who
   had worked with Paul shoulder to shoulder. If two bullocks bear the
   same yoke and yet do not agree, they make it very uncomfortable for one
   another. If one tries to lie down and the other wants to stand up, or
   if one goes faster than the other, the yoke becomes doubly galling.
   Paul speaks of somebody here as having been his "true yokefellow"--and
   he says to him, "Help those women which labored with me in the Gospel."

   What an eminent place women have always held in the service of the Lord
   Jesus Christ and here Paul speaks of them as laboring with him in the
   Gospel! Surely Lydia must have been one of those. "With Clement, also,
   and with other of my fellow laborers, whose names are in the Book of
   Life." According to some learned commentators, a man's name may be in
   the Book of Life for a time, but it may be removed. If their teaching
   is true, that book will be very much scratched and blotted. I thank God
   that I do not believe in any such book as that! If the Lord Jesus
   Christ has written my name in the Book of Life, in the great family
   register of the redeemed, I defy all the devils of Hell to ever get it
   erased!

   4. Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. If you ever
   rejoice in the Lord, you may always rejoice in the Lord, for He is
   always the same, and always gracious! There is as much reason for
   rejoicing in God at one time as at another, since He never changes.

   5. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The word, "moderation,"
   in the Greek, is a very difficult word to translate into English. It
   does not mean moderation in the sense in which some people use the
   word, for they make it, as I think, almost an accursed one. "Let your
   moderation"--your gentleness, your willingness, your forbearance--"be
   known unto all men." That is what it means. Do not push your own rights
   too far--stop short of what you might fairly demand and when you feel,
   at any time, a little vehement in temper, check yourself--hold yourself
   in, bear and forbear. Go not as far as you may, nor even as far as some
   think that you ought, in defending your own rights. Let your
   gentleness, your yielding-ness, be known unto all men.

   5. The Lord is at hand. Christ is coming--why do you put yourself out?
   The Lord is near you to help you--why are you so excessively anxious?
   Why are you so carried away with the present temporary trial? "The Lord
   is at hand."

   6. Be careful for nothing. Be anxiously careful for nothing! Sing, with
   Faber--

   "I have no cares, O blessed Lord, For all my cares are Yours."

   6-8. But in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
   let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which
   passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
   Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever
   things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure,
   whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if
   there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think on these things.
   Everything of this kind concerns you, therefore help it as far as you
   can. Be on the side of every cause that may be thus described. If it
   vindicates truth, uprightness, reverence, religion, chastity,
   holiness--be on that side. If there is anything the reverse of this, do
   not have anything to do with it, but if there is any movement in the
   world that will help forward things that are true, honest, just, pure,
   lovely and of good report, "think on these things," and so think upon
   them as to increase their influence among the sons and daughters of
   men!

   9. Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard,
   and seen in me, do. It is well when a preacher can speak like
   that--when he has not to say, "Do as I say and not as I do," but when,
   like the Apostle, he can say--"those things, which you have both
   learned, received, heard and seen in me, do."

   9. And the God of Peace shall be with you. The God of Peace is always
   with those who receive His dear Son and who help His Gospel. It is one
   of the privileges of true Believers that the God of Peace shall be
   constantly with them.

   10. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now, at the last, your
   care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you
   lacked opportunity. Paul was in prison at Rome and these Philippians
   had made a contribution. And they had sent Epaphroditus with it to
   relieve the Apostle in his poverty, so he said to them, "You cared for
   me before; but for a time you had not the opportunity of helping me,
   and now you have thought of me, again, therefore I rejoice in the Lord
   greatly."

   11. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
   whatever state I am, therewith to be content. Is not that a splendid
   piece of learning? Paul was a learned man and so are you, if you have
   learned this lesson! You may not be able to put D.D., or LL.D., after
   your name, but you are a learned man if you can say, "I have learned,
   in whatever state I am, therewith to be content."

   12. I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. These are
   two grand things to learn. There are some who know the first, but who
   do not know the second. I have known several of God's children who
   seemed quite eminent for piety when they were abased, but they were
   never worth anything after they grew rich. They did not know how to
   abound-- they became top-heavy and far too great for their britches! It
   was not so with the Apostle, for he could truthfully say, "I know both
   how to be abased and I know how to abound."

   12. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
   be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. Was he not a true Master
   of Arts? He had mastered the art of being hungry without murmuring, the
   art of being full without boasting, the art of suffering need without
   impatience, the art of abounding without setting his affection on
   worldly things. He was, indeed, a Master of Arts of the very highest
   order!

   13. I can do all things--That looks like bragging, does it not? Finish
   the sentence.

   14. Through Christ which strengthens me. There is no improper boasting,
   here, for Paul could do all things through Christ's mighty power! It
   has been well said that the angels excel in strength, but the saints
   excel in their weakness. When we are most weak, and Christ strengthens
   us, then are the most excellent virtues produced.

   14-17. Notwithstanding, you have done well, that you did communicate
   with my affliction. Now you Philippians know, also, that in the
   beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church
   communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you, only.
   For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity. Not
   because I desired a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your
   account. Their liberality was set down to their account in God's book.

   18, 19. But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
   Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet
   smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. But my God shall
   supply all your needs according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus.
   It is Paul's God who took care of the Philippians and it is Paul's God
   who will take care of you and me! "My God," says Paul, "shall supply
   all your needs--not as you have supplied mine, out of your poverty, but
   according to His riches in Glory by Christ Jesus"! Do not imagine that
   you will ever exhaust God's riches in Glory, or drain the national
   treasury of all-sufficiency--that cannot be.

   20. Now unto God and our Father be Glory forever and ever. Amen. He
   blesses us, let us bless Him! He supplies all our needs according to
   His riches in Glory--let us extol his Glory forever and ever.

   21. Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. Give him a shake of the hand.
   Say, "How are you, my Brother? I wish you well." These hearty
   salutations ought to be common in every Christian assembly. I always
   deprecate that wonderful respectability that exists in some places of
   worship where nobody knows anybody else. They are too respectable to
   become acquainted with their brethren. If you are in Christ Jesus, get
   to know one another! "Salute every saint in Christ Jesus."

   21, 22. The brethren which are with me greet you. All the saints salute
   you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. I suppose most of
   these were only slaves in the imperial household. There may have been
   one or two, perhaps, of a higher class, but, in all probability, the
   Gospel first reached the slaves in the Roman palace, that pandemonium
   of vice, where lust and cruelty abounded. There were saints even
   there--and God still has some of His jewels lying on dunghills!

   23. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Great Joy In the City

   (No. 2352)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 18, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON. ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 22, 1888.

   "And there was great joy in that city." Acts 8:8.

   "Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them,"
   and the result of his preaching was that "there was great joy in that
   city." He had a very speedy and very remarkable success. He scarcely
   opened his mouth without gaining attention and had not long proclaimed
   his message before people willingly received it and many were converted
   to Christ, so that, "there was great joy in that city."

   What was the explanation of this wonderful blessing? Something had been
   done, years before, to prepare the way for Philip. There had come to
   that region a weary Man who sat on the well at Sychar and spoke to
   Samaria's daughter concerning the Living Water! And she had heard,
   believed and been saved. And she, fallen woman as she had been, had
   gone back to the city to tell the men that she had met the Messiah,
   which is called Christ. In all probability, the work done by our Lord
   at Sychar had affected the whole district, so that, when Philip went to
   the city of Samaria, he found there a people prepared of the Lord.
   Jesus sowed the seed--Philip came and reaped the harvest!

   Learn, therefore, that no good work for God is ever lost. If you have
   labored in a village or town and have seen no great success, someone
   else may see it. If you have prayed especially for the salvation of any
   person and labored to win that one for Christ, and yet have not brought
   that soul to a decision, someone else may do it. We are workers
   together, as well as workers together with God--and what one man
   begins, another may finish! Paul plants. Apollos waters. Someone else
   may come in to gather the increase--and if God gets the Glory, what
   matters it to you what part you have had in it? If your Lord and Master
   was satisfied with sowing the good Seed of the Kingdom, leaving Philip
   to reap the harvest, can you not be satisfied if you are called to do
   work that will not yield an immediate return?

   Often, during my winter's holiday, year after year, I have seen the
   carts coming down towards the breakwater at Men-tone, bringing huge
   masses of stone, weighing many tons, which were thrown into the sea.
   For a long time, I saw no result whatever of this effort. Tremendous
   blocks of stone were cast into the sea and covered by the waters. Yet I
   felt persuaded that something was being done out of sight, though
   nothing was visible to the eyes. After a while, the piles of stone
   began to show above the surface of the water and then we saw that the
   great foundation-work had been done. Now that the structure is nearly
   finished and they begin to square up, and put everything in order, we
   say, "how quickly the work goes on!" Yes, but it really went on just as
   quickly when we could not see anything of it! Those thousands of tons
   of stone were not lost--they all went to make the underwater
   foundation--and whatever is built upon it, afterwards, is not to have
   the credit of usefulness any more than that which lay down deep at the
   bottom of the sea.

   Some of us may have to work on for years and never see any result of
   our toil. Let us not faint for a moment, nor be disheartened--some
   other person may come, by-and-by, and all men's mouths may be filled
   with wonderment at the great work that he does! And yet, after all, He
   who reads history aright, even the great God who writes it, will know
   that this man who seems to be so successful owes much of his usefulness
   to the work of other persons who labored before him. We cannot tell how
   much the Master's own service prepared the way for Philip's success
   when he went down to Samaria.

   And I believe that, in this great London, we shall see better and
   brighter days than these, because of all the work that has been done
   here in years gone by. Do not tell me that the preaching at Paul's
   Cross by men who became martyrs for the faith were lost efforts! I do
   not believe that those declarations of the Word of God in Smithfield,
   by men who were burnt,

   there, for their fidelity to Christ, will ever be lost! Let us not
   imagine that the glorious testimony for Christ of the long succession
   of Puritan preachers, who occupied yonder Churches across the water,
   will ever be lost! Neither shall it be that the witnessing in later
   times of John Newton, Romaine, Whitefield and the other faithful
   preachers of the Gospel shall be in vain, and that all they did shall
   be lost! No, London may be, at this time, far from what we want it to
   be, but, as surely as the labors of the Christ were not lost, so the
   Seed sown by those who came and labored for Him, and have now gone to
   their reward, shall spring up and bring forth fruit on some happier and
   sunnier day than this! When, perhaps, some of us shall sleep with our
   fathers, there shall come a day when there shall be great joy in this
   city as the direct result of our service for our Lord. In Cromwell's
   time, if you had walked down Cheapside at a certain hour of the
   morning, it is said that you would have seen every blind down because
   in every house there was family prayer. And at that hour, every
   morning, you might have gone from window to window and have heard the
   singing of a Psalm at almost every merchant's house in the city. It is
   not so, now, but it may be so again! Let us have faith in that Seed
   which lies still in the ground--it only needs someone to turn it up and
   it shall germinate and grow to the praise and Glory of God!

   That is a long preface, you will say, for me to have. Well, put up with
   it for once and let us now come to the text, "There was great joy in
   that city."

   I. And, first, it was A JOY BORN OF A GREAT SORROW. Usually, that is
   the best kind of joy. Joys of that sort are like Jabez who was more
   honorable than his brethren--and his mother called his name Jabez, that
   is, sorrowful, because she bore him with sorrow. The good which comes
   to us through that which is apparently an evil is usually the best of
   all good things.

   Now, the great sorrow out of which this joy in Samaria came was this.
   There had been persecution in Jerusalem, terrible persecution. Saul and
   other enemies of the Truth of God were making havoc in the Church. Good
   men were taken to prison, excellent Christian Sisters were shut up in
   jail as evildoers. Some were cruelly treated--numbers were put to
   death. Thank God, we do not know, in the real sense, what persecution
   is, for they cannot do much to us, nowadays, except expose us to the
   trial of cruel mockery, and there is not much in that to hurt us. But
   in Jerusalem the Church of God had to bear fierce persecution. Yet it
   was that persecution that made the disciples go abroad, everywhere
   preaching the Word!

   The second sorrow that they had was scattering, for it is a great grief
   to people who have lived together in holy fellowship to be divided, for
   families to be broken up, for good men who used to meet at the same
   place for prayer, to be able, no more, to see one another's faces. Men
   naturally cling to their homes, but those good folk had to flee from
   their homes and go wherever they could, to escape from the edge of the
   sword. But it was through this scattering that the blessing reached
   Samaria.

   Worse than that, death itself came into the Church at Jerusalem.
   Besides others who were put to death, Stephen, the first martyr, fell a
   victim to the persecutors' rage. He was a good man and true, a worthy
   leader of the host of God. He died a dreadful death, but through the
   scattering that followed his death, Philip was made to go down to
   Samaria and so, "There was great joy in that city." Sometimes, dear
   Friends, it is a blessing to a Church to have a great trial. I am
   persuaded that it is a good thing for some men to have to encounter a
   great difficulty. I confess that I owe almost everything to the forge,
   the fire, the file and the hammer. How little good we get out of our
   sweets--and how much we extract from our bitters! This Church at
   Jerusalem, by sore travail, became the mother of the saints in Samaria,
   and it was not without hard trials and dire struggles that she became
   useful to others.

   I want this Church, at this time, to feel that it is called upon by God
   to awaken itself before any great and overwhelming trial comes. Let us
   begin to feel for the vast city in which we dwell--and if any of you
   are under the pressure of the present distress, or if you are tried by
   the loss of some dear one at home--just as these trials worked on the
   whole Church at Jerusalem, so let them work, in their measure, upon
   you, stirring you up to seek the souls of men and to bring others to
   know and love our Lord Jesus Christ! Oh, that there were such a heart
   in the thousands of our Church members that everyone desired the
   conversion of his neighbor! Oh, that we began to feel an inward anguish
   for those about us who are perishing through sheer
   indifference--perishing while the glorious Gospel is proclaimed so near
   to them! Oh, that the great sorrow that some of us have had to bear of
   late might become the mother of a great joy to many others! It was so
   in Philip's day--there was much joy in Samaria because there had been
   much grief in Jerusalem.

   II. But now, secondly, IT WAS A JOY OCCASIONED BY ONE MAN'S
   PREACHING--"there was great joy in that city." It was one man's
   preaching that caused it. Philip went down to Samaria and preached
   Christ--and the great joy was the result of his preaching.

   Notice who it was that preached--it was Philip. Now Philip was a Jew
   and he might have said--perhaps he did say-- that he was a very
   unlikely person to succeed in Samaria, for the Jews had no dealings
   with the Samaritans--and the Samaritans did not care to have any
   dealings with the Jews. They were nations remarkably like one another
   and yet strongly antagonistic to one another. They could not stand each
   other and yet, you see, it was the preaching of a Jew that was blessed
   to the people of Samaria! Never say again, dear Friend, "I must not go
   there. I am not a proper person for that place." How do you know? The
   most unlikely person in the esteem of men may be the very person who is
   the special choice of God. Jew or no Jew, Philip is sent to preach the
   Gospel and to preach it to every creature and, therefore, he goes to
   Samaria! It must have seemed strange to him that this door of utterance
   was opened to him, that he was welcomed by the Samaritans who were so
   hostile to the Jews. I say again, dear Friends, never let us keep back
   from trying to do good anywhere, and everywhere--and never let any one
   of us say of any people, "I could not speak to them." Why not? Go, and
   try. "They are too cultured," says one. Cultured people are often
   impressed by natural, wild bird notes. "Oh, they are too ignorant,"
   says another. It may be your ignorance that makes you think so, but do
   not, because you have been better educated than they, be so proud as to
   disdain to speak to them, for if so, it will prove that you are not
   very well educated, yet, and need a great deal more of the right kind
   of training. "Oh, but I know that my profession and my trade, and so
   on, are against me!" Never mind what is against you--go and do your
   duty--and God will bless you.

   The next thing about Philip was that he was not a regular minister. He
   was one of the seven deacons chosen by the Apostles and by the Church
   at Jerusalem to look after the poor members, that the Apostles might be
   able to give their whole attention to the ministry of the Word and to
   prayer. Yes, but then anybody may preach the Gospel, anybody who can
   preach ought to preach! And instead of its being the business of a few
   select gentlemen to go and preach the Gospel, is it not written, "Let
   him that hears, say, Come"? All you who have heard the Gospel should
   endeavor to tell it to others! And the question of every Christian man
   should not be, "May I preach the Gospel?"--That you may certainly
   do--but, "Can I preach the Gospel? Have I such power of preaching it
   that anybody will listen to me? If nobody will listen, it is clear that
   it is of no use for me to preach. But if I can so speak that others
   will hear. If I have the gifts, I am bound to use them, and I ought to
   try to see whether I have the gifts, or not, for, perhaps I have them
   and do not know it." It was Philip, the deacon, whose preaching brought
   joy to this city! Therefore, preach away, my Brothers! Speak in the
   name of God as best you can on behalf of the Lord Jesus, for in these
   days there are many who are speaking against Him. This is an additional
   reason why no tongue that can speak a word for Him should remain
   silent.

   But we are also told that this deacon, Philip, was a man of excellent
   character. When the deacons were to be chosen, the Apostles said to the
   members of the Church at Jerusalem, "Look out among you seven men of
   honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint
   over this business." Philip was one of the seven and, therefore, we
   know that he was a man of sterling character. That is very essential to
   the preaching that will make a city glad. He was also a man full of the
   Holy Spirit and that is the chief qualification for a preacher of the
   Gospel. All the learning in the world is not worth a penny to a man
   unless he is filled with the Holy Spirit! When the Spirit of God rests
   upon any man, He enables the preacher to speak with the power that
   reaches the heart and the conscience. Without that power, nothing can
   be done--therefore seek it, my Brothers. When you try to labor for God,
   do it in the power of the Holy Spirit.

   But really, I do not care to say much more about who the preacher in
   Samaria was because that does not signify much. I wish that people did
   not so often take notice of who the preacher is--the principal question
   is, What is preached?

   What did Philip preach? We are not left in doubt about this matter, for
   we are told that, "Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached
   Christ to them." Yes, that is the preaching that brings great joy to a
   city! "He preached Christ to them." He told them that Jesus of
   Nazareth, who was born at Bethlehem, and who died on Calvary, is the
   Son of God, the Messiah, the Sent One! That Jesus is, Himself, both God
   and Man, and that He has come here as a messenger of peace from God to
   man.

   Philip preached Christ to them as the one Sacrifice for sin, telling
   them that Jesus died, the Just for the unjust, to bring them to God. He
   preached to them of the great Substitution of Christ for sinners and of
   all the grief He bore in the place of guilty men--and he bade them
   believe in this Christ that they might obtain the pardon of all their
   sins, full justifi-

   cation in the sight of God and power to become the children of God! He
   preached Christ, also, as their Sanctifier, telling them that Jesus
   could change their natures, take the stony heart out of their flesh and
   give them a heart of flesh, so that they would love that which once
   they hated, and hate what once they loved. Philip preached Jesus Christ
   of Nazareth as the great Heart-Changer, the true Moral Reformer, the
   Man who turns things upside down and puts evil where it ought to
   be--under men's feet--and implants His Grace as a reigning power for
   holiness within their souls. Thus he preached Christ to them. He did
   not preach up what they could do-- he preached what Christ had
   done--and he bade them come and accept the work of Christ, all finished
   and complete! He bade them quit all other confidences and come and
   confide in the Lord Jesus Christ. He did not so much try to preach them
   to Christ, as to preach Christ to them--and there is a distinction
   between these two things, though the great end in preaching Christ to a
   sinner is also to preach the sinner to Christ.

   Beloved Friends, I delight to preach to you all the doctrines which I
   find in God's Word, but I desire always to preach the Person of Christ
   above the doctrine--the doctrine is but the chair in which Christ sits
   as a Prophet to instruct us. Christ Himself is still alive! He has
   risen from the dead! He has gone into Heaven, but He is observant of
   all that is going on here, below--He is making intercession for sinners
   and if you trust that living Savior, He will save you. Oh, that you
   would do so! This is the Gospel we have to preach to you, and this it
   is which, if it is received, will make you glad. It was this that
   caused great joy in the city of Samaria!

   Thus, you see, it was a joy that was born of a great sorrow, and a joy
   produced by the preaching of one man. You have heard who he was and
   what he preached.

   III. Now, thirdly, IT WAS A JOY WHICH HAD ABUNDANT CAUSE--"There was
   great joy in that city."

   First, there was joy in Samaria because the Gospel was preached there.
   If men did but know it, the greatest gift a city can have is to have
   the Gospel preached in it. Remember the old motto of the city of
   Glasgow, "Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the Word." No city
   flourishes so well as that which has a clear, powerful Gospel bell
   ringing in the midst of it! It is a famishing city which has not the
   Bread of Life, but it is a flourishing city which has the Bread of Life
   freely dispensed from the pulpit every Sabbath by loving hands.

   But there was still more joy in Samaria because there were signs of
   blessing going with the Gospel. Unclean spirits were driven out of
   those who had been possessed by them and lame and paralyzed persons
   were made to walk! We work no such miracles, now, in the physical
   world, but we work them in the spiritual realm--out of many men have we
   seen the evil spirits go as the cup of devils has been abandoned!
   Filthy blasphemy has been given up and their speech has been seasoned
   with salt! Fornication has been forsaken, uncleanness of life has been
   hated and left, theft and dishonesty of every kind have become
   detestable! We have seen these miracles worked again and again. We have
   some among us at this time to whom we might say, "And such were some of
   you, but you are washed." The Gospel has washed, cleansed and changed
   them--and it is going to do the same for others, for Jesus Christ has
   come to cast unclean spirits out of those who are possessed by them,
   and to make some receive Divine strength who have, up to now, been
   palsied so far as any holy action is concerned--that they may,
   henceforth, run gladly in the ways of God and give up their whole lives
   to His service and Glory. Oh, that it might be so with many here,
   tonight! If it is so, there will be great joy in this city!

   Once more, there was great joy in Samaria because so many believed and
   were saved. He that believes in Jesus Christ is saved! The moment that
   he believes, his nature is changed, his sins are forgiven and his heart
   is renewed. This great work is done in a moment, but it is never
   undone! The new life commences with the miraculous, regenerating work
   of the Holy Spirit and that miracle is of such a character that it
   continues to thrill throughout the entire man until, at last, he is
   brought safely to Heaven, made perfectly like the Lord Jesus Christ.

   There was also great joy in Samaria because of the changed lives of
   those who believed. When a man is converted, he does not doubt the
   power of the Gospel that converted him. And when men see the changed
   lives of well-known sinners, they are made to believe that the Gospel
   that works such transformations must be true or, if they doubt it, they
   do so in the teeth of the most plain evidence. If our preaching does
   not turn men from drunkenness to sobriety, from thieving to honesty,
   from unchastity to purity, then our Gospel is not worth a button! But
   if it does all this, then this shall be the evidence that it comes from
   God, seeing that in the world so sorely diseased by sin, it works the
   wondrous miracle of curing men of these deadly evils!

   O my dear Friends, what a happy city Samaria was when it was full of
   men healed, saved, converted and rejoicing in

   Christ!

   IV. And this is the point I am trying to reach in concluding my
   discourse. THIS IS THE JOY WHICH WE DESIRE TO SEE REPEATED IN
   LONDON--"There was great joy in that city."

   We long to have this great joy in London! We want to see desperate
   souls made happy. My friend over yonder, who has been indulging dark
   thoughts about whether he can manage to live any longer--his hand
   almost feels for the fatal knife-- live, poor Soul, live! There is
   hope, there is joy even for you! Jesus Christ is willing to forgive the
   chief of sinners! He is ready to renew the most debauched and depraved
   of men! He is able to make a saint of you! He can, at this moment, take
   the burden from your heart and commence a work in you which shall make
   you a totally new man! What do you say to this? If you can believe in
   Jesus, there will begin to be joy in this city, for there will be joy
   in your heart! I remember the day when I despaired of finding
   salvation, when I could not think that my sin would ever be forgiven,
   but that voice, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the
   earth," was a word of life and love to my soul! And I would repeat it,
   tonight, to those in this audience who are in the depths of despair. Do
   not give yourself up--God has not given you up! Do not sign your own
   death warrant--God has not signed it. "Come unto Me," says Christ, "all
   you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Were
   you, poor sinful woman, almost hiding away for very shame? Come along
   with you! Remember what Luke wrote concerning Christ, "Then drew near
   unto Him all the publicans and sinners to hear Him," and He preached to
   them the blessed Word of Life! Oh, hear it tonight! Believe in Him and
   live! And there will begin to be joy in this city when despairing souls
   are made happy by a holy confidence in Christ!

   Well, then, dear Friends, suppose, also, that some sinful men and women
   should be changed in character--what joy there will be in this city!
   The man who used to swear and curse, goes home like a lamb. What a joy
   for his wife as well as for himself! The man who was known to the
   police--better known than one might like to be--suppose that he should
   become known as much for his integrity and uprightness as he has been
   for his wrong-doing? What a change for him and what a change for all
   around him! It is amazing what an amount of misery some men cause to
   others. O you wretched creatures, it is a marvel that God Almighty
   should let you live at all when you beat your wives and blast your
   children's lives almost from the day of their birth with your
   drunkenness and blasphemy! But if the Lord comes and changes you, and
   you give up the drink, and you become Christians, truly following
   Christ, what joy there will be in this city!

   Why, there are some men whom I have known, whose wives would hardly
   recognize them if they became kind and spoke tenderly to them! If they
   were to bring home all their wages on Saturday night, the wife would
   say, "Whatever has come over Charlie? I cannot imagine what has caused
   such a change as this." And if, instead of a word and a blow, or a blow
   without a word, such a man were to become gentle, kind and amiable--ah,
   well, it would not matter that you had lived in one room, it would not
   matter that you had but scanty wages--all that would soon be altered!
   But even if it were not immediately changed, there would come rays of
   sunlight through that dirty window and the house, itself, would
   speedily become clean and bright! And when there is a happy father and
   a happy mother, there would soon be happy children! Yes, there is joy
   in a city when such a change as this is worked in men and women who
   have gone far into sin.

   Now you suppose that I am speaking only to the poor, but I am doing
   nothing of the kind! Why, there are some men who are rolling in riches,
   yet they are grumpy, stingy and quarrelling with everybody in the
   house--from the youngest servant right up to the wife! They make
   everybody unhappy by their wicked ways. The Lord have mercy upon you
   poor rich people who do not know what you want, but are always wanting
   something or other! May God give you new hearts and right spirits--and
   teach you the sacred art of living according to the law of love! When
   you once get that word, "love," thoroughly worked into your nature, and
   into your lives, there will be joy in your house and, as houses make up
   a city, by-and-by, this wondrous work of Grace will make great joy in
   this city! The practical effect of Christianity is happiness, therefore
   let it be spread abroad everywhere! Let men begin to think about one
   another and care for one another and minister to one another's comfort
   and, before long, the sure result of the Gospel, faithfully preached,
   and cheerfully accepted, and lovingly manifested, will be great joy in
   the city!

   Oh, but what great joy there is because of the heavenly hopes which
   true religion creates within the soul! The man who is a believer in the
   Lord Jesus Christ has many joys even now, for--

   "'Tis religion that can give Sweetest pleasures while we live," but he
   has much more bliss in reversion, for it is also true that--

   "'Tis religion must supply

   Solid comfort when we die. After death its joys will be Lasting as
   eternity. Be the living God my Friend, Then my bliss shall never end."

   What a number of Christian people there are who are very poor and, what
   is worse, perhaps, very sick and often suffering great pain. But they
   say to themselves, "It is not for long. We shall soon see the face of
   the Well-Beloved." I do not suppose that there is a man in London
   suffering more than our dear brother and deacon, William Olney. His
   pain is such that if I were in his place, I would prefer death to life,
   yet, if there is a happy man anywhere, he is to be found down the New
   Kent Road! If there is one Brother whom I envy more than another--I do
   not think I envy anybody--it is that one man. Even in the midst of his
   pain, he is always peaceful, always joyful, always as merry as a
   cricket because he is looking for the coming of his Lord, abiding His
   will, and expecting to be with Him, soon, where He is!

   Oh, dear People, if you do but get a good hope through Grace, that will
   make you rich, that will make you joyful, that will make you strong! I
   wish that you all had it--my very soul keeps longing within me that you
   might all be converted to God! I cannot work that great miracle--it is
   only the Spirit of God who can do it, but He works in answer to prayer.
   I wish that all God's people would silently breathe this prayer to Him,
   now, "Lord, save every sinner in this house! Bring every unconverted
   one to Your feet!" He can do it, you know. Only let us cry to Him,
   pleading His own promise, "I will yet for this be enquired of by the
   house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like
   a flock." So let us cry to Him, "Lord, save this people! Lord, save
   this people, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ACTS8.

   Stephen had been stoned to death, but with his latest breath he prayed
   for his murderers. Then this chapter begins-- Verse 1. And Saul was
   consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great
   persecution against the Church which was at Jerusalem and they were all
   scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except
   the Apostles. Saul, having tasted blood in the murder of Stephen,
   became more and more furious in his persecution of the Church of Christ
   at Jerusalem--and the Brothers and Sisters had to escape for their
   lives. They all did so, except the Apostles, who were specially cared
   for by Divine Providence.

   2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great
   lamentations over him. As well they might, for his death was a serious
   loss to the Church. He was one of the best workers for Christ of that
   day and when he was thus put to death by the judicial murder of
   stoning, the devout men who were spared to mourn his loss "made great
   lamentation over him."

   3. As for Saul, he made havoc of the Church, entering every house and
   dragging off men and women, committing them to prison. At first, we can
   hardly believe that this was the very man who later became the greatest
   preacher of the Gospel and the most successful builder of the Church of
   Christ, but it was even so. He was always earnest in whatever he did.
   When he persecuted, he did it with all his might--and when he became
   converted he preached with all his might. He was a thorough-going man.
   I like these thorough-going men--they are worth saving! When they are
   converted, they bring great Glory to God. The next verse tells us one
   effect of the havoc worked by Saul--

   4. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching
   the Word. They might have stayed at Jerusalem and made a comfortable
   and strong Church, there, if they had not been persecuted, but, being
   scattered abroad, they were like seed in every furrow of the field!
   "They went everywhere preaching the Word." Now, out of this Church,
   there is a continual drain of Brothers and Sisters who leave their
   native land to go to distant colonies. Such are the pressing end of the
   times, that many have to go abroad. I charge you, wherever you go,
   carry the Holy Seed with you. Be yourselves a seed for Christ in every
   land!

   5-11. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ
   unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
   which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. For
   unclear spirits, crying with loud voices, came out of many that were
   possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame,
   were healed. And there was great joy in that city. But there was a
   certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used
   sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that he,
   himself, was some great one: to whom they all gave heed, from the least
   to the greatest, saying, this man is the great power of God. And to him
   they had regard, because for a long time he had bewitched them with
   sorceries. And there are those in all ages who set up to be
   prophets--and who seek to draw men after them--of whom it is well to
   beware.

   12- 13. But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
   the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
   both men and women. Then Simon, himself, believed, also. Simon believed
   after a certain style and fashion. He saw that there was a real power
   about Philip which he did not, himself, possess, and he was obliged to
   bow down before the manifest Presence of God.

   13- 17. And when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and
   wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done. Now when the
   Apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the
   Word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they were
   come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:
   (for as yet He was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in
   the name of the Lord Jesus). Then laid they their hands on them and
   they received the Holy Spirit. That is to say, they received a share of
   those miraculous gifts which attended the introduction of the Gospel of
   Christ. It has therefore been supposed that certain superior persons
   should visit the churches and lay their hands upon people. So they
   should, if they have the power to bestow such a gift as Peter and John
   gave--but to lay empty hands on the heads of men and women is a vain
   ceremony! When the Apostles laid their hands on these converts in
   Samaria, they received the Holy Spirit.

   18-26. And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the Apostles'
   hands, the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, saying, Give
   me, also, this power, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the
   Holy Spirit. But Peter said unto him, Your money perish with you
   because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
   money! You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is
   not right in the sight of God. Repent, therefore, of this, your
   wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be
   forgiven you. For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness,
   and in the bond of iniquity. Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to
   the Lord for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come
   upon me. And they, when they had testified and preached the Word of the
   Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Gospel in many villages
   of the Samaritans. And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip, saying,
   Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goes down from
   Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. Philip, who had been so useful to
   the multitude, must now be of service to a solitary individual! My dear
   Brothers, if you can gather a crowd of people together, preach the
   Gospel to them! But if you cannot do that, preach the Gospel to one
   person, if you can only reach one! It was a desert, but the angel of
   the Lord bade Philip go there.

   27. And he arose and went. Not hesitating, but at once obeying. If the
   Lord should send you to the wilderness, depend upon it that He will
   send somebody else there for you to bless! Go, therefore, without fear.

   27, 28. And, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority
   under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her
   treasury and had come to Jerusalem to worship, was returning, and
   sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the Prophet. He was a devout man, a
   studious man, a Bible-reading man. We do not often find such persons in
   great authority under queens--but here was one.

   29-31. Then the Spirit said unto Philip, go near, and join yourself to
   this chariot. And Philip ran there to him and heard him read the
   Prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading? And
   he said, how can I, unless someone should guide me? And he asked Philip
   to come up and sit with him. See how God honors the Christian ministry
   by making even His Word to be, in some respects, insufficient for some
   men! At any rate, they need that some living voice should come and
   guide them into the meaning of it. Oh, that He would bless our voice,
   tonight, that some who have gathered with us in this Tabernacle might
   be brought to understand the Scriptures through our guidance!

   32-35. The place of the Scripture which he read was this, He was led as
   a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before His shearer, so
   opened He not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken
   away: and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from
   the earth. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of
   whom speaks the Prophet? Of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip
   opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto
   him, Jesus. It seems that, wherever Philip went, he had but one
   subject. When he went down to the city of Samaria, he preached Christ
   to them, and now that he talks to this Ethiopian eunuch, he preaches
   Jesus to him.

   36, 37. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
   and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be
   baptized? And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may.
   And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
   God. That is the great confession of faith that is to be made by all
   who have believed in Jesus!

   38, 39. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went
   down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
   And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord
   caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his
   way rejoicing. The Holy Spirit will not permit us to depend too much
   upon men as our teachers. The Spirit of the Lord did not take away the
   Bible--that was left for the eunuch. He only caught away Philip after
   the Evangelist had furnished the enquirer with the key with which he
   could open the Scriptures--then he could unlock the Word, himself. That
   he did so, if history is to be believed, is very clear. He went home to
   Ethiopia, perhaps to Abyssinia, and the people there heard the Gospel
   from him--and to this day there are some traces of our holy faith in
   that

   land!

   40. But Philip was found at Azotes: and passing through he preached in
   all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. We know quite well what "he
   preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea," although it is
   not mentioned here. Wherever he went, he had but one theme--"the things
   concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ." So may it
   be with us wherever we go!

"Out Of The Depths"

   (No. 2353)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MARCH 25, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   26, 1888.

   "For innumerable evils have compassed me about: my iniquities have
   taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more
   than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart fails me. Be pleased, O
   LORD, to deliver me: O LORD make haste to help me." Psalm 40:12,13.

   You remember that these were the words of a man of God, a man after
   God's own heart, a man undoubtedly the possessor of the Grace of God.
   They were the words, also, of a preacher, one who could say, "I have
   preached righteousness in the great congregation...I have declared Your
   faithfulness and Your salvation: I have not concealed Your loving
   kindness and your Truth from the great congregation."

   This teaches us that however eminent for Grace a man of God may be, it
   may happen to him, sometimes, that the thought of his sin may be
   paramount over his faith. There are times when the Lord seems to give
   His servants a new start. It is not a second conversion, but it is
   something very like it. They are made to see, once more, the deformity
   of their character, the defilement of their nature, the inward
   sinfulness of their hearts--that they may prize more than ever that
   they have experienced the cleansing Fountain of atoning blood and the
   wonderful power of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. I mention
   this fact so that, if any of you are in trouble like that described in
   the text, you may be comforted by knowing that there are the footprints
   of a fellow Believer in this dark part of the way you have to travel.
   Others have been here before you! Others who were undoubtedly the
   people of God, others who were saved in the Lord with an everlasting
   salvation!

   You have had to write bitter things against yourself--so have other
   people. Have you ever felt as though you were surrounded by sin so that
   you could not look up? You are not the first man who has been in such a
   plight and you are not likely to be the last. This part of the road has
   been frequented by full many of the pilgrims bound to Zion's city. All
   the people of God have not taken this route--there are different ways
   of traveling along the road to Heaven. But some of the true saints of
   God have gone by this rough path and I mention this fact in order that
   no troubled heart may fall into despair because of the painful
   experience through which it is passing at the present time.

   I. In trying to describe a soul in the condition mentioned in our text,
   let me say, first, that we have evidently before us A SOUL BESET--"For
   innumerable evils have compassed me about: my iniquities have taken
   hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the
   hairs of my head."

   The text describes a man who is, first, made to see the countless
   number of his sins. He did not know so much about them, before. He said
   that he was a sinner and he meant it, but then he wrote the words in
   very small letters. Now, a further enlightenment has been granted to
   him--the Spirit of judgment and of burning has come to deal with
   him--and now he writes the sentence, "I AM A SINNER," in capitals so
   large that he needs the whole sky and all the sea, as well, to make the
   page on which to emblazon the terrible words. With an emphasis of which
   he used to know nothing, he now calls himself a sinner, for sins that
   he had forgotten come up before his memory. Now he sees that there is a
   great number of sins in any one sin, like so many Chinese boxes shut
   up, one inside another.

   Moreover, things which he formerly did not recognize as sins, he now
   perceives to be among the deadliest of transgressions. He realizes that
   the imagination of evil is sin, that sin is any lack of conformity to
   the perfection of God. Now he seems as if he swarms with sins and yet,
   a short while ago he thought himself clean and pure in the sight of
   God! It is amazing what a ray of light will do--the sun suddenly shines
   into a room and the whole air seems full of innumerable

   specks of dust dancing up and down in the sunbeam! The light does not
   make the room full of dust--it only shows you what was always
   there--but which you did not see until the sun shone in. And if a beam
   of God's true Light were to shine into some of your hearts, you would
   think very differently of yourselves from what you have ever done. I
   question whether any one among us could bear to see himself as God sees
   him.

   I think it is highly probable that if any man were to see his own heart
   as it really is, he would go mad! It would be a sight too dreadful for
   an awakened conscience and a sensitive reason to endure. And when the
   Lord comes to any of His servants and reveals sin in its true
   character, unless there is a corresponding revelation of the cleansing
   blood, it puts a man into a very dreadful condition of mind. He says
   that his sins are more than the hairs of his head. He feels that that
   is a very poor comparison, so he says they are innumerable, they cannot
   be counted! In the process of trying to count them, we would have
   sinned, again, I know not how many times--sinned in our judgments about
   our sins--our thoughts about our sins would only increase the number of
   them!

   Now, this is no morbid feeling of a perverted brain! It is a true and
   strictly accurate statement of a sad fact. It is not possible for any
   of us to think too badly of ourselves as we really are in the sight of
   God. Comfort does not come by trying to lessen our sense of sin--it
   comes in a much better and more effectual way--as I will presently try
   to show you.

   This man, then, is troubled by the number of his sins. He also seems to
   be greatly perplexed by a sort of Omnipresence of sin, for he says,
   "Innumerable evils have compassed me about." He looks that way and
   says, "Surely there is a gap, there, I have not sinned in that
   direction." But no, there are sins in that quarter. He turns sharply
   round and he looks this way and says, "Perhaps I shall find a lane,
   there, through which I may escape. I hope I have not sinned in that
   way." But when he steadily looks, he finds that he has sinned there,
   too. These innumerable evils have compassed him about. David said of
   his enemies, "They compassed me about like bees." They were all around
   him. When a swarm of bees gets about a man, they are above, beneath,
   around, everywhere stinging, each one stinging--until he seems to be
   stung in every part of his body!

   So, when conscience wakes up the whole hive of our sins, we find
   ourselves compassed about with innumerable evils--sins at the board and
   sins on the bed, sins at the task and sins in the pew, sins in the
   street and sins in the shop, sins on land and sins at sea, sins of
   body, soul, spirit, sins of the eyes, of the lips, of the hands, of the
   feet--sins everywhere, everywhere sins! It is a horrible discovery when
   it seems to a man as if sin had become well-near as Omnipresent with
   him as God is! It cannot be actually so, for sin cannot be everywhere
   as God is, but it is hard to say where sin is not when once conscience
   is awake to see it. Our whole life, from our first responsible moment,
   even until now, appears defiled. There are sins even in our holy
   things! Only half the heart is laid upon God's altar and the
   sacramental bread, itself, is defiled as it passes into our mouth. Oh,
   it is dreadful when the heart is awakened to see that it is even so!
   "Innumerable evils have compassed me about."

   But that is not all. This man is so beset with sin that it seems to
   hold him in a terrible grip. Read this--"My iniquities have taken hold
   upon me," as though they were so many griffins, or other monsters of
   the old fables. They come and fix their claws into him--they have taken
   hold upon him. Did any of you ever feel the grip of a single sin? I
   hope that you have, for you have never been rightly delivered from it
   if you have never felt its grasp. I once knew a young man who had not a
   true sense of sin. He believed himself to be a sinner, but he never had
   a real conviction of sin. He was a working-man, steady and upright, and
   he prided himself upon his sobriety and industry. One day, in some
   little frolic, he upset an oil can and, when his employer came in, and
   asked, "Who did that?" he said that he did not. No one ever found out
   who upset that oil can, but he knew that he did it. Knocking over that
   can was not, in itself, an act of criminality, but he felt mean and
   despicable because he had told a lie--and that lie fixed itself upon
   his heart, clawed at it and tore away at it so that he could not get
   away from its cruel clutches!

   He came to the House of Prayer on the Lord's-Day to try to get rid of
   this iniquity that had taken hold upon him, but it kept its hold month
   after month, hissing in his ear, "You have been a liar." Nobody knew of
   it but himself, yet that one sin was quite enough to take hold upon him
   and to fix him with an awful grip. It was in this House of God that he
   was delivered from that sin through the precious blood of Christ and I
   said within myself, when I heard the whole story, "Well, I am glad that
   sin took hold of that young man, for there were many sins beside which
   he afterwards thought of and acknowledged with tears before his
   God--but they had all passed by unnoticed, they had never laid hold on
   him as that one lie had!

   Let me tell you, Friend, if you have a number of sins which have once
   taken hold on you, you will be something like a stag when the whole
   pack of hounds has seized him and his neck and his flanks and every
   bone in him seem to feel the hounds' teeth gnawing at them. I speak
   what I know--I have felt these dogs upon me--and I have had to cry to
   God for deliverance! And perhaps I am speaking to some soul that is in
   that condition tonight. It is no child's play when this is the case.
   Here we have to deal with stern facts and it is only God, by some great
   act of Grace, who can set free a poor soul that is once beset in this
   way!

   Thus, you see, he realizes the countless number of his sins, he
   recognizes the almost Omnipresence of his sins and he feels the
   terrible grip of his sins tearing at his conscience--judging him,
   condemning him, breathing curses into him! Oh, if you know this
   experience, you can follow me when I take you a little further along
   this dark, dreary road!

   II. Here is, secondly, A SOUL BEWILDERED--"My iniquities have taken
   hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up." Do you hear that, "not
   able to look up"? That is the only hope that a man has when he is under
   a sense of sin--his one way of escape is by looking up! But the
   Psalmist says, "I am not able to look up."

   Does it not mean, first, that he did not dare to look his sins in the
   face? He felt so guilty, so self-condemned, that, as the judge, when he
   pronounces the death sentence, covers his head by putting on the black
   cap, so this culprit felt that he must hide his own face! He wants to
   have a handkerchief tied over his eyes, for he is shocked at the sight
   that meets his gaze. He dares not look up--that is, he cannot face his
   sin.

   It means, also, that he is unable to excuse himself. He used to be as
   big a braggart as anybody. At one time, he could talk as glibly as
   anyone about there being no God and no Hell. But that kind of speech is
   all gone out of him now. The Lord can soon knock such folly as that out
   of a man! Just one prick of the conscience and the boaster is brought
   to his knees--and he does not try to look up for a single moment to
   justify or excuse himself. All he can do is to hang his head and
   murmur, "Guilty, guilty, guilty." He knows, then, the meaning of Dr.
   Watts' lines--

   "Should sudden vengeance seize my breath, I must confess You just in
   death. And, if my Soul were sent to Hell, Your righteous Law approves
   it well." Now, I may talk to you, thus, and you may not feel the force
   of what I am saying. But if God deals with you, it will be a different
   matter! You will then be brought into such a state of bewilderment that
   you will not be able to face your sin, or excuse yourself, or even dare
   to think of it, the mere thought of it will be too horrible for you!

   A man in this state of bewilderment dares not look up to read God's
   promises. I come to him and I say, "Friend, do you not know that there
   is a Bible full of promises for such as you are? 'This is a faithful
   saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the
   world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.'" I put my hand on his
   shoulder and I say, "Now, look at that promise." He cannot look up. We
   read, in the 107th Psalm, of some who were so ill that when the most
   dainty food was brought to them, they shook their heads, for they could
   not touch it--"Their soul abhors all manner of meat; and they draw near
   unto the gates of death."

   Well, that is the condition of this man. "But," you say, "my dear
   Fellow, look at this passage, 'All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
   forgiven unto men.' 'Whoever confesses and forsakes his sins shall have
   mercy.'" "Ah," he says, "it is too late for me, it does not apply to
   me." Now, this is all a mistake, you know--the Lord is willing to
   receive you, my dear Hearer, however horrible your offenses may have
   been! If you are up to your neck in blasphemy and iniquity, Christ can
   make you clean in a moment! He has such sovereign power that, with a
   word, He can forgive you. Yes, and with a word, He can change your
   nature and make a saint out of a sinner, an angel out of a very human
   devil--such power does Christ possess to save the vilest of the vile!
   So we say to the poor man, "Dear Friend, look up! Look up at God's
   promises."

   Perhaps we try what effect the testimony of others will have upon him.
   We stand in front of him and we say, "Look at us for a moment." There
   was a dear Brother who prayed at the Prayer Meeting before the
   service--no doubt he is here somewhere--"Lord, save the big sinners,
   for," he said, "Lord, since you have saved me, I believe that you can
   save anybody." Now, that was good pleading, and I can say the same.
   There are many here who would say to you, "We looked unto Christ and
   were lightened. We came with all our sin heavy upon us and we did but
   look to Jesus, and we found peace, rest, new hearts and changed lives!
   What He has done for us, He can do for you, for He has shown forth in
   some of us, as he did in Paul, all long-suffering for a pattern to all
   others who will believe in Him unto life everlasting."

   Still, the man cannot look up. His sins have so bewildered him, his
   sense of guilt has so muddled his poor thoughts that he dares not look
   up--and yet he ought to! If I were suffering from a certain disease and
   a number of persons came to me and said, "We were afflicted exactly as
   you now are, but we went to Dr. So-and-So, and he cured us almost at
   once," I think that I would go to that doctor and I would try the
   medicine that had healed others! Oh, I wish that some of you would try
   my Savior! You young people--would God that you would try Him in your
   youth! You older ones, I pray that you may be led to Jesus, now, though
   your sin rises like a mountain, for He is able to forgive and to save
   unto the uttermost all that come unto God by Him!

   But this poor soul cannot yet look up, so we put our hand upon him,
   again, and we say, "But, dear Heart, if you will not look to the
   promises in the Bible and you will not look to us who are specimens of
   what Divine Grace can do, yet do look to Jesus on the Cross. Have you
   ever heard the story of how He lived and how He died? Do you not know
   the meaning of those blessed wounds of His? He was the Son of God and
   He suffered all this for sinful men. He was pure, holy and innocent,
   yet He died, 'the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God.' Must there
   not be great merit in the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ? Look up! Look to
   Him! Look up to Jesus on the Cross."--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for thee! Then look, sinner--look unto Him and be sa ved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree." But it is no use for us to talk to
   him--his sins have taken hold upon him so that he cannot look up.

   So we try again and we bid him look up to Jesus on the Throne. We say,
   "Do you not know that Jesus has risen from the dead? He has gone up
   into Heaven and He is at the right hand of God, making intercession for
   the transgressors. The business of Christ in Heaven is to plead for
   sinners. Oh, how I wish that you would look up to Him! Do it!" Thus we
   plead, but our pleading is not sufficient. Spirit of God, break these
   poor creatures away from their infatuation and help them, now, to just
   look up to the living Savior who is seated at the right hand of God,
   pleading for the guilty, for such as they are! Dear Hearers, look to
   Jesus! Only trust Him! A look will do it. Look, look now! In God's
   name, I command you to look! In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I
   do not merely advise, but, speaking by His authority, I bid you look
   and live! May He set His seal to that command, as He did when Ezekiel
   bade the dry bones live and they did! But yet I know that, apart from
   the Eternal Spirit, the poor soul will not look up, though looking up
   is the only way to safety.

   III. Follow me for just a few minutes more while I notice, in the third
   place, that here is A SOUL FAINTING--"My iniquities have taken hold
   upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs
   of my head: therefore my heart fails me."

   Why, that is the man who used to come in here as big as anybody, and
   now he cries, "My heart fails me." You used to sing above all the rest,
   did you not? And you despised those poor weeping ones. But now your
   lament is, "My heart fails me." When a man's heart fails him, it is as
   when the standard-bearer of an army faints--everything gets in
   disarray.

   "My heart fails me." You have come to a fainting condition and when the
   heart fails, death is approaching. You feel as if you must die, you are
   so utterly faint. You dare not hope. You have no energy--what can you
   do? "To will," you say, "is present with me, but how to perform that
   which is good I find not." You are the man who used to think that you
   could believe whenever you liked and jump into Sovereign Grace whenever
   you pleased! You do not find it so easy, now, do you?

   "My heart fails me." This is the language of one in whom fear is
   working. Why, there is poor Mercy! Poor Mercy! You, as a young girl,
   said, "I will not come to Jesus yet. I can come to Him whenever I
   like." And now you are fainting outside the gate because the big dog
   barks at you and your heart fails you! Oh, lie not there to die, dear
   swooning one! Jesus Christ will come to you in all your faintness. Is
   it not written, "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ
   died for the ungodly"? "When we were yet without strength." Now you see
   what there is in yourself, do you not? Nothing at all! Your very heart
   fails you and if Sovereign Grace does not interpose, you are lost, you
   know you are!

   "Yes," you say, "that is quite true, I am lost." I am so glad that you
   confess this, for your confession proves that you are the one whom God
   has chosen unto eternal life from before the foundation of the world!
   You are the sort for whom Jesus died when He poured out His heart's
   blood. You are already called, by His Grace, to come to Him, for He
   said, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest." You are the very character whom He describes as being
   the objects of His love! Come to Him, just as you are, and cast
   yourselves upon Him. Fainting Heart,

   do not wait till you are revived, but faint on the bosom of Jesus!
   Failing Heart, do not wait till you grow strong again, but come and
   confess your failure, your spiritual bankruptcy at Christ's feet!
   Remember, there are none who are declared to be clear of all
   obligations but those who are bankrupts before the Lord, even as Joseph
   Hart sings--

   "'Tis perfect po verty alone

   That sets the soul at large.

   While we can call one mite our own,

   We have no full discharge."

   "But I have no good feelings," says one. I am glad of it! Come to
   Christ for them. "But I cannot repent as I would, or believe as I
   would." Then listen to Hart again--

   "True belief and true repentance, Every Grace that brings you nigh,
   Without money,

   Come to Jesus Christ and buy."

   He needs nothing from you but that you will agree to let Him be
   everything to you! "Free Grace and dying love"--I delight to ring those
   charming bells! Oh, that every ear would welcome their blessed music!
   Poor fainting Heart, hear the gladsome tidings of Free Grace and dying
   love, and catch at the message and rejoice in Christ tonight! The Lord
   grant that it may be so!

   IV. I finish, as the time has nearly gone, by introducing this man to
   you once more. We have had a soul beset, a soul bewildered and a soul
   fainting. But here is A SOUL PLEADING--"My iniquities have taken hold
   upon me, so that I am not able to look up...My heart fails me. Be
   pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me."

   "Oh!" says one, "I would plead with God, but I do not know how to go to
   Him." Do you not? Did you ever teach your girl how to come to you when
   she needed anything? She comes and she says, "Father, I need
   so-and-so." You do not send her to school, do you, and pay so much a
   week to teach her that art? No, she knows it naturally. If there is
   anything to be got out of a father, trust a boy or a girl for knowing
   how to do it! You smile. Let that smile go a little deeper. Smile
   again, if you like, that it may go right down deep. It is in this way
   that you should deal with God--just as your children, being evil, know
   how to ask good gifts of their father, so you should know how to ask
   good gifts ofyour Father who is in Heaven! And the more childlike you
   can be in your praying, the better.

   If your boy were to come in, tomorrow morning, and take out a prayer
   book and proceed to read the collect for the day in the same kind of
   tone that you can hear it read in certain churches, and then say in the
   same tone, "Father, I know that you are generous and noble-hearted--be
   pleased to give me the valuable present of five shillings," you would
   cry out, "Boy, hold your tongue, I cannot stand such nonsense!" But if
   he says, respectfully but earnestly, "Father, I shall be very grateful
   if you will give me five shillings, for there is such and such a thing
   that I want to buy," you say at once, "Yes, my boy, certainly. Here is
   the money." That is to say, if you have it and consider it wise. I do
   not think that God is to be approached in a dignified, stupid way, with
   intoned prayers and what Africans call, "palaver."

   Come to God in the simplest way possible and tell Him all that is in
   your heart. Pour out your desires before Him, expecting that He will
   hear you and answer you--and go your way rejoicing that you have such a
   God to go to! The easiest thing in the world to a child of God should
   be to talk to his Father. He should not feel as if he had to put his
   best coat on in order to approach the Lord. Let him stand out in the
   yard, in his shirtsleeves, and pray! Why not? Wherever you are, if you
   should wake up in the middle of the night, begin to pray! You would not
   think of going to see a person in your shirtsleeves, but your boy may
   come to you like that whenever he pleases.

   A person said to me, some time ago, "Would you mind telling me what to
   say when I pray? "I answered, Say what you feel. Ask God for what you
   desire." "But," she said, "I am such a poor ignorant woman that I would
   like you to tell me the words to say." Then I thought of the passage in
   Hosea, "Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto Him, Take
   away all iniquity, and receive us graciously." Thus, the very words
   were put into the suppliants' mouths and, in our text, David does, as
   it were, make a prayer that is suitable for many of you. May the Lord
   put it into your mouths and hearts!

   I will only briefly call attention to the drift of the prayer and,
   first, it is a prayer distinctly to God. This poor bewildered heart
   does not look to itself, or to a priest, or to a sacrament--it turns to
   God and to God, alone, and says, "Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me!
   O Jehovah, make haste to help me." Your only hope is in your God!
   Salvation must

   come from God alone. You know how I pictured this matter some little
   time ago, about the baby picked up in the street. There is somebody who
   is going to tell us what that baby needs. He needs some milk and he
   needs to be washed. And he needs some clothes. He also needs nursing
   and he needs soothing to sleep. He needs--well, we can go on for a week
   and hardly tell all that he needs. But I will put in one word what the
   baby needs, and that is, his mother. And you, poor Soul, you need--you
   need--you need--you need so many, many things that I will not stay to
   mention them! I will put them into one word--you need your God! Nobody
   but He who made you can ever new-make you! Therefore, as you need
   remaking, re-creating, you need your God! Oh, poor Prodigal, I know you
   need a new pair of boots and a new pair of trousers, and a good dinner
   and a great many other things--but most of all, you need to go home to
   your Father! And if you go home to your Father, then you will get all
   the other things that you need! Cry unto God, then, you who have never
   prayed before! May the Lord, the Holy Spirit, make you cry to your God
   in Christ Jesus!

   And then, do you notice the style of the prayer in our text? "Be
   pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me." It is an appeal to the good
   pleasure of God. There is no arguing of merit, there is no plea but
   that of God's good pleasure! He will have mercy on whom He will have
   mercy--and He will have compassion on whom He will have compassion!
   Divine Sovereignty is not to be denied! No man has any right to God's
   Grace--if it is given to anyone, it is by the free favor of God-- as He
   pleases and to whom He pleases! Shall He not do as He wills with His
   own? But you, as a suppliant, must take this lowly ground--"Be pleased,
   O Jehovah, to deliver me, for Your mercy's sake, for Your goodness'
   sake! Universal Ruler as You are and able to save whom You will, for
   the rights of life and death are in the hands of the King of Kings, be
   pleased, O Lord, to deliver me!" That is the way to plead with God.

   And then you may, if you like, use that last sentence--"Make haste, O
   Jehovah, to deliver me!" You may plead urgency--you may say, "Lord, if
   You do not help me, soon, I shall die. I am driven to such distress by
   my sin that if You do not hear me, soon, it will be too late!
   Innumerable evils have compassed me about, so that I am not able to
   look up. I am driven to such dire distress that my case is urgent; O
   Lord, help me now!" Oh, how I wish that such a prayer as that might go
   up from many and many a heart in this audience! You are not truly
   awakened to a sense of your lost condition if you want to be saved
   tomorrow. If you are really convicted of sin, your prayer will be,
   "Make haste, O Lord, to deliver me." I pray that you may be brought to
   that point, tonight, so that you may not dare to go to bed till you
   have found your God, or, if you must go to bed, may not be able to
   sleep till you have found your Savior and put your trust in Him!

   Dear Friends, may God save every one of you! Oh, how I would pour out
   my very soul in pleading with you if I thought that longer talk would
   lead you to Christ! But words are only air and wind. Eternal Spirit,
   Master of all hearts, come and deal with men and lead them to Jesus,
   now! And unto the Triune Jehovah shall be the glory forever and ever!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM40.

   To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

   If I were to read this Psalm all through as referring to Christ and to
   Christ, only, I would be correct in so doing, but still, there is such
   a unity between Christ and those who compose His mystical body that
   what is true of the Head is true of the members. What is true of the
   Vine is true of the branches. What is true of Christ is true of those
   who are in Him. Therefore, this Psalm relates to David as well as to
   "great David's greater Son," and it also concerns everyone who is of
   the royal seed, every true Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus the
   Psalm begins--

   1. I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard
   my cry. "I waited." "Do not beggars wait long at a fellow creature's
   door for some pitiful alms, and should not I be content to linger at
   Mercy's gate for such great gifts as I am craving? "I waited
   patiently." Well may we tarry in patience till Jehovah's time to help
   since we know that, "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord
   pities them that fear Him." And if He is full of pity, we can well
   afford to be patient. "I waited patiently for Jehovah." Those who have
   been most mighty in prayer have sometimes had to wait for the answers
   to their supplications. Do not expect the Lord to hear you today or
   tomorrow. He may hear you before you speak, according to His promise,
   "Before they call, I will answer," but He may, for the trial of your
   faith, make you wait. Are you able to wait? Then you are certain to
   receive a great blessing! "I waited patiently for the Lord, and He
   inclined

   unto me," bowed down out of Heaven, inclined unto me, stooped to me,
   thought well of me and also of my prayer, "and heard my cry."

   2. He brought me up, also, out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
   clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. This is a
   wonderful song, full of rapturous joy. You know how Orientals were
   accustomed to cast their prisoners into pits--and these pits were often
   horribly deep, dark and damp--and the mud at the bottom would be such
   that a man would sink in it. David sings of the Lord, "He brought me
   up, also, out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay." What a
   wonderful bringing up was this and, as God never does anything by
   halves, He did not let His servant slip back, again, for David added,
   "and set my feet upon a rock." "He set my feet." When God sets a man's
   feet, those feet are well set! There is no sliding, no slipping! The
   Lord set David's feet upon a rock and, more than that, established his
   goings-- made them firm, so that when he stirred he did not stumble.

   3. And He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God.
   Sing, then, Believer! You groaned often enough in the pit! Sing, now
   that you are on the rock! You were desolate enough in the dungeon.
   Sound aloud your grateful thanksgivings, now that your goings are
   established!

   3. Many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. There you
   have a picture of a sinner's conversion and its effects. The man sees
   the Lord's goodness to the child of God in distress. He fears--that is,
   he stands in awe of the great God--and then he, also, believes! He
   trusts in the Lord. One saint makes many! One child of God brought up
   out of the horrible pit leads to the bringing up of a great many others
   in the same way.

   4. Blessed is that man that makes the LORD his trust and respects not
   the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. If you trust in God, you
   will have no reverence for the proud, nor for those who turn aside from
   God's Word and teach falsehood. If you really fear God, you will have
   no fear of men.

   5. Many, O LORD my God, are Your wonderful works which You have done,
   and Your thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in
   order unto You: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more
   than can be numbered. The child of God, reviewing the Lord's great
   goodness, feels that he can never count the mercies of God to Him and,
   as to telling them out, that can never be! It will be, perhaps, a part
   of our eternal employment to tell angels, principalities and powers in
   the heavenly places, the story of the loving kindness of the Lord which
   we have experienced here below. If we had no troubles, we would have
   nothing to tell, but now that we are led in a strange way, and into
   very difficult places, we can write another page in our diary which
   will be worth reading in those days when fictions shall all have been
   consumed in the fire, but the great facts in the lives of the Lord's
   people shall make God to be admired in His saints forever and ever!

   6-8. Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; my ears have You
   opened: burnt offering and sin offering have You not required. Then
   said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I
   delight to do Your will, O my God: yes, Your Law is within my heart.
   Spoke I not truly when I said that the Christ of God is here? To whom
   is this passage one hundredth part so applicable as to the Lord Jesus,
   Himself? Does not Paul dwell upon this passage as teaching the putting
   aside of the old Covenant Law and the bringing in of something better,
   even the obedience of Christ, our Savior? However, this evening, I wish
   to read the Scripture in reference to the saints--the Lord's own
   people. I trust that many of us, seeing that God does not delight in
   ritualistic performances, or in the externals of religion as much as He
   does in the obedience of the heart, can come to Him and declare with
   David, "I delight to do Your will, O my God." Beloved Friends, you are
   not what you ought to be! You are not what you need to be. You are not
   what you shall be, but, tell me, are you ever happier than when you are
   consciously doing the will of God? Do you not find misery in sin and
   delight in holiness? If you can say that it is so with you, then you
   are bound for the Kingdom--you are on the way to complete victory over
   sin! Be of good cheer, He who has worked in you this same thing, to
   delight to do the will of God, will grant you Grace to do it! He will
   shortly bruise Satan under your feet and your inbred corruptions shall
   yet be uprooted by the Spirit of His Grace.

   9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have
   not refrained my lips, O LORD, You know. This is what Jesus can say. He
   was the Prince of open-air preachers--the Great Itinerant, the
   President of the College of all preachers of the Gospel--and I trust
   that many of us here can also say that, according to our ability and
   opportunity, we have tried to tell of Christ to those round about us.

   10. I have not hid Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared
   Your faithfulness and Your salvation: I have not concealed Your loving
   kindness and Your truth from the great congregation. If any of you have
   done so. If there has been a sinful reticence about the things of God.
   If, called to preach, you have not preached the full Gospel of God's
   Grace, the Lord forgive you and bring you out into a clear
   manifestation of what He has written within your hearts! We cannot tell
   what we do not know and we ought not to try to do so--but what was
   engraved in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, we are bound to tell to
   others. This gas was lighted that it might shine and you received the
   Divine Fire that you might shine to the Glory of God. It may be that,
   in some dark hour, it shall afford you at least a little comfort to be
   able to say, "I have preached righteousness in the great congregation:
   lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, You know. I have not hid Your
   righteousness within my heart, I have declared Your faithfulness and
   Your salvation." You may be able to use it as an argument in prayer, as
   the Psalmist does--"I have not concealed Your loving kindness and Your
   truth from the great congregation, therefore,"--

   11. Withhold not You Your tender mercies from me, O LORD: let Your
   loving kindness and Your truth continually preserve me. Depend upon it,
   God will take care of us if we take care of His Truth. If we, from
   cowardly reasons, keep back any part of the Gospel, God may leave us to
   defend ourselves. But if we conceal nothing that He has revealed to us.
   If we are faithful to the Truth committed to our charge--that Truth
   will, itself, preserve us--and we shall know more and more of the
   loving kindness of the Lord. But what a sad verse is the next one if it
   describes the experience of any of you who have known the Lord!

   12. For innumerable evils have compassed me about: my iniquities have
   taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more
   than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart fails me. If that is the
   condition of any whom I am addressing, be comforted by the remembrance
   that another has been along that dark road where you are now found!
   Follow his example in praying to the Lord to deliver You--

   13. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
   Thus did David cry unto the Lord "out of the depths." Imitate his
   example if you are in similar circumstances. Say with good John
   Ryland--

   "Out of the depths of doubt and fear, Depths of despair and grief, I
   cry; my voice, O Jesus, hear, And come to my relief!"

   14-16. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
   soul to destroy it. Let them be driven backward and put to shame that
   wish me evil. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say
   unto me, Aha, aha. Let all those that seek You rejoice and be glad in
   You. Here is comfort for all poor trembling seekers--they are only
   seekers, but let us thank God that they are seekers, and let us say
   with the Psalmist, "Let all those that seek You rejoice and be glad in
   You." All true Christians, those who have found Christ, are still
   seekers, for, after finding Christ, they inflame their souls to seek
   Him more and more! So that our prayer, also, is, "Let all those that
   seek You rejoice and be glad in You"

   16, 17. Let such as love Your salvation say continually, The LORD be
   magnified. But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinks upon me: You
   are my Help and my Deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God. The Lord
   bless to us the reading of this precious portion of His Word, for His
   name's sake! Amen.

Scarlet Sinners Pardoned and Purified

   (No. 2354)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 1, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 29, 1888,

   "Come, now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins
   are as scarlet, they shallbe as white as snow; though they are redlike
   crimson, theyshallbe as wool." Isaiah 1:18.

   THERE is a quarrel between man and his Maker. It is a sad thing that
   the creature should have fallen out with his Creator. It is a pitiful
   business that those who are dependent upon the bounty of God should
   have rebelled against the hand that has fed them, yet it is so. Man has
   turned aside from the way of God's Commandments--he will not submit to
   Jehovah's sway.

   Under such circumstances, it is an amazing instance of Divine
   Compassion that God should be willing to hold a conference with man. Of
   course the first person to ask for such a conference ought to have been
   the offending party. It is man who has offended, it is man who will
   have to suffer the consequence of his offenses. But, instead of man
   seeking God, and pleading with bitter tears, "Lord, pitifully hear me;
   graciously listen to me and forgive me!" It is God who comes seeking
   man--the offended One is first in the effort to make up the quarrel! It
   is He who says, "Come, now, and let us reason together." He proposes to
   confer with man about the question in dispute. Admire much the freeness
   of God's mercy, that, after you have transgressed against Him and
   provoked Him again and again, He still hesitates to hurl the
   thunderbolts of His Justice at you! Instead, thereof, He invites you to
   talk with Him as to the cause of your quarrel, to reason with Him about
   your war against your Maker.

   Surely, dear Friends, it would be a great joy to a man to hear that God
   invites him to a conference! He would take heart of hope from that
   fact. He would say, "If God had meant to destroy me, He would not have
   said, 'Come, now, and let us reason together.'" When the One who
   possesses all power and who could, in a single moment, crush those who
   have sinned against Him, yet says, "Come, let us talk this matter
   over," it must mean that He is moved by love and mercy. It must mean
   that there is yet hope for the guilty--an opportunity of man, the
   enemy--being reconciled to his offended

   God!

   I think it will be wisdom on our part, sinful creatures that we are, to
   accept the conference that God proposes. Anyhow, we cannot lose
   anything by it. If the Lord says, "Come, now, and let us reason
   together," He must have some design of love in it. Therefore, let us
   come and return to our God, and reason with Him. I would invite any man
   here who is at all desirous to be right with God, to begin to think
   about his God and about his own ways. Surely, it is high time with some
   of you that you should turn to Him whom you have so long provoked!
   There is His Book, for instance--do you read it? Does not the dust upon
   it witness against you? You do not think it worth while to know what
   God has revealed in His Word! You treat your Maker and your Friend as
   if His letters were not worth even an hour's reading! You leave them
   utterly neglected. Is this as it should be? If you want to get right
   with God, should not the first step be to obey that command, "Thus says
   the Lord of Hosts, consider your ways"? And should not the next step be
   obedience to that other word, "Acquaint, now, yourself with Him, and be
   at peace: thereby good shall come unto you"? I cannot see how it can be
   wise for a man to neglect his God and to despise what his Maker has to
   say to him. It must be wise for us to confer with the Lord about this
   matter. If, after the conference, we should come to a decision contrary
   to what is to be desired, yet we shall at least have given a fair
   consideration to the subject. Let us listen, then, to the gentle yet
   powerful voice of God, which says to us, "Come, now, and let us reason
   together, says the Lord."

   2 Scarlet Sinners Pardoned and Purified Sermon #2354

   You all know what the quarrel is about, for you heard the chapter read.
   You love sin--and God cannot and will not bless you until you have
   parted with it. The greatest blessing that God can give you is to part
   you and your sins. The salvation which we so freely proclaim is not, as
   some suppose, salvation at the last for those who continue in sin--it
   is deliverance from sin. The salvation which we continually preach, as
   the work of the Free Grace of God, is salvation from the reigning
   power, the raging lust of sin. Free pardon for all past offenses is
   presented to everyone who believes in Jesus, but the grand aim is to
   set you free from the love of evil and from taking any delight in sin.

   Now, evil is evil--that which is evil towards God is also evil towards
   yourself. It cannot work your happiness to do what is wrong. You may
   think it will, but God's judgment is clearer than yours, and His Laws
   may be viewed as plain directions as to how you can be happy. When He
   forbids you anything, it is simply a warning against that which is
   dangerous to your soul. He has denied us no pleasure which can be
   called a real pleasure. He has given to us everything that is truly
   good for our immortal spirits and, if we follow in the way that He maps
   out, it shall be not only for our eternal profit, but also for our
   present enjoyment.

   In effect, God says to us, "If you would meet with Me, you must be rid
   of sin, and I am prepared to help you, no, I am prepared to rid you of
   sin. If you desire to be free from it, My Holy Spirit has put that
   desire within your heart. And if you yield yourself up to Him, He will
   rid you of sin altogether, root and branch." So here begins the
   conference. The man enters into debate with God. I will suppose that he
   does so, tonight, and that his first declaration to God is, "My sins
   are as glaring as scarlet." "Well," replies the Lord, "I will take you
   on your own ground--I will admit that your sins are as scarlet; but I
   will so remove them that you shall be as white as snow." The man, next,
   says, "But if all my old sins were forgiven, yet my tendency to sin is
   deeply ingrained. I would sin again as I have sinned before. If I start
   anew with a clean book, I shall run into debt again as I did at the
   first." The Lord meets that statement, also, and He says, "Though the
   evil tendencies of your nature are red like crimson, they shall be as
   wool. I will get the stain out, I will restore the fabric to its
   original cleanliness, I will make the long-dyed crimson wool to be as
   pure as when it first grew upon the sheep's back."

   So God meets man in two ways--He meets him, first, by the perfect
   pardon of sin and next, by a clean deliverance from the power of sin.
   Of those two things I am going to talk, tonight, pretty plainly.

   I. And, first, I will suppose that I have before me someone who says,
   "MY SINS ARE AS GLARING AS SCARLET. How can I ever be the friend of God
   as my sins are so prominent? Some people's sins are of a drab
   color--you might not notice them. Other people's sins are a sort of
   whitey-brown--you would scarcely perceive them. But my sins are
   scar-let--that is a color that is at once observed. There is a
   strikingness about my sin. Nobody could miss it, the eyes are attracted
   and detained by it. My sins are as glaring as scarlet." Now, what sort
   of sins are those that may be called scarlet?

   I say, first, that they are the filthier vices. You do not expect me to
   go into a description of them. At times, the ear of the public has been
   astounded by revelations of the vice in this great city. It was done
   once till we were all sick and we are glad that it has not been done
   again. I pray God that it may not be. But the sin, itself, is a
   thousand times filthier than the exposure of it, and yet there are some
   hypocrites in the world who say, "What a disgusting paper!" while they,
   themselves, are guilty of the very vice which is laid bare there! It is
   the sin that is disgusting, not the account of it, although I admit
   that the recital of it is harrowing and painful. If you have been
   guilty of those sins of the body which destroy, not only yourself, but
   another, also--if, in the days of your youth, or in the riper years of
   your manhood or womanhood, you have polluted yourself by such
   vices--these are scarlet sins, such as will dog a man in his dying
   moments, and howl at him as he passes into the mystery of another
   world.

   I pray God that everyone here who has been guilty of such sins, may
   listen to this text--and we need not deceive ourselves about this
   matter--there are plenty in our streets, there are plenty in our places
   of worship who are thought to be very good and respectable people, who,
   nevertheless indulge in gross vice! The Lord have mercy upon them! It
   is even to such that the text says, tonight, "Come, now, and let us
   reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they
   shall be as white as snow." The fornicator, the adulterer, the
   whoremonger and such like--these have committed sins that are of a
   scarlet hue. I say no more about this point, but I mean that such
   sinners as these are invited to come to God and seek His mercy, for He
   will make them white as snow!

   There is another set of sins which are scarlet and these are the
   universally condemned sins--those sins which are offenses against the
   State and against the well-being and social order of the community,
   such as dishonesty, theft, embezzlement in all its forms, knavery,
   cheating, lying. Oh, dear Sirs, there are some who talk of white lies,
   but there are no

   lies that are white--they are scarlet--and they will sink a man to Hell
   if they are not confessed and forgiven! Every right-minded man is ready
   to condemn such sins as pride and over-bearing, such sins as
   ingratitude to parents and treachery to friends, such sins as breaking
   solemn covenants and sacred engagements where one ought to have been
   firmly held by them--all these are scarlet sins. Some of the forms of
   transgression, which I shall not describe in detail, are condemned by
   all civilized society and, therefore, they may certainly be called
   scarlet sins. If I speak to any here present who have been guilty of
   such sins, let each man wear the cap that fits him, but let him also
   hear this gracious Word of God, "Come, now, and let us reason together,
   says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet," and that point is
   admitted, "they shall be as white as snow."

   There is another set of sins that I would put down as scarlet because
   they are the louder defiances of God. Some men dare to contradict
   Scripture, to express their disbelief in it, no, to contradict God,
   Himself, even to express their disbelief in His existence and,
   disbelieving in God, they dare to laugh at His Providence, to judge His
   Words and to utter criticisms and sarcasms about the acts of the Host
   High! Now, these are scarlet sins. Let me once know that anything is of
   God, and I bow my head in deepest reverence. "No but, O man, who are
   you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that
   formed it, Why have you made me thus?" But there are plenty, nowadays,
   who seem to enter into the lists against Jehovah and begin to ask Him
   why He acts as He does, as if they were the very God of God and the
   Judge of the Most High! Now, these are committing scarlet sins, yet the
   Lord says, even to such sinners, that He will make them as white as
   snow and, in many cases, He has already done so.

   I felt great joy, yesterday, when I received a letter from one who is
   now an earnest servant of God, but who recalled the time, (over 30
   years ago, I think it was), when he was a secularist and a very bold
   denouncer of all religion. At that period, I was but a very young man
   in preaching and he showed special spite against me. He put my portrait
   in his window, with certain exceedingly biting and cutting remarks
   appended to it. But it happened that he came to London and he must
   needs go to hear the man who was the object of his ridicule--and that
   day, in the Surrey Music Hall, God met with him! I have scarcely heard
   of him since then, till yesterday, when I found that he was still
   walking in the faith, earnestly endeavoring to serve God with all his
   might so as to make amends, as far as lies in his power, for the evil
   he had done in years gone by! Glory be to God--He can bring in those
   who have gone furthest in rebellion against Him--and make them to be
   the very noblest defenders of the faith!

   I remember that John Bunyan said, in his day, that he had great hope
   for the next generation, and he gave a very curious reason for that
   hope. He said that there was no age in which there were so many
   blasphemers and blackguards as were then living and he reckoned that if
   God saved them, they would make the finest saints in the world and he,
   therefore, hoped that the next generation would be far ahead of any
   that ever had been before because that generation was so far behind in
   morality than any that had preceded it! God often takes the raw
   material of a great sinner and transforms him, by His Grace, into a
   great saint! Such a man loves much because he has had much forgiven.
   Scarlet sinners, then, are those God-defiers who will not have Him to
   reign over them--and who tell Him so to His face! These are they who,
   when they come to Christ, shall find that He will make them as white as
   snow.

   Scarlet sins, again, may consist in long-continued dissipations. I do
   not like drawing these terrible pictures, but I cannot help it if I am
   to be faithful. There are some men who, having the means, will go into
   sins from which the poor are happily preserved--drink and
   debauchery--followed up month after month and year after year. Sin is
   persevered in as though the men were resolved to be ruined, going over
   hedge and ditch to Hell, stopped, perhaps, for a moment, by an earnest
   address, but shaking off all good impressions with an awful
   determination to go on to their eternal destruction! We know some such
   who do not occasionally fall into sin, but who continue in it, whose
   life becomes, as far as they can make it, a series of rebellions
   against everything that is pure, true and right! Do I address any such
   young man or any such woman tonight? If so, you are a scarlet sinner
   and I commend to you this gracious text, "Come, now, and let us reason
   together, says the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow."

   This scarlet glaringness is also seen in repeated transgressions. When
   a man sins once and then abandons the sin, one does not think so much
   of it as of those who, having sinned once, sin again, and again, and
   again, and again, and again. Oh, that poor moth, it comes into my study
   and flies at my lamp! It has burnt its wings and it falls down. I
   endeavor to catch it, to put it away, but before I can reach it, up it
   flies again at the lamp! It has burnt itself worse, this time, it is in
   anguish with those scorched wings, but the moment that it can summon
   enough strength, it flies up again! And there are

   some people just like that, singed and burnt by their own iniquity, yet
   returning to it as the dog returns to his vomit, and the sow that was
   washed, to her wallowing in the mud. Now, a sinner cannot act like that
   without coloring his sin to a very high degree of scarlet and making it
   most offensive to God. Yet, if it is so with any of you, the Lord still
   bids you come to Him and He will make you white as snow!

   Once more, I think that the scarlet hue will be discovered in any act
   of sin which is distinctly deliberate. There are sins into which men
   are hurried by strong passions in a moment and these are grievous
   enough, but when a man will take a week, a month, or even longer to
   concoct some evil scheme, arranging all the details, laying traps,
   setting snares, spinning webs to effect an evil purpose, this is a
   scarlet sin! When the element of deliberation enters into sin, it
   becomes a crime of malice aforethought for which it is hard to find
   mercy. Yet I venture to say that if anyone here has been guilty of such
   a sin and it comes to his mind, just now, I would urge him to confess
   it and come to the Lord for forgiveness, for He says, "Though your sins
   are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." This is the top and
   bottom of the whole matter. O you scarlet Sinners, the greatness of
   your guilt need not keep you back from God! O you who have transgressed
   beyond all bearing and past all bounds, you may yet be forgiven! God is
   able to blot all your sin out in a moment, so that there shall be
   nothing in His Book against you and the scarlet shall become as white
   as snow!

   Do you want to know how this can be done? It is through the great
   atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, His Son, who, on Calvary's mountain,
   bore the wrath of God in our place that God might be able, with
   justice, to forgive the sins of all men who trust in Christ's
   Atonement. Understand, then, that is the method of making scarlet
   sinners as white as snow! The bleeding Savior and He, alone, performs
   this miracle of mercy! This is true--and if you will come and seek your
   God, confessing your sin and accepting the great Sacrifice of
   Christ--your scarlet sin shall cease to be and you shall become as
   white as snow!

   Oh, this is the best news that ever tongue had to tell! But when I get
   home, tonight, I shall lie abusing myself to think that I did not tell
   it better! I never tell out the story of Free Grace and dying love to
   my heart's content--the thought comes to me, afterwards, "Why did you
   not put it better? Why did you let those people come and go, and not
   speak more to their hearts?" Ah, dear Friends, I would do so if I knew
   how! But I have scarcely begun to learn to preach, yet, as I want to!
   Still, I do tell this old, old story to you great sinners, you crimson
   sinners--if you trust Jesus, your sins shall not damn you! If you come
   to Christ, your sins shall be all put away forever! It is your
   unbelief, your staying away from God, your continuance in sin that will
   destroy you--but not the greatness of your guilt--for the Lord is
   willing to blot out your sins like a cloud, and to do it now, if you
   will only trust His dear Son!

   II. But I must not forget that there is a second difficulty. The man of
   whom I first spoke, also says, "ANY TENDENCY TO SIN IS DEEPLY
   INGRAINED."

   He says, "If all my scarlet sins were forgiven, yet I am afraid I would
   not be all right, even then." Why not? "Because," he says, "I feel
   impulses within me towards evil which, I think, are stronger than in
   anybody else." Well, Friend, I will take you on your own ground. I
   believe that there are some persons who have a greater hereditary
   tendency to some sins than others have. It is unquestionably true that
   the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children to the third and
   fourth generation. Anybody who studies human nature cannot help
   discovering that the child of the drunk has a greater tendency to drink
   than the child of the sober man. And children born as the result of
   lust are more inclined to that vice than others who are the offspring
   of virtuous, godly people. It is no doubt so, but what I have to say to
   you is that if you have sprung from an ancestry of drunks, if right
   straight up you cannot find a good man in all your pedigree, still,
   though your sins are red like crimson, they shall be as wool!

   God knows how to effect this transformation by the working of the Holy
   Spirit. Is that a new word to you? Well, then, let me remind you that
   the Holy Spirit is the third glorious Person of the blessed Trinity in
   Unity. And the Holy Spirit can come and remove from you the taint of
   heredity so that you shall be able to overcome this special tendency of
   yours--and you shall be preserved from those sins which run in your
   blood, which are in your constitution through your birth. God can help
   you! He that made the watch can mend it. He that made you, can set you
   right, again! You are still within the reach of Divine Omnipotence,
   whoever your father or your mother may have been! I take you on your
   own ground, not discussing the question with you for a moment.

   "Oh!" says another, "I would not mind about hereditary tendencies, but
   my difficulty is that I have been habitually committing sin." And oh, I
   admit, my dear Brothers and Sisters, that it is an awful thing to get
   caught in the meshes of an

   evil habit! When you first sin, or after you have sinned a few times,
   it is like a cobweb all around you and you cannot easily get clear of
   it. That cobweb soon comes to be a net and it is not easy to cut your
   way out of it and, after a time, the cords become bands of iron and
   steel--and what are you to do, then? How can you break loose from such
   chains? The habitual drunk--how shall he tear himself away from the cup
   that is ruining him? The man who has fallen into vicious habits, "Can
   the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?" If so, then
   he that is accustomed to do evil may learn to do well. But the Holy
   Spirit will help you to break off every sinful habit at once. I have
   known Him do it with many. I have especially noticed this--that
   swearers, and it is somewhat curious to note this fact, men who had for
   years never spoken without an oath--when they have been converted, from
   that moment they have never been tempted to utter an oath during the
   rest of life, such clean riddance can the Holy Spirit make of that
   habit! Some other sins cleave to a man and make their presence felt, at
   times, but when the Holy Spirit comes in, He drives out these old
   habits and forms new ones. "The expulsive power of a new affection" is
   very great--and when the Spirit of God puts the love of Christ into the
   soul in the place of the love of sin--that new affection drives out the
   old habits and the man is set free, even, from sins in which he has
   long indulged!

   You know that scarlet and crimson are colors very hard to get out of
   any fabric. Neither the dew, nor the rain, nor any ordinary processes
   of bleaching will get out the scarlet. I have heard that certain old
   rags cannot be used for anything except making red blotting paper
   because you cannot get out the color which the material takes in--and
   as to anything crimson, you might destroy the fabric before you could
   possibly extract the dye. But God knows how, without destroying the
   fabric, to take out 50 years of crimson habits and not leave a stain
   behind! He can make you perfectly pure and clean! He can make you a new
   man--your flesh shall be as the flesh of a little child--I mean that
   your whole conduct will prove that you have been born again!

   I heard a third person say, "But, my dear Sir, the trouble with me is
   that I have such feeble mental resistance to evil. I am so weak, such a
   poor fool." Well, you are not much of a fool if you know you are! The
   biggest fools are those who never know that they are fools. Still,
   there are people of this kind. I will try to describe you. You really
   are not altogether a bad sort of fellow and when you are convinced that
   a thing is wrong, you feel very sorry, and you say to yourself, "I will
   give that up." But there is a certain individual who has a kind of key
   that fits you and whenever he comes this way, he winds you up just as
   he likes. I do not know who the individual is. Perhaps it is a, "she,"
   not a, "he," but, whoever it is, he or she can turn you any way. You
   are such a silly sort of person that if two or three people come round
   you and try to get you to do what is wrong, you cannot say, "No," to
   them. You have not learned that little word yet! Your mother did not
   teach it to you and your schoolmaster did not teach it to you and, I am
   afraid that I cannot teach you to say,

   "No," either.

   It is a very difficult word for some people to utter. They say,
   "N-n-n," and it ends in--"Yes." The power to say, "No," is a mighty
   power, and it is an awful thing when a man has fallen into ways of sin,
   when he is weak and irresolute, and somebody twists him whichever way
   he pleases. Now, dear Friend, if you will come and reason with God, and
   yield yourself to the power of the Holy Spirit, as I pray you may, He
   will put a backbone into you. He will make you resolute and firm. I
   have known some young men who at first quite pained me with their lack
   of resolution, but who, by the Grace of God, have become almost
   doggedly obstinate. Oh, what grand old Puritans some men have made who
   once had no will of their own! We want the Lord, nowadays, to make a
   lot of people with backbones--very few of that kind have appeared,
   lately, but He can make them, by His Grace. Oh, you molluscous young
   fellow, you who have no more strength in you than a snail out of its
   shell, God's Grace can make a real man of you and you shall know the
   Truth of God--and the Truth shall make you free, and you shall be able
   to stand up and say, "No," and you will even--

   "Dare to be a Daniel!

   Dare to stand alone!

   Dare to ha ve a purpose firm!

   Dare to make it known!" God will help you to do even that if you yield
   yourself to Him.

   Still, perhaps I have not quite hit the nail on the head with all of
   you. Some are entangled by their circumstances. A man says, "You do not
   know me, Sir, or else you would not think that the Grace of God could
   save me. In my trade, my business, my position in life, I am dreadfully
   entangled. I do not know how I am to get out of it. I am in such a
   position that I must earn my bread. You know, Sir, we must live." I
   never was very clear about that statement, but this person

   says, "We must live and I am in such a predicament that I do not know
   what to do. I know I ought not to be in such a position, but I cannot
   get free from it." No, my Friend, but God's Grace can deliver you. Oh,
   I have seen, in this House of Prayer, some glorious instances that I
   hardly dare to tell! I know one whom the Lord saved who was engaged in
   a business which I could not but regard as altogether destructive to
   the souls of men and women! He said that he could not see how to get
   out of it, yet he did get out of it! He suffered bravely and, at this
   moment I can say that he is in a much better position than he was in,
   then. And if he had kept on with the other business, I believe he would
   have been ruined body and soul and that he would also have ruined
   thousands of others. There is nothing like making up your mind that you
   are coming right straight out from everything that is wrong, let it
   cost whatever it may! "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the
   whole world and lose his own soul? "The ship is going down, and if your
   little boat is tied to it, you will go down, too." Up with the axe and
   cut the rope! When God, by His Grace, helps you to act thus, as He can
   and will, the entanglement of your circumstances will be over! I do not
   know the particular case to which I am alluding just now. I often speak
   of things which God knows more about than I do, and somebody is here to
   whom this is a message from Him. Come out, come out, at all costs! Flee
   from Sodom, leave everything, look not behind you, stay not in all the
   plain, escape to the mountain, lest you are consumed!

   I think that I hear another say, "But I am a man of such strong
   passions." Yes, there are wild beasts about in the form of men and,
   every now and then, we come across a man with a terrible temper. He
   means well, dear Soul. He is always very sorry after he has had an
   outburst. Sometimes he says, "Well, I boil over, you know, Sir, but it
   is all over in a minute." Yes, but if you scald somebody, the effect of
   that scalding will not be all over in a minute. "Ah," said a certain
   Scotch lord to his servant, "You see, Sandy, I am never in a bad temper
   but what I am soon right again." "Yes!" said the servant, "and you are
   never right, again, but you are soon in another bad temper!" Well, that
   is an evil thing which has to be conquered. You cannot carry such a
   temper as that into Heaven. What would they do with you, there, with
   such fiery passions? They must be gotten rid of and I do not know of
   any surgical operation that can do it--you will have to be born
   again--that is the only real cure!

   Then there are some other individuals who appear to be going on all
   right for months when an awful wind seems to blow through their souls
   and off they go into drinking, or into some other dreadful sin--and
   they say that it is all owing to their strong passions. Well, you
   cannot take those passions to Heaven, can you? You will have to get rid
   of them if you are ever to enter there! And I know of no remedy for
   this evil but being born again. Remember this text, "As many as
   received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to
   them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of
   the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."

   "Do you believe in the doctrine of original sin?" asks one. Yes, I do!
   It is about the only original thing some people have and they have a
   large quantity of that. Yes, yes, it is so, alas! There is in us all
   the tendency to sin, the bias towards evil, and though I have been
   drawing distinctions, I must come back to this point--

   "Like sheep we went astray, And broke the fold of God, Each wandering
   in a different way, But all the downward road."

   Now, there is no help against original sin but Almighty Grace, and
   there is no way of having Almighty Grace except through the free gift
   of God! This He may give as He pleases, for He has a right to bestow it
   or to withhold it, but He promises to give it to all who come humbly
   confessing their sin and casting themselves, by faith, upon Jesus
   Christ, His

   Son.

   Thus, you see, I have shown you that the guilt of sin can be put away
   by the blood of Jesus, and the power of sin can be subdued by the Holy
   Spirit. Every provision is made for the salvation of the man who
   desires to be saved. Come then, and hear how God has met your
   difficulties--"Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white
   as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool." God
   bless you all, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Isaiah 11-20.

   May we be instructed of the Holy Spirit while we read this Inspired
   Scripture!

   Verse 1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw--Prophets
   were called seers--they saw what they were called to say and every true
   preacher of Christ must first be a seer of Christ. He must see, that
   is, realize for himself, and then he must tell others what he has seen.
   This Book is about "the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw"

   1, 2. Concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,
   Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O
   earth, for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up
   children and they have rebelled against Me. It is an appeal of God to
   inanimate creation to bear witness to the ingratitude that He had
   received, as if it were of no longer any use to speak to men. The
   appeal is stated very solemnly and impressively, "Hear, O heavens, and
   give ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken. I have nourished and
   brought up children," cared for them, loved them, fed them, "and they
   have rebelled against Me." The ingratitude of a child is something
   shocking--and the ingratitude of man to God is of that character.

   3. The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel
   does not know, My people do not consider. Men are more brutish than the
   beasts that perish! The lower animals, as men contemptuously call them,
   acknowledge the hand that feeds them, but men receive the bounty of God
   through long years and yet live as if there were no God at all--they
   feel no gratitude to Him whatever. Israel was God's peculiar people,
   highly favored and greatly indulged--and this made it all the worse for
   the Lord to be able to contrast them and the brute creation. "The ox
   knows his owner and the ass his master's crib, but Israel does not
   know, My people do not consider."

   4. Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers,
   children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have
   provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away
   backward. Thus the Prophet spoke to the people of his day and we may
   say much the same to the people of our own time. The professing Church
   of God has gone away backward, forsaken the Doctrines of the Truth of
   God and turned aside from the purity of its life. God have mercy upon
   the world when the Church, itself, becomes thus defiled!

   5. Why should you be stricken any more? What is the use of chastisement
   to such people? It is supposed that punishment is always healthy and
   that we grow the better for it, but God says, "Why should you be
   stricken any more?"

   5, 6. You will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick and the
   whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot, even unto the head there
   is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises and putrefying sores:
   they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with
   ointment. The nation had been so beaten that it was covered all over
   with bruises and sores. It seemed to be of no use to afflict Israel any
   more--and there are some persons in the world who have been chastened
   in every conceivable way and yet they are none the better. There are
   graves in the cemetery where those they love lie asleep. The house that
   was their joy has long ago been sold and they have not a roof to call
   their own. They have seen themselves at death's door by fever and by
   other diseases and yet all that God's rod has done for them has come to
   nothing. The old Roman lictors carried an axe bound up in a bundle of
   rods and, when the rods had been tried, and had failed, then came the
   axe. And if the milder forms of chastisement do not bring men to
   repentance, sooner or later will come the axe of destruction! Thus the
   Prophet says it was with sinful Israel--

   7, 8. Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your
   land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as
   overthrown by strangers. And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage
   in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
   The land had been so harried and worried by invaders that it was little
   better than a poor shanty--the nation was comparable to a poor hut
   which the Arabs put up in the vineyard to sleep in--"As a lodge in a
   garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city."

   9. Except the LORD of Hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we
   should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
   And this is true of London as well as of Jerusalem! If there had not
   been a remnant of godly ones still left, "we should have been as Sodom,
   and we should have been like unto Gomorrah."

   10, 11. Hear the Word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
   the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah. To what purpose is the
   multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? says the LORD: I am full of the
   burnt offerings of rams, and the fat offed beasts; and I delight not in
   the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. These people were a
   very religious people, although a very wicked people. It is a strange
   thing when nations have become demoralized and injustice reigns supreme
   at the same time--ritualism and outward pomp and external religion come
   to the front. This is a wretched business, to give God the husks when
   the kernel has long ago gone. What cares the Lord for "burnt offerings
   of rams, and the fat of fed beasts.. .the blood of bullocks, or of
   lambs, or of he goats," when men have left off doing that which is
   right in

   His sight? The Lord may well say to those who bring offerings to Him
   under such circumstances, "To what purpose is the multitude of your
   sacrifices unto Me?"

   12. When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your
   hands, to tread My courts? "Who invited you to come to My courts?" asks
   God. "Who asked you to pretend to worship Me, when you are living in
   sin and your hearts are not reconciled to Me?"

   13. Bring no more vain oblations, incense is an abomination unto Me.
   The new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure
   iniquity and the solemn meeting. If you are hypocrites. If your hearts
   are not right with God you may multiply your Church attendance and your
   Chapel attendance and your sacraments, but all these are only a
   provoking of God to anger! There is nothing in it all that He could
   possibly accept--He cannot endure it! He says, "I cannot endure
   iniquity and the solemn meeting."

   14. 15. Your new moons and your appointed feasts My Soul hates: they
   are a trouble unto Me, I am weary to bear them. And when you spread
   forth your hands, I will hide My eyes from you: yes, when you make many
   prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. This is plain
   speaking, but God never sends velvet-tongued men as His messengers.
   They who are called to testify for God speak out boldly--and faithfully
   denounce the sins of the day in which they live. Blessed be God for
   Isaiah and for men like he! When men are committing crimes, when they
   are oppressing the poor, when they are living in the daily practice of
   injustice, when they indulge in secret drunkenness, when their whole
   life is a lie, they may do what they will, but God will not hear their
   prayers! While we keep sin in our hearts, it is in vain for us to
   stretch out our hands unto God. He is a holy God and He seeks holy
   hearts and holy lives--nothing short of these can be acceptable to Him.

   16, 17. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
   before My eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment,
   relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. This
   is what God asks for--"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the
   Father is this--To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
   and to keep oneself unspotted from the world"

   18-20. Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your
   sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow, though they are
   red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If you are willing and
   obedient, you shall eat the good of the land: but if you refuse and
   rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD
   has spoken it. May the Holy Spirit make us willing and obedient that we
   may "eat the good of the land." And may none of us be found refusing
   God's gracious invitation and rebelling against His authority--lest we
   perish in our sins!

Christ's Negative and Positive Prayer

   (No. 2355)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 8, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 5, 1888.

   "I pray not that You should take them out of the world, but that You
   should keep them from evil." John 17:15.

   NOTICE, in the prayer of our Divine Lord, what honor He always puts
   upon God the Father. He ascribes to God everything--the taking the
   disciples out of the world, or the keeping them from the evil in the
   world. Let us never neglect to look for God's hand in all that happens
   to the saints and let us not fall into the error of those who deny the
   Great First Cause and are always dealing with appearances, forgetting
   the Mighty God who shapes our ends and rules our destinies. If we die,
   it is not by chance, but because God takes us out of the world.
   Believers fall asleep in Jesus, neither before nor after the
   predestined time. No disease or accident can cut short their lives and
   it would not be possible to prolong their existence beyond the time
   appointed by the Lord. I like to believe--whatever it may be to some of
   you, to me it is very sweet to believe that--

   "All must come, and last, and end, As shall please my heavenly Friend.
   Plagues and deaths around me fly, Till He bids, I cannot die! Not a
   single shaft can hit Till the God of Love thinks fit." Our lives are
   entirely in the keeping of our loving Father. You can see that Truth of
   God in the text. Jesus speaks of God as taking the beloved ones out of
   the world and it is even so. This fact should make us cease to be
   anxious about when or how we shall die and it should, at the same time,
   reconcile us to the time and the manner of the going Home of any whom
   we love most dearly. They were not snatched away by the robber,
   Death--they were taken out of the world by our dear Father's gracious
   hand! Let us say concerning them what Job said of his loved ones, "The
   Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the
   Lord."

   See, also, how our Lord Jesus honors the Father by ascribing to Him the
   keeping of the saints from evil, for He says, "I pray not that You
   should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from
   evil." Beloved, our escape from evil, at the first, was by the Father's
   Grace. Our persevering in righteousness until now has been worked in us
   by the Father's hand, through the Divine Spirit and, this day, if we
   have not apostatized--if we have not denied the faith and proved
   traitors to Christ--we must ascribe it entirely to the Grace of God! As
   the Psalmist says, "It is He that has made us, and not we, ourselves,"
   and it is He who keeps us, and not we, ourselves, for, again quoting
   the 100th Psalm, "We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture."

   I want you, as far as you possibly can, to be constantly recognizing
   God's overruling hand--God, in our death, taking us out of the world,
   and God, in our life, keeping us from evil, and upholding us in our
   integrity. When you get thus near to God and realize that God is always
   present with you, you are in the right frame of mind for prayer. You
   are also in the state and condition of heart which will give you
   courage in time of danger--you are, indeed, ready for anything and for
   everything, whatever may come to you, when God is thus consciously
   overshadowing your spirit. This much, I think, the prayer of our Lord
   plainly suggests.

   Observe, again, that God has us absolutely at His disposal. Let us
   always remember that great Truth. The prayer of Jesus recognizes His
   Father's Sovereignty, but, we, ourselves, must also recognize that we
   are entirely in God's hands. He can take us out of the world, or He can
   keep us in the world and preserve us from evil. We are glad to be at
   the disposal of our God! As His people, we would have no voice or
   choice in fixing our own position, but with the Psalmist we would say,
   "He shall choose our inheritance for us." Whether we stay, or whether
   we go, depends entirely upon the Lord's will and Christ, in His prayer,
   recognizes that it is so. He would not pray for a matter which was not
   in the hands of Him to whom He prayed. He felt that His people were
   absolutely at His Father's disposal and, therefore, He presented the
   prayer which is to be the subject of our meditation tonight.

   Now, in this petition, there are two things. There is, first, the
   negative prayer-- "I pray not that You should take them out of the
   world." And then, secondly, there is the positive prayer-- "But that
   You should keep them from evil." I. There is here, first, THE NEGATIVE
   PRAYER--"I pray not that you should take them out of the world." At
   first sight, that seems almost unkind on our Savior's part. What could
   happen better than for those whom the world hated to be taken out of
   the world? Jesus, Himself, was going out of the world--what could He do
   that should have greater love in it than to pray that they might go
   with Him? I have often felt as Thomas did when he said, "Let us, also,
   go, that we may die with Him." Has Jesus gone? Why should we tarry
   here? Has Jesus entered Glory? Let us be with Him where He is, that we
   may behold His Glory. There is nothing left to detain us below since He
   has ascended to His Father's right hand--but there is everything to
   attract us upward since He is there who is our heart's Lord, our All in
   All! Have you not often felt inclined to pray for yourself that the
   Lord would take you out of the world? I mean, not merely in times of
   depression, when, like Elijah, who never died, you are ready to pray,
   "Now, O Lord, take away my life," but in times of exultation, when you
   have been near to the gates of Heaven in ecstatic joy and holy
   gladness--have you not wished to slip in? "Lord, it is good for us to
   be here: if You will, let us make here three tabernacles." Have you not
   said so in your heart, if not with your voice? No, have you not wished,
   not to stay on the Mount of Transfiguration, but from that point to
   take your heavenward flight and land yourself in the New Jerusalem, to
   go no more out forever? I know that, sometimes, on a Sabbath, when we
   have been singing, to the tune Prospect--

   "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,

   And cast a wishful eye

   To Canaan's fair and happy land,

   Where my possessions lie," I have felt that I could, from my heart,
   sing the last verse of the hymn--

   "Filled with delight, my raptured soul

   Can here no longer stay.

   Though Jordan's waves around me roll,

   Fearless I'd launch away."

   Yet the Savior says, "I pray not that You should take them out of the
   world." I am sure, therefore, that it is a better thing for us to stay
   here till our appointed time than it is for us to be taken out of the
   world. It may not be better in all respects, but there are some points
   in which it is an advantage for Believers to remain here. Our Savior
   loves us so much that He would be certain to ask the very best thing
   for us. Therefore, for us to be taken out of the world at once, would
   not be, all things considered, the best disposition of us that the Lord
   could make.

   How is that? Well, first, if we, who are Christ's people, were taken
   out of the world, then the world, itself, could perish. Do we
   contemplate, with any pleasure, such a catastrophe as that? "You are
   the light of the world." Take all the lights away and the murky
   atmosphere, which is dark enough, even now, would become dense as
   Egyptian midnight-- and life would be intolerable. "You are the salt of
   the earth." Should the salt be taken away, putrefaction would revel
   without limit--corruption would then have nothing to contend with it
   and the world would reek in the nostrils of God, Himself, till He would
   be obliged to destroy it!

   I look along the ages and I see mankind given up to debauchery and
   eaten up with worldliness, yet the sinners are permitted to live on
   year after year. But I also see a strange-looking ship that has been
   built on dry land and I watch the only family on the earth that fears
   God, going up into that strange-shaped vessel, and the door is shut by
   God, Himself! I hear it as it closes and the moment that door is shut,
   what happens? The world is doomed! God pulls up the sluices of the
   great deep that lies under and He throws open the floodgates of
   Heaven--the fountains gush up from below and the rains pour down from
   above till the whole world is drowned! This awful judgment did not
   begin till Noah, the one righteous man, was taken away from the rest of
   mankind and shut in the ark--"The same day were all the fountains of
   the great deep broken up, and the windows of Heaven were opened. And
   the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty

   nights. In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
   the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of His sons with
   them, into the ark."

   I look again, and away yonder, I behold, in the vale of Siddim, the
   cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. If I go within their gates, I hear and
   see that which disgusts my soul. Things that it were a shame even to
   speak of, are done in those cities! There is one good man who lives
   there, and only one. And I see him, early one morning, fleeing with his
   wife and daughters out of the city. The moment he has passed beyond the
   bounds of the condemned cities and escaped to little Zoar, what
   happens? Destruction is poured out of Heaven upon the guilty
   people--"The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
   Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
   from the Lord out of Heaven and He overthrew those cities, all the
   plain, all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the
   ground."

   Because we do not wish such awful destruction as that, either by water
   or by fire, to fall upon this guilty world, we ask God to permit the
   salt to remain in the earth, the light to still burn in it, the Noah to
   still linger, the Lot to still dwell here yet a little while. When the
   Lord shall begin rapidly to gather His saints Home, as He may do,
   by-and-by, and when the wail is heard, "The faithful fail from among
   the children of men," then shall come dark days, indeed, and the earth
   shall know the terrible vengeance of Almighty God!

   This, then, is one reason why Christ does not pray that we should be
   taken out of the world--because it would be the ruin of guilty men if
   the saints were removed from the earth which is only preserved for
   their sake.

   Does not the Lord also wish the righteous to stay in the world a while
   that they may be the means of the salvation of others? How came Jesus
   here, Himself? He came to seek and to save that which was lost and when
   He went away, He did not take His disciples out of the world because
   their ministry was to be blessed to many of their fellow creatures. In
   this very prayer to His Father, He said, "As You have sent Me into the
   world, even so have I also sent them into the world." They who might be
   safely housed in Heaven stay here that they may be the means of saving
   others. Mother is still here, though her son has well-near broken her
   heart. She is left on the earth that she may yet win that boy for
   Christ. And our old gray-headed friend, whose infirmities are
   multiplying, is still among us though he would be far happier among the
   harps of angels--but he is detained here that his grandson, or his
   still unconverted daughter may hear from his lips, once more, a loving,
   living testimony for the Lord Jesus and may, thereby be turned to God.

   I think that there are many of you who do not, yourselves, love the
   Lord, who, nevertheless, ought to be very grateful to Him for saying,
   "I pray not that You should take them out of the world." Oh, dear man,
   you do not want to lose that loving wife of yours! She has brought you
   here, tonight, after a good deal of coaxing and tender persuasion. You
   do not think of her God, or care about the Lord Jesus, but your wife is
   still living to seek the salvation of your soul! I believe she will win
   you, yet, by God's Grace! There are many who might, long ago, have
   received their reward and would have been thrice happy to do so, but
   they have yet to preach the everlasting Gospel and yet to win more
   souls to Christ! It is more necessary for sinners that Paul should
   abide in the flesh a little longer, though he, himself, has a desire to
   depart and to be with Christ, which is far better!

   Beloved Christian Brothers and Sisters, if the Lord is keeping any of
   us here with the objective of using us in the salvation of others, let
   us take care that we answer the purpose of our continued existence on
   the earth--let us be up and doing! Let us be earnestly seeking the
   souls of our relatives! Let us be zealously endeavoring to bring others
   to Christ! I am sometimes saddened when I hear of households conducted
   by professedly Christian people--places where one would think that
   God's name would be upon every tongue--and yet servants may live for
   years in such families and their masters and mistresses never speak to
   them about their souls! And many men, employing hundreds of people,
   will give them their wages as if they had no souls to care about, for
   they take no interest in the eternal welfare of those who work for them
   in temporal things! Do not let it be so with you, dear Friends! Masters
   and mistresses, there are occasions in which you can go to your
   servants and those employed by you and, without being at all intrusive,
   can seek to interest them in the things of God! You can call at their
   homes, perhaps, and the offering of a prayer and speaking to them about
   the Gospel of Christ may reach them, and bring them to the Savior,
   where our sermons have failed to do so. I charge you, by Him who bought
   you by His blood, either go to Heaven and glorify Christ, there, or
   else, if you remain in the world, glorify Him here! But whether you
   live, or whether you die, see to this matter, that you answer the
   Divine purpose, which is that being saved, yourself, you may become the
   means of saving others.

   There is a second reason, then, for our Lord wishing His disciples to
   stay here, that they may be the means of the salvation of others.

   Next, I think the Lord lets His people stay in the world that they may
   serve Him in the place where they sinned against Him. If I had been
   converted just now, and the Lord were to open the gates of Heaven and
   say, "Come in," I think that I would step back and say, "Dear Master,
   may I stay here just a little while to undo some of the mischief that I
   did in my ungodly state?" I can fancy that someone here would pray,
   "Lord, there is my friend who used to go to the theater and the
   music-hall with me, and I taught him much that was mischievous. Will it
   please You to let me tarry here and tell him about Your great
   salvation?" I think that another would say, "Lord, I spent so many
   years in the service of Satan. Now, before I go Home to see Your face,
   let me have a few years in Your service! I would like to undo, by Your
   Grace, at least a portion of the evil that I have done before I stand
   in Your Presence amid the eternal splendors of Heaven." It seems to me
   that it is most gracious of the Lord to let us remain here to serve Him
   where we sinned against Him, and not to take us Home as soon as we are
   converted. I think that we shall congratulate ourselves, even in
   Heaven, that we had some opportunity of contending for the faith, or of
   bearing reproach for Christ's sake, or of seeking to win souls for Him
   before we entered upon our everlasting rest.

   Is not that a good reason why the Savior did not pray that His
   disciples might be taken out of the world?

   And is not this another good reason why saints are left in the world?
   The Lord keeps His people here that He may exhibit in them the power of
   Divine Grace. Just as He permitted Job to be tempted by the devil, that
   all the world might see how God can enable a man, by patience, to
   triumph, so He keeps us here to let the devil and all men know what His
   Grace can do for His people and, also, to let angels and principalities
   and powers in the heavenly places behold what saints God can make out
   of guilty sinners! He takes those who had gone far away in sin and
   brings them near by the blood of Jesus! He fashions the rough, knotty
   timber that did not seem as if it could ever be shaped, and uses it in
   the building of His Temple. He makes wonders of Grace out of sinful men
   and women--such marvels of mercy that the angels will stand and gaze at
   them throughout eternity, as they say, "How could God make such perfect
   beings as these out of such sinful material?"

   All this will be "to the praise of the Glory of His Grace, wherein He
   has made us accepted in the Beloved." You see, we cannot exhibit
   patience in Heaven. So far as we now know anything about Heaven, it
   does not seem possible that there will be any need of patience there.
   We cannot manifest strength of faith in Heaven, for faith will be lost
   in sight. We can take our love into Glory--there are some flowers that
   will sweetly open in the land where they have no need of the sun, for
   Christ is better than the sun! There are certain flowers of less sweet
   perfume and those can only be developed in the earth and the Lord,
   therefore, bids us tarry here a while, that He may show what Grace can
   do in sustaining us in suffering, upholding us under trials and
   protecting us against temptation. O soldiers of the Cross, do You want
   crowns without having contended for them?--

   "Must You be carried to the skies On flowery beds of ease, While others
   fought to win the prize And sailed through bloody seas.9" Ask no such
   thing! Be satisfied to take your share in the conflict, or else I do
   not see how you can so sweetly relish the triumph which God will give
   to His people in due time.

   Thus, the Lord exhibits the power of His Grace in us and that is
   another reason why we have to tarry here a while.

   Next, I shall have to say many things very briefly where I could have
   wished to have had time for enlargement. Do you not think that we are
   kept here to prepare us for Heaven? Are we not as yet like children who
   need education for that truer, higher life? When a boy first goes to
   school, you do not put into his hands the higher classics. He must plod
   through his grammar. He must learn many elementary lessons and then he
   must work hard on dry and dreary roots. And afterwards you will give
   him some classic poet that he may read intelligently. So must you and
   I, here below, go plodding throughout primers. We must work hard at our
   grammars. We must still have a slate and pencil and when we have become
   proficient in all, we have to learn, here, so that we shall the better
   enjoy the holy rest and perfect service which make up the Heaven of the
   blessed.

   Let me give you an illustration of what I mean. A boy is sent to school
   and his parents pinch themselves to pay for him to have a good
   education. It is not every boy who will say this to himself, but if he
   does, he is a first-rate lad--"My

   poor father and mother are doing all they can to give me a first-class
   education here. They want to make something of me and I am going to
   learn with all my heart, so that I may be worthy of all that my parents
   design for me, and not waste one single shilling of the money they are
   spending upon me." Such a boy is diligent at his books. He labors where
   others loiter and treasures up in his mind everything that he learns
   while others forget it. Now the Lord Jesus Christ is thus putting some
   of us to school, training us for high employment hereafter! He means to
   make something of us, by-and-by, and our desire, now, is to be
   prepared, as far as possible, for what Christ intends for us, that we
   may be the more to His praise and glory--and our own completeness
   forever and ever.

   I have often been puzzled by those words of the Lord Jesus, "I go to
   prepare a place for you." What there was about Heaven that was not
   ready, I do not know, except it was that Jesus, Himself, was not there.
   But I can easily understand this truth, that we are not ready for
   Heaven yet, for Heaven consists more in character than in place. We
   have to be more completely sanctified, more truly developed in all good
   things than we are at present. We are not yet fit for Glory, so Jesus
   does not pray that we should be taken out of the world, but we are to
   wait, here, a little longer till His Grace has more fully fitted us for
   Glory.

   Does not the Lord, also, by keeping us here, mean us to see more of the
   wisdom, the power, the Grace, and the Truth of God? Within this last
   month--a month of remarkable pain and travail for me--I have had
   certain experiences which I shall never forget! But I would pass
   through seas ten times as deep and boisterous, merely for the sake of
   having those experiences repeated! There are some of them which I could
   not tell, here. There are facts connected with them that would be
   discreditable to some who had to do with them, though greatly honorable
   to other. But as to my God, they have shown me His faithfulness, His
   power, His tenderness, His wisdom--and I believe that, had I been in
   Heaven, I would not have seen as much of some of the attributes of God
   as I have seen here below! If you had been an angel, forever praising
   God in Glory, could you tell how faithful He is to a tried saint? Could
   you say, if you had not experienced it here on earth, how surely He
   comforts His people in their deepest sorrows? There are some pearls in
   these troubled waters that the sea of glass, itself, can never contain!
   There are some bright eternal lessons that we would never have known if
   it had not been for our earthly trials, even if we might have had an
   archangel for a schoolmaster! Therefore we must stay here, a while, and
   suffer affliction, temptation, depression of spirit, slander and abuse
   that we may learn, thereby, the deeper Truths of God's Revelation.

   I shall have to abandon the second part of my subject, I see, for my
   time has already nearly gone. I must, however, make just one more
   remark upon our first head.

   I think that our Lord Jesus does not pray that we may be called out of
   the world because He knows that we shall be taken to Heaven in due
   time. He scarcely thinks of that as a matter of prayer--it is so
   entirely in the Father's hands that He leaves it there. I would not
   encourage anybody here to pray that he might die and, on the other
   hand, I do not know that I would incite anybody here to pray very
   earnestly that he might live. Hezekiah prayed that his life might be
   lengthened and his prayer was granted. Manasseh would not have been
   born if Hezekiah had not lived those extra 15 years, but it would have
   been a good thing if Manasseh had never been born! Those sins and
   iniquities with which he made Judah to sin with his idols, though they
   were forgiven, yet filled up the cup of the nation's perversion from
   God and fixed the doom of that apostate people! I do not know if the
   lifting of our finger could make us live for another 20 years, whether
   we had not better hesitate to lift that finger! At any rate, I feel
   quite clear about the other side of the question--we have no business
   to pray that we may die.

   As I have already reminded you, the man who prayed that he might die,
   never died at all! How foolish he was to pray that he might die, when
   God had intended that he should go to Heaven by a whirlwind, with a
   chariot and horses of fire! We shall all die in good time, unless the
   Lord shall come in the splendor of His Second Advent. If You and I had
   the choice of the time of our death, there would be just a tinge of the
   element of suicide about it and that is the very worst form of murder.
   This is clearly our duty, to leave ourselves wholly and unreservedly in
   the hands of Him to whom belong the issues of life--it is certainly our
   best course.

   This, then, is our Lord's negative prayer--"I pray not that You should
   take them out of the world."

   II. Secondly, if time had permitted, I was also to have spoken to you
   about THE POSITIVE PRAYER. I will only hint at this.

   What did Jesus pray for His disciples? That God would keep them from
   evil. This is the right prayer for you to offer for yourself. Do not
   pray to get out of the battle--ask God that you may never be a coward,
   but that you may bravely play the man in the day of danger. Do not seek
   to be screened from affliction, but plead that you may never be driven
   to sin by your affliction. You need not even pray that you may not have
   prosperity, but you may entreat the Lord that prosperity may not make
   you proud, or worldly. Let your condition be as God wills it, but let
   your great anxiety be that you may be kept from all sin in every
   condition.

   "I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you
   should keep them from evil." We need to be kept from the evil of
   apostasy, the evil of worldliness, from the evil of unholiness, from
   the evil of getting to be as men of the world are--that is the main
   point. I do not think that it matters much what the condition of a man
   is so long as his heart is above his condition. I remember that St.
   Bernard, as he is usually called--Bernard, of Clairvaux--one of the
   holiest and humblest of men, was, one day, riding on a mule to a
   certain monastery. One who saw him said, "I think Bernard is getting
   proud because he is riding on a mule, and sitting upon a cloth which
   has a fringe of gold lace on it." Now Bernard was a man who cared
   nothing for that sort of thing and when the other charged him with
   pride, he said, "Perhaps it may be so, but I never noticed that I had
   any cloth at all." Someone else had put that fine cloth upon the mule
   without his knowing anything about it. He really thought that he was
   riding on the animal's bare back, for his mind was taken up with
   something far more important.

   If you are rich and you have a cloth with a gold fringe on it, do not
   be conscious of its existence--let your soul rise above it! If you are
   poor and you have no saddle at all, do not notice your lack, but let
   your soul soar above such matters. Pray not that you may be taken out
   of this or that, be it poverty or be it wealth, be it sickness or be it
   health--but pray that you may be kept from the evil of it, for there is
   an evil in every case! If you are making money, we ought to have a
   special Prayer Meeting for you, to pray that you may be kept from evil.
   I said to a Brother who was going to a banquet, the other day, "Well,
   we will pray for you, dear Friend, for you are going into a place of
   peril." I do not think there was any great risk to such a man in
   going--perhaps some of those who stayed at home and complained of him
   were in more danger! The great point is not where you are, not what you
   are as to circumstances, but that you may be kept by almighty power
   from the evil which might come out of any circumstances unless you were
   Divinely preserved from evil! Oh, that the Lord Jesus may say this
   concerning us, tonight--"I pray not that You should take them out of
   the world, but that You should keep them from evil"! If so, we can
   leave everything else in His dear hands.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, do not let us be anxious to get to Heaven
   just yet. Let us seek to fight our way there in valiant fashion. Do not
   let us be so earnest about the end as about the way--laying hold on
   Christ and lifting up His dear Cross as our banner! Oh, that all of you
   would do this and follow the Lamb wherever He goes! We will just bend
   our thoughts to this one point and not think so much of going to Heaven
   as of avoiding sin! Lord, keep me out of evil! Then let me live or let
   me die, hold me up or press me down, let me dance with joy of heart, or
   let me lie and pine in an agony of pain with anguish racking every bone
   in my body, it shall be all the same to me--so long as nothing of the
   evil of surrounding circumstances enters into me--do with me as you
   will, O my God!

   God bless you, dear Friends, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN17.

   Verse 1. These words spoke Jesus, lifted up His eyes to Heaven, and
   said, Father, the hour is come. The hour to which He had so long looked
   forward to. The hour which He had anticipated with ardent desire--"The
   hour is come." On the very night that Jesus prayed this prayer, Luke's
   record tells us, "When the hour was come, He sat down, and the twelve
   Apostles with Him. And He said unto them, With desire I have desired to
   eat this Passover with you before I suffer." So He began His great
   intercessory prayer, "Father, the hour is come"--

   1, 2. Glorify Your Son that Your Son also may glorify You: as You have
   given Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as
   many as You have given Him. In these words we have both the general and
   the special aspects of redemption. Christ has received power over all
   flesh, but with this peculiar design, that He should give eternal life
   to as

   many as His Father has given Him. Who are they who have been given to
   Him by His Father? All who come to Him by faith, even as He said, "All
   that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." To all of these Jesus gives
   eternal life.

   3. And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent. Do you know God? Do you know
   Jesus Christ? Are you on speaking terms, on loving terms with them? Are
   They your Friends? Then you have eternal life, for, "this is life
   eternal, that they might know You the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
   whom You have sent."

   4-6. I have glorified You on the earth: I have finished the work which
   You gave Me to do. And now, O Father, glorify You Me with Your own Self
   with the glory which I had with You before the world was. I have
   manifested Your name unto the men which You gave Me out of the world:
   Yours they were, and You gave them to Me; and they have kept Your Word.
   What a sweet thing for the Lord Jesus to say of that poor, much-erring
   company of disciples, "They have kept Your Word"! "They have not been
   all they might have been, nor all they ought to have been, but, O My
   Father, they have kept Your Word!" I trust that we may be found
   faithful to the Truths of God that the Holy Spirit has taught us, and
   obedient to its precepts, that our Lord may be able to say to His
   Father concerning us, also, "They have kept Your Word."

   7, 8. Now they have known that all things to whatever You have given Me
   are of You. For I have given unto them the Words which You gave Me; and
   they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from
   You, and they have believed that You did send Me. See how the Lord
   Jesus, Himself, takes all His teaching from the Father. You never hear
   from Him any boast about being the originator of profound thoughts. No,
   He just repeated to His disciples the Words He had received from the
   Father--"I have given unto them the Words which You gave Me." If Jesus
   acted thus, how much more must the messengers of God receive the Word
   from the Lord's mouth and speak it as they receive it!

   9, 10. I pray for them: I pray not for the world but for them which You
   have given Me, for they are Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours
   are Mine: and I am glorified in them. Is not this a wonderful prayer?
   If anybody possessing the greatest possible inventive faculty were
   asked to produce a prayer which could be fitly prayed by a Person who
   was both God and Man, it would be an impossible task! This chapter has
   about it all the air of truthfulness. It ought to be sufficient to
   convince any man that Christ was God and Man. There is such a wonderful
   mixing of the two Natures without any confusion of ideas, so manifestly
   does He plead as Man, and yet so clearly does He also pray as none but
   the Son of God could pray, that He must be the God-Man, the one
   Mediator between God and man!

   11, 12. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
   and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your own name those whom
   You have given Me, that they may be one, as We are. While I was with
   them in the world, I kept them in Your name: those that You gave Me I
   have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the
   Scripture might be fulfilled. It was known and foretold that Judas
   would be lost. Therefore, the Savior, the great Keeper of the sheep, is
   not to be held responsible for the loss of, "the son of perdition," who
   was never committed to His charge.

   13-17. And now come I to You, and these things I speak in the world,
   that they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them
   Your Word and the world has hated them because they are not of the
   world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that You should take
   them out of the world, but that You should keep them from evil. They
   are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them
   through Your Truth: Your Word is Truth. Our Divine Lord seems to think
   nothing about His own sufferings! All His thoughts are occupied with
   that which concerns His people. All His prayers are for them, that they
   may be made holy, and that so God may be glorified in them.

   18-19. As You have sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent
   them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself. Or, "I set
   myself apart."

   19, 20. That they, also, might be sanctified through the Truth. Neither
   pray I for these, alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me
   through their word. They were only a handful of disciples, but you
   cannot tell what a multitude will believe on Christ through their word!
   There were but 12 Apostles yet John beheld a hundred and forty-four
   thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel and, after that,
   he beheld a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations,
   and kindreds, and people, and tongues, standing before the Throne of
   God, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and with palms in
   their hands! The Savior doubtless linked His little band of disciples
   with the ancient promise, "There shall be an handful of corn in the
   earth upon the top of the mountains, the fruit thereof shall shake like
   Lebanon." What great events from little causes, spring! Whenever You
   are doing good, remember not only those who are immediately saved, but
   the others who will be blessed through them, even as our Savior said,
   "Neither pray I for

   these, alone, but for them, also, which shall believe on Me through
   their word." We who have believed on Jesus, through the Word preached
   or written by the Apostles, are also included in this prayer of their
   Lord and ours. Notice what our Savior asked of His Father for them and
   for us--

   21. That they all may be one; as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You,
   that they, also, may be one in Us: that the world may believe that You
   have sent Me. And when Christians, being one in Christ, and one in the
   Truth of God, shall become more manifestly one in heart, and life, and
   faith--what glad days we may hope to see!

   22, 23. And the glory which You gave Me I have given them: that they
   may be one, even as We are one: I in them, and them in Me, that they
   may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that You have
   sent Me, and have loved them, as You have loved Me. This is a wonderful
   expression! Where will you find anything like it? It is, indeed,
   marvelous that God should have loved His people even as He loved
   Christ, His Son, yet that is what the Lord Jesus here says--"You have
   sent Me, and have loved them, as You have loved Me."

   24-26. Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with
   Me where I am, that they may behold My Glory, which You have given Me:
   for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O righteous
   Father, the world has not known You: but I have known You, and these
   have known that You have sent Me. And I have declared unto them Your
   name--

   "Your Character, Your work"

   26. And will declare it: that the love wherewith You have loved Me may
   be in them, and I in them. This prayer is for You and for Me, as much
   as for the 12 Apostles. May the Lord fulfill it in all of us as well as
   in them, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

The Truth Of God's Salvation

   (No. 2356)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 15, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 16, 1888.

   "O God, in the multitude of Your mercy hear me, in the Truth of your
   salvation." Psalm 69:13.

   I WOULD have you admire the educational power of prayer, for prayer is,
   in itself, an education for a saint. God might have given us every
   blessing at once without our asking Him for anything, but He says, even
   of that which He has promised to His people, "I will yet for this be
   enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them," the reason
   being that, sometimes, the prayer for the blessing is as beneficial to
   us as the blessing, itself, and thus we are twice blessed--first in
   asking--and then in receiving! Prayer brings the mercy, but in fetching
   it for us, prayer, itself, gives us an additional blessing. We are,
   ourselves, graciously helped of God as we pray, and we grow thereby.

   Will you also observe that, usually, when saints plead mightily with
   God, they draw their arguments from the Lord Himself? In this case,
   David speaks to God of, "Your mercy," and, "the Truth of your
   salvation." We do not bring pleas to God from abroad--we find them in
   Him with whom we plead. We say to Him, "You are such a One, therefore,
   will You not do this for me?" Or, "You have said it, therefore, do as
   You have said." Our best pleas lie within the compass of God's
   Character and God's promises.

   Now, because of this fact, you will at once see why prayer is so
   beneficial, for thus it helps us to communion. If we come to God and
   plead with Him on account of what He, Himself, is, we have, in that
   very pleading, fellowship and communion with Him. We have to think of
   Him, to consider Him, to endeavor to understand His attributes, and so
   we come into His Presence intelligently and profitably. This is no
   small gift, to have our fellowship with the Father fostered by our
   prayer to Him.

   Out of this communion comes edification. Coming near to God, we learn
   more and more of Him, and we get that kind of knowledge which does not
   puff us up because it first breeds love, and then builds us up, and we,
   knowing more of God, are established in Him. "They that know Your name
   will put their trust in You." Thus we grow in faith, love and every
   Grace, while prayer leads us to search out the Character of God in
   order to find these pleas that we use in our supplication. So that,
   praying is communion and praying is edification! I think that you will
   grow more in half an hour's prayer than you will in an hour's
   sermon-hearing! I am not sure that it will be so in every case, for God
   may bless a variety of means to different men and women, but I think
   that the most of us make our great advances in the Divine Life when we
   are pleading with God--pleading God's own Character with our God, we
   are then getting near Him and being built up into Him.

   And thus, you see, prayer even becomes a confession of faith. Public
   prayer may thus furnish a very useful means of instruction. That is not
   its main purpose, but it incidentally happens that, when we are seeking
   God, first, then other things are added to us in our public prayer.
   David, in this Psalm, instructs us concerning the multitude of God's
   mercy and the Truth of His salvation. It does one good to hear a godly
   man pray. When he pours out his heart before God, his language may be
   very simple--as simple as it is fervent--but there is a kind of
   insensible teaching and a force of latent instruction which gets into
   our soul, almost unawares, when we are joining in the prayers of devout
   persons. Prayer may thus be speaking to the souls of others as well as
   unto God and, may be, for some men, the best testimony and witness to
   the Gospel which they are able to hear. It was certainly so with David.

   But it is not my objective, tonight, to enlarge upon the manifold uses
   of prayer. I could not leave this point without notice, so I have given
   it to you by way of preface. Let it suggest to you to think still more
   how large a blessing has come

   to you through prayer, especially when prayer has taken the form of
   arguing with God because of the characteristics of His own Nature,
   finding pleas with Him in Himself.

   In the words before us, David pleads with God the Truth of His
   salvation--"Hear me in the Truth of your salvation," upon which I shall
   only make these two remarks--first, God's salvation is a great reality
   and, secondly, We have proved it to be so.

   I. First, GOD'S SALVATION IS A GREAT REALITY, a great Truth of
   God--"The Truth of your salvation." There is a substance in it. It is
   not a shadow, it is not a myth, it is not a mere type or figure of
   speech. It is a substantial thing, there is the Truth of God in
   it--"The Truth of your salvation."

   And, first, let us view it in reference to the Lord, Himself. To God,
   His salvation is, in the highest sense, full of Grace and His Truth.

   If I may venture to speak concerning Him of whom we can know nothing
   except as He reveals Himself, I may say that the truest and deepest
   thought of God is for the salvation of His people. This lies in the
   very center of His heart and the drift of His other thoughts and acts
   is all towards this point. He has ordained His Son to be the Head of a
   great family, of which He is to be the First-Born among many brethren,
   and the planning of the whole of creation was arranged in reference to
   the saved ones--those who are to be redeemed from among men. At the
   present time, the whole scheme of God's Providential working has a
   bearing upon the salvation of those whom He gave to His Son to be the
   reward of the travail of His soul. God's thoughts are high and not as
   our thoughts, but they are directed toward this central idea. They rest
   on this foundation principle--the underlying thought of all His works
   is the display of the Glory of His Grace in the salvation of the sons
   of men. This is the white of the target at which He shoots all His
   arrows and He fails not to hit it. In the grand gathering of all the
   redeemed, this shall be the loudest note in their song, "Unto Him that
   loved us, and that washed us from our sins in His own blood, to Him be
   Glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen." The display of all the
   characteristics of God in the salvation of His people is the subject of
   His truest, deepest thought.

   This is, also, to Himself, the most solid and lasting of all His works.
   I speak with bated breath when I talk of the things of God, but let me
   show you, Brothers and Sisters, what I mean. God creates worlds as He
   pleases. We speak of them as though they had existed and were to exist
   forever, but, Brethren, even among the starry worlds that are visible
   to us, many changes have taken place. New stars appear--they are
   admired awhile for their brilliance, but soon they are gone from our
   sight. As for this round world in which we dwell, we talk of its
   "everlasting hills" and so forth, but it shall be burned up and shall
   pass away. Yon firmament, which seems like a new piece of azure-tinted
   cloth, is wearing out and, by-and-by, it shall be folded up like an old
   garment and put away as a worn-out thing. The things that are seen are,
   after all, but temporal. Do not suppose that you see anything
   solid--you only see shadows! Faith, alone, sees substance, but
   everything that the eye is capable of beholding is, of necessity, a
   temporal and temporary thing.

   Look over the history of the whole world. Empires have arisen, all the
   thoughts of great men have been concentrated upon forming armies,
   building up enormous establishments and by State-craft consolidating
   the power of their realm. A dynasty has been formed, king after king
   has sat upon the throne and they thought, as they built their palaces,
   and walked in them, that Assyria and Babylon would never pass away!
   God's Providence lent itself to the building up of these great
   monarchies, but they were not substantial--they were only fading
   things, mere leaves upon the bay tree of existence. They came out and
   they, in due time, faded and dropped into the soil, again. But there is
   permanence in God's salvation--it will never fade--it is not a
   temporary work! The salvation of His people shall enlist the wondering
   gaze of angels throughout eternity and the songs of cherubim, seraphim
   and the hosts of the redeemed by blood shall go up before the Throne of
   God forever and forever because of the Truth of His salvation! This
   great work, which He has accomplished, He has made to last forever. Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, what a wonderful work is that of the salvation of
   the sons of men in its abiding results!

   And, further, I ask you to think, still from the God-ward aspect, of
   what Truth there is in salvation in this respect-- it is that into
   which God has thrown His whole Self. When He makes a world, He speaks,
   and it is done! He commands and it stands forever fast. The morning
   light and all that is seen by it, are produced by His word and, in His
   Providence, He just nods and dictates the policies of empires. But in
   the work of salvation, He, Himself, comes! Behold the Cross! God, in
   the Person of His Son, bleeds and dies to save a soul! He has given
   Himself to this stupendous work. The Holy Spirit enters into human
   bodies and reigns and rules over human minds, abiding in them,
   continuing His gracious, com-

   forting, enlightening and sanctifying work--He, Himself, personally
   dwelling in the saints! God throws His whole Self into the work of
   salvation!

   His little finger can create the stars and light them up or quench them
   at His will! But even His right arm is not sufficient for the
   redemption of His people! Both hands must bear the cruel nails! Both
   feet must be fastened to the accursed tree! The heart of the Son of God
   must be pierced by the soldier's lance! He, even He, Himself, must come
   forth from the bosom of the Father and must descend, and still descend,
   and yet further descend till He goes down to the lowest parts of the
   earth--there to work out the salvation of His people! Oh, my dear
   Friends, when we come to the Truth of God's salvation, we have reached
   the rocks! Now we have left the ever-rolling sea and landed on the
   Divine terra firma. Here shall you see God, indeed! In other things,
   you see only His reflection in a mirror, but, in salvation, you see the
   express Image of the Father's Glory! In the work of the redemption of
   His chosen, you see God unveiling Himself as far as man is ever capable
   of seeing Him.

   I should need all night if I were to dwell upon these points. So let me
   observe, in the next place, that God's salvation is a great reality to
   ourselves as well as to Him. Do you remember when you first grasped the
   true idea of God's salvation, when you understood that God had of old
   thought out the plan of salvation and, in the fullness of time, had
   worked it out? Do you remember when you first saw that Truth of God and
   when you felt that it was just the salvation that you needed and that
   you must have it--that you must have it then, or else perish
   everlastingly? You did not lay hold upon it, in the hour of your
   distress, as upon a fiction. You did not grasp it as a thing that might
   be or might not be. Souls that have ever been drowning in the sea of
   wrath want to clutch at a real salvation and you clutched at it as
   real. That day when I saw Christ as my soul's salvation, the great
   Sacrifice for sin was, to my soul, the most real thing I had ever seen!
   Otherwise it had not staunched the gaping wounds of my poor bleeding
   heart! Otherwise it had never brought balm and peace to my tortured
   spirit! I was a real sinner--I do not know whether you are--but I was.
   I had real pangs of conviction and I saw a real Hell before me--and I
   needed a real salvation--and I grasped it as such!

   Since then, dear Friends, God's salvation has been wonderfully real to
   us. Have we not daily found it more and more so? You have had many
   things that you doted on and trusted in, but, after a while, these poor
   cobwebs have been unable to bear the weight that you have hung upon
   them, and they have all disappeared. But have you not found Christ's
   salvation to be very real to you from that first day, even until now?
   If you have not, (excuse my putting it very plainly to you), you have
   missed your way. If you have not found a real Christ, you certainly
   need one! And if you have not found a real salvation and, by personal
   experience, known its reality, you are under a delusion and that
   comfort which you enjoy, tonight, is a false comfort! I wish that I
   could disturb you out of it, that you might find a real comfort.
   Remember that life is real, sin is real, death is real, judgment will
   be real and the final sentence will carry with it a real punishment!
   You need, therefore, to find in Christ Jesus the Truth of His
   salvation, a real salvation which, though you cannot touch it, is yet
   tangible to your soul, and which, if you cannot see it, is yet to be
   surely seen by the eyes of your spirit. But I shall be getting to my
   second head too fast if I dwell upon this point, so I will leave it.

   I think that we can say, dear Friends, that it is a real salvation to
   us in another sense. There is a Truth in God's salvation in the way
   that it has operated on us. The way it worked in the change of your
   character, at first--was not that very real? And sometimes, now, when
   temptation suddenly comes upon you, does not God's salvation pull you
   up with a very real check? Yes, and when you get somewhat indifferent
   in duty, does it not urge you on with a very real spur? Have not some
   of us said, "I will speak no more in the name of the Lord," and have we
   not found His salvation to be in us, in the truth of it, like fire in
   our bones, so that we could not hold our peace? The most potent force
   upon a real Christian's mind is the Truth of God's salvation--it
   touches him in a way that nothing else can. We are like music boxes and
   the Savior holds the key--and when He winds us up, then every part of
   us begins to play, but not till then! The spiritual nature of man is
   like a mystic harp upon which only One can play so as to bring out the
   fullness of its music! And the hand that can play upon our hearts is
   the hand that was nailed to the Cross. The Truth of God's salvation
   operates most powerfully upon our minds and so proves to us that it is
   real.

   Now, beloved Friends, to speak a little in detail of the Truth of this
   salvation, if we have really laid hold of the Truth of God's salvation,
   we believe in a real Fall. We do not believe that Adam's Fall is a mere
   fiction or parable, but we believe it to be a sad and terrible fact,
   for if there was not a real Fall, then there is no Truth of God in
   salvation! If we have not fallen from our first estate, we do not need
   picking up! But, alas, we have grievously fallen!

   Next, if you have the Truth of God's salvation, you will believe in
   real sin. There are hosts of sham sinners about. They come into our
   Chapels and we preach the Gospel to them, but they never get any good
   out of it. You may relieve sham beggars, but God never does. He
   relieves those who are really in need. Truly needy persons never come
   to Him in vain, but your pretended, dressed-up, hypocritical sinners,
   who say, "Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners," when they are
   neither miserable nor yet consciously sinful, God never relieves them!
   If you know the Truth of God's salvation, you must believe in real sin.
   "Oh!" says one, "I have more than enough of that." Then come and have
   real salvation! You who have really transgressed--you are the men and
   women for whom there is Truth in God's salvation--but, if there is no
   truth in your sinnership, there is, to you, no Truth in Christ's
   salvation.

   Once more, if we get to know the Truth of God's salvation, we believe
   in a real Atonement. You know the description that is given of the
   Atonement as it is preached by some gentlemen of supposed "culture." It
   is this--that Jesus Christ did something or other which, in some way or
   other, is probably more or less remotely connected with the pardon of
   sin. Such a salvation as that would not save a mouse! No, no, we must
   have a real Atonement--the Substitution of our Lord Jesus Christ for
   guilty sinners--the bearing of our sin in His own body on the tree!
   They say that it is unjust that Christ should suffer for us. On the
   contrary, I venture to affirm that it was in the highest degree just
   that He should die for His people, for He was one with us! His death
   was not merely substitution for us, but He had identified Himself with
   us. He came here on purpose that He might be one with His people and,
   being one with them, as the Second Adam, it behooved Him that He should
   suffer. It was right that, having married His Church, He should go with
   her for better and for worse, and bear her sins in His own body on the
   tree. And He did so, blessed be His name! And I believe that He really
   expunged His people's sins, that He truly took away the hand-writing of
   ordinances that was against us and nailed it to His Cross that, by His
   precious death, He might put away all the transgressions of His people
   once and for all. You have not learned the Truth of God's salvation if
   you do not believe in a real Atonement.

   Next, true faith brings to us a real pardon. If you have received the
   Truth of God's salvation, you are really forgiven. It was no fictitious
   document that was presented to you in that day when your Savior said to
   you, "Go, and sin no more. Your sins, which are many, are all
   forgiven." It was a real pardon, signed by the King's own hand, and
   your sins are gone--they shall not be mentioned against you any more,
   forever. "Do you believe this?"

   Now the Holy Spirit is working in you a real sanctification. Have you
   that sign and token of Grace? Have you given up evil habits? Have you
   quit your vices? Do you hate the very thought of sin? Are you watchful
   over all things within you and all things around you? Is "holiness unto
   the Lord" inscribed upon your whole life? If not, you have not a real
   salvation, and you do not know the Truth of that salvation! But if God
   has made you truly holy, by the sanctifying power of His Spirit, then
   listen once more.

   One part of the truth of this salvation is that there is a real Heaven
   for you. The Lord Jesus, Himself, says to you--

   "You shall see My glory soon! When the work of Grace is done Partner of
   My throne you shall be." And you shall dwell forever in a true Heaven,
   with a true Christ, in true Glory and only then shall you know to the
   fullest, the Truth of His Salvation!

   Thus have I shown you that God's salvation is a great reality to God,
   Himself, and also to ourselves.

   Further, if you would know the Truth of God's salvation, remember that
   the term used, here, signifies that God's salvation is real in its
   constancy. It will bear every strain and, therefore, it is that David
   uses it as a plea in prayer. He comes to God and he says, "Lord, I am
   in great distress. I beseech You, help me in my extremity by the Truth
   of Your salvation! Your salvation never fails, but endures every
   strain. Therefore, I beseech You, deliver me at this moment!" There are
   some times, when you are on your knees, and you need a master plea,
   that you can say, "Lord, if it is thus, then I beseech You, deliver
   Your servant. If this is a promise of Yours and You have spoken it, now
   do as You have said." It is no impertinence to plead with God in this
   way--"If this salvation of Yours is a fiction. If you have never spoken
   peace to my heart, nor brought me into the new and spiritual life,
   then, Lord, You may leave me. But if this is, indeed, as I believe it
   is, Your love to me, Your Grace in me, Your work for me--if I have,
   indeed, received Your salvation, then I beseech You, help Your servant
   and deliver me!"

   You will find the value of such pleading if you have but faith to know
   that there is Truth in God's salvation, in the fact of its perpetuity,
   its constancy, its unfailing power to bear you right through to the end
   as surely as it has borne you thus far. Oh, may God grant us Grace to
   feel that the truest and most real thing in earth or Heaven is the
   salvation of the blessed God! There is no doubt that it is so and that
   there is substance and endurance in it--and we do well to use this fact
   as a plea when we need a substantial argument in prayer.

   That is my first point, God's salvation is a great reality.

   II. Now I shall ask your kind attention while, for a few more minutes,
   I speak upon the second head. WE HAVE PROVED IT TO BE SO--"The Truth of
   your salvation."

   We have proved it, first, by our experience of a new life. Now reach
   for your diaries. "They are at home," you say. Take out your
   pocketbooks, then. You have not brought them with you tonight? Use your
   memories, then. Think what has been the experience of the new life in
   your soul. If there is Truth in God's salvation, you are not, now, what
   you once were, and you are now what you once never dreamed of being!
   There is within you, now, a life as much superior to the ordinary life
   of man as the life of an angel would be to that of the swine at the
   trough! Are you aware of that? Has such a life as that come into you?
   If so, that is one of the proofs of the Truth of God's salvation to
   you. An ungodly man sitting here may say, "That is no proof to me." No,
   of course it is not! You have not experienced it, so it cannot be
   evidence to you. Swine that were turned into angels would have, within
   themselves, a proof of some Divine operation upon them, would they not?
   Have you ever known what it was to be like the beast that perishes?
   Perhaps you have, for your thoughts never rose towards God--you were
   worldly, sensual, animal, perhaps devilish.

   I do not know whether you ever sank so low as that, but if the Grace of
   God has come into your heart and made you feel sorrows and joys that
   you never knew before, you have a proof of the Truth of God's
   salvation! When Luther was talking with the pretended prophets who
   claimed to be Inspired, he said to one of them, "Did you ever have
   births and deaths within your soul?" The man looked at him in
   amazement. "You knew nothing of it," said Luther--"You knew nothing of
   it, for he that knows the Lord has had births and deaths, creations and
   destructions within his own spirit." It is even so.

   My Hearer, do you know anything about this? Ordinary men do not know
   it--they are soulish, they have the life of a soul, they are far above
   the brutes--but Christian men are as far above them as they are above
   the brutes, for they have received a third and higher principle of
   life! The Spirit of God dwells in them! The Spirit of God has become
   dominant in them and this has elevated them into quite another region.
   This world that you see is not the world in which Believers live. You
   see mountains and hills--so do they--but you do not hear them break
   forth into singing before you, as Believers do. You see the trees of
   the field, but you never heard them clap their hands, as saints have
   done. There are many things, I guarantee you, which have not entered
   into your philosophy unless you have been born again. He who has been
   regenerated and has burst the shell that held him, like the unhatched
   bird within it, has emerged into new heavens and a new earth, wherein
   dwells righteousness--and that fact is to him the proof of the truth of
   his salvation.

   How else do we prove this? There is one sweet proof which we sometimes
   have of the Truth of God's salvation and that is, our sense of sonship.
   It is a great thing to be able to say, "Abba, Father," to know that God
   is our Father, not taking it as an abstract Truth that God is our
   Father, but feeling the Spirit of adoption witnessing within us,
   regarding Him not as Father in name only, but in reality, so that the
   thought of Him draws out emotions of love, delight, trust and nearest
   relationship. Oh, if you have that, you have proved the Truth of God's
   salvation! By nature you are of your father, the devil, and his works
   you do. But if you are now of your Father who is in Heaven, and you
   love Him and you grow like He, that is a grand proof to you of the
   Truth of His salvation!

   Let me tell you one or two other things. Time flies, so I will only
   mention them. Sometimes, God gives us proofs of the Truth of His
   salvation by our ecstatic joy. This is not a theme that I like to speak
   of except in very select company, but, believe me, we do have "high
   days and holidays." We have our hard days, sometimes, and you know
   about them, but you do not see our joys. Oh, if you did but know them,
   you would be willing to live a life of sorrow to have one day with us
   on the holy Mount with the transfigured Christ! I have thought,
   sometimes, that I never could doubt, again, after an experimental
   acquaintance with the banqueting house, and a sight of the banner of
   love waving over my head!

   Oh, the joy, the overwhelming joy, of the torrents of Divine Love when
   they come pouring into the soul! They bear everything away. If a man or
   a devil were then to come up and say to us, "There is no Truth of God
   in all this," we would

   feel as if we could not do him the honor to pour contempt upon him! We
   are blessedly sure of the Truth of God's salvation when we get a grip
   of Christ, when, with Mary, we sit at His feet! When, with John, we lie
   in His bosom! When, like the spouse, we even touch His dear lips and
   receive the kisses of His mouth! You who have enjoyed this delightful
   experience know the Truth of God's salvation.

   Now let me turn to another leaf of the diary of which I spoke. You know
   something of the Truth of God's salvation if you have done business in
   great waters and have had Divine support in trouble. Were you ever in
   this condition, that they said of you, "There is not a second person
   who justifies his course of action"? "It was proposed to pass a vote of
   approval of his conduct, but there was no one to second it." Did you
   ever open letter after letter and find that this friend will never help
   you again? That the next is ashamed of you and that the next one
   blasphemes God and you, also? You go on being stripped of one thing
   after another till you seem to have come to your last rag and then you
   say, "Still, I do not falter, I do not mean to budge an inch. I know
   whom I have believed and am persuaded that if all men forsake me, He
   will help me!" And you find, just then, a flush ofjoy come over you
   such as you never felt before, because now you are leaning on God's
   bare arm and there is nothing between you and the Almighty!

   I admire that saying of Luther, when he looked out of the window and
   exclaimed, "There stands the arch of Heaven, without a single pillar
   and yet it never falls." That is the way to stand--when all the pillars
   are knocked away. So many of us are like ships on the stocks--there we
   lie, in the dock, and we shall never do any good as we are! But if the
   dogshores are all knocked away and there is nothing left to support us,
   we go slipping into the water and so begin our true lifework. God help
   you, dear Brothers and Sisters, by His own Presence! And if you have
   once known the Presence of God in the utter absence of every form of
   comfort or help from mortal man, you will have had a most convincing
   proof of His salvation! The Lord can help you when you are in a
   fever--He can help you when you have gone, time after time, to the
   grave, and now that your last friend is buried. He can help you when
   that little income is suddenly taken away. He can bear you up when the
   vilest slander is cast upon your spotless reputation. And you can
   still, for all that, say, "The Lord is my portion, says my soul and,
   therefore, will I hope in Him." These are testing times, but it is then
   that you know the Truth of God's salvation!

   And then, to turn over another leaf--a bright leaf this time--when all
   those troubles are ended and you get out of your difficulties--when God
   has worked great deliverances for you--then you know the Truth of His
   salvation! Then Miriam takes her timbrel! I do not remember hearing of
   her having a timbrel before. Miriam, where was your timbrel when you
   came out of Egypt? Why, then, poor Miriam was busy carrying some of her
   household goods like the rest who had their kneading-troughs upon their
   shoulders! But she found her timbrel when the Lord had triumphed
   gloriously and the horse and his rider had been thrown into the sea.
   Some of us have our timbrels at home. We are beginning to get our
   fingers ready for playing on them, for the Lord will work for His
   people, and He will bring forth His chosen, as He has said, "I will
   bring again from Bashan, I will bring My people, again, from the depths
   of the sea." Then it is that we know the Truth of His salvation.

   But if you do not have these ups and downs, beloved Friends, you may
   know the Truth of God's salvation, and you ought to know it by the
   sweet realizations of faith. Where faith is strong, it has the faculty
   of anticipation, and that is a blessed faculty of the Divine Life, the
   power of stretching out your hands across the ages and bringing the
   far-off distance near. Perhaps you and I may not be in Heaven for
   another 20 years--we cannot tell, but Faith sits still and sees Heaven
   all round about her--and sometimes she puts on her crown and takes it
   off and casts it at her dear Lord's feet. Now and then she gets her
   heavenly harp and lays her fingers among the strings. I have known her
   put on all her holy array and walk in her white robes down the golden
   streets of Paradise--and she has seen and heard things which it were
   not lawful for her to utter!

   Do you ever have these good times? If you do not and you are a child of
   God, you are losing a great deal He is both able and willing to give to
   you! There lies, a little to the right of the road to Heaven, a hill
   called Mount Clear. Pass it not by in a hurry, but climb to the top of
   it and stand there. With a clear faith, believe in all that your God
   has told you--stay there till you can see! They say, "Seeing is
   believing." That is not true--believing is seeing when you "believe"
   fast enough and steadily enough. I say not that every Believer can see
   all this at once. If you have good milk--of course you do not all have
   it pure--but if you have good milk, there is no cream on it at first.
   But if you stand it for a little while and let it be still, there will
   come some cream to the top.

   So it is with faith. It is good milk, but you must let it stand a while
   and then you will find the cream of enjoyment, assurance and
   realization which will make you feel, "I know that God's salvation is
   true. I am sure of it, for I have as clearly perceived it by faith as
   if I had seen it with my natural eyes." If the senses, faulty as they
   are, can convey any sort of conviction to the mind, much more can that
   higher and truer God-given sense of faith convey to us a conviction
   that it is even as God has revealed unto us!

   I wish any dear friend, here, who is not yet saved, might be led to
   test the Truth of God's salvation. God, through Jesus Christ, can ease
   you of your burden at once! It is a cold wintry night. You came in here
   and you have had a little shelter, and you are going out, again, into
   the cold, but go not away with your burden--leave it in the pew! Better
   still, cast your burden upon the Lord! Jesus can give you ease and
   rest. Go not away with your foulness--Jesus can wash you! Go not
   outside till you, yourself, are whiter than the snow! The Lord grant
   you Grace to do so! Your faith will give you God. The longest arm of
   the greatest giant can never reach to Heaven, but the finger of faith
   can touch the Savior! Believe! Trust, and the work is done and you
   shall know the Truth of His salvation!

   Let us go our way with just this word of prayer. Lord, let us all know
   the Truth of Your salvation! May we all trust You! May we trust You
   more, and more, and more, and more, and more! May we trust You
   implicitly! May we trust You up to the hilt and glorify You thus by our
   childlike faith, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 37:1-18.

   Let us read, tonight, part of the 37th Psalm. David, here, first of
   all, dissuades himself and us from falling into a very common
   evil--that of envying the wicked because of their prosperity and
   murmuring against God because we, perhaps, are not so highly favored in
   our earthly affairs.

   Verses 1, 2. Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be you
   envious against the workers of inequity. For they shall soon be cut
   down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. No one envies the
   grass, let it be ever so green. No one envies flowers, let them be ever
   so fragrant, for we know that grass must be cut and that flowers must
   wither. Let us look upon the wicked in the same light--their time of
   perishing shall soon come, their end hastens on--therefore, let all
   envying be out of the question since they are such short-lived beings.

   3. Trust in the LORD, and do good. There you have the secret of the
   active life of the Christian! The root of his activity lies in his
   faith--"Trust in the Lord." The outward manifestation of his inner life
   is in the good that he does and where there is this faith, proven to be
   living faith by good works, there follows the promise--

   3. So shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed. It does
   not say, "Young man, verily you shall prosper in business." It does not
   say, "O ambitious man, you shall dwell in a palace, or revel in
   luxuries," but it does say to you, O humble-minded Christian, trusting
   in God, "Verily, you shall be fed." You know, when the word, "verily,"
   is used, there is something upon which God sets His seal as being
   true--"Verily, you shall be fed." God's, "Verilys," are better than
   men's oaths. Believe, then, Christians, and let there be no more
   fretting about your temporal trials. I know you have come in here,
   tonight, very anxious and vexed with care and grief--take this,
   "Verily," and lay it, like Isaiah's lump of figs, upon the boil and,
   "Verily," you shall soon be healed!

   4. Delight yourself, also, in the LORD; and He shall give you the
   desires of your heart. Delight is a Christian's duty. To sorrow, to
   mourn, to despair--these belong not to the Believer. "Delight yourself
   in the Lord." Christians, here is a river to swim in--plunge into it!
   Here is a bottomless abyss of delights--the Person, the Grace, the
   works, the attributes of our Covenant God! And here is a promise given
   to each one of those who carry on this excellent duty, "He shall give
   you the desires of your heart."

   5. Commit your way unto the Lord; trust, also, in Him; and He shall
   bring it to pass. Put the helm of your ship into the hand of the
   Almighty Pilot. Leave the guidance of your pilgrimage to Him who has
   led many caravans across the desert and who has never suffered any to
   perish! What an easy way this is and yet how difficult do we find it to
   carry it out! It is to unload ourselves and put our burden on our God.
   Oh, that we had the sanctified commonsense to make us fulfill this
   duty!

   6. And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your
   judgment as the noonday. Leave your character with God--it is safe,
   there. Men may throw mud at it, but it will never stick long on a true
   Believer--it shall soon come off and you shall be the more glorious for
   men's slander.

   7-11. Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him: fret not yourself
   because of him who prospers in his way because of the man who brings
   wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not
   yourself in any wise to do evil. For evildoers shall be cut off: but
   those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a
   little while, and the wicked shall not be: yes, you shall diligently
   consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the
   earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. This is
   now a Gospel blessing, for Christ pronounced it upon the mount among
   His other benedictions--"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
   the earth." Somehow or other, the only persons who truly enjoy life and
   get happiness out of this present vale of tears, are the meek spirits,
   the men who can say--"Mine are the valleys, and the mountains mine; my
   Father made them all." Even the possessions of other men make these
   people glad! They are like the man we have heard of in China who met a
   mandarin covered with jewels and, bowing to him, said, "Thank you for
   those jewels." Doing this many times, at last the mandarin asked the
   cause of his gratitude. "Well," said the poor but wise man, "I thank
   you that you have those jewels, for I have as good a sight of them as
   you have; but I have not the trouble of wearing them, putting them on
   in the morning, taking them off at night, and having a watchman keeping
   guard over them when I am asleep. I thank you for them--they are as
   much use to me as they are to you." This meek man can walk along the
   broad acres of a rich man's farm! He can see his noble oaks and other
   forest trees and he can say, "Thank God for them all! I have as much
   enjoyment from these as the rich man, himself, has, for they are mine
   to enjoy as truly as they are his." "The meek shall inherit the earth,
   and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace," not in the
   abundance of wealth, but in the abundance ofpeace! To a meek man, peace
   is his wealth, and holy quietness and calm his true riches!

   12-18. The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his
   teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for He sees that his day is coming.
   The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast
   down the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of upright
   conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their
   bows shall be broken. A little that a righteous man has is better than
   the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken:
   but the LORD upholds the righteous. The LORD knows the day of the
   upright: and their inheritance shall be forever. He knows their dark
   days and He will be their light--He knows their sunny days and He will
   be their shelter. He knows their last day and He will be their
   confidence. He knows their resurrection-day and He will be their
   glory--"Their inheritance shall be forever."--

   "Go, you that boast in all your stores, And tell how bright they shine.

   Your heaps of glittering dust are yours, But my Redeemer's mine/'

The Two Pillars Of Salvation

   (No. 2357)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 22, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 19, 1888.

   "We believe on Him that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead; who
   was delivered for our offenses, and was raised, again, for our
   justification." Romans 4:24,25.

   FAITH--true, saving faith--is in all ages the same. It may exercise
   itself upon different things, but the faith of Abraham is the same
   faith as that which was in the heart of Paul--and the faith of Paul was
   precisely the same faith as that which is in the heart of every
   Believer at the present moment! We have "like precious faith" with the
   godly of all the ages. It is always the same faith as it is always the
   same God and the same Savior.

   Paul shows us, in this chapter, that there is a remarkable likeness
   between the faith of the Believer, now, and the faith of Abraham.
   Abraham's faith went this length--he believed in God as able, even, to
   quicken the dead, and that is precisely what we believe! He believed
   that he, himself, when he was more than a hundred years old, with his
   wife equally advanced in age, could be so quickened by the power of God
   that they should be the parents of a seed which God had promised and,
   although Sarah once laughed, and I should imagine that Abraham,
   sometimes, had his fainting fits, yet they persevered in the solemn
   conviction that it should be even as the Lord had promised. And the day
   came when Sarah laughed in another sense, for a child was born to her,
   whose name was called, "Isaac," that is, "Laughter," because of the joy
   with which he filled his parents' hearts and home! Thus, you see,
   Abraham believed that God could quicken the dead--he, himself, and his
   wife, being as though they were dead as to all possibility, in the
   ordinary course of nature-- an heir should be born to them.

   Further on in the Patriarch's history, God tried his faith again. He
   bade him go and take his son, his only son, whom he loved, and offer
   him up as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah. Abraham only wished to know what
   God commanded and he was prompt in obeying. It was not for him to
   reason why, or make reply--it was for him to obey--so he went his three
   days' journey, his much-loved son bearing the wood for the sacrifice.
   They went to the top of the mountain and Abraham drew his knife to slay
   his son. His hand was divinely stopped in due time and a ram was
   offered in the place of Isaac. One reason why Abraham was able to give
   this crowning proof of obedience was that he was sure that God would
   keep His promise and that, even if his son must die, God would raise
   him from the dead! This seems to have been the point to which his faith
   always came--that God could raise the dead, that He could work what men
   call impossibili-ties--that what was not within the range of human
   nature was quite easy to that eternal arm to whose power there is no
   limit!

   Now, Beloved, this is one of the articles of our Christian faith--to
   believe that God can raise the dead. You and I believe, if we are true
   Believers, that God brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that
   Great Shepherd of the sheep. We believe that Jesus assuredly died and
   that He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, but that on the
   third day He rose, again, and left the tomb, no more to die. This we
   most firmly believe to be a matter offact--not a fiction, or a piece of
   poetry--but a matter offact, like any other reliable history, and we
   accept it without question. We also believe that we, too, though we may
   die, shall live again and that, although worms may devour this body,
   yet in our flesh we shall see God! At the sound of the archangel's
   trumpet, the dead in Christ shall rise and all the dead from land or
   sea shall gather before the Great White Throne. However scattered the
   particles of their bodies may have been, in ten thousand devious ways,
   it matters not--the body that was sown in weakness shall be raised in
   power--that which was sown a corruptible body shall be raised in
   incorruption!

   This we unfeignedly believe and our faith also believes that, even now,
   as to spiritual things, though by nature we are dead to the things of
   God, yet He can raise the dead. When we feel heavy and dull, and the
   music of our worship drags wearily, we believe that God can quicken us
   and, though we know many who are, this day, without spiritual life, and
   far from God by wicked works, we go and speak to them the everlasting
   Gospel with the full persuasion that God can raise the dead, even those
   who are dead in trespasses and sins! Though they were dead, yet shall
   they live! We believe this and rejoice in it!

   Thus I think I have shown you that the faith of Abraham is a fair
   specimen of the faith of all Believers and in this way he is the father
   of all Believers--and all the children bear a family likeness. In each
   case, they have faith in Him who can quicken the dead.

   Now let us come to our text, and I will handle it briefly with the
   intense desire that if anybody wants to find the way of salvation, he
   may find it tonight. True faith is of this character--"We believe on
   Him that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead; who was delivered
   for our offenses, and was raised, again, for our justification."

   I. First, OUR FAITH LOOKS TO GOD THE FATHER IN THE MATTER OF SALVATION.
   We do not, alone, look to Jesus Christ, as some say that we do, but,
   "we believe on Him that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead." Not
   on, "Jesus, our Lord," alone. We do believe on Him, but we also equally
   believe on God that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead.

   On this point there is an erroneous faith in two ways and one is sorry
   to see either form of this error, since it mars the beauty of Divine
   Truth. Some overlook the Father. They speak of Jesus as though we were
   indebted to Him and to Him, only, for our salvation. We are
   immeasurably indebted to Him, blessed be His name! But Jesus does not
   save without the Father, or apart from the Father, or against the
   Father's will! I like the expression that is used in the Book of
   Genesis concerning Abraham and his son when they were going to the
   Mount of Sacrifice--it is written, "They went, both of them, together."
   And in the great Sacrifice that was made for human sin, I may say of
   the Divine Father and His equally Divine Son, "They went, both of Them,
   together." There was a secret agreement and concurrence between the
   Father and the Son concerning our redemption, and the Father has our
   love and gratitude, even as the Son has. Jesus gave Himself for us, but
   the Father gave Jesus, His other Self!

   Jesus says, "I and My Father are One." I might say, in a certain sense,
   that it was God the Father who suffered for us, for He gave His Son,
   whom He loved, to suffer on our behalf. He gave up the darling of His
   heart and, in the Person of His Son, He became our Savior. It is, "God,
   our Savior," as well as, "Jesus Christ, our Savior." Never dissociate
   the Father from the Son in the work of redemption! Jesus did not come
   into this world to die to make His Father gracious. No, the Covenant of
   Grace was made from eternity and Jesus came to fulfill a stipulation of
   the Covenant through which it behooved Him to suffer. The Father's love
   is from everlasting and the death of Jesus is one of the streams that
   flow from that eternal Fountain. The Father is to be praised, for He
   delivered up His Son and raised His Son, again, from the dead. And we
   must never forget the Grace which He has, in this way, manifested for
   our salvation! Therefore, let us never fall into the error of those who
   overlook the Father's part in our redemption.

   It is an equally pernicious error if we overlook the Son. Oh, how many
   talk about God, pray to God and speak of God's mercy--but what have
   they to do with God if they ignore or despise His Son? God will not
   hear you. He will not answer your prayers if you do not come to Him by
   Jesus Christ! There is but one way of coming to the Father and that is
   through His Son, Jesus Christ! And you cannot approach God without the
   one Mediator between God and men. Why did He ordain a Mediator and why
   did that Mediator shed His blood, if you and I can come to God without
   His propitiatory Sacrifice? No, Beloved, we believe on Jesus Christ as
   well as the Father. We believe on the Father, but we believe on Him as
   the God that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead! It is not the
   Father without the Son who saves, nor the Son without the Father--nor
   these two without the Divine and ever-to-be-blessed Holy Spirit! It
   needs the whole Trinity to make a Christian! And the whole Trinity,
   co-operating in a Divine Unity, must be praised and adored for our
   salvation!

   But, now, what does the text say in bidding us trust to God the Father
   in our salvation? Well, it says, first, that He delivered up His Son.
   Of Jesus, we here read, "who was delivered for our offenses." We know
   who it was that delivered Him, for we have in this same Epistle the
   text, "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
   how shall He not, with Him, also, freely give us all things?" It was
   the Father who delivered His Son to be arrayed in human flesh. It was
   the Father who delivered His Son to be despised and rejected of men. It
   was the Father who delivered up His

   Son to the traitor's kiss and to the cruel handling of the Roman
   soldiers. It was the Father who delivered up His Son to the scourge and
   then to the Cross--and to the bitterness of death, itself! The Father
   gave up His Son to die for sinners! This was the supreme proof of the
   Father's love to us.

   And then, next, we are told that, in due season, it was the Father who
   raised up Jesus from the dead--"We believe on Him that raised up Jesus,
   our Lord, from the dead." The Resurrection of Christ is spoken of in
   different ways in Scripture, but among other declarations it is
   expressly said to have been worked by the power of the Father. Well,
   then, we have to thank Him for a living Christ, a risen Christ! It was
   the Father who breathed the life, again, into that dead body and
   brought our Redeemer back to life. It was the Father who bade the
   angels roll away the stone from the mouth of the sepulcher when the
   resurrection morning dawned.

   And remember that, as these two things--the delivering up of Christ and
   the raising of Christ from the dead--are ascribed to the Father, so the
   two fruits that come of them are also of the Father. The first fruit is
   the pardon of sin-- "Who was delivered for our offenses." The second
   fruit is justification--"And was raised, again, for our justification."
   These are both the work of the Father! It is the Father who forgives
   and it is the Father who justifies. "It is God that justifies," said
   Paul, when he was carried away with a sort of Divine ecstasy. "It is
   God that justifies. Who is he that condemns?" So, then, we cannot truly
   trust to Jesus apart from the Father. To come back to the point on
   which I have already spoken to you--to try to drive that nail home and
   even to clinch it--we do not look to Jesus apart from the Father, any
   more than we look to the Father apart from Jesus! This is the true
   Scriptural faith, "We believe on Him that raised up Jesus, our Lord,
   from the dead; who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised,
   again, for our justification."

   Now, Soul, if you would be saved, before anything else it is necessary
   that you should trust your soul in the hands of God, the faithful
   Creator, beholding always associated with those hands, the Lord Jesus
   Christ, God and Man, who has died and risen, again, to put away your
   sin! Such a faith now exercised will save you at once and will save you
   forever and ever!

   II. Now I advance a step farther and come to the second head, THE FAITH
   WHICH SAVES THE SOUL CONCERNS ITSELF WITH JESUS CHRIST AS OURS. Listen
   to this--true faith looks to nothing else that is ours. When it looks
   within, this faith sees nothing there worth having and nothing worth
   trusting to for salvation. Therefore it cries out against its own
   righteousness, which is of the Law, and desires to count it only as
   filthy rags! It views Jesus Christ, however, as its real treasure.

   Do you notice, in my text, the word, "our," three times over? Just mark
   with a pencil under that little pronoun each time it is mentioned. True
   faith receives Jesus Christ as "our" Lord Jesus. "Jesus our Lord," our
   Jesus, our Savior--not only a Savior, but our Savior--and being Lord as
   well as Savior, we acknowledge Him as our Lord, Jesus, we take Him to
   be our Lord. This is how He, Himself, puts it, "Take My yoke upon you,
   and learn of Me," and this we desire to do. This, then, is the true,
   unfeigned faith which saves the soul--the faith which appropriates
   Jesus as our Savior and as our

   Lord!

   And the next appropriation is that true faith sees Christ as delivered
   for "our" sins. "Who was delivered for our offenses." That means your
   offenses and mine--"our offenses." Oh, my dear Hearers, it is of little
   use to believe in Jesus Christ as delivered for the offenses of those
   who lived in the ages past--we must believe that He was delivered for
   our offenses! It will not save us to believe that Jesus Christ was
   delivered for the sins of nations far remote from us. No, but we must
   believe that He was delivered for our offenses. This is the faith that
   says, "Jesus Christ bore my sins in His own body on the tree." Grasp
   the Savior as your Sin-Bearer. "Look unto Me," He says, "and be you
   saved, all the ends of the earth." Look unto Him, look unto Him at this
   moment--you are saved the moment that you look! Trust Him as your
   Savior! Touch Him, as did the woman of old--it shall suffice you if you
   can but touch Him by faith and straightway you shall be saved from all
   your transgressions--for true faith believes "He was delivered for our
   offenses."

   And then next, true saving faith appropriates Christ as raised for
   "our" justification. It is a Scriptural doctrine that we are justified
   through the death of Christ, but you must not leave it merely as a
   doctrine--you must take it to yourself by faith and make it an
   experience, as the text says--"Who was raised, again, for our
   justification." For whose justification? For yours, dear Friends, and
   mine--"for our justification." I like the word, "our," sometimes better
   than the word, "my." When I get quite alone, I sometimes pray, "My
   Father in Heaven." Still, I am thankful that the Lord did

   not so word the model prayer that He gave to His disciples, but that He
   put it, "Our Father"--that is, the Father of you, me and all of us who
   love His dear name and trust His dear Son.

   Yes, Jesus was raised for my justification--I praise Him for that
   glorious fact! I see in front of me every morning, when I am washing,
   that passage, "Who loved me and gave Himself for me," and I thank the
   Lord that it is true. But, still, I like this word, "our," in our
   text--"Who was raised, again, for our justification." Does "our
   justification" mean your justification, dear Friends, as well as mine?
   Who will ride with me in the double-seated chariot of this precious
   pronoun, "our," saying, "He was raised, again, for our justification"?

   Thus have I taught you two lessons. The first, that our faith looks to
   God the Father in salvation. And secondly, that our faith concerns
   itself with Christ as ours.

   III. Now, thirdly, OUR FAITH FOR SALVATION RELIES ON CHRIST'S DEATH AND
   RESURRECTION-- "Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised,
   again, for our justification."

   Observe, then, that a faith which only deals with the historical
   narrative of Christ's life will not save you. If you believe that there
   was such a Person as Jesus Christ, even if you truly believe that He
   was both God and Man. If you believe all that Matthew, Mark, Luke and
   John wrote, and all the Epistles, as well, yet, if you believe this
   only in the sense that they are historically true, you have not yet
   attained to saving faith! You must go beyond that if you are to possess
   the faith mentioned in our text.

   Note, next, that faith in the beauty of Christ's life will not save
   you. Of late there has risen up a set of infidels of a very superior
   character to the old-fashioned ones, in some respects. Instead of
   abusing the Christian religion, they have written lives of Christ and
   they have poured out all kinds of laudation upon the wonderful and
   lovely Character of the Man, Christ Jesus. Now, mark you, I think that
   Christ does not like their praise any better than He did the
   blasphemies of those who came before them, because, if Jesus of
   Nazareth was not the Son of God, if He was not really God, the Son, He
   could not have been a good Man! His moral Character, though admirable
   in many respects, would have been spoiled by the fact that He allowed
   Himself to be worshipped and that He spoke of Himself in such a way
   that millions of us believe Him to be truly God! And knowing and
   foreseeing, as such a Man must have done, that this would be the result
   of His teaching, He was a gross impostor if He was not very God of very
   God! Therefore, if you believe Christ's Character to be beautiful, if
   you do not also believe Him to be the Son of God, you are not yet on
   the right track--you have not the faith of God's elect--you have to go
   on another road than that if you would come, at last, to the Heaven
   where He is.

   There are some who do not truly believe, although they have faith in
   the accuracy of Christ's teaching. "Yes," they say, "He is a wonderful
   Teacher and whatever He taught is true"--but they do not practically
   believe that. It is merely the doctrine that they take, and not the
   God, the Christ, who gave the doctrine! They simply exercise their
   brain intellectually, but they do not trust Him, spiritually, with
   their heart. They do not trust God who raised Christ from the dead. In
   fact, after all, they do not build upon the two main foundation stones
   of saving faith, namely, the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus
   Christ!

   I venture also to say that you may have the most orthodox faith in
   Christ's Godhead and believe in Jesus as being Lord, but if that is all
   you believe, you have not yet obtained salvation. The faith that saves
   centers in Him, "Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised,
   again, for our justification." If you would be saved, fix your eyes
   upon the sufferings of the Son of God--

   "See, my Soul, your Savior see, Prostrate in Gethsemane."

   I know that a sight of His life will do you good. It will be an example
   to you, but you are not bid to look to that for your salvation. Your
   eyes are to be fixed upon Him as delivered for your offenses. You are
   to see Him as accused of sin, though in Him was no sin. You are to see
   Him as made sin for you, as your Substitute, standing in your place,
   and suffering in your place, delivered for your offenses. If you can
   see this, then you have your eyes fixed upon that which will save
   you--the Father laying your sin upon the Son, making it to lay upon
   Him. The Father smiting the Son as if He were not only a sinner, but
   all the sinners in the world rolled into one till His Son cries, "My
   God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" "Who was delivered for our
   offenses"--there lies your only hope! If you will not have Jesus Christ
   as your Substitute, dying in your place, I know of no door of salvation
   for you! But if you will take Him as God delivers Him,

   not for your righteousness, but for your sins, to bear for you what you
   ought to bear, and pay for you what you could never have paid--if you
   will have Him so, then you have taken Christ in the right way!

   But you must also believe in Him as risen from the dead. He did rise
   from the dead and He always lives to make intercession for us--and it
   is under that aspect that you are to be justified, cleansed by a dying
   Savior, clothed by a risen Savior, washed from your iniquity by His
   precious blood, raised into acceptance with the Father by His
   everlasting life when He rose from the dead and led captivity captive,
   and received gifts for men, yes, for the rebellious, also!

   Behold, then, the Jachin and Boaz, the two massive columns that support
   the temple of our salvation! Between these two great Truths of
   God--Christ's death for us and Christ's Resurrection for us--lies the
   King's highway to eternal life. And there is no other road to
   salvation!

   IV. So I close with the fourth point, OUR FAITH SHOULD LEARN TO SEE THE
   DISTINCT RELATION OF

   EACH WORK OF CHRIST TO ITS END--"Who was delivered for our offenses,
   and was raised, again, for our justification." At first, for a poor
   sinner, it is enough that he trusts Christ and does no more. But it is
   for our comfort and edification to learn to distinguish the blessings
   that flow from certain Divine Fountains--to look along the various
   roads of the great King to see what comes this way and what comes that.

   First, then, dear Friends, our forgiveness comes from the death of
   Christ--"Who was delivered for our offenses." There is no pardon of sin
   apart from Christ being delivered for our offenses. Of late I have
   heard things that I never dreamed of, before--alleged, even, by
   professedly Christian ministers, against the fundamental Doctrines of
   God's Word! And some have even dared to say that the Substitution of
   Christ--His suffering in our place--was not just! Then they have added
   that God forgives sin without any Atonement whatever, but, if the first
   is not just, what shall I say of the second? If God continually
   forgives sin without taking any care of His moral government. If there
   is nothing done for the vindication of His justice, how shall the Judge
   of all the earth do right? Then, the very foundations of the universe
   would be removed and what would the righteous do? Depend upon this,
   whatever modern philosophy may say, "Without shedding of blood there is
   no remission of sins," that is to say, without an Atonement, and an
   Atonement consisting of the giving up of a Life of infinite value,
   there is no passing by of human transgression!

   But how is it that the death of the Lord Jesus Christ is available for
   the pardon of sin? I answer, first, in part from the majesty of His
   Person. Being God, when He took upon Himself our nature, and became God
   and Man, He had about His complete and adorable Person a Divinity and
   majesty utterly indescribable! And for Him to die was a greater honor
   to the stern justice of God than for the whole mass of rebellious men
   to be cast into Hell! There was such a vindication of Divine justice in
   Christ being nailed to the tree, that it is not conceivable that
   anything else could ever have so established the foundations of
   morality and righteousness. Oh, Sirs, Christ is infinitely better than
   all of us put together! As the Son of God and God, the Son, He is
   greater than all the rest of men throughout all ages--and greater than
   all the holy angels, too--and if He must suffer, if He must die when
   sin is but imputed to Him, and is not really His own, then God is truly
   just in taking vengeance even on His Only-Begotten Son when He stands
   in the sinner's place!

   The next reason why Christ's death for us was so efficacious is found
   in the freeness of His own condition. As God, He was not bound to come
   under the Law. Indeed, it must have seemed inconceivable that He ever
   could do so! I could not make an Atonement for you because whatever I
   could do for God is already due from me to God. If I give all that I
   have, I cannot pay my own debt, so I certainly cannot pay yours! But
   our Lord Jesus Christ owed nothing to the Law of God! It was not
   possible that He could be personally indebted to it and, therefore, all
   that He did was, as it were, a surplus which He set to the account of
   the guilty men whose Substitute He became.

   The excellence of His Atonement also lay in the absolute perfection of
   His Character. He was the Lamb of God, without blemish and without
   spot. There is no excess in Him and there is nothing lacking--and such
   a character as this entitled Him, when He came to suffer, to say that
   He did not suffer for Himself. The Messiah laid down His life and was
   cut off, "but not for Himself," since He was without sin and was under
   no obligation to the Law.

   And then, again, His Headship towards His people put Him in a position
   in which He could fitly become a Sufferer in our place. Look, Sirs, the
   first cause of your fall did not lie in yourselves. Your father Adam
   sinned long ago, and you fell in him. Do you blame God for that
   arrangement and begin to complain? Behold the door of hope there is for
   you in this fact! Because you fell through one representative, you can
   be restored by Another! When the angels fell, I suppose that they
   sinned separately, and that they had no federal head as we had. They
   transgressed, each individual spirit for

   himself and, therefore, they fell hopelessly and eternally--and none of
   them can ever be lifted up again. But our fall, happily for us, was in
   our Covenant head, Adam. There is a solidarity of the race--Adam was
   the head of it and when he sinned, we fell in him. Our fall being in
   that way--it is retrievable by the Divine device of another Head coming
   in and keeping the Law of God for us, and suffering the penalty of it
   in our place that, thereby, we might be restored. Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, I wish you felt as much joy and delight as I do in this
   wonderful Doctrine of Christ being delivered for our offenses! I go to
   sleep at night upon it. "Yes," you say, "it makes you sleep." It does
   and I wake in the morning with it, and it keeps me awake all day with a
   stern resolve to serve my Lord and Master while I can, come what may of
   it! Restful as this Truth of God is to the heart, it is also
   stimulating to the highest degree. Believe it and you will find rest
   unto your soul and you, also, will be stirred up to serve your God
   while yet 'tis called today!

   But I find, next, we are told that being thus saved from sin by
   Christ's death, we are justified by His Resurrection-- "Who was raised,
   again, for our justification." What does this mean?

   I sometimes tell you that Jesus Christ was put in the prison of the
   grave as a Hostage for us. He had paid our debt, but He must wait in
   the grave till the certificate that the debt was paid was registered in
   the court of Heaven. That being done for three days and nights--roughly
   so styled, but very short, all of them--down flew the bright messenger
   from Heaven, bearing the writ and warrant that the Hostage must go
   free, for the debt was paid and the whole liability was discharged.
   Then the stone was rolled away and when the angel had rolled it away,
   what did he do? He went and sat down upon it. It always seems to me
   that when the angel sat down, there, he seemed to say, "Now, Death and
   Hell, roll the stone back if you can"--but they could not! The keepers
   fled far away and Jesus Christ, Himself, came out to newness of life.
   And now both the sinner and his Substitute are cleared, the captive and
   the Hostage are both set free! He that owed the debt is cleared by his
   Substitute and the Substitute, Himself, is cleared, for He has paid all
   that Infinite Justice could demand and He has received a clean bill of
   deliverance! Thus He comes forth out of durance vile, raised from the
   dead by His Father's hand. That resurrection is your justification!

   Now just look at this matter for a minute in another way. Suppose that
   Jesus Christ had never risen and I were to tell you that He had made a
   complete Atonement and died for our sins, but that He was still dead
   and in that grave? Why, if you believed the message, you would always
   be troubled! You could not feel any confidence in a dead Christ--you
   would say, "He sees corruption, yet the true Christ was never to see
   corruption. He is dead and what can a dead Christ do for us?" Beloved,
   the dying Christ has purchased for us our justification, but the risen
   Christ will see that we get it! The risen Christ has come to bring it
   to us and herein we rest!

   Oh, that you would all rest in the finished work of Jesus on the Cross
   which is set forth to you in all its brightness by His rising again
   from the dead! Put the two parts of our text together, "Who was
   delivered for our offenses," "and was raised, again, for our
   justification." You need them both! Trust in them both! Trust in the
   Savior who died upon the Cross, and trust in the Christ who rose,
   again, and is now the living Christ! Trust, in fact, in Christ as He
   revealed Himself to John in Patmos--"I am He that lives, and was dead;
   and behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen; and have the keys of Hell and
   of death." Lord Jesus, as such we trust You, as such we trust You now,
   and we are saved!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Romans 3; 4:16-25.

   Romans 3:1, 2. What advantage, then, has the Jew? Or what profit is
   there of circumcision? Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them
   were committed the Oracles of God. It was a great thing to be a Jew in
   those old times. When all the rest of the world was in the dark, the
   Jews had the Light of God--"Unto them were committed the Oracles of
   God."

   3. For what if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the
   faith of God without effect? That is to say, if they did not believe
   God, did that make Him untrue?

   4. God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is
   written, That You might be justified in Your sayings, and might
   overcome when You are judged. Whatever men did under the old Law,
   however faithless they might be, God was still true and faithful.

   5. 6. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God,
   what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as
   a man). God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? Whenever
   anybody insinuates that God

   is not just, Paul protests against such an idea. "No," he says, "He
   must of necessity be just because He is God; for how could He judge the
   world if He were unrighteous?"

   7, 8. For if the Truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto His
   Glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner? And not rather, (as we are
   slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil,
   that good may come? Whose damnation is just. No Christian man ever
   said, "Let us do evil that good may come." If anybody else ever does
   say it, his condemnation is most just. Albeit that God, in Infinite
   Wisdom, does cause even the sin of man to illustrate the greatness of
   His Grace, yet that, by no means, excuses his sin, but leaves it an
   abominable evil, most hateful in the sight of the thrice-holy Jehovah!

   9. What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
   before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin. Read
   the earlier chapters of this Epistle--chapters that are enough to make
   the heart sick to read them--and to make the head ache with the memory
   of them, and when you have read them, you will say that Paul has proved
   that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin.

   10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one. Note in the
   passage we are going to read how Paul rings the changes upon those two
   words, "all," and, "none." He begins with the word, "none."

   11. 12. There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after
   God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
   unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one. Yet men come
   and talk to us about the righteous heathen whose virtues they
   extol--the imaginary good people--for there are none such actually in
   existence! Here the Lord, Himself, is speaking, and the Spirit of God
   is quoting from passages of the Old Testament which He puts together to
   describe the character of humanity. How sweeping are all the terms!
   "There is none righteous, no, not one. There is none that understands,
   there is none that seeks after God. They are all gone out of the way,
   they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good,
   no, not one."

   13-16. Their throat is an open sepulcher, with their tongues they have
   wed deceit, the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full
   of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood:
   destruction and misery are in their ways. How true that last verse is
   of many today! Their sins are destroying them! The lusts of the flesh
   destroy the body! Drunkenness and such like sins are destructive habits
   and they make those who practice them to be miserable--"Destruction and
   misery are in their ways." What miserable persons, what miserable
   families, what miserable countries are made by indulgence in sin! There
   is no true happiness without holiness!

   17. And the way of peace have they not known. Quietness, happiness, and
   rest are not known by sinful men. They are not in the way of finding
   peace.

   18. There is no fear of God before their eyes. How true is this
   terrible accusation, especially of this present age! Men seem to be
   casting off all fear of God. Anyone who reads human history will, I
   think, detect that the present condition of society in our country,
   religiously, is wonderfully like the condition of France before the
   great Revolution which brought so much bloodshed with it. Everything
   seems loosening, broadening, tending downwards and, especially, "there
   is no fear of God before their eyes."

   19. Now we know that what things soever the Law says, it says to them
   who are under the Law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the
   world may become guilty before God. Every man by nature tries to open
   his mouth and say the best he can for himself, but it is the objective
   of God's Law to shut every man's mouth--and when we come to that
   condition, there is hope for us! When we have nothing to say for
   ourselves, then the Lord Jesus will open His mouth for the dumb and
   plead for the guilty in the courts of God.

   20. Therefore by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified
   in His sight: for by the Law is the knowledge of sin. All the Law can
   do is to show us our sin. The Law is a mirror and, looking in it you
   can see your spots, but you cannot wash in a mirror. If you want to be
   cleansed from your stains, you must go somewhere else. The objective of
   the law of God is not to cleanse us, but to show us how much cleansing
   we need--to reveal our disease--not to find a remedy for it.

   21. 22. But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested,
   being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; even the righteousness of
   God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that
   believe. You see, we cannot become righteous by the Law. Paul says that
   there is no one who has ever obtained righteousness in that way. We, on
   the contrary, have so sinned that we can never become righteous through
   the Law. But there is a new way of righteousness--

   the way of the righteousness of God--and God's righteousness is much
   better than the best human righteousness can ever be conceived to be!
   There is a righteousness which comes to us by faith in Jesus Christ,
   not by doing, but by believing--a righteousness which is freely
   bestowed upon all them that believe.

   22-24. For there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short
   of the Glory of God; being justified freely by His Grace through the
   redemption that is in Christ Jesus. I have heard persons ask, "Why do
   you say, 'Free Grace'? If it is Grace, it must be free." Well, we say,
   "Free Grace," because the Scripture says, "freely by His Grace," and as
   the Lord never uses superfluous words, we conceive that we are not
   guilty of tautology when we say, "Free Grace."

   25, 26. Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that
   are past, through the forbearance of God, to declare, I say, at this
   time His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him
   which believes in Jesus. Not of him who works for salvation, but of him
   who believes! Not of him who merits, but of him who trusts! This is
   God's way of righteousness and we are sent to declare it. Oh, that the
   Spirit of God may be given to make the declaration acceptable to your
   hearts!

   27. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. Shut out, done with.

   27. By what Law? Of works? No, no, the Law of works would have allowed
   us to boast! We would have merited whatever we earned by our own
   excellence and we might have gloried in it.

   27-31. No, but by the Law offaith. Therefore we conclude that a man is
   justified by faith without the deeds of the Law. Is He the God of the
   Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
   seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith,
   and uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the Law through
   faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the Law.

   Chapter 4:16. Therefore it is offaith, that it might be by Grace; to
   the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only
   which is of the Law, but to that, also, which is of the faith of
   Abraham; who is the father of us all. Abraham is the father of all who
   believe, whether they are circumcised or not, and the promises made to
   him belong to them also.

   17, 18. (As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations),
   before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickens the dead, and calls
   those things which are not as though they were. Who against hope
   believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations,
   according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be. He was an
   old man, with a very aged wife, yet the Lord promised that he would be
   "the father of many nations." He firmly believed that which was spoken
   and, in due time, it came to pass.

   19-21. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
   dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness
   of Sarah's womb: he staggered not at the promise of God through
   unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully
   persuaded that what He had promised, He was able, also, to perform.
   That is the kind of faith we need--the faith that does not enquire how
   God can perform His promise, but believes that He will do it!

   22, 23. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now it
   was not written for his sake, alone, that it was imputed to him. The
   imputation would be enough for Abraham without any writing, but as it
   is written--it is for our instruction and for our comfort.

   24, 25. But for us, also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
   Him that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead; who was delivered
   for our offenses, and was raised, again, for our justification. May the
   Lord bless to us our meditation upon this precious portion of His Word!

The Unchangeable Christ

   (No. 2358)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, APRIL 29, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 23, 1888.

   "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today and forever." Hebrews
   13:8.

   LET me read to you the verse that comes before our text. It is always a
   good habit to look at texts in their connection. It is wrong, I think,
   to lay hold of small portions of God's Word and take them out of their
   connection as you might pluck feathers from a bird. It is an injury to
   the Word of God and, sometimes, a passage of Scripture loses much of
   its beauty, its true teaching and its real meaning, by being taken from
   the context. Nobody would think of mutilating Milton's poems by taking
   a few lines out of Paradise Lost, and then imagining that he could
   really get at the heart of the poet's power. So, always look at texts
   in the connection in which they stand. The verse before our text is
   this, "Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto
   you the Word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their
   conversation: Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever."

   Observe, then, that God's people are a thoughtful people. If they are
   what they ought to be, they do a great deal of remembering and
   considering--that is the gist of this verse. If they are to remember
   and to consider their earthly leaders, much more are they to remember
   that Great Leader, the Lord Jesus, and all those matchless Truths which
   fell from His blessed lips. I wish, in these days, that professing
   Christians remembered and considered a great deal more, but we live in
   such a flurry, hurry and worry, that we do not give time for thought.
   Our noble forefathers of the Puritan sort were men with backbone, men
   of solid tread, independent and self-contained men who could hold their
   own in the day of conflict. And the reason was because they took time
   to meditate, time to keep a diary of their daily experiences, time to
   commune with God in secret. Take the hint and try and do a little more
   thinking--in this busy London and in these trying days--remember and
   consider.

   My next remark is that God's people are an imitative people, for we are
   told, here, that they are to remember them who are their leaders, those
   who have spoken to them the Word of God, "whose faith follow,
   considering the end of their conversation." There is an itching,
   nowadays, after originality, striking out a path for yourself! When
   sheep do that, they are bad sheep. Sheep follow the shepherd and, in a
   measure, they follow one another when they are all together following
   the shepherd. Our Great Master never aimed at originality--He said that
   He did not even speak His own Words, but the Words that He had heard of
   His Father. He was docile and teachable. As the Son of God and the
   Servant of God, His ears were open to hear the instructions of the
   Father and He could say, "I do always those things that please Him."

   Now, that is the true path for a Christian to take, to follow Jesus
   and, in consequence, to follow all such true saints as may be worthy of
   being followed, imitating the godly so far as they imitate Christ! The
   Apostle puts it, "whose faith follow." Many young Christians, if they
   were to pretend to strike out a path for themselves, must infallibly
   fall into many sorrows. Whereas, by taking some note of the way in
   which more experienced and more instructed Christians have gone, they
   will keep by the way of the footsteps of the flock and they will also
   follow the footprints of the Shepherd. God's people are a thoughtful
   people and they are an imitative and humble people, willing to be
   instructed and willing to follow holy and godly examples.

   One good reason, however, for imitating saints is given in our text--it
   is because our Lord and His faith are always the same--"Jesus Christ,
   the same yesterday, and today, and forever." You see, if the old
   foundation shifted, if our faith was always changing, then we could not
   follow any of the saints who have gone before us. If we have a religion
   especially for the 19th Century, it is ridiculous for us to imitate the
   men of the 1st Century--and Paul and the Apostles are just old

   fogies who are left behind in the far distant ages. If we are to go on
   improving from century to century, I cannot point you to any of the
   Reformers, or the confessors, or the saints in the brave days of old,
   and say to you, "Learn from their example," because, if religion has
   altogether changed and improved, it is a curious thing to say, but we
   ought to set an example to our ancestors! Of course, they cannot follow
   it because they have gone from the earth, but as we know so much better
   than our fathers, we cannot think of learning anything from them! As we
   have left the Apostles all behind, and gone in for something quite new,
   it is a pity that we should not forget what they did, what they
   suffered and think that they were just a set of simpletons who acted up
   to their own light, but then they had not the light we have in this
   wonderful 19th Century!

   O Beloved, it almost makes my lips blister to talk after the present
   evil fashion, for grosser falsehood never could be uttered than the
   insinuation that we have shifted the everlasting foundations of our
   faith! Verily, if these foundations were removed, we might ask in many
   senses, "What shall the righteous do? Whom shall they copy? Whom shall
   they follow? The landmarks having gone, what remains to us of the holy
   treasury of example with which the Lord enriches those who follow
   Christ?"

   I. Coming to our text, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today,
   and forever," my first observation is that JESUS CHRIST, HIMSELF, IS
   ALWAYS THE SAME. He is, was, and will always be the same!

   Changes of position and of circumstances there have been in our Lord,
   but He is always the same in His great love to His people, whom He
   loved before the earth was. Before the first star was kindled, before
   the first living creature began to sing the praise of its Creator, He
   loved His Church with an everlasting love! He spied her in the glass of
   predestination, pictured her by His Divine foreknowledge and loved her
   with all His heart. And it was for this cause that He left His Father
   and became one with her, that He might redeem her. It was for this
   cause that He went with her through all this vale of tears, discharged
   her debts and bore her sins in His own body on the Cross. For her sake
   He slept in the tomb and with the same love that brought Him down, He
   has gone up, again, and with the same heart beating true to the same
   blessed betrothal, He has gone into Glory, waiting for the marriage day
   when He shall come, again, to receive His perfected spouse who shall
   have made herself ready by His Grace! Never for a moment, whether as
   God over all, blessed forever, or as God and Man in one Divine Person,
   or as dead and buried, or as risen and ascended--never has He changed
   in the love He bears to His chosen! He is "Jesus Christ, the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever."

   Therefore, Beloved Brothers and Sisters, He has never changed in His
   Divine purpose towards His beloved Church. He resolved in eternity to
   become One with her, that she might become one with Him and, having
   determined upon this, when the fullness of time had come, He was born
   of a woman and made under the Law. He took upon Him the likeness of
   sinful flesh, "and being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled Himself
   and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross." Yet He
   never abandoned His purpose--He set His face like a flint to go up to
   Jerusalem--even when the bitter cup was put to His lips and He seemed
   to stagger for a moment. He returned to it with a strong resolve,
   saying to His Father, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me:
   nevertheless not as I will, but as You will." That purpose is strong
   upon Him, now, for Zion's sake He will not hold His peace and for
   Jerusalem's sake He will not rest until her righteousness goes forth as
   brightness and her salvation as a lamp that burns!

   Jesus is still pressing on with His great work and He will not fail nor
   be discouraged in it. He will never be content till all whom He has
   bought with His blood shall become glorified by His power. He will
   gather all His sheep in the heavenly fold and they shall pass, again,
   under the hands of Him that counts them--every one of them being
   brought there by the Great Shepherd who laid down His life for them!
   Beloved, He cannot turn from His purpose--it is not according to His
   Nature that He should, for He is, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
   and today, and forever."

   He is also "the same yesterday, and today, and forever," in the holding
   of His offices for the carrying out of His purpose and giving effect to
   His love. He is still a Prophet. Men try to set Him on one side.
   Science, falsely so-called, comes forward and bids Him hold His tongue,
   but, "the sheep follow Him, for they know His voice; and a stranger
   will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the
   voice of strangers." The teachings of the New Testament are as sound
   and true today as they were 1800 years ago--they have lost none of
   their value, none of their absolute certainty-- they stand fast like
   the everlasting hills! Jesus Christ was a Prophet and He is "the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever."

   He is the same, too, as a Priest. Some now sneer at His precious
   blood--alas, that it should be so! But, to His elect, His blood is
   still their purchase price--by this they overcome, through the blood of
   the Lamb they win the victory--and they know that they shall praise it
   in Heaven when they have washed their robes, and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb! They never turn away from this great Priest of
   theirs and His wondrous Sacrifice, once offered for the sins of men and
   perpetually efficacious for all the blood-bought race! They glory in
   His everlasting Priesthood before the Father's Throne. In this we
   rejoice, yes, and will rejoice, that Jesus Christ is our Priest, "the
   same yesterday, and today, and forever."

   And as King He is always the same. He is supreme in the Church. Before
   You, O Jesus, all Your loyal subjects bow! All the sheaves make
   obeisance to Your sheaf--the sun and moon and all the stars obey and
   serve You, King of Kings and Lord of Lords! You are Head over all
   things to Your Church, which is Your body. Beloved, if there is any
   other office which our Lord has assumed for the accomplishment of His
   Divine purposes, we may say of Him, concerning every position, that He
   is "the same yesterday, and today, and forever."

   So also, once more, He is the same in His relationship to all His
   people. I like to think that, as Jesus was the Husband of His Church
   ages ago, He is still her Husband, for He hates divorce. As He was the
   Brother born for adversity to His first disciples, He is still our
   faithful Brother. As He was a Friend that sticks closer than a brother
   to those who were sorely tried in the medieval times, He is equally a
   Friend to us upon whom the ends of the earth have come. There is no
   difference, whatever, in the relationship of the Lord Jesus Christ to
   His people at any time! He is just as ready to comfort us tonight as He
   was to comfort those with whom He dwelt when here below! Sister Mary,
   He is as willing to come down to your Bethany and help you in your
   sorrow about Lazarus, as He was when He came to Martha and Mary whom He
   loved! Jesus Christ is just as ready to wash your feet, my Brother,
   after another day's weary travel through the foul ways of this world.
   He is as willing to take the basin and the towel, and to give us a
   loving cleansing, as He was when He washed His disciples' feet! Just
   what He was to them, He is to us! Happy is it if you and I can truly
   say, "What He was to Peter, what He was to John, what He was to the
   Magdalene, that is Jesus Christ to me--the same yesterday, and today,
   and forever."

   Beloved, I have seen men change--oh, how they change! A little frost
   turns the green forest to bronze and every leaf forsakes its hold and
   yields to it's winter's blast. So fade our friends and the most
   attached adherents drop away from us in the time of trial. But Jesus is
   to us what He always was. When we get old and gray-headed and others
   shut the door on men who have lost their former strength, and can serve
   their turn no longer, then will He say, "Even to hoar hairs will I
   carry you: I have made and I will bear; even I will carry, and will
   deliver you," for He is "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today,
   and forever." Thus much, Beloved, with regard to Jesus, Himself--He is
   always the same!

   II. Now let us go a step farther. JESUS CHRIST IS ALWAYS THE SAME IN
   HIS DOCTRINE.

   This text must refer to the Doctrine of Christ, since it is connected
   with imitating the saints' faith--"Whose faith follow, considering the
   end of their conversation: Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today,
   and forever. Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.
   For it is a good thing that the heart is established with Grace." From
   the connection it is evident that our text refers to the teaching of
   Christ, who is "the same yesterday, and today, and forever." This is
   not according to the "development" folly. Theology, like every other
   science, is to grow, watered by the splendid wisdom of this enlightened
   age, fostered by the superlative ability of the gentlemen of light and
   leading of the present time, so much superior to all who came before
   them!

   We think not so, Brothers and Sisters, for the Lord Jesus Christ was
   the perfect Revelation of God. He was the express image of the Father's
   Person and the brightness of His Glory. In previous ages, God had
   spoken to us by His Prophets, but in these last days He has spoken to
   us by His Son. Now as to that which was a complete Revelation, it is
   blasphemous to suppose that there can be any more revealed than has
   been made known in the Person and work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God!
   He is God's ultimatum--last of all, He sends His Son. If you can
   conceive a brighter display of God than is to be seen in the
   Only-Begotten, I thank God that I am unable to follow you in any such
   imagination! To me, He is the last, the highest, the grandest
   Revelation of God! And as He shuts up the Book that contains the
   written Revelation, He bids you never dare to take from it, lest He
   should take your name out of the Book of Life! And never dare to add to
   it, lest He should add unto you the plagues that are written in this
   Book!

   At this time, the salvation of our Lord Jesus Christ is the same as it
   was in all ages. Jesus Christ still saves sinners from the guilt, the
   power, the punishment and the defilement of sin. Still, "there is none
   other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved."
   Jesus Christ still makes all things new. He creates new hearts and
   right spirits in the sons of men and engraves His Law upon the tablets
   which once were stone, but which He has turned into flesh. There is no
   new salvation! Some may talk as if there were, but there is not!
   Salvation means to you, today, just what it meant to Saul of Tarsus on
   the way to Damascus. If you think it has another meaning, you have
   missed it altogether!

   And, again, salvation by Jesus Christ comes to men in the same way as
   it always did. They have to receive it, now, by faith. In Paul's day,
   men were saved by faith, and they are not now saved by works. They
   began in the Spirit in the Apostolic age, and we are not now to begin
   in the flesh. There is no indication in the Book and there is no
   indication in the experience of God's children, that there is ever to
   be any alteration as to the way in which we receive Christ! All live by
   Him. "By Grace are you saved, through faith, and that not of
   yourselves; it is the gift of God"--the gift of God, today, as much as
   it ever was, for Jesus Christ--"is the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever."

   Once more, this salvation is just the same as to the persons to whom it
   is sent. It is to be preached, now, as always, to every creature under
   Heaven. But it appeals with a peculiar power to those who are guilty
   and who, by God's Grace, confess their guilt. It appeals to hearts that
   are broken, to men who are weary and heavy laden. It is to these that
   the Gospel comes with great sweetness. I have quoted to you, before,
   those strange words of Joseph Hart--

   "A sinner is a sacred thing The Holy Spirit has made him so." He
   is--the Savior is only for sinners! He did not come to save the
   righteous. He came to seek and to save the lost and still, "to you is
   the word of this salvation sent," and this declaration still stands
   true, "This Man receives sinners, and eats with them." There is no
   change in this statement, "the poor have the Gospel preached to them,"
   and it comes to those who are farthest off from God and hope--and
   inspires them with Divine power and energy!

   Beloved, I can bear witness that the Gospel is the same in its effects
   upon the hearts of men. Still it breaks and still it makes whole! Still
   it wounds and still it heals! Still it kills and still it quickens!
   Still it seems to hurl man down to Hell in their terrible experience of
   the evil of sin, but still it lifts them up into an ecstatic joy till
   they are exalted almost to Heaven when they lay hold upon it and feel
   its power in their souls! The Gospel that was a Gospel of births and
   deaths, of killing and making alive, in the days of John Bunyan, has
   the same effect upon our hearts to this day when it comes with the
   power that God has put into it by His Spirit! It produces the same
   results and has the same sanctifying influence as it ever had.

   Looking beyond the narrow stream of death, we can say that the eternal
   results produced by the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ are the same as
   they always were. The promise is this day fulfilled to those who
   receive Him as much as to any who went before. Life eternal is their
   inheritance. They shall sit with Him upon His throne and, on the other
   hand, the threat is equally sure of fulfillment--"These shall go away
   into everlasting punishment." "He that believes not shall be damned."
   Christ has made no change in His words of promise or of threat, nor
   will His followers dare to do so, for His doctrine is "the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever."

   If you were to try to think over this matter and imagine for a minute
   that the Gospel really did shift and change with the times, it would be
   very extraordinary. Look, here is the Gospel for the 1st Century--make
   a mark and note how far it goes. Then there is a Gospel for the 2nd
   Century--make another mark, but then remember that you must change the
   color to another shade! Either these people must have altered, or else
   a very different effect must have been produced in the same kind of
   minds. In eternity, when they all get to Heaven by these 19 gospels in
   the 19 centuries, there will be 19 sets of people and they will sing 19
   different songs, depend upon it, and their music will not blend! Some
   will sing of "Free Grace and dying love," while others will sing of
   "evolution." What a discord it would be and what a Heaven it would be,
   too! I should decline to be a candidate for such a place!

   No, let me go where they praise Jesus Christ and Him, alone, singing,
   "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
   to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen." That is what the
   1st Century saints sing--yes, and it is what the saints of every
   century will sing, without any exception! And there will be no change
   in this song forever. The same results will flow from the same Gospel
   till Heaven and earth shall pass away, for Jesus Christ is "the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever."

   III. We may sound the same note, again, for a moment, because JESUS
   CHRIST IS THE SAME AS TO HIS MODES OF WORKING--"Jesus Christ, the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever."

   How did Jesus Christ save souls in olden times? "It pleased God by the
   foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe." And if you will
   look down through Church history, you will find that, wherever there
   has been a great revival of religion, it has been linked with the
   preaching of the Gospel! When the Methodists began to do so much good,
   what did they call the men who made such a stir? "Methodist preachers,"
   did they not say? That was always the name, "Here comes a Methodist
   preacher." Ah, my dear Friends, the world will never be saved by
   Methodist doctors, or by Baptist doctors, or anything of the sort! But
   multitudes will be saved, by God's Grace, through preachers! It is the
   preacher to whom God has entrusted this great work! Jesus said, "Preach
   the Gospel to every creature."

   But men are getting tired of the Divine Plan--they are going to be
   saved by the priest, going to be saved by the music, going to be saved
   by theatricals and who knows what! Well, they may try these things as
   long as they like, but nothing can ever come of the whole thing but
   utter disappointment and confusion--God dishonored, the Gospel
   travestied, hypocrites manufactured by thousands and the Church dragged
   down to the level of the world! Stand to your guns, Brothers, and go on
   preaching and teaching nothing but the Word of God, for it still
   pleases God, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that
   believe! And this test still stands true, "Jesus Christ, the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever."

   But remember that there must always be the prayers of the saints with
   the preaching of the Gospel. You must have often noticed that passage
   in the Acts concerning the new converts on the day of Pentecost, "They
   continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine"--they thought a great
   deal about doctrine in those days. "And fellowship"--they thought a
   good deal of being in Church fellowship in those days. "And in breaking
   of bread"--they did not neglect the blessed ordinance of the Lord's
   Supper in those days. "In breaking of bread." And then what follows?
   "And in prayers." Some say, nowadays, that Prayer Meetings are
   religious expedients pretty well worn out. Ah, dear me! What a
   religious expedient that was that brought about Pentecost, when they
   were all assembled with one accord in one place, and when the whole
   Church prayed and suddenly the place was shaken, and they heard the
   sound as of a rushing mighty wind, that betokened the Presence of the
   Holy Spirit!

   Well, you may try to do without Prayer Meetings if you like, but my
   solemn conviction is that, as these decline, the Spirit of God will
   depart from you and the preaching of the Gospel will be of small
   account. The Lord will have the prayers of His people to go with the
   proclamation of His Gospel if it is to be the power of God unto
   salvation--and there is no change in this matter since Paul's day!
   Jesus Christ is "the same yesterday, and today, and forever." God is
   still to be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them--and
   He still grants blessings in answer to believing prayer.

   Remember, too, that the Lord Jesus Christ has always been inclined to
   work by the spiritual power of His servants. Nothing comes out of a man
   that is not first in him. You will not find God's servants doing great
   things for Him unless God works mightily in them, as well as by them.
   You must first be endued with power from on high, or else the power
   will not manifest itself in what you do. Beloved, we need our Church
   members to be better men and better women. We need baby-Christians to
   become grownup-Christians and we need the grownup-Christians among us
   to be "strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might." God will
   work by His servants when they are adapted to His service--and He will
   make His instruments fit for His work. It is not in themselves that
   they have any strength--their weakness becomes the reason why His
   strength is seen in them! Still, there is an adaptation, there is a
   fitness for His service, there is a cleanness that God puts upon His
   instruments before He works mighty things by them and Jesus Christ is
   "the same yesterday, and today, and forever," in this matter, too.

   All the good that is ever done in the world is worked by the Holy
   Spirit and, as the Holy Spirit honors Jesus Christ, so He puts great
   honor upon the Holy Spirit. If you and I try, either as a Church or as
   individuals, to do without the Holy Spirit, God will soon do without
   us. Unless we reverently worship Him and believingly trust in Him, we
   shall find that we shall be like Samson when his locks were shorn. He
   shook himself as he had done before, but when the Philistines were upon
   him, he could do nothing against them. Our prayer must always be, "Holy
   Spirit, dwell with me! Holy Spirit, dwell with Your servants!" We know
   that we are utterly dependent upon Him. Such is the teaching of our
   Master and Jesus Christ is "the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever."

   IV. I do not want to weary you, my dear Brothers and Sisters, but may I
   be helped, just for a few moments, to speak on a fourth point! JESUS
   CHRIST HAS ALWAYS THE SAME RESOURCES, for He is "the same yesterday,
   and today, and forever."

   I will repeat what I said--Jesus Christ has always the same resources.
   We sit down, sometimes, very sorrowful, and we say, "The times are very
   dark." I do not think that we can very well exaggerate their darkness
   and they are full of threatening omens. And I do not think that any of
   us can really exaggerate those omens, they are so terrible. But still
   is it true, "The Lord lives, and blessed be my Rock."

   Does the Church feel her need of faithful men? The Lord can send us as
   many as ever! When the Pope ruled everywhere, nobody thought, I should
   imagine, that the first man to speak out for the old faith would be a
   monk--they thought they had taken stock of all the men that God had at
   His command and they certainly did not think that He had one of the
   leaders of the Reformation in a monastery! But there was Martin Luther,
   "the monk that shook the world," and though men dreamed not what he
   would do, God knew all about him. There was Calvin, also, writing that
   famous book of his Institutes. He was a man full of disease--I think he
   had 60 diseases at once in his body, and he suffered greatly. Look at
   his portrait--pale and wan. And as a young man he was very timid. He
   went to Geneva and he thought he was called to write books, but Farel
   said to him, "You are called to lead us in preaching the Gospel here in
   Geneva." "No," said Calvin, for he shrank from the task. But Farel
   said, "The blast of the Almighty God will rest upon you unless you come
   out and take your proper place."

   Beneath the threat of that brave old man, John Calvin took his place,
   prompt and sincere in the work of God, in life and in death never
   faltering! Then there was Zwingli over there at Zurich. He had come
   out, too, and Oecolampadius, and Melancthon and their fellows--who ever
   expected them to do what they did? Nobody! "The Lord gave the Word,
   great was the company of them that published it." And so, today, He has
   only to give the Word and you shall see starting up all over the world
   earnest preachers of the everlasting Gospel, for He has the same
   resources as always! He is "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and
   today, and forever."

   He has also the same resources of Grace. The Holy Spirit is quite as
   able to convert men, to quicken, enlighten, sanctify and instruct.
   There is nothing which He has done which He cannot do again! The
   treasuries of God are as full and as running over, now, as they were in
   the beginning of the Christian age! If we do not see such great things,
   where lies the restraining force? It is in our unbelief. "If you
   believe, all things are possible to him that believes." Before this
   year has gone, God can make a wave of revival break over England,
   Scotland and Ireland--from one end to the other! Yes, and He can deluge
   the whole world with the Gospel if we will but cry to Him for it! And
   He wills to do it, for He is "the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever," in the resources of His Grace.

   V. So I close my sermon with this fifth head, on which I will be very
   short, indeed. JESUS CHRIST IS ALWAYS

   THE SAME TO ME--"yesterday, and today, and forever." I will not talk
   about myself except to help you to think about yourselves. How long
   have you known the Lord Jesus Christ? Perhaps only a short time.
   Possibly many years. Do you remember when you first knew Him? Can you
   point out the spot of ground where Jesus met you? Now, what was He to
   you at first? I will tell you what He was to me.

   Jesus was to me, at first, my only trust. I leaned on Him very hard,
   then, for I had such a load to carry. I laid myself and my load down at
   His feet. He was All in All to me. I had not a shred of hope outside of
   Him, nor any trust beyond Himself, crucified and risen for me. Now,
   dear Brothers and Sisters, have you got any further than that? I hope
   not! I know that I have not. I have not a shadow of a shade of
   confidence anywhere but in Christ's blood and righteousness! I leaned
   on Him very hard at the first, but I lean harder now! Sometimes, I
   faint away into His arms. I have died into His life. I am lost in His
   fullness! He is all my salvation and all my desire. I am speaking for
   myself, but I think that I am speaking for many of you, too, when I say
   that Jesus Christ is to me, "the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever." His Cross, before my failing eyes, shall be my dying comfort
   as it is my living strength.

   What was Jesus Christ to me at the first? He was the object of my
   warmest love. Was it not so with you? Was He not chief among ten
   thousand and altogether lovely? What charms, what beauties were there
   in that dear face of His! And what a freshness, what a novelty, what a
   delight which set all our passions on fire! It was so in those early
   days when we went after Him into the wilderness. Though all the world
   around was barren, He was All in All to us. Very well, what is He
   today? He is fairer to us, now, than He ever was! He is the one gem
   that we possess--our other jewels have all turned

   out to be but glass and we have flung them from the chest--but He is
   the Kohinoor that our soul delights in! He is all perfections joined
   together to make one absolute perfection! He is all the Graces adorning
   Him and overflowing to us! Is not that what we say of Him? "Jesus
   Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever."

   What was Jesus Christ to me at the first? Well, He was my highest joy.
   In my young days, how my heart did dance at the sound of His name! Was
   it not so with many of you? We may be huskier in voice, heavier in body
   and slower in moving our limbs, but His name has as much charm for us
   as it ever had! There was a trumpet that nobody could blow but one who
   was the true heir--and there is nobody who can ever fetch the true
   music out of us but our Lord to whom we belong! When He sets me to His
   lips, you would think that I was one of the trumpets of the seven
   angels! And there is no one else who can make me sound like that! I
   cannot produce such music as that by myself and there is no theme that
   can ravish my heart, there is no subject that can stir my soul until I
   get to Him! I think it is with me as it was with Rutherford when the
   Duke of Argyle called out, as he began to preach about Christ, "Now,
   Man, you are on the right string, keep to that!" The Lord Jesus Christ
   knows every key in our souls and He can wake up our whole being to
   harmonies of music which shall set the world ringing with His praises!
   Yes, He is our joy, our everything, "the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever."

   Let us go forward, then, to the unchanging Savior, through the changing
   things of time and sense, and we shall meet Him soon in Glory, and He
   will be unchanged even there, as compassionate and loving to us when we
   shall get Home to Him and see Him in His splendor, as He was to His
   poor disciples when He had not where to lay His head and was a Sufferer
   among them.

   Oh, do you know Him? Do you know Him? Do you know Him? If not, may He,
   this night, reveal Himself to you, for His sweet mercy's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HEBREWS13.

   Verse 1. Let brotherly love continue. It is supposed to already be
   there--let it continue, not only love of a common kind, such as we are
   to have to all men, but that special "brotherly love" which Christians
   bear to one another as members of one family. "Let brotherly love
   continue."

   2. Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
   entertained angels unawares. Abraham did and Lot did. They thought they
   were entertaining ordinary strangers and they washed their feet and
   prepared their food but it turned out that they had entertained angels!
   Some people will never entertain angels unawares, for they never
   entertain anybody. May we be given to hospitality, for that should be
   part of the character of saints.

   3. Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them. Christian
   people who have got into trouble through being Christians and persons
   who have been shut up in prison for righteousness' sake--there were
   many such in Paul's day. Sympathize with them, says the Apostle, "as
   bound with them."

   3. And them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves, also, in the
   body. So that, if you are not, now, in adversity, you may be before
   long. Therefore, have a fellow feeling for those who are in trouble. If
   you are not, yourself, distressed, you are not out of the reach of such
   a thing--therefore be tender towards your afflicted Brothers and
   Sisters.

   4, 5. Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
   whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Let your conversation be
   without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for
   He has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you. There is a
   fortune for you. There is a pension to fall back upon. You may very
   well be content to leave your temporal concerns in the hands of God,
   for He has said, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." Why, if you
   believe that one promise of God, He will be better to you than ten
   thousand friends who promise to provide for you! The Provider in Heaven
   is better than any provider on earth! A beautiful motto is that of the
   old house of Chester, "God's Providence is my inheritance."

   6, 7. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
   fear what man shall do unto me. Remember them which have the rule over
   you, who have spoken unto you the Word of God: whose faith follow,
   considering the end of their conversation. It seems that there were
   special persons who were leaders in the Church of God, who were to be
   remembered and thought upon, and considered. They were set apart for
   this world--"them which have the rule over you, who have

   spoken unto you the Word of God." They were leaders among the saints
   and Paul would have the rank and file imitate them in their confident
   trust in the Lord Jesus Christ--"whose faith follow, considering the
   end of their conversation."

   8, 9. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever. Be not
   carried about with divers and strange doctrines. Do not believe one
   thing, today, and another thing, tomorrow. Be not carried about like
   the thistledown in the wind. Have a faith of your own--know what you
   believe and stand firmly to it.

   9, 10. For it is a good thing that the heart is established with Grace;
   not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied
   therein. We have an altar. Yes, true religion cannot exist without an
   altar, but what kind of altar is it? Is it a material altar? Far from
   it! But "we have an altar"--

   10, Whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. They
   have nothing to do with it, for they are still under the old ceremonial
   Law and those whose religion consists in outward rites and ceremonies
   can never eat of the spiritual altar whereat spiritual men eat, for
   they do not understand the Scripture and they still serve the Mosaic
   tabernacle.

   11-13. For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the
   sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.
   Therefore Jesus, also, that He might sanctify the people with His own
   blood, suffered outside the gate. Let us go forth, therefore, unto Him
   outside the camp, bearing His reproach. Outside the gate was the place
   of Christ's atoning death. "Outside the camp," is the place where His
   servants will find themselves most at home.

   14. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. We
   cannot stop in the condemned city--we must be outside its walls. Our
   Lord went out of the city to die and we must go outside the camp to
   live!

   15, 16. By Him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
   continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name.
   But to do good and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices
   God is well pleased. Christian people should be always doing good. As
   God is always doing good, so we can never say we have done all we ought
   to do and will do no more--"To do good and to communicate," that is, to
   communicate of your substance and of your charitable help, "forget
   not."

   17-19. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
   for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that
   they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable
   for you. Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
   things willing to live honestly. But I beseech you the rather to do
   this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. The movements of God's
   servants may be controlled by prayer. You cannot tell how much of
   blessing will come to your own souls through the ministry if you are in
   the habit of praying about it! The man who comes up to God's House,
   having prayed for God to bless the preacher, is not likely to go away
   unprofited.

   20-25. Now the God of peace, that brought, again, from the dead, our
   Lord Jesus, that Great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do His
   will, working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight, through
   Jesus Christ; to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. And I beseech
   you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a
   letter unto you in few words. Know you that our brother, Timothy, is
   set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you. Salute
   all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy
   salute you. Grace be with you all. Amen. Does not that blessing seem to
   come across the centuries as fresh as if we heard the Apostle speak it
   with his living lips? Oh, to feel it true tonight! "Grace be with you
   all. Amen."

Personal and Effectual Calling

   (No. 2359)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 6, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 26, 1888.

   "He calls His own sheep by name, and leads them out." John 10:3.

   IF YOU were near an Eastern village, you would probably see a large
   square, walled about with stones rolled roughly one upon another. You
   would also see a gate and, perhaps, more than one entrance into this
   enclosure. The square is empty through the day, for the flocks have
   gone into the neighboring pastures. But, towards evening, at certain
   seasons of the year, all the shepherds bring their flocks to these
   enclosures and there they are shut in for the night all together. One
   man has but a few sheep and another man has only a few sheep, while the
   more wealthy owner has larger flocks, but all are enclosed in what I
   will call the parish fold.

   Now the morning comes. The sun is up early and so is the shepherd. The
   porter is at the door and he recognizes the various sheepherders as
   they come down to the sheepfold to fetch their flocks. One shepherd
   comes and he takes away his little company. Another shepherd arrives
   and he leads away a larger number. In each case, the shepherd has no
   trouble in separating his own sheep from the rest in the fold. You and
   I would think it well near impossible--and we certainly would never be
   able to divide those differing flocks--but the shepherd does it easily
   as soon as ever he comes to the door of the fold. There are certain of
   his sheep that love him much. They are accustomed to keep very near his
   hand and often get the sweetest bits of grass, and they leap up at the
   very sound of his footsteps! They recognize his person and they come
   straightway to the gate and are ready, at once, to go out to the
   pastures with him.

   Some others, I am afraid the larger part of the flocks, are not quite
   so eager, but the shepherd speaks and they recognize his voice--and
   when he proceeds to name the sheep, one by one, for this the Eastern
   shepherd literally does, and when he begins to call them out by name,
   you can see the fleecy creatures recognizing the tones of his voice and
   responding to his call as readily as dogs with us know their master's
   voice and their own names! The sheep, thus called, push their way from
   among the different flocks and they come out and follow their shepherd,
   who leads them to the pastures that he has provided or discovered for
   them.

   Now, that is exactly what the Good Shepherd does with His sheep. He
   comes to the door of the fold. Here we are, tonight, like so many sheep
   in the enclosure. I cannot tell who among you may be Christ's sheep, or
   who may not be His. My voice has no power to separate you from your
   companions unless Christ shall use my voice and make it the echo of His
   own. I may speak as long as I will, apart from that Great Shepherd of
   the sheep, but I can make no distinction between His chosen ones and
   the rest of mankind. But if the Lord, Himself, shall come and call, His
   chosen shall detect the gracious voice. And when, one by one, He calls
   them to Himself by what theologians term "effectual calling"--(and it
   is a good expression, for it is effectual calling), then the sheep hear
   His voice and they rise up at once and follow Him, for they know His
   voice, and He leads them out.

   I am going to speak upon this text, viewing it from three points.

   I. The first point is that JESUS, THE GOOD SHEPHERD, OFTEN COMES INTO
   CONTACT WITH HIS SHEEP.

   He has bought them, He has paid the full price of their redemption. He
   has laid down His life for His sheep, so that they are effectually
   ransomed. He has gone up to Heaven to plead for them and to present
   before His Father the memorials of His death. Yet He is still with
   them, according to His Word, "Lo, I am with you always." He has not
   left His sheep here, below, simply to the care of undershepherds, much
   less are they in charge of hirelings. He has His under-shepherds,

   but He is with them and He still comes to His flock. He still calls His
   sheep by name. He still leads them out. Let us think of the various
   ways in which the Good Shepherd still comes into contact with His
   sheep.

   He came into contact with us, first, in our conversion. He had come to
   us, before, by the many pleadings of His Spirit and the many entreaties
   of His love in the days of our youth, and in years gone by, but we did
   not, then, know His voice. Our ears were not open, then, and we did not
   hear His call. He went after us into the wilderness, He sought us on
   the mountain steeps, but it was, for a time, a weary seeking and little
   came of it. Then, on a day never to be forgotten, He came with His
   effectual Grace! I say He came. Mother had come, teacher had come,
   pastor had come, books had come, sermons had come, but, last of all,
   He, Himself, came! Do you remember His coming? I can never forget the
   spot where He first met with me! The tones of His voice when, at last,
   He won my heart, are ringing as clearly in my ears, tonight, as though
   they were the marriage bells of yesterday! I can never forget how that
   call sounded, "Look! Look! Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends
   of the earth!" Then I knew His voice and responded to it, through His
   own rich Grace, and I was His and He was mine! It needed that He should
   do the wooing for Himself and should unveil His own dear face-- and
   then my heart was won and my spirit yielded itself entirely to Him! You
   remember how it happened to you, also, do you not? Think of it with joy
   and gratitude.

   Since then, the Lord Jesus has often come to us in guidance. Many of us
   can say that He has guided us through all the pathway of life and, at
   certain times, and at difficult turns of the road, He has come to us
   with such consoling counsel, and with such abounding compassion that we
   have blessed Him, and said, "He is truly near to me. How hallowed is
   this place! It is none other than the House of God and the very gate of
   Heaven." There are some few saints who could not tell you when Christ
   is not with them because He is always with them--they never lose His
   company. I wish that I could be one of their number, yet, I might
   almost claim that position, for it is a joy to me to be able to say
   that, habitually, I do realize the Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
   have said more to Him than to any other man. I have spent more time
   with Him than with any other that I have ever heard of--and my heart
   more joyously goes out to Him than to anyone beneath the sun!

   You have, perhaps, seen the rooks on the plowed land--all day going
   from field to field--following the man with the plow. Where do they
   live? Where are their nests? Wait till near the going down of the sun
   and you shall see. Now they all mount with many a caw and with hoarse
   converse with each other, and after they have hurried to and fro a
   while, away they go where those old trees that stand around the ancient
   baronial hall supply them with their house and home! Now, such is
   Christ to some of us. We are necessarily abroad through the day,
   looking after this or that work which needs attention, but the moment
   we are at liberty, we know where our nest is! It is with the hearts of
   many of us as it is with the needle in the mariner's compass. Do you
   see it? It is pointing to the pole. If you will, you may put your
   finger on that needle and turn it round. It points East now--yes, you
   turn it round till it points South. But take your finger off, it is
   back at once to its true pole! So is it with our hearts. Our hearts are
   with Him on His Throne, always magnetized and polarized for Christ, and
   we shall never rest until we get back to Him! He is in our first
   thoughts in the morning and our last meditations at night! We can truly
   say--

   "I think of You, my God, by night,

   And talk of You by day.

   Your love my treasure and delight

   Your Truth my strength sustain.

   The day is dark, the night is long,

   Humblest with thoughts of Thee,

   And dull to me the sweetest song,

   Unless its theme You be."

   And, Beloved, you know how near the Lord is in the way of sympathy. It
   is no exaggeration where we read, "In all their affliction He was
   afflicted, and the angel of His Presence saved them." You have
   sometimes been in sharp sickness and have had "cruel pains," as men
   call them. Or you have, perhaps, known the sharper pangs of poverty, or
   possibly, though I hope it is not so, some of you know what it is to be
   deserted by your friends in the hour of your greatest need, and have to
   stand alone amid the pitiless blasts when none seem willing to afford
   you shelter. Oh, but we never fully know Christ till such a time as
   that! We never realize the sweetness of His sympathetic companionship
   till He stands by us and we can say with Paul, "At my first answer no
   man stood with me, but all men forsook me. Notwithstanding the Lord

   stood with me and strengthened me." Yes, He may be a long way from the
   healthy and the strong sheep, but the Good Shepherd is always near the
   sickly and the weak! And when the heart is breaking, Christ always
   comes. He knew what heart-break meant, and desertion, and agony, and
   bloody sweat, so He can sympathize with us in our sorrows--and there is
   no hand so soft as that which was nailed to the Cross! Jesus is quick
   as a mother to feel all the sufferings of His people.

   I may also add that our Lord is always with us in intercession. This
   Divine foresight takes the practical shape of pleading for us about
   troubles that are yet to come. You see Peter. Satan had desired to have
   him, that he might sift him as wheat. And Satan had not, then, gone any
   farther than desire. His malice is very quick, but still, at that time,
   he had only desired to have Peter. Yet, when the devil had that desire,
   Christ had gone a long way beyond him--"But I have prayed for you, that
   your faith fail not." So quickly does the careful love of Christ
   outstrip all our necessities, that even the dark wings of the
   arch-enemy cannot fly so fast as the interceding love of our
   Arch-Friend, our chief Helper, our Best-Beloved! He is always with you,
   watching to see not only what you need, but what you will need--not
   only noting what are your dangers, but what are to be your dangers in
   the future! Before Satan has plucked the arrow from his quiver, and
   long before he has fitted it to the bow, Christ has already prepared
   that shield of interceding love that shall guard you from his attacks!
   O sheep of Christ, can there be happier news for you than that the Good
   Shepherd is always with you? He has said, "I will never leave you nor
   forsake you." Vineyard of the Lord, hear this, and make a song of it--
   "I, the Lord, do keep it. I will water it every moment lest any hurt
   it. I will keep it night and day." Here is a song for the vineyard of
   red wine--let all the saints sing it in their hearts tonight!

   So much, then, upon that first point, that Jesus often comes into
   contact with His sheep.

   II. Secondly, this also is clear from the text, that Jesus CALLS HIS
   SHEEP BY NAME--"He calls His own sheep by name." You Thomas, you Mary,
   and Martha, and Lazarus, and you Matthew, the publican, yes, and you,
   Mary of Mag-dala--He calls you all by name! What does this imply?

   The first thing that it means is, intimate knowledge. Beloved Friends,
   I used to have such a trustworthy memory that I not only knew the
   nearly 6,000 members of this Church by face, which I am still able to
   do, but I knew them all by name--and it was a rare thing for me to ever
   forget or make a mistake, save when certain ladies changed their names
   and I had not been made aware of it, but even then I soon rectified the
   error. But now, sometimes, I find myself unable to remember all your
   names--perhaps it is because I do not see you often. Our Lord knows all
   the myriads of His redeemed by name. There is no failure of memory with
   Him and He always sees them! His eye and His heart are towards each one
   of His people both night and day--"He calls His own sheep by name." I
   do not wish so much to preach upon this passage as I want you to put it
   into your mouth, or rather, to taste it with your spiritual palate, so
   as to get the flavor and sweetness of it. "I know My sheep," says the
   Good Shepherd! He knows not only who they are, but what they are, and
   where they are! "He calls His own sheep by name." This implies His
   intimate knowledge of them.

   Does it not signify, next, that if He calls us by our name, He is in
   the habit of speaking to us with exceeding plainness? He can so speak
   to us that we shall know what He means. His Word is dark and mysterious
   to outsiders, but when He makes us to be His sheep, He speaks very
   plainly, calling us by name. It is only when persons are on very
   familiar terms with one another that they address each other by their
   Christian name. We are, all of us, Mr. Somebody, or the Reverend Mr.
   Somebody, or Dr. Somebody, or Squire Somebody--but when we are at home,
   we are, none of us, esquires! We are Richard, or Mary. Mother never
   thinks of calling us, "Mr." and Father does not say, "Miss," but they
   call us by our name! So the Lord Jesus Christ calls us by name to show
   how plainly He speaks with us and also to let us see what gracious
   familiarity there is between the Head and the members of His mystical
   body, between the Bridegroom and His spouse, between the Well-beloved
   and His Church which is so dear to His heart!

   "He calls His own sheep by name." I think this also means intense
   personality. When anything is directed to you by name, it comes to you
   as your own with great definiteness. There is a story recorded of Mr.
   Rowland Hill which I have not seen printed in a book until just lately.
   It bears on its very face the tokens of truth, for it is just what he
   would be likely to do. He was accustomed, at family prayer, to pray for
   his servants by name, asking for such a blessing for Sarah, and such
   for Jane, and such for John, if his man-servant was present. There was
   a new cook engaged--her name was one which, in those days, was more
   common than it is now--it was, "Biddy." So, at prayer time, Mr. Hill
   prayed that God

   would bless Sarah, and the others, one by one, and would the Lord be
   pleased to save Biddy and give her a new heart and a right spirit!

   After prayer was over and the servants had gone away, there was a
   gentle knock at the study door and the good minister said, "Come in,
   what is it?" "Please, Mr. Hill, I am very glad to be in your service
   and I hope I shall find it a comfortable place, but would you kindly
   not mention my name in prayer? I have not been accustomed to it and I
   do not think I could bear it." "All right, Biddy," he said. "I try
   never to do anything that is displeasing. I am sorry you should be
   annoyed and I must not mention your name in prayer again." She went to
   her work and the next time of family prayer Mr. Hill prayed in the
   following manner. After having pleaded for blessings in general, He
   said, "Now, Lord, be pleased to bless Sarah, and convert her, and lead
   her in Your way." And so he mentioned the rest of them and then he
   added, "Lord, I may not ask You to bless Biddy because she earnestly
   requests that she may not be mentioned to You in prayer." The prayer
   was over and there was, again, a knock at the door. "Come in," said Mr.
   Hill. It was that cook, again. "Please, Mr. Hill," she said, "I didn't
   want you to pray like that. I didn't want to be left out in prayer,
   Sir. Please, you may mention my name if you like." "Just so, Biddy," he
   said, "I will do it and God will bless you, I do not doubt."

   Well now, there is a good deal in that way of personally mentioning
   people in prayer, because they then feel that you are praying for
   them--and when the Lord Jesus Christ calls His own sheep by name, they
   distinctly recognize that He speaks to them! Have not some of you known
   what it is to be spoken to, from this pulpit, by the Lord Jesus Christ,
   quite as distinctly as if I had mentioned your name and address? You
   know you have! This is the way in which some of you were first brought
   to Christ. It was not merely to sinners, but to you as a sinner! It was
   not merely to all men, but to you as distinctly singled out, that the
   Gospel of Jesus Christ came with power! To show the personality of His
   Gospel, He calls men by name.

   This call also teaches us the wonderful suitability of Christ's Words
   to our needs. There will often be, in a text of Scripture, the very
   message that is needed by a poor wearied spirit. How often, too, will
   the Lord prepare the mind of a hearer till the preacher's words shall
   be as suitable as if he had been told all about the unknown person!
   Friends sometimes write to me and say, "We are going to bring a friend
   of such and such a sort to the Tabernacle." They let me know in the
   hope that I may make my message suitable. Do not let me know whom you
   bring! I do not want to know because I cannot suit my sermon to your
   friend. Bring your friend, with your own hearty and earnest prayer, but
   without my knowing anything about it! God will speak through His
   servant what He wishes to have said--and it will come with greater
   force and power than any thoughtful love can suggest. Oh, may God speak
   to some of you tonight! May you be called out by your name and feel in
   your heart, "Jesus calls me, and I will go to Him at once, and put my
   trust in Him"!

   III. Now I am going to close with this third remark, THAT THIS CALL BY
   NAME COMES AT SPECIAL TIMES. I will mention four special seasons when
   the Lord's personal call is heard.

   First, it comes at conversion. I have, perhaps, already said enough
   about that. There is a call to sinners by name--the Gospel preached in
   general is all very well, but it is the Gospel preached in particular
   that saves men. If you have come in here, tonight, just to hear as one
   of a crowd, you will probably get nothing by coming. But when you sit
   here, saying, "Lord, speak to me! Lord help me to apply every word to
   my own case! Help me to lay hold of every promise that is
   quoted!"--that is the way to gain the blessing! They say that the times
   are improving and that business is looking up, but when I meet with a
   friend who is in a certain trade, he says, "Business is not looking up
   my way. I do not find that I have any more customers than I used to
   have, or that I can get the slightest increase of profit on my goods."
   Just so, Friends, you do not profit by the general blessing, do you?
   You need a particular blessing to come to your own soul, for, in this
   respect, as it is with temporal things, so it is with eternal
   things--we need the blessing for ourselves.

   Now, in business we have to check this kind of selfishness, but in
   spiritual things we may excite it, for we need men to "covet earnestly
   the best gifts." One good old man said, "The Lord's people are a
   covetous people." "Oh!" said one, "they ought to get rid of all
   covetousness." "Yes," he answered, "except that spiritual covetousness
   to which we are exhorted by Paul, when he says, 'Covet earnestly the
   best gifts."' That is quite true! We should covet earnestly the best
   things, even heavenly things. Seek these things for yourselves and rest
   not satisfied until you have them! May the Lord by conversion call you
   by name, that you may have the first of these best gifts!

   I have known Him, in the second place, call some by name to fresh
   service. Did He not say, "Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work
   whereunto I have called them"? Sometimes there is a Sunday School
   teacher needed. There sits a

   young man in this place, tonight, who ought to be in the Sunday school.
   I shall not call him by name. Perhaps he would be offended if I did so,
   but I hope that the Lord will call him. There sits a Christian woman,
   here, who should be engaged in the school, or who ought to take a tract
   district. Possibly there is a Christian woman here, of years and
   knowledge, who ought to be teaching a Bible class, or conducting a
   mothers' meeting. Perhaps I speak to some large-hearted man, with
   considerable ability, who spends all his time on his business and does
   no work for Christ. He ought to have a Mission Hall and support it,
   himself--he has money enough and he has talent enough. Some of you have
   never had an idea of what you yet can do for the Lord--and the only way
   to find it out is to try to do something for the Savior! There are too
   many "retiring" people among us who are so retiring as to get to be
   lazy! Come out of your hiding place, my dear Friend! No, I will not
   mention your name, though I know some of this sort--and I have their
   names almost on my tongue, but I will not mention them. But I do pray
   the Master to mention your names so that you may consecrate your
   substance, your time, your ability, to the work of the Lord somewhere
   in this great perishing London, or somewhere in this great nation where
   so many perish for lack of knowledge! "He calls His own sheep by name,
   and leads them out" into wider spheres, into larger enterprises, into
   fuller consecration to His service! May He now do that with many of
   you, my Brothers and Sisters!

   Sometimes the Lord calls His saints by name and leads them out into
   higher attainments in the Divine Life. Come, you who have been always
   halting, doubting, fearing--it need not be so with you! The Lord
   invites your faith to full assurance, your love to enthusiasm, your
   prayer to wrestling, your desire to expectation and your present
   imperfect service for Him to the complete dedication of yourself--body,
   soul and spirit--to His cause! We have not yet attained all we may
   reach, dear Friends. There is a something yet beyond and to this the
   Master calls us. "But I cannot rise to it," says one. "With man, it is
   impossible, but with God all things are possible." You may be strong,
   useful, joyful--you need not always be weak, careless and sorrowful!
   Oh, that there might come into your soul, by the breath of the Divine
   Spirit, an increase of spiritual life till you shall have it more
   abundantly and shall bless and praise the name of the Lord!

   But, lastly, there will soon come another call to some of us--and we
   would be very, very slow to shrink from it. I mean the call Home to
   Heaven. I know not to whom it may come this week, or next, but stand
   you all ready for it. It will come by the messenger appointed by Him
   who loves you and who longs to have you where He is, that you may
   behold His Glory! Perhaps the summons may come to you as it came to
   Christiana, with this token--"an arrow sharpened with love, let easily
   into her heart." She knew what the token meant and she welcomed her
   Lord's call! It will come in different ways. One aged Christian, who
   was dying of cancer, met another who was greatly suffering from another
   painful disease. "Well, well, my Brother," she said, "we must all have
   something to die of, you know, or we should live here forever. Do not
   let us quarrel with the messenger the Lord sends." He will send the
   proper messenger in His own good time and in the right way.

   Rowland Hill, whom I have already quoted, was sometimes very odd in his
   expressions. He went, when he was very old, to see a godly woman at
   Everton who was nearly ninety, and he told her that when she got Home,
   he hoped she would mention him up there, for he had almost begun to
   think that they had forgotten him--he had grown so old that he would be
   glad to be going Home to his dear Lord and to see those blessed
   Johns--John, the beloved disciple and John Bunyan, and some other Johns
   that he mentioned. It was not long before he went home, too, and he
   almost overtook her before she could deliver his message! Well, whether
   we live to be as old as he, or die in middle life, or in the early days
   of our conversion, it does not matter. The Lord will send the messenger
   and the messenger will know us--and we shall hear the voice that says,
   "Arise and come away." I would have you standing with your wings
   outstretched, as the cherubim abode over the Mercy Seat, with their
   wings outspread, as if ready to die at the Divine bidding!

   Are you afraid? Afraid of going Home, dear child? Are you so fond of
   boarding school that you have no desire for the holidays? Are you
   afraid, dear Heart, afraid of the wedding day, and of the Bridegroom,
   and of the everlasting joy? Soldier, are you afraid of the victory and
   the crown? No, no! Instead of fearing, let us begin to anticipate the
   bliss of being "forever with the Lord." God help us to joy and rejoice,
   wearing, today, by faith, the chaplet which we shall soon wear in
   reality, striking even now the harp strings with the joyous fingers
   which, before long, shall sweep the chords throughout eternity, as we
   sing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, unto Him that loved us, and
   washed us from our sins in His own blood, to Him be Glory and dominion
   forever and ever. Amen."

   We will close our service by singing this verse--

   "Forever with the Lord! Amen! So let it be!

   Life from the dead is in that word, 'Tis immortality!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 10:1-31.

   Verse 1. Verily, verily, I say unto you. When our Divine Lord and
   Master was about to speak with deep solemnity, He usually commenced His
   discourse by repeating the word, "verily"--"Verily verily, I say unto
   you." The authority of Christ is the basis of our religion. He does not
   quote from others, but He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you." Jesus
   is Incarnate Wisdom, He is God, Himself, and what He says is Infallibly
   true and is to be accepted without question.

   1. He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up
   some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. Those who professed
   to be the shepherds of the sheep, but did not come according to
   previous Revelation by the way of the Old Testament types and
   prophecies, were nothing better than thieves and robbers. They could
   have no design in palming themselves off upon the people except to
   steal from them and to do them harm.

   2. 3. But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
   To him the porter opens. John the Baptist was, so to speak, the porter
   who recognized the Christ and opened the door to Him. John said,
   concerning Jesus, when the Spirit abode upon Him, "I saw, and bare
   record that this is the Son of God."

   3. And the sheep hear his voice. His chosen ones, those whom the Father
   had given Him, the peculiar people--"the sheep"--at once recognized the
   Presence of the Shepherd when they heard His voice.

   3. 4. And he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. And when
   he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow
   him. "He goes before them." There is never an act prescribed by Christ
   for His followers but He first performs it, Himself--"He goes before
   them." Other professed leaders drove the flock before them. The Jewish
   teachers laid heavy burdens upon men and grievous to be borne, which
   they, themselves, did not touch with one of their fingers. It is the
   distinguishing mark of the Good Shepherd that, "when He puts forth His
   own sheep, He goes before them." You are not bidden to do, as a
   servant, what the Master would not do. Even if it is the menial
   occupation of washing the saints' feet, He, Himself has done it--you
   are to lay down your life for the Brethren, for Jesus, Himself, has
   done that--"He goes before them, and the sheep follow him."

   4. For they know His voice. There is an instinct, a God-given instinct,
   in the elect of God, by which they know Christ's voice. When once the
   Spirit of God has changed their natures, they have an open ear for the
   Words of Jesus-- "the sheep follow Him: for they know His voice."

   5. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
   they know not the voice of strangers. Others will follow the stranger,
   but the sheep will not do so. We read of some, that they were full of
   such deceivableness that they would, if it were possible, deceive the
   very elect, but there is an, "if it were possible." The Lord's true
   sheep cannot, will not long be deceived--"they know not the voice of
   strangers..."

   6. This parable spoke Jesus unto them: but they understood not what
   things they were which He spoke unto them. We need not only to listen
   to Christ's Words, but we need an interpreter to explain them to us.
   Jesus is needed to make His people understand His own teaching. He--

   "IsHis own interpreter, And He will make it plain."

   7. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you.
   Still, you see, Jesus speaks with the same authority! He is an intense
   dogmatist. He leans not upon the arguments of human reason, nor upon
   the precedents of former teachers. Again He said just this, "Verily,
   verily, I say unto you"--

   7. I am the Door of the sheep. Is He both Shepherd and Door? Yes, and
   many other figures meet in Him--all creation cannot set Him forth
   completely. We may multiply all the types and symbols and analogies of
   Nature, and yet not fully picture our Lord Jesus Christ. Dr. Watts
   truly wrote--

   "Nature, to make His beauties known, Must mingle colors not her own."

   We must know the Creator as well as the created if we would set forth
   Christ to the fullest.

   8. All that ever came before Me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep
   did not hear them. Some people did hear them-- one pretended messiah
   and another led different companies of deluded followers after them,
   "but the sheep did not hear them." The Prophetess Anna, the holy
   waiting Simeon, the guileless Nathanael--these did not hear them--their
   ears had not yet caught the mystic tone which belongs only to the true
   Shepherd's voice--"The sheep did not hear them."

   9. I am the Door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
   shall go in and out, and find pasture. Is Christ the Door of salvation
   to you? Some teach that Baptism is the door. Others talk of a thousand
   things as being doors of salvation, but it is Christ, alone, who is the
   Door, and you must enter into salvation by simple trustful faith in
   Him. What does a sheep do in order to enter the fold? Does it perform
   any tricks? No, it simply goes in by the doorway. Poor wandering sheep,
   do the same, for Jesus says, "By Me if any man enter in, he shall be
   saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture."

   10. The thief comes not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
   I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
   abundantly. You who have eternal life may have more of it! You may be
   spiritually stronger, more vigorous, more clear of eye, more happy of
   heart, more active in service. Life is a blessing, but abundant life is
   a greater blessing! We need not merely to breathe, to live, as I saw
   one about an hour ago. He had life, but too little life even to
   speak--we need to have much life, that we may enjoy it, and may use it
   for the glory of God! Christ has come that we might have life more
   abundantly--may we all make use of His coming to that end!

   11-13. I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd gives His life for the
   sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the Shepherd, whose own the
   sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees:
   and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep. The hireling flees
   because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep. How many there
   are of whom we have reason to fear that they must be hirelings because,
   when they see false doctrine and error abroad, they do not oppose it!
   They are willing to put up with anything for the sake of peace and
   quiet. They flee as soon as they see the wolf, but he most copies his
   Master who will not flee on any terms. Certainly he will not flee when
   wolves are about, for is he not set for the defense of the sheep, that
   he may chase the wolf away, even though he gets to himself many a
   scratch and many a wound? Our Master never fled from the wolves. He
   might have done so--our Good Shepherd might have gone back to Heaven
   and escaped Gethsemane, the gruel scourges and the wounds upon the
   tree--but that was not His course of action. The sheep were His own
   and, therefore, it was a joy to Him to interpose Himself between them
   and the destroyer, and He did so.

   14-16. I am the Good Shepherd and know My sheep, and am known of Mine.
   As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down My
   life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold.
   Not yet brought in, still wandering away on the barren hills. Them also
   I must bring. "I must," says Jesus, and, as men say, "must is for the
   king." There is a Divine necessity laid upon Christ our Savior! He must
   save the people, the sheep whom His Father gave Him-- "them also I must
   bring." Oh, wondrous love that holds even the Omnipotent Savior in
   bonds and puts Him under the sacred constraint of this mighty,
   "must"--"them also I must bring."

   16. And they shall hear My voice. How like a king, Jesus talks! It is
   the Royal Shepherd who says, "They shall hear My voice." But suppose
   they will not hear it? "They shall hear My voice." But suppose they
   stop their ears against the Gospel. "They shall hear My voice," and
   Christ's, "shall," is always backed by Omnipotence!

   16-18. And there shall be one fold, and one Shepherd. Therefore does My
   Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again.
   No man takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to
   lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This Commandment have I
   received of My Father. Herein lay much of the effect of the death of
   Christ, that it was voluntary, that He had power to lay down His life,
   the right to lay it down and the right to take it again. When any
   ordinary man dies, he only pays "the debt of nature." If he were even
   to die for his friend, he would simply pay a little earlier that debt
   which he must ultimately pay! But the Christ was Immortal and He needed
   not to die except that He had put Himself under Covenant bonds to
   suffer for His sheep.

   19-26. There was a division, therefore, again among the Jews for these
   sayings. And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad, why do you
   listen to Him? Others said, These are not the words of Him that has a
   devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? And it was at Jerusalem,
   the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the
   Temple in Solomon's porch. Then came the Jews round about Him and said
   unto Him, How long will You make us to doubt? If You are the

   Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I told you, and you
   believed not: the works that I do in My Father's name, they bear
   witness of Me. But you believe not because you are not of My sheep, as
   I said unto you. This was a brave utterance of our Lord. Those who are
   Christ's chosen and redeemed people, in due time come to believe in
   Him, but He does not say to the Jews, "You are not My sheep because you
   do not believe." He tells them the same Truth of God in another way,
   "Your not believing is a proof that you are not My sheep."

   27-31. My sheep hear My voice and I know them, and they follow Me. And
   I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out of My hand. My Father, which gave them to
   Me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My
   Father's hand. I and My Father are One. Then the Jews took up stones
   again to stone Him. These are the ultimate arguments of
   unbelief--stones! There is no sense in stones, no reason in violence,
   yet ungodly men, when they have nothing else to use, throw stones at
   the Teacher of the Truth of God! Is this generous? Is this wise? If you
   do not believe the testimony, at least leave the Testifier alone! Yet
   it is not in the nature of men to do so. Their stones are always ready
   when they are unable to answer the Christ. "Then the Jews took up
   stones again to stone Him." They had done it previously when He said
   unto them, "Before Abraham was, I Am." But as He escaped their malice,
   then, so did He at this time.

Come, My Beloved!

   (No. 2360)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 13, 1984.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   4, 1888.

   "Make haste, my Beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart upon the
   mountains of spices." Song of Solomon 8:14.

   THE Song of Songs describes the love of Jesus Christ to His people and
   it ends with an intense desire on the part of the Church that the Lord
   Jesus should come back to her. The last word of the lover to the
   Beloved One is, "Speed Your return; make haste and come back." Is it
   not somewhat singular that, as the last verse of the Book of Love has
   this note in it, so the last verses of the whole Book of God, which I
   may also call the Book of Love, have that same thought in them? At the
   20th verse of the last chapter of the Revelation, we read, "He which
   testifies these things says, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so,
   come, Lord Jesus." The Song of Love and the Book of Love end in almost
   the same way--with a strong desire for Christ's speedy return.

   Are your hearts, dear Friends, in tune with that desire? They ought to
   be, yet have not some of you almost forgotten that Jesus is to come a
   second time? Refresh your memories. Others of you, who know that He
   will come--have you not thought of it as a doctrine that might be laid
   on the shelf? Have you not been without any desire for His glorious
   appearing? Is this right? That Song of Solomon is the central Book of
   the Bible. It is the innermost shrine of Divine Revelation, the Holy of
   Holies of Scripture. And if you are living in communion with God, you
   will love that Book, you will catch its spirit and you will be inclined
   to cry with the spouse, "Make haste, my Beloved." If you have no
   longings for Christ's appearance, no desires for His speedy return,
   surely your heart is sick and your love is faint! I fear that you are
   getting into a lukewarm state. I believe that our relationship to the
   Second Advent of Christ may be used as a thermometer with which to tell
   the degree of our spiritual heat. If we have strong desires, longing
   desires, burning desires for the coming of the Lord, we may hope that
   it is well with us! But if we have no such desires, I think, at best,
   we must be somewhat careless, perhaps, to take the worst view of our
   case--we are sadly declining in Divine Grace.

   I. Well now, to come to our text, I want you to notice, first, WHAT THE
   CHURCH, HERE, CALLS HER LORD--"Make haste, my Beloved."

   I will have only a few words upon this point. I am hardly going to
   preach, tonight, but just to talk familiarly to you, and I want you to
   let your hearts talk. Observe, the spouse first calls her Lord,
   "Beloved," and secondly, "my Beloved."

   Christ is our "Beloved." This is a word of affection and our Lord Jesus
   Christ is the object of affection to us. If you read the Bible,
   especially if you read the New Testament and study the life of Christ
   and yet you only admire it, and say to yourself, "Jesus Christ was a
   wonderful Being," you do not yet know Him! You have but a very
   indistinct idea of Him. If, after reading that life, you sit down and
   dissect it, and say to yourself, coolly, calmly, deliberately, "So far
   as is practicable, I will try and imitate Christ," you do not yet know
   Him--you have not come near to the real Christ as of yet. If any man
   should say, "I am near the fire," and yet he is not warm, I would
   question the truth of his words, and though he might say, "I can see
   the fire. I can tell you the appearance of the coals. I can describe
   the bright flames that play about the stove," yet if he were not warmed
   at all, I would still think that he was mistaken, or that there was
   some medium that interposed between him and the fire at which he said
   he was looking.

   But when you really come to see Jesus and to say, "I love Him! My heart
   yearns toward Him. My delight is in Him. He has won my love and holds
   it in His own heart," then you begin to know Him! Brothers and Sisters,
   true religion has many sides to it. True religion is practical. It is
   also contemplative, but it is not true religion at all if it is not
   full of love and affection. Jesus must reign in your heart or else,
   though you may give Him what place you like in your head, you

   have not truly received Him. To Jesus, beyond all others, is applicable
   this title of the Beloved, for they who know Him love Him. Yes, if ever
   love had emphasis in it, it is the love which true Believers give to
   Christ! We do well when we sing--

   "I love You because You have first loved me,

   And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.

   I love You for wearing the thorns on Your brow--

   If ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now.

   I will love You in life, I will love You in death

   And praise You as long as You lend me breath!

   And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,

   If ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now." We may also go beyond that
   point, as the hymn does, and say--

   "In mansions of glory and endless delight, I'll ever adore You in
   Heaven so bright; I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow; If
   ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now." Our love to Jesus begins with
   trust. We experience His goodness and then we love Him in return. "We
   love Him because He first loved us." They say that love is blind. I
   should think it is, from what I have seen of it in some people, but
   love to Christ might have ten thousand eyes and yet be justified in
   loving Him. The more you see Him, the more you know Him! The more you
   live with Him, the more reason will you have for loving Him. There will
   never come a time in which you will have to question whether you were
   right to surrender your heart to Him, but even throughout the eternal
   ages you shall, in the happinesses of His blessed company, feel that
   you were, in fact, more than justified in calling Him your Beloved!

   That is the first part of the name the spouse gives to her Lord--no,
   not the first--the first part of the name is, "my." She calls Him, "my
   Beloved."

   Brothers and Sisters, this signifies appropriation, so that the two
   words together mean affection and appropriation--"My Beloved." If
   nobody else loves Him, I do. This is a distinguishing affection and I
   love Him because He belongs to me! He is mine, He has given Himself to
   me and I have chosen Him because He first chose me. He is "my Beloved."
   I am not ashamed to put Him in front of all others and when men say,
   "What is your Beloved more than another beloved?" I can tell them that
   "My Beloved" is more than all the earthly beloveds put together! It is
   a delightful thing to get hold of Christ with both hands, as Thomas did
   when he said, "My Lord and my God." There he held Him with a
   double-handed grip and would not let Him go. It is sweet and saving
   even to come into contact with Him, as the woman did who touched the
   fringe of His garment, but, oh, to take Him up in your arms! To hold
   Him with both hands and say, "This Christ is mine. By a daring faith,
   warranted by the Word of God, I take this Christ to be mine, to have
   and to hold, for better or worse, and neither life nor death shall ever
   part me from Him who is 'my Beloved!'"

   Now, there is a sweet name for the Lord Jesus Christ. My dear Hearers,
   can you speak of Jesus in that way, "my Beloved"? One who can, by the
   Spirit of God, say this, has uttered two words that have more eloquence
   in them than there is in all the orations of Demosthenes! He who cannot
   truly say this, though he may speak with the tongues of men and of
   angels, yet, since he has not this charity, this Divine Love in his
   heart, it profits him nothing! Oh, that every one of you could say, "My
   Beloved! My Beloved!"

   Do you all really know what saving faith is? It is the appropriation to
   one's own self of Christ in His true and proper Character as God has
   revealed Him. Can you make this appropriation? "Oh," says one, "I am
   afraid I would be stealing salvation if I did!" Listen! So long as you
   can get Christ anyway, you may have Him. There is never any stealing of
   that which is freely given! The difficulty is not about any rights that
   you have, for you have no rights whatever in this matter, but come and
   take what God gives to you, though you have no claim to it. Soul, take
   Christ, tonight, and if you take Him, you shall never lose Him! I was
   going to say, if you do even steal Him, so long as you do but take Him
   to yourself, He will never withdraw Himself from your grasp. It is
   written, "Him that comes to Me , I will in no wise cast out." Some come
   properly and Christ does not cast them out. But there are some who come
   improperly--they come, as it were, limping on a wooden leg, or perhaps
   only creeping or crawling. It does not matter how you come to Christ,
   as long as you

   really come to Him--He will never cast you out! Get to Him anyway you
   can and, if you once come to Him, you may plead that blessed promise of
   His, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   I have told you, before, that some years ago I felt a great depression
   of spirit. I knew whom I had believed, but somehow, I could not get the
   comfort out of the Truths of God I preached. I even began to wonder
   whether I was really saved and, having a holiday, and being away from
   home, I went to a Wesleyan Chapel. A local preacher occupied the pulpit
   that morning. While he preached a sermon full of the Gospel, the tears
   flowed from my eyes and I was in such a perfect delirium of joy on
   hearing the Gospel, which I so seldom have an opportunity of doing,
   that I said, "Oh, yes, there is spiritual life within me, for the
   Gospel can touch my heart and stir my soul." When I went to thank the
   good man for his sermon, he looked at me and he could hardly believe
   his eyes. He said, "Are you not Mr. Spurgeon? "I replied, "Yes." "Dear,
   dear," said he, "why, that is your sermon that I preached this
   morning!" Yes, I knew it was, and that was one reason why I was so
   comforted by it, because I felt that I could take my own medicine, and
   I said to myself, "There now, that which I have seen to have a certain
   effect upon others has had the same effect upon me." I asked the
   preacher to my inn to dinner and we rejoiced together to think that he
   should have been led to give the people one of my sermons so that I
   should be fed out of my own cupboard. I know this, that whatever I may
   be, there is nothing that moves me like the Gospel of Christ! Do not
   many of you feel just as I do?

   II. Now I will lead you on to the second division of my subject. I have
   shown you what the Church calls her Lord. Now, in the second place, I
   will tell you WHENCE SHE CALLS HIM--"Make haste, my Beloved, and be
   like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of spices." What does
   that mean? She cries to Him to come from the place where He now is,
   which she calls, "the mountains of spices."

   Readers of Solomon's Song know that there are four mountains spoken of
   in the Song. The first set of mountains is mentioned in the 17th verse
   of the second chapter of the Song where we read of the mountains of
   division--"Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
   Beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of
   Bether," or, the mountains of division, the divided crags, or the
   mountains that divide. Well now, Beloved, this was Christ's first
   coming! There were mountains of division--our sins and God's
   justice--like great mountains, divided us. How could God's love ever
   come to us, or how could we get to it? There were mountains of division
   and, as we looked at them, we said, "They are impassable! Nobody can
   ever climb those lofty crags, or scale those awful precipices, or cross
   those dread abysses! These mountains effectually separate a guilty soul
   from a holy God and, my Brothers and Sisters, there was no way over
   those hills till Jesus came like a roe or a young hart! Roes and harts
   can stand on crags where men's heads turn giddy and they fall--and our
   Divine Master was able to stand where we could not. He came leaping
   over the mountains of our sins and over the hills of Divine Justice,
   and He came even to us and opened up a way over the mountains of
   Be-ther, the mountains of division, by which God comes to us and we
   come to God. And now, instead of division, there is a sacred union!

   That was Christ's first coming, over the mountains of division.

   But there were other mountains beside those--which you read of a little
   further on in the Song--these were the mountains of the leopards, the
   dens of the lions. Turn to the fourth chapter, at the eighth
   verse--"Come with Me from Lebanon, My spouse, with Me from Lebanon:
   look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the
   lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards." When Christ came the
   first time, He met with fierce opposition from sin, and death, and
   Hell. These were the lions--these were the leopards--and our great
   Champion had to go hunting them and they hunted Him. You know how these
   grim lions met Him and how they tore Him--they rent His hands and His
   feet, and His side. Do you not remember how that great lion of the Pit
   came leaping upon Him--how He received him upon His breast, like a
   greater Samson--and though He fell in the death-struggle, He tore that
   lion asunder, as though he had been a kid and cast him down? As for His
   other enemies, He could truly say, "O Death, where is your sting? O
   Grave, where is your victory? "Our Well-Beloved came to us over the
   mountains of the leopards and the dens of the lions, more than
   conqueror through the greatness of His love! Do you not see Him as He
   comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, traveling in the
   greatness of His strength, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save?
   In spite of all opposition, He finished the work of our redemption!

   So Jesus came to us over the mountains of separation, and over the
   mountains of the leopards.

   But there is a third mountain mentioned in this wonderful poetical
   Book, and that is, the mountain of myrrh. In the sixth chapter at the
   second verse, it says, "My Beloved is gone down into His garden, to the
   beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies." It is
   called a garden, but in the sixth verse of the fourth chapter it is
   called a mountain-- "Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, I
   will get Me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense."
   You know the story well. After Jesus had come over the mountains of our
   sins. After He had killed the lions and the leopards that stood in our
   way, He gave up His soul into His Father's hands and loving friends
   took His body, and wrapped it in white linen, and Joseph of Arimathea
   and Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes to preserve His blessed body,
   that matchless case of a perfect Soul and, having wrapped Him, they
   laid Him in a new tomb, which thus became the garden or mountain of
   myrrh. A bitter thing was that grave wherein He buried all our sin,
   that grave out of which He came victorious over death, that grave out
   of which He rose that He might justify His people!

   That was the mountain of myrrh to which Jesus went for a very brief
   season. Scarcely three days was He there, but I think I can hear His
   Church standing at the tomb and saying, "Make haste, my Beloved! Be
   like a roe, or a young hart, and come quickly from Your sleep with the
   dead in the mountains of myrrh." It was but a short time that He was
   there, even as He said to His disciples, "A little while and you shall
   not see Me; and again a little while, and you shall see Me." Soon was
   that slumber over and when He woke, as Samson carried away the gate of
   Gaza, so Christ arose and took up the gates of Death--posts and bar and
   all--and carried them away and neither death nor Hell can ever bring
   them back again! By the Resurrection of Christ, the tomb is opened,
   never to be closed again!

   The "mountain of myrrh" is the third that is mentioned in the Song, but
   our text refers to "the mountains of spices." I am not stretching this
   passage, or drawing a lesson where there is none--the mountains of
   spices are those places where Jesus dwells at this very moment at the
   right hand of God. It is from there that we now call Him with the
   spouse when she said, "Make haste, my Beloved, and be like a roe or a
   young hart upon the mountains of spices.

   What are these spices? Are they not Christ's infinite merits which
   perfume Heaven and earth? The foul corruption of our sins is not
   perceptible because of the mountains of spices! One single sin would be
   vile enough to pollute a universe-- what, then, were all our sins put
   together? Behold this wondrous sanitary power of Divine Grace! These
   mountains of spices more than nullify the foulness of our sins!
   Christ's merit is perpetually before the eyes of His Father so that no
   longer does He perceive our sins!

   What shall I say next of these mountains of spices? Are they not our
   Lord's perpetual and prevailing prayers? He intercedes for the people
   before the Throne of God. He is that great Angel from whose swinging
   censer there goes up, continually, the incense of intercession. The
   prayers of saints are presented by Him to His Father with all His own
   merit added to them. These are the mountains of spices--Christ's
   infinite merits and His ceaseless prayers, His undying supplications to
   the great Father on behalf of all His people!

   In consequence of this, I think I may say that the praises of His
   glorified people, the sweet music of the harps of the redeemed, the
   everlasting symphonies of the spirits of just men made perfect and
   cleansed by His atoning blood--are not these as sweet spices before
   God? Yes, all Heaven is perfumed with everything that is precious and
   acceptable, full of a sweet savor unto God and a delightful fragrance
   to all His people! Now, this is where Jesus is now--not here in this
   foul, polluted world, but up yonder He rests in the mountains of
   spices! And the prayer of His Church is continually, "Come, my Beloved!
   Make haste, my Beloved! Be like a roe or a young hart upon the
   mountains of spices."

   III. That brings me to what is really the gist, the main point, the
   arrowhead of the text. We have noticed what the Church calls her Lord,
   and whence she calls Him. Now, thirdly, note HOW SHE CALLS HIM. She
   says, "Make haste, my Beloved, make haste."

   Why is it that all the Church of God and each individual Christian in
   particular, should be found anxious for the speedy coming of our Lord
   Jesus Christ? I think, surely, that this is the result of true love.
   Does not love always wish to see the object on which its heart is
   fixed? When your dearest one parts from you for a while, do you not
   always wish for a speedy return? The parting is painful--it were
   bitter, indeed, if you did not expect to meet again. So you say, "Be no
   longer absent than you are forced to be. Come home as speedily as you
   can." Where there is great love, there gets to be great longing, and
   that longing sometimes becomes so vehement as to be well-near
   impatient. May not the Church that mourns her absent Lord sigh and cry
   till He returns? Is not this the very language of intense love, "Make
   haste, my Be-

   loved, and return to me"? If we love our Lord, we shall long for His
   appearing, you can be sure of that--it is the natural result of ardent
   affection.

   But, notwithstanding this, Beloved, we sometimes need certain
   incentives to stir up our souls to cry for our Lord's return. One
   reason that ought to make the Believer long for Christ's coming is that
   it will end this conflict. Our lot is cast in a wretched time, when
   many things are said and done that grieve and vex God's Holy Spirit and
   all who are in sympathy with Him. Sometimes it is false doctrine that
   is proclaimed--and if you preach the Truth of God, they smite you on
   the mouth and then you say to yourself, "Would God the Lord would
   come!" At other times, it is sheer blasphemy that is uttered, when men
   say, "The Lord delays His coming," or when they talk as if He were not
   Lord, as if His Gospel were no Gospel and His salvation were worn out.
   Then we say, "Make no tarrying, O our God! Come, Lord, and tarry not!"
   We grow almost impatient, then, for His coming.

   And, dear Friend, when you see the oppression of the poor, when you
   hear the cry of the needy, when you know that many of them are ground
   down to bitter poverty and yet are struggling hard to earn a bare
   pittance, you say, "Lord, will this state of things always exist? Shall
   not these wrongs be righted? Oh, that He would come who will judge the
   people righteously, and vindicate the cause of the poor and the
   oppressed!"

   Then we look on the professing Church and we see how lukewarm it is,
   how honeycombed it is with heresy and worldliness, and how often the
   Church that ought to honor Christ insults Him and He is wounded in the
   house of His friends. We say, "Will not this evil soon be at an end?
   Will not the conflict speedily be over?" Oh, how have I stood in the
   midst of the battle, when the deadly shafts have flown about me on the
   right hand and on the left and, wounded full sore, I have cried, "Will
   not the King, Himself, soon come, and shall I not, before long, hear
   the sound of those blessed feet whose every step means victory, and
   whose Presence is eternal life?" "Come, Lord! Make haste, my Beloved!
   Come to the rescue of Your weak and feeble servants! Come, come, come,
   we beseech You!" Put yourself into this great fight for the faith and
   if you have to bear the brunt of the battle, you will soon be as eager
   as I am that Jesus should make haste and come to your relief. You,
   also, will cry, "Make haste, my Beloved," when you think what wonders
   He will work at His coming!

   What will Christ do at His coming? He will raise the dead. My eyes
   shall see Him in that day. "I know that my Redeemer lives, and that He
   shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin,
   worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." When Christ
   shall come the second time and that blast, of which we sang just now,
   "the loudest and the last," shall ring through earth and Heaven, then
   shall the dead men arise! There are newly made graves. The mourners'
   tears are not yet wiped away. There are the graves of many who have
   gone Home long ago and we remember them, and we say, "Would God that
   Christ would come and spoil death of those precious relics! Oh, that He
   would reanimate those bodies and call together the dry bones and bid
   them live!" Come, Lord! Come, Lord! Make no tarrying, we beseech You!

   And when He comes, Beloved, remember that then shall be the time of the
   glory of His people--"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun
   in the Kingdom of their Father." Slander will be rolled away in the day
   when Christ comes. The wicked shall awake to everlasting contempt, but
   the righteous to an everlasting justification. They shall be clear of
   every accusation in that day and then shall they sit on the Throne of
   God with their Lord. They were with Him in His humiliation--they shall
   be with Him in His Glory! They, too, were despised and rejected of men
   as He was, but in that day, none shall dare to despise them, for every
   saint shall be seen to be a king and a son of the King! Oh, the glory
   that awaits His people in the day of His coming! "It does not yet
   appear what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we
   shall be like He; for we shall see Him as He is." Well may the child of
   God say, "Make haste, my Beloved!" Oh, for the sheathing of the sword
   and the waving of the palm! Oh, for the drying of the tear and the
   handling of the harp of gold! Oh, for the ending of the doubt and the
   trouble and the beginning of the everlasting enjoyment and the eternal
   serenity at the right hand of the Ever-Blessed One!

   Still, there is another reason why we say, "Make haste, my Beloved." It
   is this. We desire to share in Christ's Glory, but our chief desire is
   that our Lord may be glorified. I believe I shall have the support of
   every Christian heart when I say that we would a thousand times rather
   that Christ were glorified than that we should be honored. Many years
   ago, after the Surrey Music Hall accident, I well-near lost my reason
   through distress of heart. I was broken down in spirit and thought
   that, perhaps, I might never preach again. I was but a young man and it
   was a great burden that crushed me into

   the dust through that terrible accident. But one passage of Scripture
   brought me recovery in a moment. I was alone and as I was thinking,
   this text came to my mind, "Him has God exalted with His right hand to
   be a Prince and a Savior," and I said to myself, "Is that so? Is Jesus
   Christ exalted? Then I do not care if I die in a ditch! If Christ is
   exalted to be a Prince and a Savior, that is enough for me."

   I distinctly recollect remembering what is recorded of some of
   Napoleon's soldiers who were well-near cut to pieces--lying dying,
   bleeding, suffering, agonizing on the battlefield--but when the Emperor
   rode by, every man lifted himself up as best he could, some resting on
   the only arm that was left, just to look at him once more and shout,
   "Vive l'Empereur!" The Emperor had come along. He was all right and
   that was enough for his faithful followers! I think that I felt just
   like that--whatever happened to me, it was true of Christ, "Him has God
   exalted." Never mind what becomes of the man--the King lives and
   reigns! Jesus Christ is glorified and so long as that is the case, what
   matters it what becomes of us? I think I can say for you, as well as
   for myself, that if there is anything in this world that will glorify
   Christ, you will make no hesitation about the bargain. If it will
   glorify Christ, you say, let it come. Though your name should be cast
   out as evil and your body should be left unburied, to be gnawed of
   dogs, what matters it, so long as He who loved us and gave Himself for
   us, should ride on conquering and to conquer in the midst of the sons
   of men?

   To every loyal soldier of King Jesus, this is the best thought in
   connection with His Second Advent, that when He comes, it will be to be
   admired in His saints and to be glorified in all them that believe!
   Then shall there be universal acclamations to Him and His enemies shall
   hide their heads in shame and dismay. Oh, what will they do, then? What
   will they do in that day of His appearing? They, also, will live again
   and what will they do in that day? Judas, where are you? Come here,
   man! Sell your Lord, again, for 30 pieces of silver! What does he say?
   Why, he flees and wishes that he could again go out and destroy
   himself, but that is impossible. Now Pilate, vacillating Pilate, wash
   your hands in water and say, "I am innocent of the blood of this just
   Person." There is no water for him to wash his hands, and he dares not,
   again, perform that wicked farce! And now, you who cried, "Crucify Him,
   crucify Him," lift up your voices, again, if you dare!

   Not a dog moves his tongue, but listen, they have found their tongues
   and what do they say? They are imploring the hills to fall upon them!
   They are calling on the rocks to hide them! The King has not put His
   hand upon His sword, He has not sent forth His lightning to scatter
   you--why do you flee, you cowards? Hear their bitter wail! "Oh, rocks
   and hills, hide us from the face, from the face, from the face of Him
   that sits upon the Throne!" It is the face of Jesus which they were bid
   to look upon, that they might live, but now, in another state, they
   dare not look upon that face of placid love which, in that day, shall
   be more stern than the frowning brow of vengeance, itself! Yes, they
   flee, they flee!

   But you who have trusted Christ, you whom He has saved--you will draw
   near to Him, you will shout His praises, you will delight in Him! It
   shall be your Heaven to bless Him forever and ever! Oh, yes, great
   Master, "Make haste, my Beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart upon
   the mountains of spices" and all His saints, with one voice and heart,
   will say, "Amen."

   Oh, that you who have never trusted Him, would trust Him, now! And if
   you trust Him, you shall live with Him forever and ever. God grant it!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: REVELATION 22.

   Verse 1. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
   crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb. There is
   no other "water of life" except that which springs from a Sovereign God
   and a substitutionary Sacrifice--"a pure river of water of life, clear
   as crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb." This
   sets forth the blessings of salvation that come to us through the
   Sovereign Grace of God by the precious blood of Jesus.

   2. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river,
   was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruit, and
   yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the
   healing of the nations. When Adam ate of the forbidden fruit, he was
   cast out of Eden, lest he should also eat of the tree of life, but our
   new "tree of life" yields us both medicine and food. Blessed are they
   that eat of it--they shall find a Divine variety of mercies--"twelve
   manner of

   fruits." They shall find a constant succession of blessings--"and
   yielded her fruit every month." And there shall be an ever-present
   power of healing--"the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
   nations."

   3. And there shall be no more curse: but the Throne of God and of the
   Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him. Happy servants,
   to be permitted so to do! Here, dear Friends, we are hindered in our
   service, but I think that it will be Heaven enough for some of us to be
   permitted to serve the Lord forever in Glory--"His servants shall serve
   Him."

   4. And they shall see His face. Oh, to keep up communion with the Lord
   while you are at work for Him! To serve Him and to see His face! This
   is a double joy! This is to be like Martha and Mary in one person--"His
   servants shall serve Him: and they shall see His face."

   4. And His name shall be on their foreheads. They will acknowledge Him
   and He will acknowledge them. They are glad to wear His name on their
   foreheads, but who wrote it there? He, Himself, engraved it, as the
   seal and token that they were His! Happy, happy people, thus to be
   acknowledged of God as His peculiar people while they acknowledge Him
   as their only Lord!

   5. And there shall be no night there. Here, there are nights of
   ignorance, of sorrow, of sin and of fear, but, "there shall be no night
   there."

   6. And they need no candles, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God
   gives them light. He puts aside the use of means. While we are here, we
   need candles and suns. It seems curious, does it not, to put candles
   and suns in the same sentence? "They need no candle, neither light of
   the sun." But, after all, compared with God, candles and suns are very
   much the same thing! Great lights and little lights are all limited,
   all less than nothing in comparison with the boundless, infinite God,
   who is Light, and the Source of all light that exists in Heaven above,
   or on the earth beneath.

   6. And they shall reign forever and ever. It must be a wonderful city
   in which every inhabitant is a king--and not a dethroned king, either,
   for, "they shall reign." Every redeemed one in Heaven has also an
   everlasting kingdom--"They shall reign forever and ever." I hope our
   friends who are always cutting down the meaning of the word,
   "everlasting," will be good enough, at least, to let us have an
   everlasting Heaven! Whether they do so, or not, we believe that the
   saints shall reign "forever and ever."

   6, 7. And He said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
   Lord God of the holy Prophets sent His angel to show unto His servants
   the things which must shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly. Or, "I
   am coming quickly."

   7, Blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this Book.
   Our Lord is on the road! He may arrive, tonight, while we are sitting
   here. Happy would be our communion service if, for the last time, we
   should be doing as He commanded us in expectation of His coming--and
   that He should come even while we were commemorating His death!

   8, 9. And I, John, saw these things, and heard them. And when I had
   heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel
   which showed me these things. Then said he unto me, See you do it not:
   for I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the Prophet, and of
   them which keep the sayings of this Book: worship God. John made a
   mistake--he mistook the messenger for the Master and I am not surprised
   that he did so, for the heavenly beings are like their Lord when they
   see Him as He is! John was quickly set right and his error was soon
   corrected. He was bidden to pay no kind of homage to one who, however
   bright and holy, was only his fellow servant. No worship of angels, no
   worship of angelic men must be tolerated among us. "Worship God," is
   the command to us as it was to John.

   10. And he said unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this
   Book: for the time is at hand. There was no need to seal the prophecy,
   as though it only related to those who would live in distant ages--"The
   time is at hand."

   11. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy,
   let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
   still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. This is what will be
   said when Christ comes to judgment, when we get into that future state.
   Today the voice of Jesus says, "Repent, Repent, Repent," but once cross
   the narrow stream of death and pass out of the dispensation of
   mercy--and then character is fixed--and fixed forever.

   12. And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give
   every man according to his work shall be. What reward will some of you
   get? Christ will "give every man according as his work shall be."

   13-15. I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and
   the Last. Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have
   right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
   city. For outside are dogs. Men of a quarrelsome and filthy spirit.

   15. And sorcerers. Such as pretend to have dealings with spirits and
   who intermeddle with the mysterious things of the unknown world.

   15. And whoremongers. All such as indulge their evil passions.

   15. And murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.
   Whether it is a lie about things on earth or things in Heaven, a
   falsehood spoken or a false doctrine taught.

   16-18. I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify unto you these things in
   the churches. I am the Rock and the Offering of David, and the bright
   and morning afar. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him
   that hears, say, come. And let him that is thirsty, come. And whoever
   will, let him take the water of life freely. For I testify unto every
   man that hears the Words of the prophecy of this Book, If any man shall
   add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are
   written in this Book. The Book is finished. Not another line of
   Inspiration may any man dare to put to it on peril that God shall add
   to him every plague of which the Book speaks!

   19. And if any man shall take away from the Words of the Book of this
   prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out
   of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this Book.
   The Book is perfect. You cannot take a line from it without spoiling it
   if you were to cut from it a solitary text. It would be misused and the
   Book should be marred. You would do this at your peril, for God
   threatens to take away, out of the Book of Life, the name of anyone who
   takes anything from "the words of the Book of this prophecy."

   20. He which testifies these thing says, Surely I come quickly. Amen.
   Even so, come, Lord Jesus. Thus we sang just now--

   "Come, You, the soul of all our joys You, the desire of nations, come!"

   21. The Grace of our lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. The whole
   Inspired Volume thus closes with a benediction--"The Grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."

Hopeful, Yet Doubtful

   (No. 2361)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 20, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   8, 1888.

   "And a certain scribe came and said unto Him, Master I wiil follow You
   wherever You go. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the
   birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay
   His head." Matthew 8:19,20.

   "A CERTAIN scribe"--"One scribe"--it is said in the original. Perhaps
   to mark the noteworthy fact that he should be a scribe, and yet should
   wish to be a disciple of Christ. The Lord has some of His own in every
   class of men. You may go as low as you will, but Grace can go lower!
   You may look as high as you please, but Grace can rise higher! In
   Heaven we shall find a multitude of those who were considered to be the
   base people of this world and, here and there, we shall find a king. So
   there was one scribe, a certain scribe, who desired to be a follower of
   Christ. Let us not despair of anybody. If God has not shut them out of
   our commission and He certainly has not, for He has bid us preach the
   Gospel to every creature, then let us not shut them out from our
   hopefulness, but let us expect to see even "a certain scribe" coming
   forward and declaring, "Master, I will follow You wherever You go."

   I. We have no time for any preface, tonight, so we shall go at once to
   our first point which is that here is SOMETHING VERY HOPEFUL. A certain
   scribe said unto Jesus, "Master, I will follow You wherever You go."

   Note, first, that this was a very respectful speech. The scribe
   addressed the Lord as, "Master." "Master, I will follow You wherever
   You go." It was not a flippant speech. There was no absence of
   reverence. He evidently looked up to the great Miracle-Worker who had
   been healing the sick in the streets on that long evening, and he
   called Him, "Master." Jesus said, on another occasion, "You call Me,
   Master and Lord, and you say well; for so I am," and this scribe began
   his religious confession well, whatever that confession may have turned
   out to be, by addressing Christ as Lord. I do not like those professed
   converts who are irreverent and I think that they condemn themselves
   out of their own mouth when they begin to talk about the Lord Jesus
   Christ as if He were some common Person of their acquaintance--and as
   if faith and repentance and all that appertains to godliness were a
   thing to be joked about. That will not do. There is something hopeful
   about this scribe in that he speaks in respectful and reverent tones to
   the Lord Jesus.

   There is still more hopefulness in the fact that his words are very
   enthusiastic. They go upon wheels and the axles of the wheels are hot
   with speed--"Master, I will follow You wherever You go." His utterance
   is earnest, it is hearty, it is enthusiastic! And from a scribe, too, a
   man of pens and ink, a calm, quiet letter-man. To see him on fire is
   something really remarkable! I do not like those converts who have no
   enthusiasm. If they do not burn at first, what will they do afterwards?
   If in their first love there is no zeal, no holy flaming fire, what
   shall we make of them, by-and-by? It is well to see, in those who have
   newly come to Christ, even if it is possible, a little too much
   enthusiasm! We can very well put up with that. There is a novelty to
   the soul that begins to see the Light of God--a novelty in the Light,
   itself, which suggests to it something sparkling and brilliant--and we
   do not wonder if the words of confession that the newly converted utter
   should burn and glow. There is something very hopeful, then, in the
   reverent tone and in the enthusiastic spirit of this man's utterance.

   We are also greatly pleased and expectant of the best results when we
   notice that he was very ready. I do not know that he had been pressed
   by anybody to become a follower of Christ. There had been, so far as we
   know, no distinct call given to him, but he had readily responded to
   that call which is really in Christ, Himself, and in the miracles He
   worked. When any man is blessed, there is a voice in that blessing to
   others who need the same favor. All the sick are called when some sick
   ones are healed and this man had a quick ear and, apparently, a very
   obedient spirit, so he delayed not, but

   made haste to avow his allegiance to Christ. The Savior was going down
   to the boat and about to leave the multitude. The scribe might not,
   perhaps, see Him, again, so, at all risk of intrusion, he comes to
   Jesus and says, "Master, I will follow You wherever You go." We like to
   see this readiness in those who have newly come to Christ!

   And one also likes what this man said because it was so very
   resolute--"Master, I will follow You." Hear how he says it--"I will
   follow You." There is no, "if," no, "but," no merely, "I hope and trust
   so," but, "Master, I am decided that whoever else may hesitate, I will
   follow You. I am determined, whatever others may do, that I will be
   Your follower. I will follow You." And surely, he who is not resolute
   when he enters upon the heavenly war, courts defeat! You must draw your
   sword from the sheath! You must say, "Set down my name, Sir," to the
   man with the writer's inkhorn, and you must begin straightway to cut a
   lane through your foes, for only he who is resolute and determined will
   take the Kingdom of Heaven, of which our Lord said, "the violent take
   it by force." We are glad to see the strong determination, the firm
   decision of a clear-cut man who comes right straight out from his old
   associates and says with all his heart and soul, "Master, I will follow
   You."

   Then observe, with congratulation and hopefulness, that this man's
   declaration was very unreserved--"I will follow You wherever You go."
   "If You go to sea, I will go with You! If You land on the other side,
   where You will be confronted by men possessed of devils, I will follow
   You wherever You go." There is something of the unreserved loyalty of
   Peter when he said, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both into prison
   and to death." So this scribe makes no exception of any kind, but says,
   "I will follow You wherever You go." Oh, if he had only meant it in its
   highest spiritual sense, what a blessing this man would have had
   resting upon him! Of the glorified spirits above it is written, "These
   are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes"--

   "Foremost of the sons of Light, Nearest the eternal Throne."

   May we be among those who always follow Christ, keeping at His heels
   through floods or flames, to whom it is imperative that they should do
   what He does, and be what He is in His humiliation, that they may be
   like He in the day of His appearing in Glory! I like a convert--do not
   you, my Brothers and Sisters, also delight in a convert--who can use
   such language as this, "Master, I will follow You wherever You go"?

   The best thing that I can say about this man's utterance is that it was
   very right. I am about to show you that he was not right, but the words
   he used were right! He said, "Master, I will follow You wherever You
   go." Is not this what Jesus has a right to expect of us? Will He ever
   be satisfied with less than this? Unless our heart takes Him for better
   and for worse, in life and in death, do we really take Him at all? Is
   not this what the Holy Spirit would work in us, that we should follow
   the great Master wherever He goes? Is not this the one need of the
   present age, the lack of fidelity to Christ in everything? Are not many
   aiming at originality? Are they not too much striking out paths for
   themselves? Have we not been told, over and over, again, that we are to
   be "independent thinkers"? Is not the position of sitting at Jesus'
   feet looked upon with contempt by many? Jesus, Himself, said that the
   Words that He spoke were not His, but He spoke what His Father told
   Him. He was no original thinker, but He was the great translator of the
   thoughts of God to men!

   But men disdain this in the pride of their scientific knowledge.
   Professing themselves to be wise, they thus become fools! Still, this
   is the point to which we come back and may God bring His Church there,
   and bring you and me there, to say with heart and soul, without
   reserve, "Master, I will follow You wherever You go." The voice of the
   Virgin, at the first miracle at Cana of Galilee, spoke a word which it
   is well for us to always obey, "Whatever He says unto you, do it." That
   was at Christ's first miracle and we would see many miracles if we
   would give heed to that Word of God! But because we do not act as He
   bids us, the water is not turned into wine and we lack that special
   brightness, glory, fullness and sweetness in life which would come of
   complete obedience to Him. What Jesus commands, let us, by His Grace,
   delight to do! Where Jesus leads, let us rejoice, by His Grace, to
   follow!

   So far I have shown you that in the utterance of this scribe, there is
   something very hopeful. But our blessed Master is not deceived by
   glitter. He looks for gold. He does not seem to answer this man's
   words--it is a way that Christ has, you will notice, all through the
   Gospels--that often He does not reply to men's words. You and I have to
   do that, but Jesus read their thoughts and He answered their thoughts
   rather than their words. So He read this man's thoughts and we, too,
   may read them, reflected in the reply which Jesus gave him--"The foxes
   have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has
   not where to lay His head."

   II. By this answer, Jesus showed us, I think, that there was SOMETHING
   WHICH NEEDED TESTING. That will be the second part of my subject.

   Note, first, that this man's resolve to go with Christ was very sudden.
   Perhaps, therefore, it was the fruit of excitement. It was a very
   exciting evening--a hospital in the street--a great Physician instantly
   healing all kinds of disease! There were shouts ofjoy on all
   sides--lame men leaping like harts--and the tongues of the dumb
   singing! Well, I do not wonder if some people did not quite keep their
   heads and, though this man, now, with intense enthusiasm cries,
   "Master, I will follow You wherever You go," perhaps, after all, it is
   only the result of excitement. You know, Beloved, that nature can do
   nothing in the spiritual realm, yet nature can make a wonderful
   imitation of Grace. But the child of nature, however finely dressed, is
   a dead child and not a living one. "You must be born again," is the
   Word of Christ to all who would enter His Kingdom. It is not at all a
   difficult thing to take nature, especially some natures that are kindly
   and well-disposed and have much that is amiable about them, and to so
   work upon them that Nature cries, "I will follow Christ." And, indeed,
   there is so much about Christ that is naturally beautiful, so much that
   is sweetly attractive, that we have known plenty of instances of
   individuals, quite destitute of spirituality, who have been in love
   with Jesus Christ with a natural love for the natural excellences of
   His Character!

   And there have been some who have been prepared to go a long way and,
   as they thought, prepared to go all the way with Christ, but who,
   nevertheless, did not really and savingly know Christ at all! They only
   saw the outer Christ, but the true Christ, the spiritual Christ, they
   had not perceived. They could not have spoken to them what Jesus said
   to Peter, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood have not
   revealed it unto you, but My Father which is in Heaven." They had had
   no such Revelation and this man had no Divine call. At least there is
   no mention of any--he had no effectual calling, no inward drawing, no
   work of the Spirit of God that we can perceive at all. And so he
   suddenly breaks out with an enthusiasm that is, after all, but the
   effort of nature. It is well known to everybody that water will, of
   itself, rise as high as its source, but it will not rise any higher.
   Human nature will rise as high as human nature--no higher. "That which
   is born of the flesh is flesh." You watch and you fancy that there will
   be some wondrous birth and that human nature, in her throes, will bring
   forth something very superior to herself, but she cannot--"That which
   is born of the flesh is flesh"--and nothing more! The offspring of the
   flesh cannot rise beyond its parentage. "Who can bring a clean thing
   out of an unclean? Not one." So, Brothers and Sisters, sudden
   conversions may be genuine conversions, but, on the other hand, a
   supposed conversion may be only an apparent change--the fruit of
   excitement, the working of an excitable na-ture--but not the work of
   the Spirit of God at all.

   Next, there was reason for testing the scribe's utterance because it
   was very unconsidered. He had probably not thought about the matter at
   all and, without consideration, cried out, "Master, I will follow You
   wherever You go." He had jumped to this decision and, perhaps, being
   unconsidered, it may have been based upon ignorance. The man did not
   appear to know the poverty of the Christ. He professed that he would
   follow Jesus anywhere, but he was not aware that the Great Physician,
   who had worked such mighty wonders that evening, had not a place where
   He could lay His head. When the scribe was once enlightened upon that
   point, apparently he dropped the matter, altogether, and gave up all
   thought of being a follower of the meek and lowly Jesus.

   My dear Friends, I want you to be so converted to Christ that when you
   come to read your Bible through, you will not find anything there that
   you will kick at! I want you to be so converted to Christ that when you
   are further instructed in the Gospel, you will take it all in and say,
   "Just so. I am Christ's disciple and I am prepared to accept whatever
   He teaches me." Why, there were some who were, for a time, with Christ,
   but who went back and walked no more with Him when they heard certain
   Truths which He uttered! Such people as those are poor converts. They
   cheat our hopes! They bring discredit upon the Church to which they
   join and, therefore, it is necessary for us to say to all who are
   thinking of following Christ, "Search the Scriptures, read the Word and
   realize what you are doing. Do not put on the uniform of our great
   Captain without knowing what His service will involve. We do not want
   to entrap you as sergeants enlist half-drunken clowns! We wish you to
   take the oath of allegiance to the great King, knowing something of
   what it means. Otherwise we shall be disappointed in you and you will
   be disappointed in yourselves when you come to know more of our great
   Master and of His service."

   Note further, the reason for testing this utterance lay here--this man
   was evidently very self-reliant--"Master, I will follow You wherever
   You go." What a great, "I WILL," there is there! There is no prayer for
   Grace or guidance. There is

   no dependence upon a greater than himself! It is simply, "I will." You
   know, "I will," is for God to say--but when we say, "I will," it must
   always be, "cum grano salis" with a grain of salt, and that salt must
   be, "If You will help me to do so." But nothing of that dependence upon
   Divine support appears here and, consequently, the scribe's declaration
   is unsatisfactory.

   That which is said by one who is self-reliant may prove to be untrue.
   In Simon Peter's case, there was truth at the bottom of what he
   boastfully said, but there was not enough truth to keep him steadfast
   when a silly maid put a plain question to him and he denied his Master.
   But in the case of some boasters, there is not even sincerity in what
   they say! They think that they are sincere, but their utterance is very
   shallow. There is not depth enough in it for it to be honestly called a
   heart-word. It is but a lip-word and of little or no real value. Oh, my
   dear Friend, I told you how glad I was, just now, to hear you say that
   you would follow the Lamb wherever He goes, but I am very sorry if I
   have to feel that in what you have said, there is more of dependence
   upon self than of reliance upon God, for you will break down, as this
   man did, as soon as ever the Lord tested him by saying, "The foxes have
   holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not
   where to lay His head."

   Notice, again, this man was very obtrusive and bold in his declaration
   of loyalty to Christ--"I will follow You wherever You go." I am loath
   to judge him for being so outspoken, but, at the same time, it is
   possible, when persons are so very loud in their profession, that there
   may be much of self-interest in what they say. I wonder if this man
   thought, "Well, now, I am a scribe. If I join that company, I shall be
   a leader! I perceive that they are only fishermen, the bulk of them,
   and if I come in among them, I shall be a great acquisition to that
   little band. I shall no doubt be the secretary." Perhaps he may have
   thought that there was something to be made out of such a
   position--there was one who thought so. Remember him who had the bag
   and who kept that which was put therein? Did this scribe think so? Or
   had he an idea that Jesus really was the Messiah and that following
   Him, he would be joining One who would be a great King, who would have
   a splendid retinue and so, if he cast in his lot with Him, no doubt he
   would sit on one of the 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel? He
   who could heal the sick at that rate was evidently a great Man and some
   shadow of His greatness would rest upon His followers. Oh, if you try
   to join the Church of Christ from any such motives as these, may the
   Lord, by His good Spirit, readily detect you and touch your
   conscience--and let you know that you are not such as He invites to
   follow Him!

   This man's confession of faith was also very daring and, as I have
   shown you, this would have made it very commendable if it had been
   genuine. But it was very temporary. It did not last long. Some have
   said that there was in it too much attachment to the Person of Christ
   rather than to the teaching of Christ. I like not the distinction, but
   still, I have no doubt that many converts do what is worse than
   that--they have an attachment merely for the preacher. Oh, how many
   come to join Churches because such and such a preacher speaks well, and
   he has charmed them with that interesting story, or with that excellent
   metaphor, yes, and they like him for his work's sake and for his
   godliness and so, when the good man dies, or is removed, do we not
   often see that flocks are scattered and many go back to the world? It
   must be because their faith stood in the wisdom of man and not in the
   power of God! Surely, it must be so, that they based even their
   confidence in Christ upon confidence in His minister! Oh, I pray you,
   keep clear of that fatal mistake! In no respect, I trust, would you
   rely upon me--if you did, you would be foolish to the last degree! Let
   not your reliance be upon the preacher--what is he at the best but as a
   trumpet set to his Master's mouth? The music lies not in the
   instrument, but in Him who uses it and produces a certain sound through
   it. Let your trust be only in Jesus and in that glorious Gospel which
   He came to preach! Yes, which He worked out upon the Cross when, as the
   Lamb of God, He took away the sin of the world.

   Thus I have shown you that there was something in this man's
   declaration that needed testing. I am sorry that I have not time to
   work out the subject from other points, for they are well worthy of
   notice, especially by ministers and those who have to see many
   enquirers after salvation.

   III. But now, thirdly, and very briefly, here is SOMETHING TO REMEMBER.
   Jesus said to this enthusiastic person, "The foxes have holes, and the
   birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay
   His head."

   Remember this, then, you must expect to fare like your Lord. He said to
   His disciples, "If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute
   you." "If they have called the master of the house, Beelzebub, how much
   more shall they call them of his household?" If you follow Christ, you
   must go at night where He goes, to Olivet, where the dew shall saturate
   your

   garments. You must go with Him to Vanity Fair, to be hunted unto the
   death! You must expect to be called mad! You must reckon upon being
   even charged with being a drunk and a wine-bibber, a friend of
   publicans and sinners! Are you ready for this? There is no going to
   Heaven without wearing, for Christ's sake, a fool's cap and a fool's
   coat. You will find, if you seek honor, here, that you may possibly get
   it, but it will do you no good, for when you die, the honor which you
   obtain by unfaithfulness to Christ will clothe you with shame and
   everlasting contempt! See, then, what Jesus expects His followers to
   be--they must be willing to share and share alike with Him, for the
   disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord.

   Notice next, and remember it well, that the Lord Jesus does not want
   any but real disciples. You know how it is with some. They want to make
   up a good number and to report that so many have been converted and so
   many have joined the Church. Oh, that desire after big figures! What
   mistakes and misery it leads some people into! But Jesus does not want
   to count this man unless he is one who can be rightly counted as really
   made His follower--so He speaks to him discourag-ingly and testingly.
   He tries and tests him--and the man goes his way. The Lord Jesus Christ
   does not ask you to become His follower unless you mean to be wholly
   His! Body, soul and spirit--through and through, out and out! You must
   be His, or else you cannot be a follower of Christ at all. Hear that
   and remember it well.

   Then, notice, that a little more instruction may sometimes drive some
   disciples back. The Savior hardly said more than a sentence to the man
   and he was gone! Let us take care to instruct our converts. It will act
   as a sieve and prevent much deception. Tell them all about the trials
   they will have to endure. Bid them count the cost. Set before them the
   difficulties of the way and the need of a Higher Power than their own
   to help them through.

   There is one other thing that I would like you to remember--that which
   drove this man away was the real reason why he ought to have stayed
   with Christ. O Brothers and Sisters, why do we love Christ, if we do
   love Him? Why, because, though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became
   poor! What? Shall we leave Him because He gave up everything for our
   sakes? Shall we leave Him because He had not even a hole like a fox, or
   a nest like a bird? Shall we leave Him because He was despised and
   rejected of men? Shall we leave Him because He was scourged and spit
   upon? Shall we leave Him because they crucified Him? No, these are the
   bonds that bind us fast to Him and will not let us go--

   "His visage marred with sorrows great! The vinegar and gall-- These are
   His golden chains of love, His captive to enthrall."

   And if men leave the Savior because of those very things that ought to
   bind them to Him, then it is not Christ who is at fault--they must have
   all the blame laid upon themselves--and they must bear it to their
   everlasting confusion! Yet no doubt there are many who do forsake the
   Cross because it is the Cross--and leave Christ because of the shame He
   endured for the sake of sinners. What is that but to quit Jesus because
   He is Jesus? Do not do it, I beseech you! But if you do, then will you
   be discovered and unmasked--and your fine professions of allegiance and
   all your pretty resolutions will be blown away like chaff before the
   wind!

   IV. Bear with me a minute or two more while I finish by saying that
   here is SOMETHING FOR PERSONAL CONSIDERATION. I will only throw out
   hints and will not enlarge upon them.

   There are a few questions that I am going to ask. The first is, Would
   it not be better to always do than to promise? The scribe said,
   "Master, I will follow You wherever You go." That sounded well, but
   suppose he had followed Christ wherever He went--that would have been
   much better! Next time you are going to make a vow, pause a while. Vows
   are entangling things. Next time you think of giving a promise, stop a
   little. You had better perform the promise rather than make it and then
   break it--is it not so?

   The next question is, Would it not be better to always pray than to
   promise? Instead of saying, "Master, I will follow You wherever You
   go," suppose the scribe had knelt down and said, "Master, lead me. Take
   me for a disciple. Draw me with bands of love and hold me fast even to
   the end"? That would have been better! A resolve is well enough in its
   way, but it may prove to be lame, weak and broken-backed. But a
   prayer--ah, God hearing it, you have girded yourself with Omnipotence
   and you are, indeed, strong!

   Now for another question. Is Jesus worth the price? Is not Jesus worth
   following to poverty, to shame, to death? Oh, some of us have had to
   ask this question! For the Truth of God's sake, we must lose
   friendships, we must bear contempt, we must expect to be misunderstood.
   But is not Jesus worth it all? Say, is Jesus worth our going to prison,
   or worth our

   suffering the rack, or worth our being burnt at the stake? I truly
   believe that some modern Christians do not hold any doctrine for which
   they would think it worth while to suffer even a toothache! I fancy
   that they almost think so themselves by the ready way in which they go
   on to something else! Would they not be fools if they did die for their
   gospel? It is not worth the killing of a fly, for there is nothing in
   it! But is Christ worthy of anything we have to bear for His sake? Is
   He, or is He not? If you can honestly say, after calculating and
   reckoning it all up, "Yes! Yes! Those things that were gain to me, I
   count loss for Christ! Yes, I count, I reckon, I estimate all things
   loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." If
   it is really so, then go on following your Lord, for you have counted
   the cost. If not, do not begin to build what you cannot finish and what
   is not worth your while to finish.

   And, next, what do you say? Are the spiritual and heavenly rewards of
   following Christ a sufficient recompense? What if you should never make
   a penny by following Christ, but should lose everything that you have?
   What if you should never get any comfort out of it for the present, but
   often be in the dark and have a world of soul-conflict as the result of
   it? Say, do you believe that to be a Christian, to have a spiritual
   life, to have communion with God in prayer will be enough for you
   without anything else? Do you think that Heaven, the sight of the King,
   the sitting on the Throne of God with Him and the everlasting Glory
   will make amends for all this? Would you fling the world away, as
   though it were a child's ball? Yes, would you throw ten thousand worlds
   away, as so many rotten apples, glad to get rid of them, if you might
   but have your God, your Heaven, your All? You are the stuff of which
   Christ's soldiers are made if you can say all that from your heart!
   But, if you cannot, may God renew you, for you know not, yet, what
   Moses knew when he counted even the reproach of Christ greater riches
   than the treasures in Egypt! It was not reigning with Christ, but even
   His reproach that Moses esteemed to be greater riches than the
   treasures in Egypt!

   The last question is, Does Grace enable us to take Christ with all the
   consequences? Does the Holy Spirit at this moment sweetly constrain
   your heart to say, "Yes, yes, after every consideration has had due
   weight with me, if Jesus will have me, I will follow Him wherever He
   goes"? Do you feel that this is not the voice of nature, but the cry of
   Grace within you? Is it because He has loved you with an everlasting
   love and washed you from your sins in His own blood? Is it because His
   Spirit has reached you, changed your likes and dislikes and made you
   love the things which you did once despise? If so, then, my Brother, my
   Sister, Christ gives you His hand, tonight, and you may take it, never
   to let it go, again, for who shall separate us from the love of God
   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord?

   Will you also believe in Him, dear Friend? Will you trust Him? Will you
   take Him to be your Leader and your Lord forever? God make it to be so
   this very night! God make this your birth-night, for His dear Son's
   sake! Amen.

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK"--639, 646, 659.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW 8:16-34; 9:1.

   Verse 16. When the even was come, they brought unto Him many that were
   possessed with devils: and He cast out the spirits with His Word, and
   healed all that were sick. It was the evening after the Sabbath. They
   did not venture even to bring out their sick till the day of rest was
   ended. And the Savior, saying nothing about their lingering
   superstition, began to work mightily among them. "He cast out the
   spirits with His Word." What a power there is in the Word of Jesus!
   There is nothing like it for the casting out of devils. All our
   philosophies will not do what it does! The enemy will say, "Jesus I
   know, and Paul I know, but who are you?" He cast out the evil spirits
   with His Word, and healed all that were

   sick."

   17. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet,
   saying, He, Himself, took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses. It
   does not look like a fulfillment, except upon the wondrous principle of
   the power of Substitution. Jesus takes the sickness and, therefore, He
   removes it from us. He heals our infirmities because He took them upon
   Himself. Is it so, do you think, that every miracle of healing that
   Christ worked took something out of Him? We remember that when the
   woman with the issue of blood was cured by touching His garment, Jesus
   said, "I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me." Was it so that He
   suffered while He was thus relieving the suffering? It was the joy of
   His heart to bless

   mankind, but every blessing that He gave was very costly to Him. I
   think that Truth lies embedded in the Evangelist's declaration.

   18. Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave commandment
   to depart unto the other side. This, again, looks like a non sequitur.
   You and I would have said, "If there are great multitudes about us, let
   us speak to them while we are here." But then, again, you see, we may
   not always judge by the apparent usefulness of the present moment. We
   have to consider the rest of our career. Our Savior knew that the
   governors of the country were very jealous and that if people came
   together in large numbers, they might suspect insurrections and
   revolutions--and they would be there with their troops--and many
   innocent folk might be slain, and, speaking after the manner of men,
   His work of usefulness might be quickly brought to an end. Therefore,
   when He saw the great multitudes, He judged it wise to go elsewhere.
   Besides, He was no lover of popularity--He looked upon it as a shadow
   which necessarily followed Him rather than as a thing to be sought
   after. This He showed in the intense humility of His spirit and in that
   love of solitude which was so natural to One who walked in continual
   fellowship with God. Sometimes we shall really do more by apparently,
   for the moment, doing less.

   19, 20. And a certain scribe came and said unto Him, Master, I will
   follow You wherever You go. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have
   holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not
   where to lay His head. We hear no more of this man. Our Savior's
   faithfulness probably dismissed Him.

   21. And another of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, suffer me, first,
   to go and bury my father. Now this man was a disciple, mark you, and,
   according to Luke, the Lord had said to him, "Follow Me," yet he urged
   this plea, "Suffer me, first, to go and bury my father."

   22. But Jesus said unto him, Follow Me and let the dead bury their
   dead. Nothing, not even the duties of filial love, must be allowed to
   come in conflict with the command of Christ, "Follow Me." I take it
   that this is not so much a word to the common disciple as to a disciple
   called out to a special ministry--"Your ministry is to be your first,
   your main, your only occupation--'follow Me: and let the dead bury
   their dead.' Let the politicians attend to the politics; let the
   reformers see to the reforms. But, as for you, keep to your own work
   and follow Me." When God's ministers come to this point, that they have
   to win souls, and that this is their only business, then souls will be
   won! There are plenty of dead people to bury the dead! There are plenty
   of moral people to see after the ordinary affairs of morality. As for
   us, let us follow Christ and keep to our one business!

   23. And when He was entered into a boat, His disciples followed Him. He
   went first and they followed afterwards. If the boat is the type of the
   Church, then Christ is the first on board. He is the Captain and the
   disciples make up the crew--"His disciples followed Him."

   24. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that
   the boat was covered with the waves: but He was asleep. What? A tempest
   where Christ is? Yes, it is generally so. If all seems very calm, you
   may question whether Christ is there, but when He goes into the boat
   and His disciples follow Him, it is not remarkable that the devil comes
   after Him. "The boat was covered with the waves." That sea of Galilee
   lies very deep, indeed, and it is surrounded by lofty crags and yawning
   chasms that act like funnels to the wind, so that to this day it is
   very dangerous for those who are on it in a boat. "The boat was covered
   with the waves: but He was asleep." Here is the weakness of humanity
   and here is, also, the strength of faith. Jesus went to sleep because
   that boat was in His Father's hands and He would take care of it. "He
   was asleep."

   Sometimes the best thing that we can do is to go to bed. You are
   worrying and troubling yourself and you can do nothing--go to sleep,
   Brother. It is the climax of faith to be able to shake off all care and
   to feel, "If the Lord cares for me, why should I not sleep?" Remember
   what Alexander the Great said of his friend, Parmenio? "Alexander may
   sleep, for Parmenio watches," and surely we, who have a far greater
   Friend than Parmenio, can say at any time, "We may sleep, for God
   watches." "He was asleep." To sleep was the best thing that Jesus could
   do to renew His bodily energies and to prepare Himself for the time
   when His efforts would be needed for the deliverance of His disciples
   from danger.

   25. 26. And His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, Lord,
   save us: we perish. And He said unto them: Why are you fearful, O you
   of little faith? The disciples might have answered, "Lord, how can you
   ask us why we are fearful? The boat is covered with waves, the sea
   threatens to swallow it and all of us up." Still, they might have
   thought, "If

   Christ is on board the boat, will He allow it to sink? Can He be
   drowned? We carry Christ and all His fortunes--is not our vessel thus
   insured beyond all risk? He may well say to us, 'Why are you fearful, O
   you of little faith?'"

   26. Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a
   great calm. "A great calm." No ordinary stillness of the sea, but it
   was a great calm, as the tempest had been great which had preceded it!
   What? And all of a sudden, too? Storms sob themselves to sleep through
   lengthened intervals of fretfulness, but when Jesus gives the word of
   command, the storm is gone at once. "There was a great calm."

   27. But the men marveled, saying, What manner of Man is this, that even
   the winds and the sea obey Him? They did not yet know their Lord--nor
   do we. Perhaps we have to go to sea to learn more of Him--I mean that
   troubles and trials of a greater sort than we have known, before, may
   yet have to come to be our schoolmasters to teach us who Jesus is.
   "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
   waters, these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep."
   You landsmen are thankful for your quiet, but you do not see so much of
   Jesus as others of His disciples do--you must go to sea to be able to
   cry, "What manner of Man is this?"

   28. 29. And when He was come to the other side into the country of the
   Gergesenes, there met Him two possessed with devils, coming out of the
   tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And,
   behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with You, Jesus, You
   Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time? They knew
   that there is a time when He will judge them and when their torment
   will begin. Say what you please, sin in men or devils will be followed
   with torment--with sorrow indescribable, unutterable--and these devils
   knew it and they were obliged to confess the Truth of God! They were
   afraid lest Jesus had come to inflict upon them the penalty of their
   evil deeds before that Last Great Day.

   30. And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
   feeding. The owners of these animals had no business to have any swine
   there--swine were forbidden in that holy country--and they should not
   have been kept there.

   31. So the devils besought Him, saying, If You cast us out, suffer us
   to go away into the herd of swine. What a wonderful creature a man is
   as compared with an animal! A legion of devils could be packed away
   into these two men, but they needed a whole herd of swine to contain
   them all! How much greater is a man than a beast, that is to say, how
   much more capable of spiritual influence for evil as well as for good!

   32. And He said unto them, Go. Jesus never wastes words on devils! He
   is always short and sharp with them--"Go."

   32. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and,
   behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into
   the sea, and perished in the waters. The proverb has it, "They run fast
   whom the devil drives," they run to destruction, even as these swine
   perished in the waters!

   33. 34. And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
   city, and told everything, and what was befallen to the possessed of
   the devils. And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. You
   feel that they are going to worship Him, or at least to ask Him to come
   and teach them the way of salvation! Nothing of the sort.

   34. And when they saw Him, they besought Him that He would depart out
   of their coasts. And there are many, still, who try all they can to get
   Christ to go away from them. Woe be to them if He grants their desire!

   Matthew 9:1. And He entered into a boat, and passed over, and came into
   His own city. I think I see the departing sail--love, hope and peace
   melting away upon the distant horizon--and the Gergesenes left to
   perish! O God, do not so with any of us! Say not, "Ephraim is joined to
   idols. Let him alone."

The King and His Court

   (No. 2362)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, MAY 27, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   11, 1888.

   "My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell
   with me: he that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me." Psalm
   101:6.

   DAVID is going to be king and these are the resolutions that he makes
   before he ascends the throne. He meant that he would look for the best
   men in the nation and that he would take care of them. He would give
   them offices about his court so that he might have his work done well
   --that his people might be judged by wise and righteous men--and all
   the affairs of state should be managed by those who were faithful to
   God. This was a very proper thing for him to do. I wish that those who
   are not kings, but who are placed in any position of influence, would
   have their eyes upon the faithful of the land. Good men should
   patronize good men. Those who have it in their power, should, to the
   utmost of their ability, advance those whom they know to be upright and
   true and gracious men. But, my dear Friends, we are not going to talk
   about David, now, but about the Son of David, "great David's greater
   Son," the King of Kings and Lord of Lords! There is no doubt that in
   His Kingdom His eyes are upon the faithful. He looks upon the faithful
   among His people. He takes them into communion with Himself and He uses
   them as His servants in conspicuous and remarkable ways--"My eyes shall
   be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me: he that
   walks in a perfect way, he shall serve Me."

   My business, tonight, is to speak especially to God's people about this
   faithfulness. And I shall handle the subject thus. First, Who are these
   faithful men--"the faithful of the land"? Secondly, What will the King
   do with them? And, thirdly, How may we get among them, that we, also,
   may have this favor from the King of Kings?

   I. First, then, WHO ARE THESE FAITHFUL MEN to whom Jesus, our King,
   will have respect at all times?

   I answer, they may be known in part by this mark--they are true in
   their dealings with God. A man who is not honest to God is honest to
   nobody. He who will rob his God will soon rob his fellow men. Now, I
   mean by being truthful and upright to God, just this, that we walk
   before Him in deep sincerity of heart. To make a profession of being
   what we are not, is not being among the faithful of the land! And to
   come before God with prayers which are not prayers, but only the skins
   and shells of prayers, is not being faithful before God. To profess to
   sing His praises, when we are only uttering words without heart, is to
   make ourselves as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal in the ears of
   God. We are not accepted by Him if our heart is not true. A man who is
   faithful before God will not go in his religious expressions beyond his
   religious experience--he will always be afraid of stretching his arm
   farther than his sleeve will reach. If he has not felt certain changes,
   he will not profess to have felt them. He would rather err on the side
   of doubting and distrusting himself than on the side of boasting and
   claiming for himself what he really does not possess. I think that it
   is a most important thing to be very true and thorough in our private
   walk with God. If you are backsliding, it is well to know it. If you
   are making but small progress, it is well to confess it. If you are an
   idler, it is well to admit it. If you have become lukewarm, it is well
   to know it. Nothing is more dangerous than to be saying to yourself, "I
   am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing," when all
   the while you are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
   naked."

   God has His eyes upon the faithful of the land, those who are faithful
   to Him, who do not attempt to deceive themselves with religious
   professions which they cannot support. How many a man has become a
   bankrupt by a lavish expenditure which exceeded his income! He said
   that he "must keep up appearances," and he did keep up appearances till
   they became his ruin! God grant that you and I may never try to keep up
   appearances before Him! Be what you would seem to

   be and, in the Presence of God never seem to be or dream of seeming to
   be what you are not! Thus I think we, first of all, know the faithful
   by their upright dealing with God.

   This will lead them to be true in their dealings with men. I hope that
   I need not say much about this, but yet I do not know. I have heard, at
   times, of professing Christians who are no more straight in business
   than worldlings are. It is a shame to you of whom this can be said and
   it is a disgrace to the Church to which you belong! It brings dishonor
   upon the Lord Jesus Christ if any of you profess to be His servants and
   yet you lie and cheat, or, what is much the same thing, puff your goods
   beyond what can honestly and fairly be said of them, or sell them under
   false names, deceiving the people who purchase from you. I am not going
   into all the tricks of trade. I remember how good old Latimer,
   preaching, once, at Paul's Cross, said that he knew a man who had some
   wheat, poor stuff it was, and he poured out a bushel of good wheat,
   first, and then he put the bad wheat next. And then he put some good
   wheat on the top and so mixed it all together, or, rather, he concealed
   the bad wheat in the middle. Latimer went on telling another tale, and
   another, until all of a sudden he said, "Now, I am not doing you any
   good, for, I daresay, some of you will go and do these things,
   yourselves, tomorrow."

   So the good old man checked himself and dealt with the evil rather by
   way of generality than by specialty. That man is not faithful in God's
   esteem who is not upright, honest, true to a hair's breadth, in his
   dealings with his fellow men! We must stand to our bond even though we
   lose by it. We must be true to the word we speak though it be to our
   own hurt. God grant that His Spirit may work in us, not only the
   ordinary integrity which may be found in many a natural man, but
   something deeper and more thorough than that in all our dealings in
   business, in the family and everywhere else, for the eyes of the King
   are upon the faithful of the land!

   Now, dear Friends, such people will, in the next place, always be true
   in their dealings with men on God's behalf. I think this passage bears
   very pertinently upon the minister, the Sunday school teacher and the
   Christian worker. The eyes of Christ are upon the faithful of the land.
   If I come here and teach you what I do not believe, or if I conceal
   what I do believe, or if I tell you something which has in it a
   suppression of the Truth of God, or if I preach to you orthodox
   doctrine while in my own heart I believe something different, remember
   that I cannot be said to be one of the faithful of the land! And if I,
   as a minister, sit still and watch the Gospel of Christ trampled in the
   mire and hold my tongue for fear of shame and contempt, I cannot be
   called one of the faithful of the land! If you, dear Sunday school
   teachers, in your instruction of the children, keep back from them
   anything they ought to know, or if, in telling them what they ought to
   know, you do not press it home upon their consciences. If you do not
   pray with them. If you do not long for their conversion, you are not
   faithful to their souls on God's behalf and the eyes of Christ will not
   be fixed upon you with approval!

   It is a very hard thing, to always be faithful with men on God's
   behalf. I know that it is so even in visiting the sick. One is tempted
   to begin to comfort some of them when they ought not to be
   comforted--to say very soft and gentle words to them because they are
   ill, when, perhaps, they have never felt their need of a Savior--and
   never been awakened to any sense of spiritual need. I remember one who
   was greatly condemned for the action that he thought it right to take.
   Two or three of us had been to see a sick and dying man who always
   welcomed visitors. We prayed with him and told him the Gospel, but we
   were all under the impression that we had produced no effect whatever
   upon his mind--that he was passing into another world without any
   knowledge of his lost estate--without any repentance or faith in
   Christ. The good man to whom I refer--he is now in Heaven, but I well
   remember the reproach that he suffered for what he did--he stood at the
   foot of the bed and he said, "Friend, you are a deceived man. You are
   dying and you have no well-grounded hope. You always say, 'Yes, yes,
   yes,' to all we say, but my inmost thought of you is that you are
   without God and without hope. And if you die as you are, you will be
   lost forever."

   The man's wife was thunderstruck and so was he! But when we went to
   visit him the next day, you should have seen the change that God had
   worked in him! There was a broken-hearted man crying for mercy! A man
   in sore trouble and distress of soul. The faithful messenger of God had
   told him the naked truth--it pained him to do it, but he had been more
   faithful to the sick man than others who had spoken very kindly to him!
   Oh, I believe if we are faithful, so that we are clear of the blood of
   all men, faithful to the Truth of God, faithful to our own consciences,
   faithful to the consciences of those with whom we have to deal, then we
   are among the number of whom the text says, "My eyes shall be upon the
   faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me."

   Have you and I been faithful to our own children and faithful to our
   own parents? Wives, have you been faithful to your own husbands about
   their souls? Do you not think that some of us might go home, tonight,
   and pour out floods of tears before God as we confess, "No, we have not
   been as faithful as we should have been to what we know of the Gospel,
   and to those to whom we were bound to teach it"? Christ has a special
   eye of love for those who are faithful in their dealings with God,
   faithful in their dealings with man and faithful in their dealings with
   the souls of men on God's behalf. Oh, that we may be among that happy
   company!

   Then, observe that these faithful men are thorough in all that they do.
   If you read the second part of our text, you will see that the Psalmist
   also says, "He that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me." May I
   be permitted to say, especially to you who are commencing the Christian
   life, that if you wish to live near to God and to be greatly used of
   Him, it is important that you should begin as you mean to go on--by
   endeavoring to walk in a perfect way? There are some who tried, at
   first, with their own convictions. I cannot help quoting myself, at the
   risk of being called egotistical. When I was converted to the Lord
   Jesus Christ and made to rejoice in Him, I read the New Testament for
   myself. I had no friend and no relative who was a baptized Believer. I
   come of a stock in which infant Baptism has long been religiously
   observed. I read the Scriptures and I saw, there, that only the
   Believer was to be baptized. That Truth of God came to my conscience,
   but the suggestion which came to me from friends was, "Well, it really
   is a pity to introduce this matter, for all those around you think
   differently."

   I have never ceased to thank God that I was thoroughly honest to my
   convictions about the ordinance. Do any of you think it a trifle? Very
   well, waive that point for the moment, but when a man is not honest to
   his convictions about a trifle, the next thing is that he is not honest
   to his convictions about something else--and so he gets off the
   lines--and if you begin to go a little aside, for the sake of peace, or
   to prevent disturbances, or to please your friends, you have taken a
   way of life which will lead you, I cannot tell, where! Be determined
   that if others do as they please, you are not accountable for their
   action--but still do what you believe to be right! If you are a
   Christian, go through with it! Be a follower of Christ in every respect
   as far as the Word of God and your own conscience lead you. I found
   that the habit of beginning to think for myself and to follow my
   convictions was useful to me, and it has been useful to me to this day.
   And at this moment, before the living God, I am able to stand on my own
   feet, to lean neither on this man nor on that, but only on that eternal
   arm which will support any man and woman--every man and woman who, in
   the sight of God, determines to follow the Truth of God wherever it may
   lead them!

   Now, I earnestly pray every Christian person here, especially in the
   beginning of life, to look well to this matter, for the joy of your
   life, the peace of your life, the inward rest of your life will much
   depend, under God, upon your being faithful to your convictions in
   every point as God shall help you! The great King, Himself, seems to
   say, tonight, "My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that
   they may dwell with Me: he that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve
   Me. He is the man whom I will pick for My servant. I will put him here,
   or I will place him there, where I am unable to station some others
   because they are not clear and straight in their conduct and because
   they are not to be depended upon for loyal obedience to their Lord and
   Master."

   Thus have I tried to describe who the faithful men of the land are. May
   we all be numbered among them!

   II. But now, secondly, I want very briefly to answer this question,
   WHAT WILL THE KING DO WITH THEM?

   David says, "My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land," and
   David's son, the Lord Jesus Christ, says the same. What does He mean?

   Well, first, His eyes of search will seek them out. That dear Brother
   who is faithful to God is only a young apprentice, but he has been
   faithful in not breaking the Sabbath. Nobody knows about him, dear
   young man, but the eyes of the Lord are upon him! There is a working
   man who, the other day, in the midst of a swearing company, rebuked the
   blasphemer and spoke up for Christ. That noble action is not recorded
   in the newspaper and never will be--but God's eyes are upon the
   faithful of the land. There is a poor woman who, the other day, lost a
   good deal by being straight and honest. No one will report it. Nobody
   will put her down in the Legion of Honor. No, but God's eyes are upon
   the faithful of the land! And when you, through the Grace of God, are
   led to follow Christ faithfully, quite alone, not wishing to be seen,
   doing in secret what only God, Himself, knows--it is reward enough for
   you that the Lord Jesus Christ sees what you do and He, Himself, will
   one day reward you openly.

   But there is more than that. When King David says, "My eyes shall be
   upon the faithful of the land," it means that his eyes of favor will
   cheer them. The King would first search them out and then he would
   bring them forward. He would promote their interests, he would see that
   the faithful men were not thrust into a corner and neglected, he would
   have an eye to cheering them as they had an eye to pleasing him. I
   believe that God greatly favors and blesses those whom, by His Grace,
   He makes to be faithful. If you are unfaithful, your unfaithfulness
   will come home to you, sometime or another. I mean, if you are a child
   of God, for there is discipline in the House of the Lord. I am not
   talking, now, about the punishments of the Law of God--the children of
   God are not under the Law--I am speaking about the discipline of the
   Gospel. You are saved by free, rich, Sovereign Grace and you are made a
   child of God. From the moment of your new birth you come under the
   discipline of the great Father's House and if you are unfaithful, your
   unfaithfulness will deprive you of many a comfort and many a joy! It
   will dog your footsteps and track you when you least expect it. Look at
   David. After his great sin, he was never the man that he had been
   before--and many were the griefs and pangs of heart which he brought
   upon himself by that one terrible fall. The Lord grant that we may be
   kept faithful, so that God's eyes of approval may rest upon us and that
   we may joy and rejoice in Him from day to day!

   But then the text, after saying, "My eyes shall be upon the faithful of
   the land," adds, "that they may dwell with Me." The faithful shall
   dwell with God. Oh, this is a choice privilege! When Grace makes a man
   faithful, God rewards his faithfulness by permitting him to dwell in
   close communion with his Lord! It is a wonderful thing to me that if we
   have any good works, God always works them in us, and then he rewards
   us for them as if they were our own! He gives us Grace and then smiles
   on us because of the Grace that He, Himself, gives! So, if He makes a
   man faithful, He then rewards him for it according to His Grace, and
   says, "He shall dwell with Me."

   I think I see David carrying out this resolution. There is a poor but
   honest man away down there in Bethlehem and David hears of his strict
   integrity and sends him a letter. "Come to Jerusalem," says the king,
   "I will make a courtier of you. I will make a friend of you. You are
   the sort of man I need. Come and dwell with me." He hears of another
   poor man, over yonder, who has been ridiculed because he stood up for
   Jehovah, the God of Israel, when others were inclined to worship some
   false god. "Come up to Jerusalem," he says, "come live with me. You are
   my sort of company, for you are one of the faithful ones." Now, that is
   what the Lord Jesus Christ says to us! He calls us as sinners, but He
   communes with us as saints! He washes us when we are guilty, but after
   we are washed and He has made us upright in His sight, then He takes us
   to dwell with Him! He delights in opening His heart to us and in
   permitting us to open our heart to Him!

   Now, if any of you are not faithful to Christ, I can tell you that you
   will not be able to commune with Him. If you have done a wrong thing in
   business, or if you have held your tongue and not been faithful in
   testifying for Christ. When you go on your knees at night you will not
   be able to find yourself so led out in prayer as you were, before, when
   you were true to Him. And when you turn to the Scriptures, instead of
   finding them speaking to you, they will seem as if they were dumb--no
   voice of comfort will come from them. But if you have been faithful and
   true, and out and out for Christ, then you shall dwell with Him--you
   shall abide in Him and His Word will abide in you!

   Then it is added, "He shall serve Me." The faithful shall be Christ's
   servants. I do not know which is the greater privilege, "He shall dwell
   with Me," or, "He shall serve Me." Perhaps the second is the higher.
   Have you ever thought, Beloved Friend, what an honor it is to be
   permitted to do anything for God? For God to bless us is great
   condescension on His part, but for Him to permit us to be of any use to
   Him--this is a wonderful honor from His right hand! I believe that
   there is more honor in being allowed, for the Glory of God, to teach a
   little Sunday school child the way of salvation than there would be in
   ruling the whole German Empire if it were done for the glorification of
   self! The honor does not lie in the act so much as in the motive--and
   if the motive is, "I did it unto the Lord," then I stand in the same
   rank with angels, yes, in a line with those wonderful living creatures
   that John saw in the Revelation who reveal the Glory of God and
   continually do Him service!

   The Lord will not have you as His servant if you are not faithful, if
   you do not give yourself up to His Truth and to be true, through and
   through! It is not God's way to send forth His Truth by untruthful men.
   If there is a lie in your left hand, the Truth of God in your right
   hand will seem to have lost at least half its power. Like the hoard of
   Achan hidden away in the tent which robbed all Israel of the victory at
   the gates of Ai, so will you find that anything which is untrue, hidden
   away in your life or your conduct, will deprive you of victory when you
   go out in the service of God. "He shall serve Me," says Christ. And He
   will not accept the service of those who are not true to Him.

   III. Thus I have spoken of a very necessary practical Truth of God, and
   I am going to close by trying to answer one more question--HOW MAY WE
   GET AMONG THESE FAITHFUL ONES?

   Perhaps we can truly say, God helping us, we hope that we are among
   them. If so, as we read a little while ago, "it is He that has made us,
   and not we, ourselves." If there is any faithfulness, if there is any
   uprightness, unto God be the glory of it all! Pray, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, that you may never lose your faithfulness, but that you may be
   kept even unto the end! Remember that passage in Jude's Epistle, "Now
   unto Him that is able to guard you from stumbling"? So it is in the
   Revised Version and it is an improvement and nearer to the original
   than our old text, for while it is a great mercy to be kept from
   falling, it is a still greater favor to be guarded from stumbling, so
   as to walk with careful, steady progress in uprightness before God all
   your life! Let it be your constant prayer that you may be thus kept
   faithful even unto death.

   But now I speak to others who are not as yet faithful. You say, "How
   are we to get among the faithful?" Well, I should say, first, so far as
   you may be, and so far as your light goes, be faithful tonight--be
   honest in confessing sin. Before you sleep, put yourself before God
   just as you are. Have you neglected religion? Confess it. Or have you
   pretended to possess religion when there was no truth in your
   profession? Confess it. What has been your sin? Confess it. Kneel by
   your bedside and there, God, alone, seeing you, unveil your heart
   before Him. You say that He knows all about you. That is true and that
   is a reason why you should be the more explicit in your confession to
   Him. Speak freely to God and make Him, as you ought to make Him, your
   only "Father Confessor." Tell Him that you are lost. Tell Him that you
   are hard-hearted. Tell Him that you are unfeeling. Tell Him that you
   desire to be converted, but that it is only a faint desire as yet. Tell
   him all about yourself. In a word, begin to deal with God on the
   straight. If you have not done so, already, I pray God that you may do
   so, tonight, and I beseech you to go as far as you can in this matter.
   Reveal your poverty, your filthiness, your sin, your nakedness, your
   deserving of Hell--only do all honestly as in the sight of God. What an
   amazing thing it is that men do not like to act thus, yet, when the
   Grace of God enables them to do it, they are already on the road to
   salvation! When the man comes before God with a rope round his neck,
   confessing that he deserves to die, then there is this blessed text to
   comfort him--"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
   forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God
   grant that you may find it to be so tonight!

   Well, then, dear Friend, next, be anxious to have a new heart and a
   right spirit. May God make you thus anxious tonight! Remember that
   there is evil in us by nature. "All have sinned and come short of the
   Glory of God." "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately
   wicked." And before we can be faithful, we must be born again. No man
   will ever be true until the God of Truth has truly renewed him. Our
   tendency is to lean either this way or that--to stand upright is a gift
   of Divine Grace and none but the Holy Spirit can bestow it upon us! Oh,
   that we might have a deep anxiety to undergo that wondrous change, that
   radical and total change of heart which the Savior described when He
   said to Nicodemus, "You must be born again"! Go to the Lord with
   David's prayer, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right
   spirit within me." Plead that Old Testament promise, "A new heart,
   also, will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I
   will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
   an heart of flesh."

   Then, supposing that you have come thus far, I earnestly entreat you,
   if you would be found among the faithful of the land, be sincere in all
   your dealings with the living God. If you mean to pray, pray! If you
   believe in Jesus, do not simply say that you believe, but believe! If
   you repent, do not merely talk of repentance, but repent! Let
   everything be thorough and downright. May the Spirit of God save you
   from getting the imitation of spirituality which will damn you! And may
   He give you the reality of spiritual life which will effectually save
   you! I believe that there are many who are very much injured by being
   led to profess religion when they do not possess it. There is a revival
   meeting. There is a room for con-verts--they get in there--they are
   pressed, they are exhorted, they are entreated! They think that they
   are sincere--in a certain measure they are--but there is no sense of
   guilt, no loathing of sin, no true repentance, no wounding and,
   therefore, no healing, no stripping and, therefore, no clothing! The
   whole thing is but a mere sham! And they go away and are, themselves,
   deceived and afterwards return to their old sins and are worse than
   they were before! If you have not eternal life, do not pretend that you
   have it. I charge you before God, who shall judge the quick and the
   dead, in the day of His appearing, never cheat yourself in this matter,
   for you are the only person that you can really cheat for long! God,
   Himself, you will never deceive. Make clear, clean, sharp, distinct,
   decided work of this matter, or rather, may God the Holy Spirit work
   this miracle of mercy in you, for Christ's name's sake!

   Lastly, dear Friend, if you would be among the faithful of the land,
   depend continually upon the Lord Jesus and His Word to make and keep
   you faithful. Every day wait upon Him for fresh anointing and renewed
   power. And daily live unto Him and for Him, laying yourself out to
   honor Him who has redeemed you. Your only hope is in His precious
   blood! Then let the objective of your existence be to glorify Him,
   alone. If this is so, you shall be among the faithful of the land and
   you shall dwell with the King, even with the King of Kings, and you
   shall serve Him forever and ever!

   Are you not glad to hear this, you great sinners? Jesus is as able to
   pardon you, now, as He was to save the dying thief! And you who have
   hard hearts, He is able to give you new ones, today, as He gave them to
   those of old. And oh, you children of God, I pray you, do not act as if
   David had a great God, and you have a little God! Do not act as if, in
   the trials of the olden times, God made bare His arm, but that now He
   will hardly put out His little finger! Do not treat Him as if it could
   be so. God still hears prayer! If He does not work miracles, He does
   the same thing in some other way which is even better! He still
   delivers us! He still feeds us! He still leads us! He still guards us!
   He is the same as He always was! Oh if you would but trust Him!
   Abraham's God is your God and He can help you in the day of battle.
   Joshua's God is your God and He says to you as He did to Joshua, "I
   will not fail you, nor forsake you." Oh, believe it! Jesus Christ--my
   grandfather's Jesus Christ, my father's Jesus Christ--is my Jesus
   Christ! Look back on all the godly people you have ever known and think
   of what the Lord did for them--and then remember that His arm is not
   shortened, His ear is not heavy, His love is not diminished, His wisdom
   is not turned to foolishness! He is still able and willing to bless
   you, as in all the ages that have gone by. Trust Him, you saints! Trust
   Him, you sinners--and the Lord bless you all, for Jesus Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 100; 101.

   May the Spirit of God, by whose Inspiration David penned these Psalms,
   bless them to us as we read them!

   Psalm 100. This is entitled "a Psalm of Praise." Note, here, that this
   is the only Psalm which bears that title. There are others which have
   titles very much like it, but this one is singled out from all the rest
   to be, in a very special sense, "a Psalm of Praise." Martin Luther was
   very fond of it and it has even been said that he composed the tune
   which we have just sung, and which is commonly called, "the Old
   Hundredth"--though other attribute it to a German named Franc.

   Verse 1. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all you lands. Do you
   notice the missionary spirit here? The Jews looked upon God as the God
   of Israel and they had but very faint desires for the conversion of
   other nations. But the Holy Spirit speaks more by David than David,
   himself, may have known--"Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all you
   lands." We ought to express the praise of God, not merely to feel it,
   and to express it by what is called, here, "a joyful noise." All our
   songs to God should have in them a measure of joyfulness. The gods of
   the heathen were worshipped with dolorous noises, with sorrowful sounds
   and cries of misery--but the God of Heaven is to be worshipped with a
   joyful noise! "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all you lands." Oh,
   that the day were come when China, India and all Asia, Africa, America
   and Europe would take up the gladsome note of praise to Jehovah!

   2. Serve the LORD with gladness. What a text that is! "Serve the Lord."
   Obey Him, yield to Him your homage, but serve Him, "with gladness." He
   wants not slaves to Grace His Throne! He loves willing worship, happy
   worship, for He is "the happy God." "Serve the Lord with gladness."

   2. Come before His Presence with singing. Singing is delightful, but
   singing in God's Presence is heavenly! Do not the spirits that are made
   pure and holy come before His Presence and come before it with singing?
   I wish that whenever we sing, we would sing as in the Presence of God.
   I am afraid that we sometimes go through the tune mechanically and the
   words languish on our lips. "Come before His Presence with singing."

   3. Know you that the LORD, He is God. One says, "Man, know yourself,"
   and another says, "The proper study of mankind is man." Not so! Man,
   know your God! The proper study of mankind is God! He who knows God
   knows himself, that is, he knows himself to be nothing. "Know you that
   Jehovah, He is God." There is but one God--it is the same God in the
   Old Testament as in the New--Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and
   of Jacob--the God and Father of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!

   3. It is He that has made us, and not we, ourselves. Note the negative,
   as if to deny that we had any hand in our own making, and this is also
   worthy of notice spiritually. It is the Lord who has made us
   Christians, not we, ourselves. He has created us in Christ Jesus. There
   are some who lay such stress upon the human will and I know not what,
   besides, in man, that it is necessary to put in the negative as well as
   the positive. "It is He that has made us, and not we, ourselves."

   3. We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Praise Him, then!
   Praise Him because He is your Maker! Praise Him more sweetly because He
   is your Shepherd. If we are His people, here is His electing love, here
   is His effectual calling, here is the Grace of His Spirit that made us
   so. "We are His people and the sheep of His pasture." He leads us, He
   feeds us, He protects us, He has bought us with His precious blood.
   Truly, this is good reason why we should make a joyful noise unto God
   and serve Him with gladness! "We are His people and the sheep of His
   pasture." Are you His people? O my dear Hearer, ask yourself--are you
   one of the sheep of His pasture?

   4. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with
   praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name. Gratitude is that oil
   which makes the wheels of life easily revolve. And if anybody ought to
   be grateful, surely we are the men and women for whom the Lord has done
   so much! "Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts
   with praise."

   5. For the LORD is good. Should we not praise so good a God?

   5. His mercy is everlasting; and His Truth endures to all generations.
   "His Truth"--that is to say, His truthfulness, His faithfulness to His
   people. This is a blessed Psalm and it seems to me to reach the highest
   point of praise when it tells us, "The Lord is good; His mercy is
   everlasting; and His Truth endures to all generations."

   Psalm 101. The last Psalm was a Hymn of Thanksgiving, this one is a
   Psalm of Thanksgiving. I suppose it to have been written by David just
   when he assumed the throne, when he was about to become king over all
   Israel and Judah. Its title is, "A Psalm of David." This is what he
   said to himself--

   Verse 1. I will sing--That is right, David. In the 100th Psalm, he had
   exhorted other people to sing. Now, in the 101st he declares what he,
   himself, will do. "I will sing"--

   1. Of mercy and judgement. It is a mingled theme. There are the treble
   and the bass notes--"mercy and judgment." There are some dear friends
   who, if they sing at all, will have to sing this way, for they have a
   heavy sorrow on their heart and yet great mercy is mixed with it. Oh,
   you who are troubled and bow your head in grief, say, "I will sing of
   mercy and judgment." Mix the two together!

   1. Unto You, O LORD, will I sing. A second time the Psalmist says, "I
   will sing." It is well to make this firm resolve. "Unto You, O Lord,
   will I sing." Winter or summer, "I will sing." Poverty or riches, "I
   will sing." Sickness or health, "I will sing." Life or death, "I will
   sing"--

   "I will love You in life, I will love You in death And praise You as
   long as You lend me breath." "I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto
   you, O Lord, will I sing."

   2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. This was a good
   resolve, but David did not carry it out to the fullest. There were evil
   times when he was not wise and there were sad times when he was far
   from perfect. Still, it is well to make such a resolve as this
   declaration of David when he came to the throne, especially when you
   are newly married, or just opening a business. Oh, that every young man
   and young woman would commence life with such a holy resolution as
   this--"I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way." But notice the
   prayer that follows the resolve--

   2. O when will You come unto me? For I shall be neither wise nor holy
   without You. "O when will You come unto

   me?"

   2. I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. There is a great
   deal in the way in which a man walks in his house. It will not do to be
   a saint abroad and a devil at home! There are some of that kind. They
   are wonderfully sweet at a Prayer Meeting, but they are dreadfully sour
   to their wives and children. This will never do! Every genuine Believer
   should say, and mean it, "I will walk within my house with a perfect
   heart." It is in the home that we get the truest proof of godliness.
   "What sort of a man is he?" said one to George Whitefield, and
   Whitefield answered, "I cannot say, for I never lived with him." That
   is the way to test a man--to live with him.

   3. I will set no wicked thing before my eyes. "I will not look at it,
   for if I do, I may long for it." It is the tendency of things that are
   gazed at to get through the eyes into the mind and the heart. Therefore
   is it wise to say with the Psalmist, "I will set no wicked thing before
   my eyes."

   3. I hate the work of them that turn aside. He means all those who
   practice dodges--the "policy" people--those who never go straight.
   Kings usually like such people as these. Do not men say that an
   ambassador is a gentleman who is paid to live abroad and to lie for the
   benefit of his country? I suppose that is what diplomats in David's day
   generally did, but David resolved that he would have none of that sort
   of folk about him. "I hate the work of them that turn aside."

   3. It shall not cleave to me. "If I touch it, by His Grace, I will not
   let it stick to me. Pitch defiles, so I will keep clear of it and if
   any man tries to practice a trick for my advantage, I will have nothing
   to do with him."

   4. A forward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
   person. "For, if I come to know him, one of these days I may be known,
   myself, to be a wicked person." "Evil communications corrupt good
   manners." No man or woman can afford to be the friend of a man who is
   not a friend of God! If he does not love God, quit his company, for he
   will do you no good. Say with David, "I will not know a wicked person."

   5. Whoever privately slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off. David
   was a king and he meant to study the peace of his people by putting
   down slander. Oh, what mischief is worked by backbiting tittle tattle!
   If we could have a race of men-- and for the matter of that, of women,
   too--with no tongues, it might be an advantage, for there are some who
   use their tongues for very sorry purposes. David says, "Whoever
   privately slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off."

   5. Him that has an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. High
   looks and proud hearts are generally the characteristics of cruel,
   tyrannical, domineering persons--and King David would not have any such
   near him.

   6. My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell
   with me. Oh, that masters had more of an eye to the piety of their
   servants than they often have! They want "clever fellows." Whether they
   are honest or not is generally a secondary question. So long as they
   are profitable to their masters, they will not mind what they are to
   their customers. But David would not have servants of that sort.

   6, 7. He that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that works
   deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that tells lies shall not
   tarry in my sight. He was a king and he could choose his company--and
   he meant to select the truthful and upright. Now mark this! If David
   would not let a man who lies tarry in his sight, you must not expect
   that God will let such tarry in His sight. "All liars shall have their
   part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone," says the
   Scripture. God grant us to have clean, truthful tongues!

   8. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off
   all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. What a practical Psalm this
   is! I have heard of a prince of Saxe-Gotha, years ago, who, whenever he
   thought that one of his ministers or judges was not what he ought to
   be, used always to send him the 101st Psalm to read. It was commonly
   said of such a man, "He will get the 101st Psalm before long." And,
   after reading it, if he did not mend his manners, the prince sent him
   his dismission and he had to go about his business. Oh, that all who
   profess and call themselves Christians would act according to the tenor
   of this straight Psalm which is like a line drawn by the hand of God,
   without a crook or a turn in it!

Comfort and Constancy

   (No. 2363)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY JUNE 3, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   15, 1888.

   "Now our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our Father, which
   has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope
   through Grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good Word
   and work." 2 Thessalonians 2:16,17.

   THE Thessalonians had been a good deal confused by certain persons who
   had said that the coming of the Lord was immediately at hand. Paul,
   therefore, bade them to be steadfast and not be worried and perplexed
   by any such teaching. And then he presented this prayer to God for
   them, that they might have these two things, comfort and
   constancy--that God would comfort their hearts and establish them--"in
   every good Word and work." It is a very blessed and comprehensive
   prayer and, while we are thinking of it, let us be praying it for
   ourselves and for one another, that the Lord may comfort our hearts and
   establish us "in every good Word and work."

   I. The first enquiry to be answered is this, WHY IS THERE THE
   CONJUNCTION OF THESE TWO THINGS IN THIS REMARKABLE PRAYER? Why is it
   put thus, "Our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our Father...
   comfort your hearts and establish you in every good Word and work"?

   I answer, first, the two things, comfort and constancy, are put
   together because comfort by itself is not enough. We do not desire,
   first and above all things, that Christians should have comfort. It is
   a very great privilege to be comforted, especially by the Comforter,
   for such comfort is sound, safe and holy, but, at the same time, they
   err who think that the first and chief reason for knowing God is that
   you may feel comforted and happy! I fear that there are many who are
   under that notion. They expect every sermon to comfort them--otherwise
   they think it is a wasted opportunity. Even when they are alone in
   prayer, their chief thought is that they need to be comforted by their
   own devotion. But, sometimes, rebuke is better than comfort, and
   spiritual quickening and especially true sanctification, are more
   greatly to be valued than any measure of comfort whatever! If we were
   to confine ourselves to prayer for the Lord only to comfort His people,
   we would have a very imperfect form of intercession. No, it needs that
   we should not only be comforted by our religion, but that we should be
   led by it into holy activity so as to abound in every good Word and
   work, and be established therein.

   I give another answer to the question, Why is there this conjunction
   between comfort and constancy? Because establishment in every good Word
   and work is not enough if it is alone. We need to be comforted as well
   as to serve the Lord. Our God is not like Pharaoh who would not give to
   the children of Israel even a day in which they might have rest and
   worship God. Pharaoh said, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let (or
   hinder) the people from their works? Get you unto your burdens." But
   God does not speak so to us. The service which His children render to
   Him is quite compatible with rest. We are like certain birds that are
   said to rest on the wing--we never have a better rest than when every
   faculty is occupied in the service of our Lord!

   But work by itself, establishment in every good Word and work, alone,
   might tend to weariness. We might be jaded if God did not minister
   Divine consolation to us while we served Him. Moreover, I am sure that
   we would never do the work well if God did not comfort us, for unhappy
   workers, those who do not love their work and are not at home in it,
   those who feel no comfort of religion, themselves, are generally very
   poor and unsuccessful workers. The second blessing mentioned in our
   text is certainly a very necessary one, this establishing in every good
   Word and work, but you also need the first one, that God may, "comfort
   your hearts." When you get the two together--when you are up to your
   necks in

   holy service and up to your hearts in Divine comfort--then these two
   things cause you not to be barren or unfruitful and, at the same time,
   they help you not to be weary in well-doing. You are made to be
   "steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,"
   because you are comforted with the belief that, "your labor is not in
   vain in the Lord." I see those two reasons for the conjunction of
   comfort and constancy in the text. First, because comfort, alone, is
   not sufficient and, secondly, because constancy without comfort will
   not suffice us.

   And next, dear Friends, it is because the comfort of the heart aids in
   the establishment of the soul in service. They are put together because
   the one helps the other. May the Lord "comfort your hearts and
   establish you in every good Word and work!" He that is happy in the
   Lord will persevere in the service of the Lord. He that derives real
   support and comfort from his religion is the man who will not backslide
   from it. I notice that it is usually thus with those who decline-- they
   first of all lose the comfort and joy of religion--they have not the
   brightness and delight that they once had in the things of God. And
   then, of course, they drop, first, this particular service, and then
   the other--they begin to absent themselves from the means of Grace,
   Prayer Meetings and so forth, because they miss what is so material a
   stay to the establishment of their minds, that is, the comfort, joy and
   peace that true religion used to bring them.

   Whenever you are not happy in the Lord, I urge you not to rest until
   you become so. It is no small evil to get out of the sunlight of God's
   Countenance. A dear child will not say, "If my father is angry with me,
   it does not matter; he will not kill me; I shall always be his child."
   No, just in proportion as he enjoys his father's love, it will be
   painful to him to come in the least degree under his father's
   displeasure and he will cry out to be fully restored and to have,
   again, from those dear lips the kiss of forgiveness that will put away
   all his offenses. So, dear Friends, believe that your lack of comfort
   is an evil thing which may lead to your loss of industry and
   perseverance in the cause of your Lord. If your heart is not comforted
   by God, you are not likely to be "established in every good Word and
   work."

   Now let me turn the text around the other way. I think that these two
   things are put together because establishment in Word and work is so
   necessary for our comfort. I said we must be comforted that we might be
   constant in the service of God. Now I put it that we must be constant
   in the service of God that we may be comforted! God does not give His
   dainties to idlers. He has choice secrets into which He does not admit
   everybody, nor even all of His own family. When we are diligent in His
   service and all our powers are fully consecrated to Him, then He gives
   us gracious rewards--not of debt, but according to the discipline of
   His own house, wherein He honors the faithful and chastises those who
   are negligent.

   Now, Beloved, you will miss your comfort when you begin to neglect your
   work. I know how it used to be with the boys at home. In cold weather
   they huddled round the fire--almost sat on the fire! It was so cold
   that they could not tell how they would live through the bitter winter.
   But when Father came in, he said, "Now, you boys, set to work and clear
   away that snow. Don't sit here idle, go and do something!" And they
   came in with ruddy cheeks and, somehow or other, the temperature seemed
   to have altered considerably, for they were quite warm from their
   exercise. I think the best thing that could happen to some men would be
   that they might have something to do. I do not find much about
   depression of spirit in the journals of Mr. Wesley or Mr. Whitefield
   and men of that sort who spent themselves in the Lord's service.

   The fact is, the Lord seemed to carry them on from one work to another
   and from strength to strength in their ser-vice--and they were
   comforted as to their hearts because they were established in every
   good Word and work. These things act and react, one upon another--the
   comfort makes us work--the work brings to us a fresh measure of
   comfort! See how even the Savior puts it. He says, "Come unto Me, all
   you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." That is
   the first rest, pardon of sin. What next? "Take My yoke upon you, and
   learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest
   unto your souls." That is another rest over and above what Jesus gives.
   "Through bearing My yoke, you shall find in My service rest unto your
   souls." God grant us Grace to seek that rest which we are to find, now
   that we have received the rest which Jesus gives to those who come to
   Him!

   I have not yet fully answered this question--Why is there the
   conjunction of these two things, comfort and constancy? I think it is
   because the two blended together serve a very useful purpose. We are in
   this world to bear witness and by our bearing witness we are to bring
   others to faith in Christ through the operation of the Holy Spirit.
   Now, there are some people who are only to be won for Christ by the
   holy confidence and comfort of Believers. I am sure that if a Christian
   woman, in the time of affliction at home, is calm, patient, resigned
   and happy, she is more likely to see her husband converted by the
   comfort that religion brings to her own heart than by taking him to
   hear a sermon. By her Christian character she will preach to him and
   supply him with evidence of the power of Grace which he will not be
   able to deny.

   I have known persons, in a storm at sea, exercise great influence over
   all in the vessel by the way in which they have been able to live above
   the storm, resting patiently in God. And in times of personal sickness,
   what a wonderful influence there is about holy patience! Some members
   of the family, who never have been moved by the external services of
   religion, have been deeply impressed by the patience of great
   sufferers--and especially by the serenity of dying saints. They have
   said to themselves, "There is something in this religion, after all.
   There is no mistake about it--the Grace which could support and calm
   the heart at such a time as this must be the gift of God." Now, if this
   were accompanied by idleness, it would lose much or all of its force,
   but when this holy calm comes over one who, in days of health, was full
   of active service for the Master, then the two things, together, become
   powerful arguments which gainsayers are not able to resist! Seek to
   have this blessed blending, this comfort, like a light that burns
   within the lamp, and then this establishment in Word and work, like the
   rays of light that stream from the lantern at the head of the
   lighthouse, that all may see, both far and near.

   And I should like to give one other answer to this query, which is
   this. Paul in his prayer puts the two things together, because there is
   great need for both. There is great need to pray that our Father would
   comfort the hearts of His people, for there is trouble enough in the
   land! There is trouble enough in every house--there is trouble enough
   for each one of us--we need you to often pray for us, that God would
   comfort our hearts. It may be that we have to play the man in public
   and yet, when we get away by ourselves, our heart is very heavy and we
   have to cry mightily to God for supporting Grace. Some of the strongest
   of God's servants, those who carry a smiling countenance, who, if they
   fast, anoint their head and wash their face, that they appear not unto
   men to fast, yet have need to pray very earnestly to the Comforter that
   He would come and sustain their spirit.

   And there is equal need that we should have Grace given us to be
   constant and instant in every good Word and work, for there is a
   tendency in us to think that we have done enough. The feeling creeps
   over men of a certain age that it is time for the young people to do
   the Lord's work. One says, "I am now at such an age that as much cannot
   be expected of me as used to be." Oh, yes, if you have much serving,
   Martha is not the only woman that gets cumbered with it, and being
   cumbered is not confined to women! Oh, how many there are who are not
   women, who are cumbered as much as Martha was! We need to have the
   Mary-spirit to keep the heart bright and cheerful, or else we shall
   quarrel with our work, or with our sister, or possibly with our Master,
   as we say to Him, "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to
   serve alone?" We need both comfort and constancy and, therefore, I
   commend to you this piece of heavenly plaiting--let the two things be
   twisted together in your life! May the Lord "comfort your hearts, and
   establish you in every good Word and work"!

   II. As I look at my text, a second question comes to my mind. WHY DOES
   THE APOSTLE SO SPECIALLY ADDRESS THIS PRAYER? Notice to whom he
   addresses it--"Now our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our
   Father... comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good Word and
   work." Why is this?

   It seems to me that in the first place, in this prayer the whole
   Trinity is supplicated. When the Apostle is desiring comfort to be
   given, he does not mention the Comforter, for that is needless. It
   would occur to every Christian mind that the Holy Spirit was necessary,
   since in comforting and quickening He is only exercising His special
   office. But the Apostle does mention, "Our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself,
   and God, even our Father," so that, to the mind of the thoughtful
   reader, the prayer for comfort and establishment is directed to the
   ever-blessed Three-in-One. Oh, that we more often remembered the
   distinction of the Divine Persons without dividing the Divine
   Substance! It becomes instructed Believers to remember that one
   blessing comes from the Father, another blessing from the Son and a
   third blessing through the Holy Spirit. There are times when it would
   seem as if the one blessing must come through the three Divine Persons,
   that there must be a manifestation of the whole Trinity to produce the
   result. I cannot help noticing that Truth of God and reminding you how
   the Savior is especially placed, here, side by side with, "God, even
   our Father," that we may see that equal reverence is to be paid to Him
   with the Father, and equal prayer to be offered to Him with that
   presented to the great Father of spirits.

   But then, I think next, that mention is here made of, "Our Lord Jesus
   Christ, Himself because, as the prayer is for consolation, He is "the
   Consolation of Israel." The Holy Spirit is the Comforter, but Christ,
   Himself, is the Comfort-- the Holy Spirit gives the consolation, but
   Jesus Christ is the Consolation. Beloved, we are never so comforted as
   when we turn to our blessed Lord, Himself! His Humanity, His sympathy
   with us, His griefs, His bearing our infirmities, His put-

   ting away of our sins, His pleading for us at the right hand of God,
   His everlasting union with His people--all this makes us turn our eyes
   to Him! He is the Sun that makes our day. From Him flows that "river of
   the Water of Life" which quenches our thirst. So you see why the "Lord
   Jesus Christ, Himself," is mentioned in this prayer for comfort, since
   He is the every essence of the Believer's consolation!

   But then we are reminded of "God, even our Father," and is not this
   expression brought to our mind that we may derive comfort from the
   relation which God bears to His people? O you children of God, does not
   the recollection that He is your Father comfort you? Children of the
   heavenly King, is not the fact of your relationship to Him a well of
   unceasing consolation? What more do you require to lift your spirits
   out of the dust than to know that this manner of love has been bestowed
   upon you, that you should be called the children of God! "And if
   children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ"? I
   believe that if the Holy Spirit only lays home to the heart the fact of
   our new birth and our adoption into the family of God, we have enough
   comfort to make us swim through seas of trouble without fear! And also
   enough motive for the most constant, diligent service, when we know
   that it is for our Father who is in Heaven that we are spending the
   strength that He, Himself, gives us! Do you not see, therefore, why the
   Apostle thus addresses His prayer to "God, even our Father," and to
   "our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself"?

   And is not this another reason why Paul thus prayed, because he would
   remind us that it requires the direct action of the Godhead upon our
   hearts to produce comfort and constancy? This is especially evident at
   certain times. Very frequently, when I have to comfort mourners--cases
   where, perhaps, a young husband has been taken away, leaving a large
   family of little children unprovided for--or, perhaps, where two
   persons who have been together for many years, till their lives have
   grown into one and, all of a sudden, the wife or the husband has been
   taken away, I have said and I cannot help saying it often, "My dear
   Friend, I cannot comfort you as I should like to. I have never been
   exactly in your circumstances and, therefore, I cannot enter into your
   peculiar grief. But I would remind you that one Person of the Divine
   Trinity has undertaken the office of Comforter and He can do what
   nobody else can."

   You must, sometimes, have felt the power of a single text of Scripture
   laid upon a wound in your heart--it will staunch the bleeding and heal
   by a sort of heavenly magic! Have you not, at times, felt in a flutter
   of distress so that you could not rest? Christian friends have spoken
   kindly to you, but they only seemed to mock you. Then, in a moment, a
   soft, calming influence has stolen over your spirit and you have felt
   that you could bear 10 times the weight which had almost crushed you an
   hour before! God can comfort to purpose--therefore the Apostle did not
   say--"I hope you will enjoy the comfort I have given you, or that,
   perhaps, your minister, next Lord's-Day may give you." No, this was his
   prayer at this particular juncture--"Now our Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us
   everlasting consolation and good hope through Grace, comfort your
   hearts, and establish you in every good Word and work." It is grand in
   your prayers to fall back upon your God and upon a God whom you know as
   your Lord Jesus Christ, and your Father, and to feel, "The case is
   beyond me, but it is not beyond my God! The trial overwhelms me even in
   my sympathy with the tried one, how much more does it overwhelm the
   actual bearer of it? But I put you and your sorrow into hands quite
   equal to the emergency and leave you there."

   There is much more to be learned than I can tell you, because time
   fails me, as to how it was that the Apostle presented this remarkable
   prayer in this remarkable manner.

   III. The third point, with which I close, is this. WHAT DOES PAUL
   MENTION IN HIS PRAYER AS PLEAS? He

   mentioned several facts for the strengthening of the faith of those for
   whom he prayed and gave arguments which they should use while pleading
   with God for others. Let us speak of these arguments very briefly.
   There are six of them.

   First, Paul says that Jesus is ours. He is asking for comfort and
   establishment and he begins his prayer, "Now, our Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself." Do, if you can, get the sweetness of this expression, "Our
   Lord Jesus Christ." Why did not Paul say, "The Lord Jesus Christ"? Why
   did he not say, "My Lord Jesus Christ"? No, here is a plural possessive
   pronoun--"Our Lord Jesus Christ." Is it so, then, that God has given us
   the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, to be ours? Can we not only call His
   blood ours, and His Resurrection ours, and His Kingdom ours, but is He,
   Himself, ours? Oh, can we get a grip of Him as, "My Beloved"? Is He my
   Husband, my Covenant Head, my Jesus and my All? Come, then, Beloved--I
   was going to say that you hardly need pray for comfort because you have
   it, already--you have it in Jesus!

   Here is a solid mass of the pure gold of comfort in the fact that Jesus
   Christ, Himself, is yours. You are Christ's, but Christ is also yours!
   As the husband belongs to the wife, and the wife belongs to the
   husband, so there is a mutual posses-

   sion between Christ and you who are believers in Him. Are you poor?
   What? And yet Christ is yours? Do you say that you are helpless and
   friendless? How is that when you can say, "Our Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself"? No, here is a well opened in the desert for you--come and say
   to it--"Spring up, O well!" Sing unto it, drink of its Living Water and
   fill your earthen vessels to the fullest! There is comfort enough for
   all saints in "Our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself."

   The second plea in Paul's prayer is that God is our Father--"Now our
   Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our Father." I have already
   shown you what a mine and mountain of delightful consolation lies in
   the fact that the God who made the heavens and the earth, the
   Omnipotent and Unchangeable Jehovah is "our Father." Do not think that
   this is a mere metaphor--that God is only set forth to us under the
   image of a father. There is no doubt that He is our Father-- it is a
   matter of fact if we are trusting His Son. "Doubtless You are our
   Father, though Abraham is ignorant of us and Israel acknowledge us not:
   You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from
   everlasting." We have been begotten again by God--our new birth is from
   His power and His Divine energy! We belong to His family and shall
   never be cast out of it. Dear Friends, what a plea this is in prayer!
   "My Father, will You not comfort my heart? My Father, will You let Your
   child despond? My Father, will You not relieve me in the hour of my
   distress? Jesus Christ, my Lord Jesus Christ, do this for me, and great
   God, my Father, fail not to cheer my heart!"

   Then the Apostle goes on to remind us that God has loved us. Kindly
   look at the text and remember it--"God, even our Father, which has
   loved us." You do not expect me to preach from those words, do you?
   "Which has loved us." I cannot comprehend this Truth! I can very well
   understand God pitying us, as we pity a beggar in the streets--but
   God's loving us always deprives me of the power to explain it! There
   was nothing in us to love! There was everything in us loathsome and
   nothing lovable, yet the Lord loved us before the world began! He has
   loved us without bound, so as to give His only-begotten Son to die for
   us! Is not that a powerful plea in prayer? "Lord, comfort my heart,
   establish me in every good Word and work, for You have loved me,
   therefore continue to love me. If You have given me Your love, surely
   You will not deny me the comforts of Your face and the consolations of
   Your Word."

   Then Paul adds, "Who has loved us, and has given us." God has given us
   much and all His past gifts are pleas for more gifts. Men do not plead
   so. The beggar in the street cannot say, "Give me a penny, today,
   because you gave me one yesterday," else we might reply, "That is the
   reason why I will not give you anymore!" But when dealing with God,
   this is a good plea. "O flowing Fountain, You have long been flowing,
   Flow on still! O blessed Sun, You did shine yesterday, shine today!"
   God loves us to make His past mercies arguments for obtaining future
   blessings, so the Apostle says, "God, even our Father, which has loved
   us, and has given us."

   But what has God given us? God has given us "everlasting consolation."
   Catch at that expression, for it reminds us of everlasting love, the
   Everlasting Covenant, the everlasting promises, everlasting redemption
   and the everlasting Heaven. Men, nowadays, clip this word,
   "everlasting," round the edges. We do not--we take it as we find it.
   That which is everlasting lasts forever--you can be assured of that!
   And God has given us consolation which will last us in life and last us
   in death--and last us throughout eternity! Well, if He has given us
   "everlasting consolation," we may well plead that He would graciously
   enable us to lay hold upon it, that our hearts may be comforted and
   cheered and that we may be established in every good Word and work!

   There is only one more expression upon which I will say a sentence or
   so. God has given us "good hope through Grace." It is of Grace and,
   therefore, it is a gift! And He has given it to us through the
   operation of His Grace upon our hearts. It is a hope, a good hope, a
   "good hope through Grace." We have a good hope that God's love will
   never fail us and that, when life dies out on earth, we shall enter
   into His rest forever and behold His face with joy. We have a good hope
   that when days and years are past, we shall meet in Heaven! We have a
   good hope of dwelling throughout eternity with our God--"forever with
   the Lord." O Father, after You have done so much for us and given so
   much to us, it is but little we ask of You, now, when we pray You to
   comfort our hearts and to establish us in every good Word and work!

   I cannot understand what those do who have no God. I cannot comprehend
   the condition of those who have no "good hope through Grace." What can
   they do? They have to work very hard from Monday morning to Saturday
   night. On Sunday they have no day of rest, no thought of a world to
   come, no rising to a purer atmosphere. They lie in bed, perhaps, in the
   morning, and then get up and lounge about in their shirtsleeves. There
   is nothing for them to get but what is found beneath the moon and very
   little of that. It is better to be a dog than a man if there is no hope
   of a hereaf-

   ter! It is better not to live at all than to live such a dead,
   good-for-nothing life as that man lives who lives without God and
   without hope!

   Surely, you who are without God and without Christ, have your sinking,
   your mourning, your dull times, have you not? What do you do, then?
   Perhaps you try to drug yourself with strong drink. Alas, some do that
   and this is mischievous, indeed--to try to poison conscience and
   silence the best friend you have within you! Do not so, but think about
   God, and about "our Lord Jesus Christ." This way lies hope, where
   stands that Cross, and He pleads, who received, there, those five
   wounds for sinners! This way lies your only hope! Oh, that you would
   think of it and consider it! If God Himself comes down from Heaven to
   save men, it must be worthwhile for man to look and understand what God
   did for him in that wondrous Sacrifice. Look, for--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One"--

   look now, for--

   "There is life at this moment for you." Especially is there life for
   you who came in here troubled, downcast, almost wishing you were not
   alive at all, but fearing that when life came to an end, it might be
   worse for you than ever, for you have "the dread of something after
   death." Oh, that you were reconciled to God through the death of Jesus
   Christ! That being done, He would comfort your hearts and you would be
   led into every good Word and work through gratitude to the Lord Jesus
   Christ, our Savior, and His Grace would save you and preserve you to
   the end! May this be the very moment when you shall seek and find the
   Lord!" "If you seek Him, He will be found of you." God grant it, for
   His dear son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 Thessalonians 2; 3:1-5.

   2 Thessalonians 2:1, 2. Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto Him, that you
   be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
   word, nor by letter as from us, as that the Day of Christ is at hand.
   Paul believed in the Second Coming of Christ, for he beseeches the
   Brothers and Sisters, "by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." He felt
   the power of this great Truth. He often exhorts us to be watchful
   because of the uncertainty of the time of that coming as far as we are
   concerned. But there were some who sprang up in his day, as in ours,
   who professed that they knew a great deal about the Second Advent--when
   it was to happen, and so on--and they began to foretell and to prophesy
   beyond what was really revealed of God. By this means, some persons
   were terrified and others driven to a very foolish course of action. It
   would seem, from this Epistle, that some people forsook their daily
   calling and, on pretence of the near return of Christ, endeavored to
   live upon the alms of Christian people instead of themselves working.
   Many, however, were shaken in mind, so Paul wrote to reassure and
   strengthen them--"That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
   neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
   Day of Christ is at hand."

   3, 4. Let no man deceive you, by any means: for that Day shall not
   come, except there comes a falling away, first, and that man of sin is
   revealed, the son of perdition; who opposes and exalts himself above
   all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, as God, sits
   in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. It has been
   usually thought that this passage alludes to the great apostasy of the
   Church of Rome and, certainly, if there were a hue and cry raised for
   the culprit here described, one might well arrest that apostasy upon
   suspicion! It may not, however, be the man of sin, or the son of
   perdition--it may be that general spirit which springs up again and
   again, one of the many anti-Christs that were already in the world even
   in John's day. There are many such spirits that are constantly rising
   up, not outside the Church--there, we could deal with them--but inside
   the Church, using the Words of Truth, and the signs of Truth to signify
   something far other than the Truth of God! This is the great rook that
   threatens destruction! Oh, that God's Church might always be kept from
   striking upon it! But there is this rook which would, if it were
   possible, wreck the very elect ship of Christ, itself!

   5-7. Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these
   things? And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in
   his time. For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only He who
   now lets will let, until He is taken

   out of the way. There was something that hindered the full development
   of anti-Christ in Paul's day. When that is taken out of the way, then
   will there be a fuller revelation of this sinful system.

   8-12. And then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord shall
   consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the
   brightness of His coming. Even him, whose coming is after the working
   of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all
   deceivableness of unrighteousness, in them that perish, because they
   received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved. And for
   this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
   believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the
   Truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. We will not attempt to
   explain all this in detail. It would be too much of a task for a mere
   exposition, but the Church has always to be on her guard against that
   which comes as an angel of light, but is really a spirit of darkness.

   13. But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren,
   beloved of the Lord, because God has, from the beginning, chosen you to
   salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth.
   How the saints praise one another! How sweet is Christian fellowship!
   How we rejoice in the blessed love of God to His people when we are
   assailed by those who battle against His Truth! Then is the love of the
   Brethren stronger than ever and our faithfulness to God is largely
   increased. The Apostle falls back upon the doctrine of electing
   love--"God has, from the beginning, chosen you to salvation." And he
   admires the methods by which that love effects its purpose--"Salvation
   through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth." Men are
   made holy by the Spirit of God--the holiness is that of life and of the
   understanding. They attain to a belief of the Truth of God, as well as
   to a practice of the Divine Commands. Oh, happy people who are
   ordained, from the beginning, unto salvation through sanctification of
   the Spirit and belief of the Truth!

   14. To which He called you by our Gospel, to the obtaining of the glory
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. How the Apostle loved the Gospel! It was
   Christ's Gospel, but Paul calls it, "Our Gospel." He and his Brethren
   had made it so completely their own and it had become so much their own
   in contradistinction to "another gospel, which is not another," that he
   speaks of it with unction and joy! "He called you by our Gospel, to the
   obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   15. Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you
   have been taught, whether by word, or our Epistle. "The things which we
   have handed out to you, which you have been taught, whether by word, or
   our Epistle." They had heard Paul preach. He had not only written to
   them, but he had also spoken to them. And he bade them treasure up what
   he had said and what he had written, and hold it fast as for dear life.
   The Apostle did not preach that which he, afterwards, left, as the
   ostrich leaves its eggs, but he watched over it and he watched over the
   people who had heard it, anxious that the Truth of God to which they
   had listened should prove in them to be the message of everlasting
   life! Oh, my dear Hearers, are there not still some of you who have
   heard our Gospel, to whom we have often and long spoken and yet,
   notwithstanding, it has not yet been the message of eternal life to you
   though it has been to many others? God have mercy upon you and yet
   bring you to the feet of Jesus! As for others who come to listen to the
   Word for the first time-- may it be the power of God unto salvation on
   the very first occasion of their hearing it, to the praise of God and
   the Glory of His Son!

   16. 17. Now our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even our Father,
   which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good
   hope through Grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good
   Word and work. I believe in an established Church--not established by
   acts of Parliament--but established by the purpose and by the Presence
   of God in the midst of it. Oh, to be a member of a Church established
   in every good Word and work! Do you know God's Word? Seek to know it
   better, still! Try to strike your roots down deeply into this fruitful
   soil! Suck out the Divine nutriment of it, that you may grow so strong
   that none shall be able to tear you away from it!

   Have you begun to work for Jesus? May you be established in that good
   work! Go on working more and more, with both your hands and all your
   heart, that somehow you may glorify His blessed name! Let me read these
   sweet verses again--"Now our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and God, even
   our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting
   consolation and good hope through Grace, comfort your hearts, and
   establish you in every good Word and work."

   2 Thessalonians 3:1. Finally, brethren, pray for us. "Pray for us,"
   says the Apostle. "Pray for myself and the Brothers who are with me.
   Pray for all the Apostles and preachers of the Word." "Finally,
   Brethren." If this were the last word we had to say to you, we would
   make just this request, "Finally, Brothers and Sisters, pray for us."
   You cannot tell how much God's servants are helped by the prayers of
   His people! The strongest man in Israel will be the better for the

   prayers of the weakest saint in Zion! If you can do nothing else, you
   can pray for us--therefore, day and night, be at the Mercy Seat on our
   behalf. "Finally, Brethren, pray for us."

   1. That the Word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified,
   even as it is with you. "You Thessalonians enjoy the power of the Word.
   Pray that it may be so everywhere else." Paul is said to have written
   this Epistle from Corinth or Athens, and he longed that, there, the
   Word of God might prevail as it had done at Thessalonica. Pray just now
   that in every part of the world, God's Word may have free course! There
   are many who stand in the way of it. Pray God that they may be swept
   out of the way, that the Word of the Lord may have free course. We need
   the Gospel to run and spread till the whole earth shall know its
   blessed message!

   2. And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for
   all men have not faith. All men are not candid, or true. "All men have
   not faith."

   3. But the Lord is faithful. What a wonderful contrast this is and how
   suggestive of comfort! "All men have not faith. But the Lord is full of
   faith, faith-ful." True, He keeps all His promises. "The Lord is
   faithful."

   3-5. Who shall establish you, and keep you from evil. And we have
   confidence in the Lord touching you, that you both do and will do the
   things which we command you. And the Lord direct your hearts. You see,
   Paul does not command the Thessalonians to do anything but what he can
   pray God to work in them. The command of a man, by itself, is nothing,
   but when he only asks that to be done which he can pray God to do, then
   there is power about his message! "We have confidence in the Lord
   touching you, that you both do and will do the things which we command
   you. And the Lord direct your hearts."

   5. Into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ. May
   the Lord hear that prayer for all of us, for Christ Jesus' sake! Amen.

Poverty and Riches

   (No. 2364)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 10 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH
   22, 1888.

   "For you know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was
   rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you, through His poverty,
   might be rich," 2 Corinthians 8:9.

   I AM very weary, tonight, having had day after day, almost without
   cessation, to make a supreme effort to address large assemblies. I
   felt, therefore, that the only subject that I could handle would be
   some theme that was restful and did not require any great thought on
   the part of the preacher or his hearers. I want to have a bath and rest
   myself while I am speaking to you, and, perhaps, it may not hurt you,
   either, for I doubt not that you often grow weary with daily cares. So
   we shall have no difficult problem, no mysterious doctrine to consider
   at this time, but shall only talk about things that we know.

   The text begins, "For you know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ." You
   know this, for you believe it. You have no doubt, whatever, that there
   was a wondrous graciousness in the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Grace is an attribute of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Spirit--and you know that there was infinite Grace, favor, compassion,
   in the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ--and it was that and not your
   merits, which constrained Him to lay aside the royalties of Heaven and
   endure the sufferings and the griefs of our mortality. "You know the
   Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ."

   You know this Grace, too, because you have learned to perceive the
   outcome of it. You not only know it as a seed, but you know the blessed
   flowers that have grown out of it because, in His Grace, He became poor
   that you might be rich. And, in taking of those riches which He has
   procured for you, you have not only drunk of His bitter soup, but you
   have drunk of the spiced wine of His pomegranate, so that you now know
   the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ by that which is the fruit and the
   outcome of it.

   I think that the Apostle here meant that we also know the Grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ through what He has done for us. We might have known,
   as a matter of fact, that Jesus was gracious, but we could not have
   seen it so as practically to know it if He, having been rich, had not
   become poor, that we, through His poverty, might be rich. The way the
   Apostle shows that Truth of God is just this. He was urging the
   Corinthian Christians to liberality. They were a far richer community
   than the Church at Philippi, but He tells them that the Churches of
   Macedonia, out of their poverty, had often been generous to the poor
   and he persuades these Corinthians, who were better off, not to be
   behind the Philippi-ans.

   After Paul had quoted this example to them, he felt that he had a far
   stronger argument to fall back upon. He seemed to say, "How am I to
   know your Grace except by your works? How am I to know that you have
   Christ in your hearts except by what you give out of your gifts to help
   your poorer friends?" He then gives this as the proof that we must see
   Grace by the results it produces--"You know the Grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ by this fact, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He
   became poor, that you, through His poverty, might be rich." The same
   Law of God, that the Grace within must be manifest by the action
   without, applies to Christ as well as to us. If He had not become poor
   to make us rich, how would we have fully known His Grace? And if you
   and I do not give of our substance, and of our talents, to the poor,
   and to the cause of Christ, how shall we know and how shall others know
   that there is any Grace at all within our hearts?

   Beloved, as I have said before, I may say to you, again--you know the
   Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ because you have not only heard it, but
   you have seen it--you have tasted and handled the Grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. Your hope

   of Heaven lies in that Grace! Your daily comfort lies there. If Christ
   were not gracious, you would be graceless. If you did not know His
   Grace, you would have no Grace of your own, for certain--for it is from
   Him, as from an ever-flowing fountain--that all the streams of Grace
   come to you. Happy men and happy women if, as I read this text, "You
   know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," you can each one say, "Yes, I
   do know it, glory be to God!"

   There are two things for me to talk about tonight. They are both very
   simple and lie on the surface of the text. The first is, the poverty of
   our Lord Jesus Christ. And the second is, the riches of His saints.

   I. First, let us think of THE POVERTY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST--"Though
   He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor."

   This poverty was voluntarily undertaken for our sakes. There was no
   need that Christ should be poor except for our sakes. Some persons are
   born poor and it seems as if, with all their struggles, they could
   never rise out of poverty. But of our Lord Jesus Christ it can truly be
   said, "He was rich." Shall I take you back in thought to the glories of
   the eternity when, as very God of very God, He dwelt in the bosom of
   the Father? He was so rich that all He possessed was as nothing to Him.
   He was not dependent upon any of the angels He had created, nor did He
   rely for Glory upon any of the works of His hands. Truly, Heaven was
   His abode, but He could have made ten thousand heavens if He had willed
   to do so! All the greatest wonders He had ever made were but specimens
   of what He could make. He had all possibility of inconceivable and
   immeasurable wealth within His power, yet He laid aside all that,
   denied Himself the power to enrich Himself, and came down to earth that
   He might help us! His poverty was all voluntary--there was a necessity
   laid upon Him, but the sole necessity was His own love. There was no
   need, as far as He was concerned, that He should ever be poor--the only
   need was because we were in need and He loved us so that He would
   rescue us from poverty and make us eternally rich!

   Our Lord's was also very emphatic poverty. I believe that it is quite
   true that no one knows the pinch of poverty like a person who has once
   been rich. It is your fallen emperor who has to beg his bread, who
   knows what beggary is! It is the man who once possessed broad acres
   who, at last, has to rent his lodging in a miserable attic, who knows
   what poverty is! So was it with the Savior--He was emphatically rich.
   You cannot press into the word, "rich," all that Jesus was--you have to
   feel that it is a very poor word, even though it is rich, with which to
   describe His heavenly condition. He was emphatically rich and so, when
   He descended into poverty, it was poverty with an emphasis laid upon
   it, the contrast was so great. The difference between the richest and
   the poorest man is just nothing compared with the difference between
   Christ in the Glory of His Godhead and Christ in His humiliation--the
   stoop was altogether immeasurable! You cannot describe His riches and
   you cannot describe His poverty. You have never had any idea of how
   high He was as God and you can never imagine how low He stooped when He
   cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"

   His poverty, then, was voluntarily undertaken and it was emphasized by
   its contrast to the riches He had before. Now let us try to examine
   some of the details of this poverty.

   First, this poverty of Christ was seen in His condition. It was great
   poverty to Him to be a Man. Humanity is a poor thing when you set it in
   comparison with the Deity. What a narrow space does man fill--but God
   is Infinite. What little can man do--but God is Omnipotent. How little
   does man know--but God is Omniscient. How confined is man to a single
   spot--yet God is Omnipresent. I say not that Jesus ever ceased to be
   God, but we must remember that He became Man and, in becoming Man, He
   became poor in comparison with His condition as God. But then, as Man,
   He was also a poor Man. He might have been born in marble halls,
   swaying the scepter of an universal empire and, from His birth,
   receiving the homage of all mankind. But instead of that, you know, He
   was reputed to be the carpenter's Son, His mother was but a humble
   Jewish maid and His birthplace was a stable--poor accommodation for the
   Prince of the kings of the earth!

   His early life was spent in a carpentry shop and afterwards His
   companions were mostly poor fishermen. You do not find Him consorting
   with the senators and philosophers, or great ones of the earth--He goes
   from one lowly home to another. And for His maintenance He is dependent
   upon the alms of His followers. Certain women ministered unto Him of
   their substance. He was, all His life, familiar with poverty, so that
   He could say, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
   nests, but the Son of Man has not where to lay His head." You remember
   that passage which is broken up by our translators so as to make a
   chapter begin where there should be no division? "Every man went unto
   His own house. Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives," for He had not a
   house--His only home was among the olive trees where He pleaded with
   His God!

   Then remember that Christ, while He was here, was a Servant. He was the
   Servant of the Father. Though He counted it not robbery to be equal
   with God, yet He took upon Himself the form of a Servant. He has been
   well called, by the Latins, "Servus servorum," the Servant of servants.
   And you see Him in that character when He rises from supper, lays aside
   His garments, takes a towel and girds Himself--and pouring water into a
   basin, begins to wash His disciples' feet. Well did He say, "I am among
   you as He that serves." He, before whom the brightest seraph veils His
   face and lies low in humble adoration, yet washes His disciples' feet!
   You can understand, then, how in His condition He is numbered among the
   poor.

   Perhaps the poverty of Christ is seen more clearly as to His condition,
   in His association, not only with poor disciples, but with the despised
   of mankind. The Pharisees truly said, "This Man receives sinners and
   eats with them." This was the occasion when Luke wrote, "Then drew near
   unto Him all the publicans and sinners for to hear Him." He made
   Himself their companion for their good, for He had come to seek and to
   save that which was lost. He condescended to be among the very lowest,
   no, He did not sometimes stoop to them, but He seemed to be always in
   their midst, always raking in the mire to find the jewels that had been
   lost there! So, Beloved, you will see that as a Man, a poor Man, a
   Servant, and associating with the very lowest of men for their good,
   Christ had become, indeed, poor in His condition.

   The second point of His poverty was in His reputation. All Glory
   belonged to Christ, the praises of all the heavenly host were gladly
   given to Him, but He made Himself of no reputation. Often, while He was
   here, men treated Him with all the scorn and contempt that they could
   possibly display. Let me quote these words slowly, "Then did they spit
   in His face." They blindfolded Him. They buffeted Him. They struck Him
   with the palms of their hands, saying, "Prophesy unto us, Christ! Who
   is he that struck You?" They called Him, "a gluttonous Man and a
   winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners." They took His
   reputation from Him--some even went so far as to say that He worked His
   miracles through Beelzebub, the prince of the devils! It was not
   possible that they could degrade Him lower than they did! Their scorn
   went to the very uttermost against this blessed and adorable Son of
   God! Even those who were reputed to be good men, at times, thought
   little of Him. His mother and His brothers and sisters tried to entrap
   Him because they, evidently, judged that He was insane! And in the time
   of His direst need, all His disciples fled from Him and left Him alone.
   In His greatest extremity no man did Him homage, but everyone had an
   ill word for Him. In this respect He was poor--He made Himself of no
   reputation.

   I do not know whether any of you ever had to do what has fallen to the
   lot of some few--after standing in good repute among your
   brethren--deliberately knowing what you were doing, to do that which
   subjects you to misrepresentation and scorn, but to do it for the
   Lord's sake and to suffer all the consequences without wincing. I can
   tell you that it is a poverty, indeed, to a tender spirit to be bereft
   of the respect which one has long enjoyed. Yet the Savior, out of love
   of us, stripped Himself of every single vestment of honor that He had a
   right to wear--and He became despised and rejected of men, a Man of
   Sorrows, and acquainted with grief! This was a part of His
   poverty--poverty of reputation.

   Then, thirdly, there was a poverty in operation, for the Lord Jesus
   Christ, in His own natural estate, was able to do anything that He
   pleased. There was nothing which He wished to do which He could not do.
   Did He but judge it right to create or to destroy, all was in His
   power. But when He came to this earth, for our sakes He became poor. It
   was necessary, then, for Him to put a restraint upon His own
   Omnipotence. He is hungry, but it is a temptation of the Evil One which
   suggests to Him that He should turn stones into bread. He is thirsty
   and at a word from Him, the water would have leaped from the well! But
   He has to beg from a woman of Samaria and say to her, "Give Me to
   drink." He never works a miracle on His own behalf. He makes Himself as
   poor as to His operations, as unable to help Himself, as the most
   incapable among us! And this, mark you, by a continued determination of
   His will that He would remain poor, for had He so determined, He could,
   with but a wish, have summoned legions of angels to come from Heaven to
   His assistance! How can I sufficiently admire this voluntary poverty of
   operation? Our Lord Jesus Christ will restrict Himself to loss,
   suffering and even death, when, naturally, He possesses the power to
   deliver Himself from all these trials.

   The next kind of poverty that I see in Christ is poverty in communion.
   If a man were ever so poor, yet if he could always associate with
   persons of education and refinement, supposing him to be a man of that
   kind, poverty would be a small matter. "We cultivate," said the
   Edinburgh students, "we cultivate literature upon a little oatmeal
   porridge," and nobody seems to pity them! Nobody needs to pity
   them--they are quite willing to take the porridge if they can get the
   literature! If they can associate with men of thought and men of
   standing, they have a feast of reason and have a flow of

   soul--and they are content with a little oatmeal if that is their only
   fare. But our Savior never consorted with anybody who could, for a
   moment, be called His equal! He learned from no man. There was one
   disciple whom Jesus loved--we can all tell why He loved John--because
   John was the nearest to his Master. But what a long way down it was
   from Jesus to John! It makes a man feel himself in an awful solitude
   when he outgrows his fellows. You may pine for such a position, young
   man, and long to reach the very highest peak of the mountain, but it is
   cold up there and bleak, and lonely! I believe far greater enjoyment is
   to be had when you are the equal of your fellow men and can associate
   with them as such. But as for our Lord and Master, He seems always on
   the pinnacle of the Temple or the summit of the mountain. I know that
   in His condescension He is never there! He stoops to the people, but
   still it is a stoop and, stooping, you know, is back-aching work. I
   mean, it is heart-aching work to be always having to stoop and to have
   nobody who is your comrade and associate.

   Jesus shut Himself off from the grandest company that He might have
   had, from the senate of the skies, from the assemblies of the perfect,
   from the multitude of angels! The heavenly beings may come and go
   casually with errands from on high, but, for the most part, Jesus is
   here to associate with the sinful--His perfect mind to be in constant
   contact with the ignorant--His trained and cultured and holy spirit to
   be vexed by the frivolous and the fickle who cannot be depended upon.
   What a poverty must the faithful, the just, the true, the wise Savior
   have felt when even His disciples could not understand Him and when, as
   He unveiled some of the deeper Truths of God, He had come to reveal,
   "many of His disciples went back and walked no more with Him." It was a
   greater poverty, still, when, in the Garden, rising from the agony and
   bloody sweat, He found the three that were nearest to Him, sleeping,
   and He said to them, "What, could you not watch with Me one hour?" Ah,
   then was He in the depths of poverty, indeed, as to the communion of
   His spirit!

   Still, I think that we have not reached the lowest deeps of the
   Savior's poverty till we come to the fact of His bearing sin. A man may
   be very poor as to worldly goods and he may be able to bear it. He may
   have taken another's debts upon himself and they may press heavily upon
   him, yet the load may not crush Him. But when he loses his character
   because of no wrong of his own, but because he wishes to deliver
   another, and when he has to come into contact with the sin of another
   and cannot help coming into contact with it--if his mind is pure and
   innocent--it is an awful poverty to him! Brothers and Sisters, it is
   the greatest miracle I ever heard of that the Lamb of God should bear
   the sin of men at all-- and should so bear sin as to take it away,
   because, remember, there was in Christ no taint of sin of any kind!

   There was no inclination to sin in Him and yet, (hear these Inspired
   Words), "He has made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin." Of course,
   the Savior never could be sinful and we will use no words that might
   even suggest such a thought! We would, with indignation, repudiate such
   an idea, but yet He did occupy the sinner's place. He did endure the
   sinner's curse--"As it is written, cursed is everyone that hangs on a
   tree." No, I will even dare to say that before the Lord God, He stood
   as the one Sinner, though He was no sinner! But the Lord made to meet
   on Him the iniquity of us all. Jesus stood to answer the summons of the
   Law of God and to appear there as the Substitute for His people, "the
   Just for the unjust." But still, to appear there for the unjust--"who
   His own Self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." Let me give
   you those words, again--"who His own Self bore our sins in His own body
   on the tree."

   He who was "God over all, blessed forever." He without whom was not
   anything made that was made--for Him to whom the cherubim and seraphim
   continually cry, "Holy, holy, holy"--this must be abject poverty,
   indeed, that though He was rich in holiness, for our sakes He became
   poor in bearing our sin!

   The end of His poverty and the climax of it, was when at last He died.
   We have, perhaps, never realized the wonder that He "who only has
   immortality" did actually die! His spirit departed. He gave up the
   ghost, the ghost who had been a guest within His body. He gave up that
   guest and His body was tenantless--an empty house. What a sight is
   that, (I wonder not that great painters have tried to depict it), the
   taking of Christ down from the Cross, the wrapping of His mangled body
   in the fair white linen and the precious spices! Can this really be the
   Son of God, the Redeemer of men? Do they wrap Him up in a winding sheet
   and do the holy men and women actually bear Him to a tomb? Yes, and to
   a borrowed tomb, for as He had lain in a borrowed cradle, He now sleeps
   in a borrowed sepulcher! They put Him there, for He is dead. His eyes
   are as firmly closed as those of any other dead man and His hands are
   as cold and motionless, for Christ's was no fancied death. The Lord of
   Life and Glory did actually die and there, in Joseph's tomb, was He
   buried. And from there He rose the third day. As the earth quakes and
   the angel rolls away the stone from the sepulcher, say to yourselves,

   "You know, now, the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, though He was
   rich, yet for our sakes became poor," so poor that He actually lay,
   awhile, dead in Joseph's tomb!

   There I leave this first point. May God the Holy Spirit help us to
   understand the poverty of our Lord Jesus Christ!

   II. But now, dear Friends, very rapidly, but yet I trust, deliberately,
   I want to show you THE RICHES OF BELIEVERS. They are exactly parallel
   with the poverty of Christ. Our Lord Jesus Christ did not come into the
   world to become poor with regard to money, or that you and I might
   become rich in worldly wealth, for many of the best of His people are
   still as poor as poverty, so far as this paltry pelf is concerned! He
   came to give us true riches as He came to endure true poverty. I have
   brought before your notice a poverty that did not lie so much in the
   scantiness of His apparel, or in the hardness of His fare, as in other
   matters. So the riches which Christ gives do not lie in our being
   clothed in scarlet and fine linen, or faring sumptuously every
   day--they are similar in character to the marks of our Lord's poverty!

   First, then, He made His people rich in condition. Brothers and
   Sisters, we are servants, as Christ was. But that which was a lowering
   to Him is a lifting up for us! To us there is no greater honor than to
   be called the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ--and to wait upon the
   servants of God. To be servus servorum is a privilege that any one of
   us might covet. To wash the disciples' feet is now an honor to us and
   we feel it to be so. If the servant is permitted to be as his Master,
   it is a great exaltation for him. By Christ's poverty, we are made rich
   in our condition, so that, today, we are the sons of God! Today we have
   access to the Mercy Seat! Today God listens to the voice of a man!
   Today Jesus has made us kings and priests unto God and we shall reign
   forever and ever! The condition of the believing man is a highly
   exalted one in proportion as the condition of Christ was one of
   humiliation and poverty!

   So is it with regard to the Believer in his reputation. Oh, Brothers
   and Sisters, what a reputation Christ has given us! He has given us the
   reputation which He threw away, for now we are righteous in His
   righteousness! We are comely in the comeliness which He puts upon us!
   We have a name and a place, now, better than that of sons and
   daughters! We are not now reckoned among the guilty, but among the
   godly! We are not numbered among the rebellious strangers, but among
   the obedient children! Oh, blessed be the name of Jesus! He has clothed
   us with honor because He clothed Himself with shame!

   The same is true as to our operation. I showed you how Christ
   voluntarily narrowed and limited His power, but behold how He has
   widened our power! There is a text I often look at and admire. Jesus
   said, "He that believes on Me, the works that I do shall He do, also,
   and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto My Father."
   He makes us to have an almost boundless power! We are nothing but poor
   feeble men and yet how wonderfully does God use men! Have you ever
   noticed, in Paul's Epistles, how he represents the minister of Christ
   as being both father and mother to a new-born soul? Writing to
   Philemon, he says, "I beseech you for my son, Onesimus, whom I have
   begotten in my bonds." And to the Galatians he writes, "My little
   children, of whom I travail in birth, again, until Christ is formed in
   you." Is it not a very wonderful thing that we should be called,
   "workers, together with God"--our weakness working side by side with
   Omnipotence, itself?

   My Brothers and Sisters, perhaps you do not know how greatly Christ has
   enriched you. Have you ever proven how rich He has made you in the
   power of prayer? "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it." "If you
   abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask what you will,
   and it shall be done unto you." We do not make enough use of the great
   name of Christ! If we did, we would work miracles--I mean not in the
   material world, but spiritual miracles would be at our beck and call!
   Our great Lord Jesus, by His poverty of operation, has made us rich in
   a wondrous power of Grace!

   I also said that He had become poor in communion and I showed you how
   narrow was the circle of men with whom He could associate. But He has
   wonderfully enriched us in communion, so that we have come, "to the
   general assembly and Church of the first-born, who are written in
   Heaven." Behold, He has given us such fellowship with Himself that He
   says of us who believe, "These are My mother, and My sister, and My
   brothers." We also have fellowship with God-- "Truly our fellowship is
   with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ." What riches He has
   given us here!

   Next, you remember, I spoke about Christ's bearing sin as being an
   awful instance of His poverty, but by His Substitution, we have
   acceptance with God. See how rich He has made us, for we are, "accepted
   in the Beloved." "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God."
   That is a wonderful passage in Jeremiah's prophecy, "This is the name
   wherewith she shall be called, the Lord Our Righteousness." What? The
   Church, itself, called, "The Lord Our Righteousness"? Yes, she takes
   her husband's name! The Church has Christ's own title bestowed upon
   her! Christ became poor, indeed, as He stood

   in our place, but He has fixed us in a large and wealthy place by
   giving us complete acceptance with the Father through His
   righteousness.

   Then, as I completed the story, I pictured our Lord Jesus as lying in
   the death sleep of the tomb. But think, O Beloved, that He has now, in
   consequence of that death, given us eternal life. His own words are,
   "He that believes on Me has everlasting life." "Whoever lives and
   believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?" Because Christ
   died, we live. Because He died, we shall never die! The capital
   sentence has been executed upon our Substitute and can never be
   executed again. Punishment cannot be inflicted, first on the bleeding
   Surety, and then on those for whom that Surety stood! Therefore we live
   by His death and over us, the Second Death can have no power! Death is
   not annihilation. No thoughtful person ever fancies that it is. Death
   is the separation of the soul from the body. Death, in its highest
   sense, is the separation of the soul from God. We may know the first
   death, the rending of the soul from the body, but the Second Death, the
   separation of the soul from God--that we shall never know--for Jesus
   knew it on our behalf when He said, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?" But now, "Christ being raised from the dead dies no more;
   death has no more dominion over Him, for in that He died, He died unto
   sin, once: but in that He lives, He lives unto God." Oh, how rich He
   has made us in the indestructible everlasting life which He has
   bestowed upon us through His atoning death and His glorious
   Resurrection!

   I close with just these two or three remarks which the subject
   suggests.

   First, if such is the result of Christ's poverty, "that you, through
   His poverty, might be rich," what will the result of His riches be? If
   by His death we live, what must be the outcome of His life? If by His
   humiliation we are so enriched, what will come of His Glory? If by His
   first coming, when He came as a Sin-Offering, all this is accomplished,
   what may not be expected when He shall come a second time without a
   Sin-Offering unto salvation? Try and work out that problem if you can!

   Here is another. If Christ's poverty is such as I have tried to
   describe it, what must the riches of His people be? If our riches are
   proportionate to His poverty, what rich people we are! He was poor as
   poor can be and we, if we are believing in Him, are as rich as rich can
   be! So low as He went, so high do we rise! That is how the scales of
   the sanctuary act--as He sinks, we go up! Will you try to see how high
   you must be according to this standard? What riches must belong to you
   when you judge of them by Christ's poverty!

   The next question is, if such are our riches, why do we complain of
   poverty? There stands a child of God who does not know whether he has
   any Grace. He is putting his hand into his soul's pocket to see whether
   he can find a pennyworth of Grace. My Brother, all things are yours if
   you are Christ's, for it pleased the Father that in Him should all
   fullness dwell! There is many a child of the King who is entitled to
   reign like a prince, who continues to live like a miser. He weighs
   every ounce he eats. He starves himself, spiritually, near unto death.
   What are you doing? Why shouldn't you, to whom God has given Christ,
   that is to say, everything--be glad in the Lord and rejoice with
   unspeakable joy--and full of glory?

   I close with one more question. If such was His power, why shouldn't
   we, also, for His Glory, be willing to be poor? If He would throw aside
   His honor, why shouldn't we throw ours aside? If He gave up His ease,
   why shouldn't we give up ours? If He was willing to be a Servant, why
   shouldn't we be servants? If He made Himself of no reputation, why
   shouldn't we do the same? That is very different from the action of my
   friend over there who said, "Well, you know, I shall not stand it. I do
   not think that I should be treated like that. I really feel that I
   ought to be more respected." Ah, poor Soul, if you knew yourself, you
   would not talk so! Who among us deserves any respect? They call us,
   "Reverend." It makes me sick to think that any mortal man should be
   considered a "reverend" person! What reverence can be due to us except
   that every wife is to "see that she reverences her husband"? That is
   Scriptural--but it is never said that every hearer is to reverence the
   preacher! Oh, what poor creatures we are at our best!

   If God were to permit us to be doormats to the Church, it would be too
   high an honor for us! I have seen a broom, sometimes, outside a door
   where farming men come to brush their boots. It is a grand thing for a
   man to be just like that. I think that I am getting very near to that
   honor and glory, so many are scraping their boots against me just now,
   and I am well content that it should be so if they get some of the mud
   off and do not go and spoil God's floor inside. Let all of us feel that
   what becomes of us matters nothing at all! Let us be willing to die in
   a ditch so long as Jesus Christ sits on the Throne of God and His great
   Truth is established in the world.

   "You know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich,
   yet for your sakes He became poor." Go and imitate Him and be willing
   to be nothing at all, if only He may be All in All. God bless you!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 22:1-21.

   This marvelous Psalm is a wonderful prophecy which might seem as if it
   had been composed after the suffering of our Lord. But it was written
   many hundreds of years before His Incarnation and death. It is "a Psalm
   of David," and is dedicated, "To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth
   Shahar," or, as the margin renders it, "the hind of the morning." We
   know who that hunted Hind of the morning is. We seem to see Him
   panting, his flanks white with foam, pressed by the dogs, almost torn
   to pieces by the cruel enemy. The Psalm begins with words that, in all
   their fullness, belong to nobody else but our Well-Beloved.

   Verse 1. My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Every word is
   emphatic. You may put the stress where you please, upon every single
   word. "My God, My God." With two hands He takes hold on God, crying,
   "My God, My God," "Eloi, Eloi, My Strong One, why have You forsaken
   Me?" Or read it, "Why have You forsaken Me?" "Why have You forsaken
   Me?" "Why have You forsaken Me?" You get a different shade of meaning
   each time, but each meaning is true.

   1. Why are You so far from helping Me, and from the words of My
   roaring? The Savior's prayers had ceased to be articulate. They had
   become, in His own judgement, like the pained crying of a wounded
   beast. He calls them, "My roaring." Oh, what prayers were those of our
   Lord on the Cross! Sometimes we, too, feel as if we could not pray--we
   can only sigh, and sob, and groan. Well, if it even came to roaring, we
   would have a fuller sympathy with Christ, for He could say, "Why are
   You so far from helping Me, and from the words of My roaring?"

   2, 3. O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You hear not; and in the
   night season, and am not silent. But You are holy, O You that inhabit
   the praises of Israel. Jesus will find no fault with God. Even if in
   His dire extremity, God forsakes Him, yet He will not utter even a
   whisper against Him--"You are holy, O You that inhabit the praises of
   Israel."

   4-6. Our fathers trusted in You: they trusted, and You did deliver
   them. They cried unto You, and were delivered: they trusted in You, and
   were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man. The allusion here is
   to a little red worm which, when it is crushed, seems to be all blood
   and nothing else--the Savior compares Himself to that little red worm,
   "and no man."

   6. A reproach of men, and despised of the people. They would not let
   Him be numbered with them. They accounted Him as an off cast and an
   outcast.

   7, 8. All they that see Me laugh Me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,
   they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD that He would
   deliver Him: let Him deliver Him, seeing He delighted in Him. Will you
   try to picture the Savior saying all these words as He hangs upon the
   Cross? That is the best commentary upon the Psalm. Hanging there,
   nailed to the cruel wood, in terrible bodily and mental anguish and
   deserted of God, He soliloquizes after this sad fashion. You will
   understand it all so well if you have Him in your mind's eye as we are
   reading.

   9-10. But You are He that took Me out of the womb: You did make Me hope
   when I was upon My mother's breasts. I was cast upon You from the womb:
   You are My God from My mother's belly. We could not help ourselves
   then. At the moment of our birth, everything depended upon God and so
   it does in the moment of our death. It is well to remember those years
   of helpless infancy when we could not feed ourselves. We were taken
   care of, then, when we hung in absolute impotence upon our mother's
   breast--then surely, if a second childhood should come, if all our
   powers should fail us, and we should be once more as weak as we were at
   our birth--He that helped us in the beginning will help us in the end!
   Thus the Savior comforted Himself as He went on praying--

   11. Be not far from Me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
   Oh, the bitterness of that cry, "None to help!" "They have all gone.
   The disciples have all fled. Judas has betrayed Me. Peter has denied
   Me. There is none to help. Be not far from Me." There stand the Roman
   soldiers, the High Priest and the Scribes and Pharisees--and Jesus
   says--

   12-14. Many bulls have compassed Me; strong bulls of Bashan have beset
   Me round. They gaped upon Me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
   roaring lion. I am poured out like water, and all My bones are out of
   joint. They were, no doubt,

   dislocated by the dreadful shaking and jarring that our Savior must
   have suffered when they dashed the Cross into the hole dug for it.

   14. My heart is like wax; it Has melted in the midst of Me. When the
   heart goes, everything goes. When the heart fails, and begins to melt,
   then it seems as if everything is loosening and the man is in the
   anguish of death.

   15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and My tongue cleaves to
   My jaws. Our Lord was parched with the fever brought on by the terrible
   anguish and strain upon the hands and feet, which are full of nerves
   and very tender. A slight wound of the thumb has brought on lockjaw,
   but what the wounds of the Savior's delicate and sensitive body must
   have been, we cannot possibly tell--"My tongue cleaves to My jaws."

   16. And You have brought Me into the dust of death. He felt as if His
   very frame was all turning to the dust of which the body is made. So
   complete is the breaking up of the whole manhood when a strong fever is
   upon one.

   16. For dogs have compassed Me. There was the ribald crowd--not, this
   time, the bulls of Bashan, the great ones, but the mob--the masses of
   the common people hooting at Him. "Dogs have compassed Me."

   16. The assembly of the wicked have enclosed Me: they forced My hands
   and My feet. Can anybody else be speaking here but Jesus of Nazareth,
   the Son of David, the King of the Jews? Now is this Hind of the morning
   hunted till the dogs and the hunters have made a circle round Him. "The
   assembly of the wicked have enclosed Me." Here is Christ's Crucifixion
   beyond all doubt--"They pierced My hands and My feet."

   17. I can count all My bones. He is so emaciated that, as He looks down
   upon His body, He says, "I can count all My bones."

   17. They look and stare upon Me. The delicate modesty of the Savior is
   shocked. They have stripped Him and hung Him up--and there they stand
   and gloat--their cruel eyes upon His matchless body. "They look and
   stare upon Me."

   18. They part My garment among them, and cast lots for My clothing. How
   accurate is this description, even to the least detail! How wondrously
   was this Poet-Prophet inspired when he thus drew the portrait of the
   Crucified Christ! "They part My garments among them, and cast lots for
   My clothing."

   19-21. But be not You far from Me, O LORD: O My strength, hasten You to
   help Me. Deliver My Soul from the sword: My darling life from the power
   of the dog. Save Me from the lion's mouth: for You have heard Me. So
   far, You see, the Psalm describes the sufferings of our Divine Redeemer
   and then it changes. The light of the sun has broken out from the
   midday darkness! God has smiled on Him, once more, and the Psalm
   changes its tone altogether as the Savior congratulates Himself upon
   the result of His passion. The Psalm ends with these memorable words,
   "It is finished." Our version puts it, "He has done this." It might
   just as well be rendered, "It is finished," for the sense is precisely
   the same. And when Jesus had said this, He bowed His head, and gave up
   the ghost.

"Goodness, as a Morning Cloud"

   (No. 2365)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 17, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   25, 1888.

   "And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the
   days of Jehoiada the priest." 2 Chronicles 24:2.

   "Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made
   obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them. And they left
   the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and
   idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this, their
   trespass."

   2 Chronicles 24:17,18.

   THERE is a book called The Museum of Natural History and the most
   amazing animal in that museum is man. It would be far more easy to
   understand any other creature than to understand a human being. He is
   worthy of very great study and the more he is studied, the more will he
   surprise you. There are certain characters that are great curiosities.
   Alas, there are, also, other characters that are great monstrosities!
   You can never tell, from what a man is, what he will be. The case
   before us is a very extraordinary one because here is a man with every
   possible advantage who, through a number of years, exhibited the
   brightest form of character. And, yet, in the end, he was not thought
   worthy to be laid in the sepulchers of his fathers with others of the
   kings of Judah. Neither was he worthy of any royal interment, for the
   latter part of his life blackened and defiled the whole of his career
   and he who began his reign like the dawning of the day, ended it like
   the middle of the night.

   I wonder whether there are any persons here who will turn out to be
   very sinful and wicked before life is over? I mean, those who have
   begun well, who are now the hope and joy of those who know them, but
   who will end badly, in dishonor to themselves and grief to their
   households? If there are such here, probably you can find them out by
   this one test. Those who say, "It is impossible that it should be so
   with us," are probably the persons. While those who are afraid lest it
   should be so and ask for Grace that it may not be so, are probably
   those who will be preserved and whose path will shine brighter and
   brighter unto the perfect day.

   Dear Friends, what need there is to go below the surface in the
   examination of moral and spiritual character! I shall have to prove
   this to you, tonight, for in appearance, Joash was all that we could
   wish. Yet, had he really been what he seemed to be, he would have
   continued so! If there had been that work of Grace within his soul
   which there appeared to be in his life, he would not have turned aside
   as he did, for where a work of Grace is real and true, it is known by
   its abiding influence throughout the whole of life. Where godly
   principles have been imparted and a Divine Life has been infused, these
   things are not taken from a man. "They went out from us, but they were
   not of us," said the Apostle John, "for if they had been of us, they
   would, no doubt, have continued with us: but they went out, that they
   might be made manifest that they were not all of us." So was it with
   Joash. He turned aside from God because he had never truly known the
   Lord at all! And his last end was worse than the first because his
   beginning was really not such as it had seemed to be.

   I trust that every person here desires to have genuine religion and not
   to have the sham. There is a prayer that I recommend to everyone as I
   desire to use it myself, "Lord, let me know the very worst of my case!
   Do not suffer me either to deceive myself, or to be deceived by others.
   If I am not Yours, let me know that I am not Yours. If my repentance is
   but a seeming repentance and my faith but the mere shadow of faith, and
   not the substance of it, Lord, by Your good Spirit convince me of my
   dangerous delusion and let me know where I am and what I am!" I am sure
   many of you desire to pray like that and, perhaps while I am speaking,
   that petition may be answered, especially in the case of some of our
   young friends.

   I was very happy, last Sunday night, in preaching as I believe so as to
   suit the case of one young man of whom I knew but very little. Yet it
   seems that I described him so accurately that he felt that I was
   speaking especially to him. At the same time there was another young
   man, sitting in quite another part of the Tabernacle, who came in on
   Thursday to tell me how pointedly and distinctly I had described him.
   On Saturday I received a letter from the center of England, from a
   father who sent me his son's letter saying that he was here and that I
   had looked at him, and distinctly and accurately described him. It is
   not always that we can hit three birds with one shot, but I have been
   praying that I may have still better success, tonight, and that many
   may feel, "The preacher is speaking of me. He is describing my
   character." God grant that it may be so!

   My first head will be taken from the first verse of our text--"Joash
   did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of
   Jehoiada the priest." This is my first division--It is a great blessing
   when young people yield to godly influences. The second division will
   be--But this is not all that is needed. And the third will be--This
   yielding spirit may prove a source of mischief. Instead of being a
   blessing, it will be a curse if it has not something more added to it.

   I. First, then, IT IS A GREAT BLESSING WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE YIELD TO GODLY
   INFLUENCES.

   Although Joash came of a bad family, yet he had a good aunt who was
   married to the High Priest, and the aunt and the uncle took care of
   young Joash. When he was but an infant, they stole him away so that
   Athaliah might not kill him with the rest of the royal seed. And thus
   Joash had this remarkable privilege that for six years he lived in the
   Temple-- "He was, with them, hidden in the house of God six years."
   That is a splendid beginning for any life, to be hidden in the house of
   God six years! I do not think we ever value enough those first six
   years of a child's life. Impressions then made have a remarkable
   influence over the rest of life. Joash was where God's praise was sung
   from day to day and where holy prayer was perpetually offered. He was
   seldom beyond the fragrance of the perfumed incense, or away from the
   sight of the white-robed priests. He heard nothing that could defile
   him, but everything that could instruct and purify him. He was hidden
   in the house of the Lord so as not even to go out of it--concealed with
   godly people for the first six years of his life.

   Perhaps, no, I am sure, some of you present had similar happiness. The
   first thing that you can remember is your mother taking you to a place
   of worship. You can never forget the time when Father, also, led you
   there, and did not seem to be happy unless his boy was trotting by his
   side when he went to hear the Gospel. Among our earliest recollections
   are the memories of holy hymns and the sayings of gracious people, in
   whom, as children, we took an interest when they came to our father's
   house. It is a grand thing that the first days of one's life should
   bear the impress of the Divine finger. It is well when the vessel
   begins to revolve upon the wheel and the clay is soft and plastic, that
   the first fingers that should touch and shape it should be the fingers
   of God's servants. God grant that they may be as the very finger of God
   upon our souls! Thus Joash began his career by being hidden in the
   house of the Lord six years.

   After he was seven years of age, he was started on his life's business
   in a very admirable way. He was to be the king, but there had to be
   great care taken to sweep away the usurper from the throne and to put
   the little king upon it. Je-hoiada managed the whole affair with great
   skill. He also drew up a Covenant for the king to sign, a Covenant with
   God that he would be obedient to Jehovah as the supreme King, and a
   Covenant with the people that he would rule according to equity and
   right, and not tyrannize over them. It was all done so well that no
   objection was ever taken to it and Joash reigned with great prosperity
   and happiness over a people who were blessed by his rule. Jehoiada, all
   the while, being his faithful prime minister and guide.

   It is a grand thing to be started in life aright. It is half the
   battle, you know, to begin well. Some young men and some young women,
   too, are launched in life wrongly. It seems almost a matter of course
   that they should be too strongly tempted and, in all probability, yield
   to the temptation. But many of you were not started so--you began with
   a father's blessing and with a mother's prayers. You recollect your
   first going out into life. Some of us remember the ride on the coach
   when, early in the morning, we had to leave our father's house for the
   first time. Perhaps it was a cold and bitter frosty morning when we
   started in those old days to go across the country. We remember it well
   and how God cared for us and blessed us--and we desire to praise Him
   that He has preserved us even unto this day! I am showing you the
   bright side of Joash's career, first. After the six years in the house
   of God, he had a grand start in life with everything to his advantage.
   Alas, alas, alas, that, with such a bright beginning, he should come to
   such a sad end!

   Notice, also, that being thus well started, "Joash did that which was
   right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest."
   While that good man lived, the king was under his influence. He
   consulted him in every matter of importance. He even seems to have been
   guided by him, to some extent, in the matter of his marriage. He was
   plastic under his uncle's hands and he did that which was right in the
   sight of the Lord. Mark you, not only that which was right in the sight
   of good people, but that which was right in the sight of the Lord! His
   life seems to have been at least outwardly obedient to the Law of
   Jehovah and he yielded himself up, apparently, at any rate, to be a
   loyal servant of the great King. And that he did, not for a short time,
   only, but all the days in which Jehoiada lived. Well, now, have we not
   known men and women whose lives have been under the benign influence of
   some kind elderly person--uncle or aunt, father or mother--and they
   have done what was right, year after year, as long as their godly
   relatives lived? They have been diligent in going up to God's house,
   apparently devout in Bible reading and prayer, willing to assist in
   holy work in the Sunday school and all sorts of service for the Lord
   and, leading outwardly most useful, admirable lives all the time that
   these higher influences were over them, even as "Joash did that which
   was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the
   priest"?

   Yes, and more than this, he was zealous for the externals of
   religion--"It came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair
   the house of the Lord." He actually chided Jehoiada, his uncle, because
   of the slowness of the Levites! "The king called for Jehoiada, the
   chief, and said to him, Why have you not required of the Levites to
   bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection?" Yes, and
   there are some whose hearts are not right towards God who,
   nevertheless, are very zealous about the externals of Divine worship.
   It is a much easier thing to build a temple for God than it is to be a
   temple for God. And it is a much more common thing for persons to show
   zeal in repairing temples than in reforming their own manners!

   So this young man, you see, went even beyond his uncle in intense zeal
   for the cause of God, just as there are many, now, who, trained up in
   the ways of the Lord, are indefatigable in rendering some external
   service to the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ. They would give to the
   building of a Church. They would work hard to promote the paying for it
   and so forth, but, alas, you may give and you may work and you may
   attend to all the externals of religion, and yet have no part nor lot
   in the matter! Mr. Bunyan says that when he was an ungodly man, he yet
   had such a reverence for the outwards of religion that he would gladly
   have kissed the ground that the clergyman walked on--and every nail in
   the door of the Church seemed holy to him! That is all very fine, but
   unless there is a great deal more than that in us, we shall fall far
   short of the requirements of God!

   All this while, Joash influenced other people for good. As king, he
   kept back the nation from the worship of idols. As king, he threw the
   cloak of his patronage over those who worshipped Jehovah--and things
   seemed to go well for years--"all the days of Jehoiada the priest." As
   long as Jehoiada lived, Joash seemed to be all that he should be.

   II. Now I am going to turn, for a few minutes, to the second point to
   show you that, good as all this is, IT IS NOT ALL THAT IS NEEDED.

   For, mark you, this is not yielding the heart to God. "My son, give Me
   your heart," says God. All that Joash had done was to give his heart to
   Jehoiada, not to Jehovah! It is very easy to be outwardly religious by
   giving your heart to your mother, or your father, or your aunt, or your
   uncle, or some good person who helps you to do what is right. You are
   doing all this out of love to them, which is, at best, but a very
   secondary motive. God says, "My son, give Me your heart." If your
   religion is taken up to please any creature, it is not the religion
   which pleases the Creator. Your homage is due, not to anyone here
   below, but to Him who sits in the heavens, whose Kingdom rules over
   all. Dear Christian friends, as you think yourselves to be because of
   the Christianity of your parents, I do beg you to remember that true
   religion must be a matter of your own heart and of your own soul. If
   you merely attend to it out of respect to the dearest and most precious
   person under Heaven, you do not reach the standard that the Lord has
   set up!

   Note next, that this yielding to godly influence may exist without any
   personal, vital godliness whatever. You may meet with God's people and
   yet not be one of God's people! You may give attention to God's servant
   and yet not be, yourself, God's servant. A young man may yield to his
   mother's advice and yet never be really repentant on account of sin. He
   may listen to his father's words and pay respect to the externals of
   his father's religion, but never have believed in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. You must, yourselves, repent, and yourselves believe in Christ,
   or else all the rest will aggravate your sin by increasing your
   responsibility--and it will not go even a hair's breadth towards your
   salvation! I would have every per-

   son here, whether young or old, examine himself to see whether his
   religion is vital to his own soul. Have you been born again? I enquire
   not now about your mother, or father, or friends! Have you been born
   again? Are you now condemned under sin, or are you justified by faith
   in Jesus Christ? There can be no proxies and no sponsors, here--every
   man must give account for himself to God--and each man, each woman,
   must come to the Savior, personally, and accept Him and be saved by
   Him, or else eternal ruin is certain!

   I believe, also, dear Friends, that a character like that of Joash, a
   yielding character, an externally pious character may even prevent men
   from being saved at all. I mean you may take it for granted that you
   are saved, but you must not take anything for granted between God and
   your soul! I charge you to make sure work, here--take your wealth for
   granted if you like; take the title deeds of your estate for granted if
   you please--but between God and your soul, let everything be settled,
   straight, clear, sure and have no mistakes about this matter! It is so
   easy to have been under religious influence from our youth up and then
   to go on, year after year, never having raised the question whether we
   are Christians or not, saying to ourselves, "Of course it is all
   right." You will be much nearer the Truth of God if you say, "Of course
   it is all wrong." You will be much more likely to come to an honest
   conclusion if you rather suspect yourself too much than believe in
   yourself too much! I am sure that, in speaking thus, I am giving you
   sound teaching.

   After all, to be under godly influences year after year, without any
   great trial or temptation, may leave the personal character altogether
   undeveloped. Some continually put children under restraint, never
   suffering them to have any sort of temptation. It is so with children,
   sometimes, in large institutions--they have not any money and they
   cannot steal any because there is nobody else who has any--they are
   kept out of the world altogether! They live only among their own
   company and there is very much of prayer and everything that is good
   and often, when they go out into the world, those who have trained them
   are altogether disappointed with them, yet they need not very much
   wonder! If a person on dry land thinks he can swim, it is not certain
   that he will swim when he gets into the sea. We must have some kind of
   test, or else we cannot be sure of the character! We cannot know
   whether a child is honest or not if it never has any chance to take
   that which is not its own. You cannot be sure about principle being in
   any young man if he has been kept under a glass case--and if his
   principles have never been tried.

   That was the condition of Joash--the real character of the man had
   never come out at all because Jehoiada, as it were, covered him. He was
   guided and influenced by the High Priest, but his own disposition only
   needed an opportunity of developing itself. I have heard of an officer
   in India who had brought up a young leopard. It was completely tamed.
   Apparently it was as tame as a cat and the officer had no fear of his
   leopard. It went up and down the stairs and entered into every room of
   his house. He never suspected, for a single moment, that it would be
   guilty of blood-shedding. Well, while he was asleep one afternoon, in
   his chair, the leopard licked his hand in all tenderness as a cat might
   have done. But after licking for a while, it licked too hard and a
   little blood began to flow. It no sooner tasted blood than the old
   leopard's spirit was up and his master was his master no more! So does
   it happen to many that, by being shut in and tamed, as it were, but not
   changed--subdued but not renewed, kept in check but not
   converted--there has come a time when the taste of blood has called out
   the old nature and away the man has gone! You would never have thought
   that he could act as he did, but he did so because he had not a new
   nature! It was human nature held in check for a while, not the Spirit
   of God creating a new life and infusing a new character into the soul!

   Do you see where I am coming to, dear Friends? I am speaking to those
   of you who have not passed from death unto life--to you who have never
   been renewed in the spirit of your mind. I pray you, do not imagine
   that natural religion is spiritual religion. Do not mistake the lessons
   learned at your mother's knee for the teachings of the Holy Spirit! Do
   not confuse a change with the change--and do not think that anything
   that can come to you by your first birth can serve your turn without a
   second birth! "Fou must be born again," or else, though you spent the
   first six years of your life in the house of God and though you were
   taught under the most hallowed influences, you only need an
   opportunity, a temptation, a peculiar stress laid upon you and you will
   go off where the old nature carries you--and you will find out for
   yourself and to the horror of others that all your early training had
   effected nothing because it stopped short of the Kingdom of God and His
   righteousness.

   III. Now, in the third place, I wish to show you that THIS YIELDING
   CHARACTER MAY EVEN PROVE A SOURCE OF MISCHIEF.

   We like young people to be obedient. We are very glad to have to do
   with those plastic characters that are readily shaped, but, at the same
   time, we ought never to be too sure about them. A person with grit in
   his character, if really affected by the Grace of God, may turn out a
   far better man than your too plastic, pliable character. Oh, dear, how
   many we know who are very good, but there is nothing in them at all! We
   have known some others who were dreadfully difficult to manage and to
   get at, but when, at last, a change has been worked by Divine Grace,
   that very obstinacy and willfulness of theirs, when sanctified, has
   given a strength to their character and, instead of being a drawback,
   it has been a

   help!

   This young Joash was exceedingly supple in the hand of Jehoiada, but
   alas, Jehoiada died. Other counselors came and flattered Joash. "Now
   after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah and made
   obeisance to the king." Do you not see those gentlemen coming, bowing
   and scraping a hundred times before they get up to him? They "made
   obeisance to the king." Jehoiada had not often made much obeisance to
   him. He had treated him with due respect as his king, but he had also
   spoken to him honestly and faithfully. Joash had somebody to look up to
   while Jehoiada lived, but now he found himself a great man with
   everybody looking up to him! And the princes of Judah, the fashionable
   part of the realm, the respectable people who never had been
   worshippers of Jehovah, but who had always preferred the more
   recondite, ritualistic and sensuous service of Baal, the philosophical
   god, came and bowed, and made obeisance to the king.

   I think I can hear what they said--"Royal Sir, we congratulate you upon
   being released from leading strings. Now you can think for yourself! It
   is a fine thing for a young man to be delivered from the power of his
   old uncle--he was, no doubt, a very excellent person. We were present
   at his funeral and we paid him all due respect, still, he was a regular
   old fossil, one who never had made any progress at all. He clung to the
   worship of Jehovah and served the God of his fathers. Royal Sir, we
   congratulate you upon the liberty to which you have attained. Besides
   that, we fear that you have been considerably priest ridden. This
   Jehoiada was a priest and, of course, you respected and venerated his
   character, but you could not indulge yourself as long as he lived. We
   have always had high thoughts of you, Royal Sir. We always believed
   that you would break out, one of these days, and now that the good man
   is laid asleep, we are sure that you will not let his dead hands rest
   upon you, but you will wake up and be abreast of the age, and keep up
   with the spirit of the times!"

   You know how they do it! It is always being done, this pouring of drops
   of poison into the ears--these soft, subtle flatteries. Even when a man
   has reached Joash's age, he is not beyond the power of flattery. I
   wonder how old a man would be when he would be too old to love
   flattery. Of course, he always likes to be told, "Ah, dear Sir, I know
   that you could not bear flattery," being, at that moment, more highly
   flattered than at any other time in his life! So these princes of Judah
   did and poor Joash, good Joash, Joash who repaired the Temple, Joash
   who was even more intensely earnest than Jehoiada, himself, was led
   astray by the soft words of the deceivers and we find him burying his
   religion with his uncle! In Jehoiada's grave he buried all his piety.
   Some whom I have known, and over whom I have wept, have acted in the
   same way.

   After that, he went off to sin. The images which he had broken down
   were set up, again. The groves which he had cut down were planted,
   again, and he who seemed so zealous a servant of Jehovah had now become
   a worshipper of the foul Ashtaroth and bowed before the accursed
   Baalim! Oh, sad, sad, sad mischief this! There was a lack of principle
   in Joash, and it is of that I want to warn all our friends. Do not, I
   pray you, be satisfied with the practice of piety without the
   principles of piety! It is not enough to have a correct creed--you must
   have a renewed heart! It is not sufficient to have an ornate
   ritual--you must have a holy life--and to be holy you must be renewed
   by the Holy Spirit! If this change is not worked in you by the Holy
   Spirit, you who yield so readily to good, will yield just as quickly to
   evil.

   What happened next? Joash refused reproof. God sent Prophets to the
   people and they came and warned them, testifying against the
   idolaters--"But they would not give ear." This Joash, who had spent his
   first six years in the Temple, now would not give ear to the Lord's
   Prophets! He was always ready to listen to Jehoiada, but now he would
   not give ear. He was a tremendous zealot for repairing the Temple with
   most costly architecture and gold and silver without limit--but now he
   will not give heed to God's servants at all! They may speak with all
   their heart and soul, but he is as the deaf adder that will not hear
   the voice of the charmer, charm he ever so wisely. Yet he was once your
   good young man, your pious young man! Oh, what a sifter London has been
   to many like Joash! Many do I remember whose story was like this. They
   had been to the house of God always--they were brought up where there
   was a family altar in the house! Everybody reckoned them to be
   Christians when they came to London.

   At first, they went where their father exhorted them to go, to some
   humble place where the Gospel was preached, but after a time they
   thought it was not wrong to go on Sunday to see one of the more showy
   religious places. That done, they went to some showy place that was not
   religious. They worked so hard all the week that they must go out a
   little into the fresh air on the Sunday and, by degrees, they found
   companions who led them, little by little, from the path of integrity
   and chastity till, "the good young man," was as vile as any on the
   streets of London! And he who seemed to be a saint became not only a
   sinner, but the maker of sinners!

   What did Joash do next? He slew his friend's son. Old Jehoiada's son,
   Zechariah, one of those who had helped to put the crown upon young
   Joash's head, was, at last, moved to come out and speak in the midst of
   the Temple service to the people, as he had a right to do. And he began
   to upbraid them for turning aside from Jehovah to the worship of the
   foul idol gods. Now, look--the tiger's blood is up! Joash bids them
   kill him! How dare he testify against his king? True, he is the son of
   his best friend--he is his own cousin, he is one who helped him to
   ascend the throne--but what matters all that to this once good young
   man? The milk of human kindness is now soured. The oil that was so soft
   burns fiercely when it once takes fire. "Let Zechariah die. Kill him in
   the Temple. Splatter the sacred altar with his blood! Stone him! He has
   dared to speak against me."

   See your soft clay--how hard and coarse, and rough it has become! I
   have seen this change come over men. I believe that the worst
   persecutors in the world are generally made of those who once were
   tender and soft-hearted. Nero would, at first, scarcely sign the death
   warrant of a criminal, and yet he lived to delight in wholesale murder!
   When the son of perdition was needed to betray his Lord, the raw
   material of the traitor was found in an Apostle! You cannot make an
   out-and-out bad man except from one who seems to be good. You must take
   the man who has been six years in the Temple, the man who has done that
   which is right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada, to
   make such a devil as Joash turned out to be when he killed the son of
   his benefactor in the court of the house of the Lord! Oh, I could look
   steadily in the face of some here, tonight, and in the spirit of
   prophecy I could burst out into tears to think of what they will yet
   be, what they will yet do and what they will yet say! Perhaps you look
   at me and ask, "Is your servant a dog that he should do this thing?"
   Oh, Sir, you are worse than a dog! There lurks within you a heart,
   "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?"
   Oh, that you did know it and would turn to God and say, "O Lord, renew
   me! Lord, make a new creature of me! Lord, save me, that I may never do
   such things as now, today, I think it impossible that I should ever
   do!"

   This Joash, perishing, miserable, having no faith in God, robbed the
   Temple and gave all the gold and treasures to Hazael the Syrian.
   Personally, he was full of disease and, by-and-by, his own servants,
   disgusted with him for his conduct towards Jehoiada's son, slew him on
   his bed. What a death for the young man who was six years hidden away
   in the house of the Lord! Oh, if I could tell some of you what will
   become of you, you would never come to this place, again, you would be
   so angry with me! If I could prophesy to some good young fellow here--I
   mean, outwardly good as Joash was at first, but without a new heart,
   without the Grace of God in his soul--if I could prophesy to him what
   he will be, he would spit in my face in indignation that I would dare
   to foretell such a thing! There is not a man or woman here who is safe
   from the most abominable sin until they yield themselves to Christ!
   There is not one of you who is sure that the deepest damnation of Hell
   will not be your portion unless you come and commit your soul into the
   hands of Jesus, who is a faithful Keeper of them that put their trust
   in Him!

   Can there be a Character Insurance Society? There can be no such
   Society formed by men that can insure our character, yet God has formed
   one! "The righteous, also, shall hold on his way; and he that has clean
   hands shall be stronger and stronger." The Lord will keep him and
   preserve him from evil, for, "the path of the just is as the shining
   light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day." I earnestly
   entreat you, by the living God, my hopeful young Friend--yield yourself
   to Jesus Christ and seek His guardian care lest the fair blossom of
   today should never bring forth fruit, but end in disappointment.

   The Lord grant that we may, all of us, meet in Heaven, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 Chronicles24:1-25.

   This chapter gives us the story of the reign of Joash. He was the only
   one of the royal seed who was preserved alive when Athaliah sought to
   destroy all the family of Ahaziah. He was hidden away for some six
   years in the Temple by his aunt Jehoshabeath, the wife of Jehoiada the
   High Priest, who arranged matters so well that when the child was seven
   years old, Jehoiada caused him to be crowned king and he put to death
   the cruel she-wolf Athaliah who had destroyed the royal family. You
   see, therefore, how much this young king owed to his uncle, the High
   Priest. Now let us read the story of his reign.

   Verse 1. Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned forty years in Jerusalem. He might have reigned much longer had
   he not erred and turned aside from the right way, and so brought
   judgment upon himself.

   1, 2. His mother's name was Bibiah of Beer-Sheba. And Joash did that
   which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the
   priest. As long as his uncle lived, that truly devout statesman, as
   well as priest of the Lord, "Joash did that which was right in the
   sight of the Lord."

   3. 4. And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
   daughters. And it came to pass after this. Probably, some 23 years
   after--

   4. That Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD. Jehoiada had,
   with him, broken in pieces the images of Baal, and battered down the
   temples of the idols. And now the young king is "minded to repair the
   house of Jehovah."

   5. And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to
   them, go out into the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money
   to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you
   hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. It is a great
   pity when those who live in the house of God have not enough interest
   in it to see to its repair. The fact was, the offerings presented at
   the Temple, like the tithes in modern times, were intended not only for
   the ministers, but for the maintaining of the fabric, too. But these
   priests and Levites would not allow anything to be deducted from their
   own income even for the repair of the house in which they served! So
   Joash ordained that special collections should be made for the purpose.

   6-9. And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why
   have you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out
   of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the
   servant of the Lord, and of the congregation of Israel, for the
   tabernacle of witnesses? For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman,
   had broken up the honor of God; and also all the dedicated things of
   the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Daalim. And at the king's
   commandment they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the
   house of the LORD. And they made a proclamation through Judah and
   Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses, the
   servant of God, laid upon Israel in the wilderness. Everyone must give
   his half shekel by way of redemption money--and this had not been
   brought in.

   10-14. And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,
   and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. Now it came to
   pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by
   the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money,
   the king's scribe and the High Priest's officer came and emptied the
   chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. This they did
   day by day, and gathered money in abundance. And the king and Jehoiada
   gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the
   LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD,
   and, also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
   So the workmen worked, and the work was perfected by them, and they set
   the house of God in his state, and strengthened it. And when they had
   finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and
   Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even
   vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of
   gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the
   LORD continually all the day of Jehoiada. See the influence of one man!
   One man can sway a state. One man can check sin. One man can be the
   head of a host who shall serve God and honor His name.

   15. But Jehoiada waxed old. It happened to him as it must happen to us
   all, for the best of men must grow old and pass away. Let us value them
   while we have them. Too often we give them stones while they are alive,
   in anticipation of giving them bigger stones to keep them in memory
   when they die. "Jehoiada waxed old"--

   15. And was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old
   was he when he died. An unusual age for that time. Short enough as
   compared with the years of the antediluvian Patriarchs, but still a
   great age for those days.

   16. And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because
   he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward His house. That
   is the best kind of good which begins with doing good toward God and
   then goes on to doing

   good towards God's house. The Church is to be served, but even it must
   be second to God's Glory. God, first, and then the very best must come
   next.

   17. Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made
   obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them. These flatterers
   came with all their daintiest manners and made obeisance to the
   king--and "the king listened to them." All the days of Jehoiada, these
   princes had been afraid to set up the fashionable worship--the worship
   of Baalim that had been introduced by the Sidonian queen, Jezebel--that
   wicked woman of strong and masterful spirit. This worldly and false
   religion had been put down by the strong hand of Jehoiada, but when its
   adherents thought they had a chance to get to the front, again, they
   came and flattered the king. And "the king listened to them."

   18. And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers and served
   groves and idols. Or, "Asherah and idols." The word is mistakenly
   translated, "groves." These were certain horrible and disgusting
   emblems of the heathen goddess Ashtaroth, or Astarte--"They served
   Asherah and idols."

   18, 19. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this, their
   trespass. Yet He sent Prophets to them, to bring them, again, unto the
   LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
   "These old Puritans have come back again," they said. "We will not
   listen to them." The common people were still mostly worshippers of
   Jehovah, but the great ones of the earth had gone over to the idols.
   And they could not endure that one and another of the Prophets, often
   very humble and unlearned men, should come and bear testimony for
   Jehovah.

   20. And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the
   priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus says
   God, "Why transgress you the Commandments of the Lord, that you cannot
   prosper? Because you have forsaken the Lord, He has also forsaken you.
   He spoke very temperately and affectionately. The warning was faithful,
   but it was delivered in the very best and kindest spirit. But now see
   what the wicked men did.

   21. And they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the
   command of the king in the court of the house of the Lord. This is
   probably the Prophet to whom Christ alludes when He speaks of
   Zachariah, "whom you slew between the Temple and the altar." It was a
   crime most foul to murder the son of Jehoiada, one of those who had
   helped to put the crown upon the head of the king! To do this evil deed
   in the court of God's house, when the Prophet was engaged in his
   Master's business and delivering a Divine message, was to heap sin upon
   sin!

   22. 23. Then Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada,
   his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he
   said, The LORD look upon it, and require it. And it came to pass at the
   end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they
   came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the
   people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the
   king of Damascus. God delayed not long the punishment of the evildoers!
   When His servants are persecuted, He will speedily avenge His own
   elect. "They destroyed all the princes of the people from among the
   people." Was not that remarkable? These were the authors of the sin and
   they had chiefly to endure the penalty. It is not always that invaders
   lay hold upon the princes, alone, and slay them--but these Syrians did
   so.

   24, 25. For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
   and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hands because they
   had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment
   against Joash. And when they were departed from him, (for they left him
   in great diseases), his own servants conspired against him for the
   blood of the sons of Jehoiada, the priest, and slew him on his bed and
   he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him
   not in the sepulchers of the kings. When one set of executioners had
   gone, his own servants conspired against him and slew him! Here ends
   our reading. May it be profitable to us!

"The Sure Mercies of David"

   (No. 2366)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JUNE 24, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   6, 1888.

   "And as concerning that He raised Him up from the dead, no w no more to
   return to corruption, He said on this wise, I will give you the sure
   mercies of David." Acts 13:34.

   WE know from this quotation made by the Apostle Paul in his address at
   Antioch, that he was alluding not only to David, but to the Lord Jesus,
   also. "For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
   God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
   but He, whom God raised again, saw no corruption." There was a Covenant
   made with David which was intended to be typical of another
   Covenant--and David, himself, is the special type of that great King
   with whom God has made a Covenant on behalf of His people. We will
   leave David somewhat in the background in our meditations tonight. We
   will only use him as the symbol of the great Christ in whom we rejoice,
   for God gives to us "the sure mercies of David" in Jesus Christ, His
   well-beloved Son.

   The course of our thought upon this passage, if we are helped to follow
   it, will be this. First, let us consider, Where our salvation lies--it
   lies in this, that the mercies we receive are "the sure mercies of
   David." When we have turned that thought over, we will try to answer
   this question, What are the sure mercies of David? Our next enquiry
   will be, In what day are they so sure? And then, lastly, we will
   enquire, What is the connection between the sure mercies of David and
   the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ? This text is evidently
   quoted to prove that the Resurrection of Christ was spoken of in the
   Old Testament--"As concerning that He raised Him up from the dead, now
   no more to return to corruption, He said on this wise, I will give you
   the sure mercies of David."

   I. First, dear Friends, let us consider, WHERE OUR SALVATION LIES.

   It does not lie in ourselves. You may sift yourself over and over, as
   with a sieve, and you will not discover one atom of saving matter in
   yourself! You may throw on the dunghill all that you find there. There
   is not a grain of Grace in a hundred tons of human nature. You may go
   on sifting, sifting, sifting, to all eternity and you shall find only
   that which is worthy of the damning sentence. Ask any man who is saved
   and if he speaks intelligently, he will tell you that the Lord Jesus
   Christ is his salvation. If he begins to explain the grounds, reasons
   and foundation of his salvation, he will look away from himself and
   will point to Jesus Christ, alone!

   The text speaks about David and David is a good type of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, in whom our salvation lies. Jesus was One who was despised and
   rejected, just as David was in his own family. When Samuel came to
   anoint as king one of the sons of Jesse, David was away watching the
   sheep--he was not thought worthy of being called in till Samuel
   specially sent for him. His brothers evidently despised him and
   condemned him as being forward when really he was more courageous than
   they were. So, too, our Lord was despised and rejected of men--they did
   not think that the Nazarene could be the Messiah. It was enough,
   merely, to mention His name and to speak of Him as Jesus of Nazareth,
   for them at once to ridicule His claims. They judged that it was not
   possible that He, who was so poor, so meek, so lowly--that He who had
   so little of anything which they looked for in the promised Deliverer,
   should be the Savior--yet He was and still is the only Savior.

   You know the story or tradition that when they were building Solomon's
   Temple, all the stones were marked to indicate the places where they
   should go, for no hammer or chisel was to be used upon them in the
   sacred courts. There was one stone of a very awkward shape and the
   builders could not find a place for it. They turned it over and tried
   to fit it in here and there, but it would not go in anywhere, so they
   threw it aside and the nettles and the thistles grew over it. It

   became a proverb and a by-word. One would say to another, "Will you not
   try to build in that stone?" but they all in turn gave it up--it was
   the stone which the builders refused. At last, the Temple was all but
   finished--it only lacked one cornerstone and they looked about for it,
   but they could not find it. Someone at last suggested, "Perhaps that
   queerly-shaped stone is the very one intended to complete the Temple."
   So they brought it out and found that it was even so. Our blessed Lord
   and Master applied to Himself the words of the Psalmist, "The stone
   which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner:
   this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes." Like David,
   Jesus was the Rejected One, but He is the Anointed of the Lord, blessed
   be His holy name!

   Our salvation lies in Another, even in One who has fought our greatest
   enemy, and overthrown him. This was the mark of David that, in due
   time, he came to the front when all Israel fled from the gigantic
   Philistine. The two champions meet for the deadly duel, the stone flies
   from the shepherd's sling, the giant falls! His head is cut off with
   his own sword and David brings the gory trophy to King Saul. Our
   salvation lies in One who has destroyed death, and him that had the
   power of death, that is, the devil. I see Him coming back with the
   tokens of His triumph in His hand! Like David, He has slain His ten
   thousands in slaying the one great enemy of His people! In this Jesus,
   who died on Calvary and in dying, destroyed death and burst the bonds
   of the grave, lies our salvation!

   Yet it lies in One who, despite His glorious triumphs, was sorely
   persecuted. David did not go straightway from his victory over the
   Philistine to sit upon his throne--he was hunted by Saul like a
   partridge on the mountains and long had to carry his life in his hands.
   He had to pass through sore persecution before he became king. And,
   Beloved, in a certain sense, that is the condition of our Lord Jesus
   Christ even now! He is still rejected. I know that His name is used and
   men like to call themselves His followers, but if you set forth a real
   Christ, crucified among them, and preach His great substi-tutionary
   sacrifice, you shall see that He is no more a favorite among men than
   He used to be! Still will they spit in His face! Still will they
   scourge Him! Still will they crucify Him. There has been a long, long
   battle, through these nearly two thousand years, while men have cried,
   concerning the Lord and His Anointed, "Let us break their bands
   asunder, and cast away their cords from us."

   But the King will yet come to His Throne. God says, concerning Him,
   "Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Zion." "I will set His
   hand, also, in the sea, and His right hand in the rivers. Also I will
   make Him My First-Born, higher than the kings of the earth." But, for a
   while, the Prince of this world prevails, the Saul, the enemy that
   walks in darkness, is allowed to "worry whom he can't devour." And
   though it shall not always be so, yet at present it is a time of
   conflict and trial. Our salvation still rests in a despised Gospel, in
   a hunted Christ--but as Israel looked to David in Engedi, by the tracks
   of the wild goats, and not to Saul upon the throne--so we look to our
   Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Though He is still cast out and
   persecuted, He is the one hope of our spirits!

   Bear with me while I also say that our salvation lies in One who was
   thrice anointed, even as David was, first, at his father's house, then
   at Hebron, where he was anointed king of Judah, and afterwards when he
   came fully to his throne and was acknowledged as king of all Israel.
   Our Jesus was trebly anointed as our Prophet, Priest and King. God has
   anointed Him with the oil of gladness and we, today, rejoice in Him as
   fully fitted, prepared and equipped for completing the great work of
   our salvation.

   Once more, Beloved, as David ultimately came to his throne and when, on
   his throne was seen as the king with whom God had entered into a solemn
   Covenant that the throne should be his forever, even so our salvation
   lies in One with whom God has made a Covenant, "ordered in all things
   and sure," a Covenant which shall stand fast when earth's old pillars
   bow and when all things that are created shall melt into their natural
   nothingness! You know that we fell in one federal head, even the first
   Adam. Behold the glory of the fact that we rise in another
   Representative, even the Second Adam, the Lord from Heaven! We see our
   ruin, yonder, in the Garden of Eden. We see our salvation, yonder, in
   another garden, Gethsemane, and on the Cross of Calvary. Still we look
   beyond all our willing, doing, praying and everything that comes of
   ourselves, to the Son of God and Son of Man, given by God to accomplish
   that redemption by which sinners are saved! The Lord says, concerning
   Jesus, "I have laid help upon One that is mighty; I have exalted One
   chosen out of the people." This Almighty Savior is the only hope of
   guilty men!

   May I ask my dear Hearers at once--lest I should suddenly have to stop
   short in my sermon--do you know and trust this Savior? Have you come to
   lean on Christ, alone? Do you love the Lord Jesus Christ? Can you say,
   "He is all my salvation and all my desire"? Can you take Him up in your
   arms, as old Simeon did, and bless God that your eyes have seen

   His salvation? All that can save you lies there, in the Person and work
   of this glorious David, of whom I desire to speak to you, tonight. May
   God the Holy Spirit introduce you to Him if you know Him not, and may
   you accept Him at once, as God would have you accept Him--as your
   Savior and your All! I have thus spoken upon the first point, where our
   salvation lies.

   II. Now, secondly, WHAT ARE THE SURE MERCIES OF DAVID? What is meant by
   that expression?

   I have already told you, but I may tell you yet again. God dealt with
   Israel by way of mercy and, to make that mercy sure, He took a man whom
   He had chosen--a man whom He loved, a man whom He intended to use--and
   He made with him a Covenant that He would set him upon the throne, that
   by his personal influence he might bring down blessings upon all the
   people. These are "the sure mercies of David."

   In the matter of our salvation, "the sure mercies of David" mean that
   God has laid hold upon His Son, Jesus Christ. You cannot help yourself,
   but Christ can help you. You cannot cleanse yourself, but Christ can
   cleanse you. You cannot save yourself, but Christ can save you. Dear
   Heart, whatever it is you lack, there is no lack in Christ! Whatever is
   your need, Christ has exactly that which can meet your case. Young man,
   you say, "I have nothing." And I answer you with this--Christ has
   everything! You say, old man, "What can I do? "And I answer you with
   this--What cannot Christ do? If you are nothing, Christ is everything!
   If you are everything that is evil, Christ is everything that is good.
   If you have weakness, mourn it, but trust Christ and He shall be your
   strength! If you have sorrow, you can not shake it off, but go to Jesus
   and He shall be your song! All that you need is in Christ. This, then,
   is the first sure mercy of David--that help is laid on Christ.

   And, next, as David was anointed to be the Leader and Commander to his
   people, even so, Christ is anointed on our behalf. He comes not to as a
   self-sent Savior, but as one anointed of God! It was a great comfort to
   me, when I put myself in Christ's hands, that I had not to pick out a
   Savior for myself, but God had appointed Him. I did not put myself into
   the hands of One who was not authorized to act, for Jesus comes to us
   fully commissioned by God. A person who has no diploma may very
   possibly be a wise surgeon, but there are few sufferers who would trust
   themselves, in difficult operations, with a man who was not properly
   authorized to act in such a case. My Lord has a full diploma given Him
   by the infinite wisdom of God! He knows how to save. He has been long
   in practice and there are multitudes in Heaven whom He has saved. He is
   the great specialist in soul saving and He can meet your special case!
   He has dealt with diseases that no one else can understand--if you are
   an odd man, or the oddest of the odd, yet this Christ, all
   comprehensive in His wondrous wisdom, knows all about your condition!

   This is another of the sure mercies of David. First, help is laid on
   Christ and, next, He is anointed to act on our behalf.

   We are told, in the 89th Psalm, that God promised David that He would
   overthrow all his enemies--"I will beat down his foes before his face."
   Here, then, is another sure mercy for us, Christ will rout all our
   enemies. Who are they? How many are there of them? Which way do they
   come to assault us? Christ can meet them all! Your sins, your many
   fierce and cruel sins, are your enemies. But Christ has made full
   Atonement for them all. Believe, and these Egyptians shall sink like
   lead in the Red Sea of your Savior's blood! Your present lusts, your
   evil passions, the instincts of your nature which you cannot curb are
   foes too strong for you to overcome, but Christ is able to destroy them
   and to put all your temptations to the rout! It may be that Satan,
   himself, assails you and I pity you if that is the case. Any man who
   has had a real encounter with the devil will never forget it! All the
   tempters in Hell, together, cannot make up so dreadful an adversary as
   Apollyon, himself--but even Satan knows who is his Master! Christ can
   bid him lie down and be still as a man silences a dog! Only look to
   Christ, for this is part of the Covenant, ordered in all things and
   sure, that He shall rout your adversaries! Hand your enemies over to
   Him and He will rid you of them. Cry, "Son of David, have mercy upon
   me," and you shall have a gracious answer and quick deliverance!

   God also made this to be a part of His Covenant with His servant,
   David, that he was to be a storehouse of good things to the nation over
   which he reigned, and Jesus is the storehouse of mercy to all His
   people. I am so glad that I have to speak to those who need large
   supplies of Grace, for there is, in Christ, all that any sinner can
   ever need! As truly can it be said, now, as it might have been said
   nearly nineteen hundred years ago--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its power,

   Till all the ransomed Church of God Is saved to sin no more."

   He that opened eyes long ago can open your eyes! He that healed lepers
   in Judea can heal you! He that raised the dead can raise you! He is as
   much a Savior, now, as He was at the first--if there is any difference,
   He has an increase of power, for now has God committed into the hands
   of Jesus all power in Heaven and in earth. Only come and trust Him--for
   all your salvation lies in Him--and in Him will be found for you in
   abundance all "the sure mercies of David."

   There is this point, also, about the Covenant made with David, that he
   was always to have a seed--and Jesus will always have a seed. I never
   come to preach at haphazard, saying to myself, "Perhaps my Lord will
   have some souls bow before Him." I know that I have a large
   congregation and I feel sure that, when God's Truth is proclaimed, some
   will yield to Christ. When He speaks, some of His sheep will hear His
   voice and follow Him--and He will give unto them eternal life! When the
   good Seed of the Kingdom is sown, there are some furrows in which it
   will surely take root and bring forth a harvest to His praise.

   Well, then, since Christ must have a seed, why should not I be among
   them? Since, as a Savior, He must save some, why should He not save me?
   If He is a Physician and must heal some, why should He not heal me? If
   He spreads a banquet of mercy and the wedding must be furnished with
   guests, why should not I have a seat among them? How I pray that I may
   be putting a hopeful thought into some troubled heart tonight! I would
   get alongside some trembler and whisper this into his ear, "Jesus must
   save sinners--will you not be one of those whom He must save?" It is
   written, "Him that comes to Me , I will in no wise cast out." If you
   trust Him and He does not save you, let us know of it, for we shall
   have to alter our preaching! Christ will have run back from His Word.
   He will be another Savior and not the one in whom we trusted. Come,
   then, and learn what "the sure mercies of David" are. They are the sure
   mercies of Jesus, that in Him there is salvation! He is anointed on
   purpose to give salvation! He is able to rout your
   adversaries--yes--"He is able, also, to save them to the uttermost that
   come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make intercession for
   them."

   III. That leads me to say a few words, as best I may, upon the third
   point--IN WHAT WAY MAY THESE MERCIES BE SAID TO BE SURE?

   Well, they may be said to be sure because they are found in Jesus. He
   is the same, yesterday, today and forever. Then, whatever is in Him, is
   most surely sure! What a storehouse for God to lay up His mercy--the
   Person of the Lord Jesus Christ! Remember how the Israelites built
   treasure cities for Pharaoh? Well, Beloved, the Lord God has made His
   treasure city to be His own dear Son! "It pleased the Father that in
   Him should all fullness dwell." "Go unto Joseph," said Pharaoh. "Go
   unto Jesus," says Jehovah, for all the blessings of the Covenant are
   treasured up in Him and are, therefore, safe and sure! If salvation had
   been in your own keeping, you would have lost it long ago. If your hope
   had lain in yourself, it would soon have been withered! But since it
   lies in Jesus and in Jesus, only, it is always living and blessed! You
   and I, poor, helpless, hopeless souls, can flee to this City of Refuge
   whose gates are never closed, and find ourselves secure from the
   adversary. They are "the sure mercies of David" because the mercies are
   all in Christ Jesus our Lord!

   The expression is also a good one because the mercies that come to us
   by Christ are real mercies. It seems a very commonplace question to
   ask, but it is necessary to ask it--did you ever feel yourself to be a
   real sinner? It is wonderfully easy to go on crying, "Lord, have mercy
   upon us, miserable sinners," and yet to know nothing at all about
   genuine conviction of sin. You know that beggars make sham wounds. I do
   not know the process, but I have been told that they have certain acids
   which they can put on their flesh to make you believe they have
   terrible wounds. But real wounds are very different from sham ones--and
   when a man is a real sinner and knows it, and his sin cuts into his
   heart--then he needs real pardoning, real cleansing and a real Savior!
   So I tell you of "the sure mercies of David"--real forgiveness for real
   guilt, real pardon for real rebellion--nothing sham or superficial.
   Yes, you truly guilty ones, you who might be ashamed to be sitting in
   the House of God, tonight, you who might well cover your faces at being
   found where godly people come together--you are the sort of people for
   whom Jesus died! You who need to be disinfected and set apart--you are
   the sort that our great Lord came into the world to seek and to save!
   Blessed be His name, He brings us "the sure mercies of

   David!"

   I think the expression is used, again, because the blessings needed are
   surely provided. I have said that you need pardon and cleansing--

   "There is a Fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Emmanuel's veins.

   And sinners, plunged beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains."

   There is cleansing in that Fountain for you. The blessings which your
   souls need will not have to be created--they are ready, they are
   waiting. The medicine for your sickness is already compounded! The
   clothing for your nakedness is already made! All that you need between
   here and Heaven is stored up in the provision of God's mercy that is
   made in Christ Jesus! You will never surprise the Lord by the greatness
   of your necessities, nor have to hear Him say, "I cannot meet your
   special case." No, there is a sure provision already made for every
   soul that will come to God by Jesus Christ!

   The blessings of the Covenant of Grace are sure mercies because they
   are surely bestowed. You shall not merely hear of them, but you shall
   receive them. If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, your sins, which
   are many, shall be all forgiven. If you will look only to Christ, you
   shall be saved with an everlasting salvation! Do you hear this, you
   despairing one? In the name of God I say it to you, if I never have an
   opportunity of uttering it in your hearing again! Will you come and
   cast your soul on the great David, Jesus Christ, the Well-Beloved of
   the Father? If you do, you shall have power to become a child of God
   and then all the heritage which belongs to the heirs of Heaven shall
   fall to your lot! It will surely be so! You will have those "sure
   mercies of David."

   And once you have them, you shall never lose them because they shall
   surely be continued. If God shall bestow on you eternal life, it shall
   be eternal life! If God shall once forgive you, He will not afterwards
   condemn you! If the Judge of all shall justify you, who shall lay
   anything to your charge? If the Good Shepherd shall bring you into His
   fold, who shall pluck you from His hand? He says of His sheep, "I give
   unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   pluck them out of My hand." I have not to preach to you a Gospel of,
   "ifs," and "buts," and "perhapses," but a Gospel of, "shalls" and
   "wills!" "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." Jesus said,
   "He that believes on Me has everlasting life." God does not speak to
   sinful men in the way of mere hopefulness, but He speaks with an
   absolute certainty of Grace! If you believe, you shall be as surely
   saved as God is God! Though you are the most guilty soul out of Hell,
   if you will flee to Christ Jesus, you shall as surely be in Heaven as
   God is in Heaven! Only trust in Jesus. "Trust in the Lord forever: for
   in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength." Riches of mercy, floods
   of Grace, ceaseless outflowing of love shall be yours if you will but
   put yourself under Christ's leadership--if you will take Him as your
   Leader and Commander and as the one Mediator between God and men!

   IV. Now, lastly, IN WHAT WAY ARE "THE SURE MERCIES OF DAVID" CONNECTED
   WITH THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST?

   God promised to David that his seed should always sit upon his throne,
   but if Jesus dies, then is that Covenant broken? That Jesus' reign may
   endure forever, He must live. Though He bows His head in death, yet
   must He live. He must rise again, otherwise the King is gone, the
   throne is vacant, the Covenant has failed. Jesus must rise from the
   dead, else how can He save His people? Can a dead Christ save us? The
   Church of Rome continually sets before us Christ either as a Baby in
   His mother's arms, or else as a Man dead on the Cross. Neither of these
   is a true portrait of Christ! He is no more a Babe, and He is no more
   dead! He sits on the Throne of God, reigning and ruling, and He will
   come, the second time, without sin, unto salvation! The living Christ
   is our hope! It is witnessed of Him that He lives at the right hand of
   God and, as I quoted to you just now, it is for this reason that "He is
   able, also, to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him,
   seeing He ever lives to make intercession for them."

   Finally, the resurrection of Christ guarantees to all His people, "the
   sure mercies of David." Our Lord Jesus Christ has passed through great
   changes, yet He has always remained the same. He was once God in the
   full Glory of illimitable splendor, then a Baby upon a woman's lap,
   then a carpenter's Son working and toiling in a quiet village, then a
   Teacher and Preacher and miracle-worker, then a Sufferer with His
   visage more marred than any of the sons of men, then bound, accused,
   scourged, condemned, crucified, dead and buried! A wonderful change
   this, is it not--from pure Godhead to the grave? Then He rose again
   and, rising, He revealed Himself in His Glory to His disciples, meeting
   with them by the sea, and in different places until, at last, He
   ascended and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And now He sits,
   in supernal majesty, at the right hand of the Father, waiting till He
   shall come to judge the earth with righteousness and the people with
   His Truth.

   I do not know how to finish up my sermon better than by telling you the
   old story of Robbie Flockhart, which I have told in this house, before,
   but not to this present congregation. The story shows the blessedness
   of Christ's death and

   Resurrection. Robbie Flockhart used to, constantly, preach in the
   streets of Edinburgh, and he told this story. He said, "I had a friend
   in the army and he committed some offense in war-time for which he was
   condemned to be shot. So he said, 'Robbie, I have to die tomorrow, and
   as I have a little money, I have made my will and left it to you.'
   'Thank you,' I said. The next morning, instead of being taken out to be
   shot, the soldier received a free pardon, so," said Robbie, "He got his
   life and I lost my legacy, for a testament is not in force while the
   testator lives. He must die to give effect to his will. And," said
   Robbie, "our great Testator is dead. We know that He died, they nailed
   Him to the Cross. Therefore His will stands good--let us go and take
   the legacy He has bequeathed to us. But," added Robbie, "that story is
   not enough to set forth Christ's work for us. Some time after, another
   friend left me a legacy and he did die."

   There were some lawyers who got hold of the money and Robbie never
   received a penny of the legacy. He said, "if my friend had been alive,
   I would have got it--that is to say, if he would have died and then,
   afterwards, have been alive, again, he would have seen that I received
   the legacy. So, the first time I lost my legacy because the friend who
   left it to me did not die and, the second time, I lost it because the
   friend who left it to me did die, but did not rise again. But," he
   said, "see the glorious safety of the Believer's legacy from His Lord!
   He who died and so made the will to be effective, has risen, again, and
   He will see that no lawyer, honest or dishonest, shall ever interfere
   with the legacies that He left to His people! Not even the devil,
   himself, shall prevent the heirs of everlasting life from obtaining the
   heritage which Christ has left them in the New Covenant which He has
   sealed with His blood!"

   Beloved, the mercies of David are sure because your David lives! He
   died to purchase these mercies for you--He lives to claim them on your
   behalf! He died to cleanse you--He lives to apply that cleansing to you
   and to see that the work is fully done! Come to God in the name of Him
   that is living and was dead! I entreat you to come to Him! How happy
   would I be if all in this congregation came to Christ! You who have
   come and I suppose that is the majority here, tonight, come again,
   looking unto Jesus! And you who have never come before, oh, that this
   Thursday night might be made memorable by your coming to Him who always
   lives to save the sons of men! Dreams of happiness and thoughts ofjoy
   hit across my mind as I stand here and think that perhaps--no, great
   Lord, I drop the, "perhaps," for it will be so--you will yield
   yourselves to Jesus, tonight! He will give you "the sure mercies of
   David," He will enter into Covenant with you and then each one of you
   will say--

   "Now will I tell to sinners round,

   What a dear Savior I have found!

   I'll point to Your redeeming blood

   And say, 'Behold the way to God.'" As I remember the day when I first
   saw Christ on the Cross and, trusting in Him, soon began to tell the
   story to others and, by His Grace, many thousands have come to Jesus by
   the simple telling of the old, old story, so I feel, tonight, as if
   some young man here will come and trust in Jesus and will go and say to
   others, "Look and live." It may be that some mother, here, finding
   Christ, herself, will be a blessing to her children. And that some
   father, believing unto life eternal, will bring his sons and daughters
   to the Savior's feet. And if so, I will be forever happy and the Lord's
   name shall be praised and magnified forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Acts 13:13-49.

   Verses 13, 14. Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they
   came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to
   Jerusalem. But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
   Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down. They
   would be noticed as strangers who had come there. The synagogue did not
   generally contain a very large assembly, and the Jews of the place
   would be well known to one another, and they would notice that two or
   three men had come in whom they had not been accustomed to see in their
   company.

   15-17. And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets the rulers of
   the synagogue sent unto them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have
   any word of exhortation for the people, say on. Then Paul stood up and
   beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God,
   give audience. The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and
   exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt,
   and with an high arm brought He them out of it. They always liked to
   hear the story of their race, it was sure to win their attention.
   Notice how expressly Paul puts it, that though they

   were a favored people, it was by the election of Divine Grace that they
   were such--"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers." The
   Lord chooses whom He will and He chose the fathers of the house of
   Israel--"and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the
   land of Egypt." God took care of them when they were aliens and
   foreigners under a cruel power in the land of Egypt--"and with an high
   arm brought He them out of it." This was the glory of Israel! The Jews
   always delighted to hear of Egypt, of the Exodus and of the great
   things that God did for them in the day of their redemption when, by
   the sprinkling of the blood of the paschal lamb, they were protected
   from the sword of the destroying angel.

   18. And about the time of forty years suffered He their manners in the
   wilderness. It is a continuous history that Paul gives to these people
   at Antioch and it brings to their minds the sins of their fathers as
   well as the Grace of their God. These are two things that you and I
   always need to keep in mind--God's Grace and our own sin. Truly, I fear
   that God has had much provocation from us during our 40 years, even as
   He had with His ancient people. There is much meaning packed away in
   that sentence, "Forty years suffered He their manners in the
   wilderness."

   19. And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He
   divided their land to them by lot. The Lord did not run back from His
   Covenant. He promised them a land flowing with milk and honey and He
   gave it to them, even though seven nations had to be destroyed to make
   room for them. This verse reminds us of that passage in Isaiah--"since
   you were precious in My sight, you have been honorable, and I have
   loved you: therefore will I give men for you, and people for your
   life." He gave seven nations of Canaan for this one nation of Israel!

   20. 21. And after that He gave unto them judges about the space of four
   hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the Prophet. And afterward they
   desired a king. This was another piece of wantonness on the Israelites'
   part. God was their King, yet they must have a visible king like the
   other nations by which they were surrounded. They were faithfully
   warned by the Prophet Samuel of the evil consequences that would follow
   their choice, but they would not be content with their God as their
   only Ruler--"afterward they desired a king."

   21-23. And God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe
   of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. And when He had removed him,
   He raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also He gave
   testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse a man after My
   own heart, which shall fulfill all My will. Of this man's seed has God
   according to His promise raised unto Israel a Savior, Jesus. No matter
   where the Apostle begins, he comes to Jesus Christ before long! No
   matter what the preacher's text may be, he must never close a sermon
   without having set forth the claims of Jesus! This should be the
   invariable rule of our ministry--that Christ is the top and bottom, the
   sum and substance of all our preaching. Paul could truly say, "We
   preach Christ crucified."

   24-26. Whom John had first preached before His coming, the baptism of
   repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John fulfilled his
   course, he said, Whom think you that I am? I am not He. But, behold,
   there comes One after me, whose shoes of His feet I am not worthy to
   loose. Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever
   among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. This is
   plain preaching, pointed preaching, bold preaching! Paul did not
   conceal the Truth of God, though he well knew how objectionable it
   would be to his hearers, yet he put it before them in the plainest
   possible terms--"To you is the word of this salvation sent."

   27. For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
   knew Him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets which are read every
   Sabbath, they have fulfilled them in condemning Him. It was strange
   that they should fulfill the prophecies which they had often read, no
   doubt, with fear and trembling! They became the guilty agents by which
   the prophecies were fulfilled. Paul's preaching agrees with what Peter
   said on the Day of Pentecost--"Him, being delivered by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands
   have crucified and slain."

   28-30. And though they found no cause of death in Him, yet desired they
   Pilate that He should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that
   was written of Him, they took Him down from the tree, and laid Him in a
   sepulcher. But God raised Him from the dead. Now the Apostle has
   reached the very heart of his judgment! Now he has come to the great
   cornerstone of the Christian faith! Notice that there are no
   embellishments here--there is not even an anecdote, or a story by which
   he may illustrate the Truth he sets forth--but just a plain declaration
   of the great facts of the life and death and Resurrection of Jesus
   Christ. These are the backbone of the Gospel and the more we dwell upon
   these facts, the better. Let us preach the doctrines that grow out of
   these facts, for the facts are stubborn things and if they are backed
   by the Spirit of God, they will carry all before them.

   31-33. And He was seen many days of them which came up with Him from
   Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses unto the people. And we
   declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto
   the fathers, God has fulfilled the same unto us, their children, in
   that He has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second
   Psalm, You are My Son, this day have I begotten You. Writing to the
   Hebrews, Paul quotes this passage from the Psalms to prove Christ's
   Godhead and everlasting filiation, so that he evidently saw more than
   one meaning in this portion of Divine teaching, and we do not err when
   we believe that no Scripture is exhausted by a single explanation. The
   flowers of God's garden, bloom not only double, but sevenfold--they are
   continually pouring forth fresh fragrance.

   34, 35. And as concerning that He raised Him up from the dead, now no
   more to return to corruption, He said on this wise, I will give You the
   sure mercies of David. Therefore He says also in another Psalm, You
   shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption. Christ did die but
   His precious body was not allowed to see corruption.

   36-41. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
   God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
   but He whom God raised, again, saw no corruption. Be it known unto you,
   therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you
   the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that believe are justified from
   all things, from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses.
   Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the
   Prophets, Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a
   work in your day, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a
   man declare it unto you. This is a noble sermon, but again I remark,
   how simple it is! Like the sermon of Peter, on the day of Pentecost, it
   is free from that continual calling out of, "Believe, believe,
   believe," which is the habit of some preachers who never tell the
   people what they have to believe! Exhortation is well enough in its
   place, but you must not have only powder in your gun--there must be
   some shot, also. The Apostle has solid facts here which he drives home
   to the heart and conscience of his hearers. He does not forget that the
   weight and forge of a sermon must lie in the distinct Truth of God
   which is taught in it.

   42. And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
   besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
   They would like to hear the same message, so they said to Paul, "This
   sermon was to the Jews. Will you not preach to us Gentiles? We have
   come in here and heard what you have said, but you did not speak
   specially to us-- will you do so next Sabbath?"

   43, 44. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
   religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them,
   persuaded them to continue in the Grace of God. And the next Sabbath
   came almost the whole city together to hear the Word of God. There is
   something attractive about the Gospel. I do not think they sent out a
   trumpeter--the preaching of the Gospel is all the trumpet that is
   needed to gather the people together! If we will but preach it in the
   power and plenitude of the Spirit of God, it will soon attract a
   congregation, as it did in this instance.

   45-49. But when the Jews saw the multitude, they were filled with envy
   and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting
   and blaspheming. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said, It was
   necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken to you,
   but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
   everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so has the Lord
   commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light of the Gentiles,
   that you should be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. And when
   the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the Word of the
   Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. And the
   Word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. God send us
   days like that, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

God's Hidden Ones

   (No. 2367)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 1, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   8, 1888.

   "Your hidden ones." Psalm 83:3.

   IT was the desire of Asaph to obtain for his nation help from God.
   Israel was exposed to great danger--ten confederate nations had
   conspired, with desperate hate, to assail the chosen people. They were
   determined to root out the very name of Israel from among the nations!
   They joined together in a wicked league for this purpose and they came
   from all quarters--north, south, east and west--in order to utterly
   devour the little insignificant people whom God had called His own. It
   was the Psalmist's desire to bring God into this quarrel, to stir Him
   up to take the part of Israel and he, therefore cried, "Keep not Your
   silence, O God: hold not Your peace, and be not still, O God. For, lo,
   Your enemies make a tumult: and they that hate You have lifted up the
   head. They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, and consulted
   against Your hidden ones."

   Nothing stirs a man more than when his children are assailed. The most
   quiet and inoffensive individual grows angry if his little one is
   touched. The blood flies to his cheeks and all his manhood is awakened
   to defend his child. So the Psalmist pleads with God that this nation
   was His own and that, therefore, He must protect it. And he describes
   the people by this singular but instructive title, "Your hidden ones."
   I am going to enquire what may be meant by this term, "Your hidden
   ones," in the desire that some of God's hidden ones may be discovered,
   and that the Lord's blessing may rest upon them. First, I shall ask,
   Why are they called God's hidden ones? Secondly, What is their special
   honor? They are God's hidden ones, they belong to Him and, thirdly,
   What then?

   I. First, then, Why are they called God's hidden ones?

   I think, in the connection in which these words occur, the phrase means
   that they were hidden by God with a view to safety. The 10 heathen
   nations conspired against Israel, but they could not really harm the
   chosen people, for God, Himself had hidden them as a hen hides her
   chickens under her wings when a hawk hovers overhead, or as one who has
   found a treasure hides it away from the hands of the thief. As the most
   precious things are put into cases and kept concealed for safety, so
   does God hide away His people and preserve them. God puts His saints
   where the enemy cannot find them, or, if he finds them so as to see
   where they are, God places them where the enemy cannot reach them.
   Sometimes He puts them in the secret places of His pavilion--yes, in
   the secret places of His tabernacle does He hide them. As well might
   the devil think to destroy an angel as to destroy a child of God! That
   same power that protects the perfect ones before the Throne of God
   protects believing ones who are on the way there. "Lord, You have been
   our dwelling place in all generations," and such a dwelling place that
   we have been hidden away in You so that no evil has been able to reach
   us!

   You remember when Athaliah sought to kill all the seed royal that
   Jehoiada, the High Priest, took Joash, who was then a child, and hid
   him for six years in the house of the Lord, and there He was safe? Thus
   does God take each one of His children and make a Joash of him, and
   preserves him from the assault of the enemy so that he cannot be
   destroyed. God said to Noah, "Come, you and all your house, into the
   ark," and he and his household went into the ark and the Lord shut them
   in. They were hidden in that ark of safety from the floods which rose
   from beneath and the rain which fell from above--and thus they outlived
   the Deluge. So, if you believe in Jesus, God will hide you away from
   all the rage of earth and Hell. He will preserve you, you shall be one
   of His hidden ones, of whom Christ said, "They shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. My Father, which gave
   them Me; is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
   My Father's hand." They are God's hidden ones. As the king takes care
   of his royal diadem and

   crown jewels, so does God watch over those who have made a covenant
   with Him by sacrifice. "They shall be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in
   that day when I make up My jewels." What a privilege is yours and mine,
   dear Hearers, if, indeed, we have so believed in Christ that we are
   hidden away in Him! "You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
   God." Rightly do we sing--

   "How blest are they who still abide Close sheltered in Your bleeding
   side! Who life and strength from there derive, And by You move, and in
   You live."

   1 think this is the first reason why the Israelites were called God's
   hidden ones, because He had put them out of the reach of their
   adversaries and concealed them in a place of safety.

   But, next, I think there is another meaning which some of us have, at
   times, realized. They are God's hidden ones because He gives them quiet
   and peace, even in the midst of turmoil and sorrow. The Psalmist seems
   to say, "Your enemies make a tumult, but Your hidden ones are quiet."
   Do you not know what this experience means? Have you ever felt it? That
   trouble you dreaded so much, of which you said, "I am sure it will
   crush me," would have crushed you if you had been left to yourself! But
   when it came, you were strangely upheld and kept so calm and placid
   that you did not know yourself! When you saw your husband die and those
   little children were all around you, and you knew that you were a
   widow, how was it that then you were still so trustful? Or, dear
   Husband, when you saw your wife, at last, expire, and the light of your
   home was quenched, how was it that you still said and meant it, "The
   Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the
   Lord"? Why, it was because the Lord had made you one of His hidden
   ones! He said, "Come home, dear child, come and rest with Me"--and He
   shut you away from all the trial and enabled you to find peace in Him.

   Do you remember that wonderful poem by Miss Havergal, in which she
   speaks of the peculiar calm which prevails at the very center of a
   cyclone? The gifted poetess writes--

   "They say there is a hollow, safe and still,

   A point of coolness and repose

   Within the center of a flame where life might dwell

   Unharmed and unconsumed, as in a luminous shell

   Which the bright walls of fire enclose

   In breathless splendor, barrier that no foes

   Could pass at will.

   There is a point of rest

   At the great center of the cyclone's force,

   A silence at its secret source.

   A little child might slumber undistracted,

   Without the ruffle of one fairy curl,

   In that strange central calm amid the mighty whirl." Well now, some of
   us have, at times, known the experience which is typified in those
   lines. Troubles of every sort and size come upon us. We are vexed with
   every form of calamity and yet during all that time we are serenely
   quiet and perfectly happy. I should think that an eagle, high aloft,
   when he sees the sportsman coming with his gun, however far the bullet
   may carry, if he knows himself to be quite out of range, would poise
   himself upon the wing and look down upon the sportsman with a merry
   heart! Let him send his bullet up into the air as far as it can rise,
   but the eagle is high above it all--and God gives His children, at
   times, such mounting faith that they rise up as upon the wings of
   eagles--and the bullets of trouble cannot reach halfway to them! There,
   in the clear blue Heaven of fellowship with God, they look down on the
   tops of the clouds, and defy all the assaults of man! Happy are they
   who have thus become God's hidden ones!

   There are green meadows and there are still waters, but I believe they
   are mostly to be found in the places where trials most abound! There,
   consolations are most plentiful. I hardly think that a man knows the
   deeps of the serenity of God unless he has been greatly tried. There
   are wonderful sights that none shall see but those who are hidden away
   by the Lord in the time of storm and trouble. Oh, the strife of
   tongues, the endless babbling of slander! What a blessing not to hear
   it, or to hear it as a deaf man that hears not. Oh, the noise of
   misrepresentation! Oh, the wave upon wave of actual trouble that may
   come to you in business or in the domestic circle! What joy it is to be
   kept out of it all, as I said before,

   like Noah in the ark--all the world drowned, but you shut up in safety!
   And remember that the deeper the floods became, the higher Noah rose
   toward Heaven! And so shall it be with you. The more of trial you have
   to endure, the more of communion you shall have to enjoy! This is the
   happy, happy case of a tried child of God.

   There are two meanings, then, of this expression--hidden away for
   safety and hidden away for quiet.

   But, next, God's people may be hidden away because they are not
   understood. The true Christian is a marvel to other men. He is a
   stranger and a foreigner among them. He is a plant that never would
   have grown on earthly mold unless God had planted it there. The
   Christian is a man wondered at! If you are understood, you are in the
   wrong. If you are a genuine Christian and are right, you will be
   misunderstood by the world--it has not the faculty of understanding the
   saints. He who has been made to live unto God lives a life that is
   quite incomprehensible to ordinary men. No, let me put it very
   plainly--the spiritual life which God gives to those who believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ is altogether beyond the discernment of the carnal
   mind! "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" and cannot rise to an
   understanding of that which is born of the Spirit, which, alone, is
   spirit! Your life is a secret between God and yourself.

   So, too, the motive of your life will not be understood by other men.
   They feel sure that there is something at the back of it. If you were
   to tell them that you lived only for God's Glory, they would laugh at
   you! God's Glory--what is that to them? They think, no doubt, that you
   make a good thing out of your religion, and herein they prove
   themselves to have learned their lesson in the school of the devil, for
   he said, "Does Job fear God for naught? Have not You made an hedge
   about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every
   side?" The desire to live so as to please God belongs to every man who
   walks with God, but it will not be understood by other men. God's
   people are, in this sense, His hidden ones.

   Therefore, the comfort that reigns in a Christian's heart is a thing
   which he cannot impart to others. If others were to hear the reason of
   the Believer's happiness, they would say, "Well, that would not make me
   happy! There is nothing in it that would sustain me." And there isn't.
   The food on which angels live is not such as common flesh and blood
   could feed upon. And the inward comforts of the child of God are such
   as the world cannot give because it cannot even understand them.

   So your hopes and the lamps that light up your life, the world knows
   nothing about! Perhaps some of your own brothers and sisters do not
   understand your hopes. And when you talk about death with pleasure, and
   about the eternal state with delight, they think that you are half
   insane! It is because they are altogether insane that they think so.
   But if you are one of God's hidden ones, in all these points you will
   be a stranger to your own mother's children--you will be one who cannot
   be understood! Do not expect to be understood--settle this in your mind
   and it will save you a great deal of heartache and disappointment.

   There is a third sense, then, in which God's children may be called
   hidden ones, because they are not understood.

   But there are some of them who are hidden in another sense--they are
   very obscure. Some of God's best children have not anything that can
   bring them to the light here on earth. Perhaps they may be living among
   rich people and, as they are very poor, nobody notices them. There is a
   directory containing the names and addresses of the great people who
   live in the town, but they have not put poor Mary's name in that
   book--and as to John, well, the highest degree he ever had was that he
   was a cobbler--and his name, of course, is not in the book, either. The
   Lord has many of those hidden ones who are not known among the great
   because they are so little in Israel.

   Some of God's hidden ones are not known because they are ill. It is now
   several months that poor Mary has been lying on a bed. It is years
   since William has gone out of the house, at all, and very few ever come
   to see these hidden ones. But I bear my witness that some of the best
   things I have ever learned from mortal lips, I have learned from
   bedridden saints! There are some who wickedly teach that bodily
   afflictions are caused by sin. It is a cruel--I was going to say, an
   infernal supposition--for some of the holiest people I have known have
   been bedridden for ten, twelve, or 15 years, and if I were to say that
   I thought they were sinners above others, I should belie my
   convictions, for in sitting down to talk with some of them I have found
   them to be saints above others!

   I shall never forget going some miles, years ago, to see a woman who
   had been bedridden for, I think, 20 or 25 years. I went up a ladder to
   the room where she was. She was rendered comfortable by the kindness of
   those who came to see her. She sat up in bed as best she could and, oh,
   I wish that I could preach such sermons as she preached to me when she
   spoke about the goodness of the Lord to her, and told me how that poor
   chamber was made to glow in the middle of the

   night with the delightful Presence of her Lord! She was one of God's
   hidden ones--and He has many such! Now, just think of that a minute,
   and pray God to bless His dear hidden sick ones at this moment, and ask
   Him to cheer and comfort their hearts.

   Perhaps there are some hidden ones who come into our places of worship
   and have no one to speak to them. I do not think that many such persons
   come to the Tabernacle--I hope there never will be. There is a Brother
   who was a member, here, and who will be a member, again. He has gone to
   live in the suburbs and he attends a very respectable place of worship.
   They are very good people but, you know, our friends in the suburbs are
   so much more respectable than we are and they know it, too! And there,
   in the outer ring of London, it is perfectly amazing what great people
   they are--you would not believe it. When they come into the City to
   business, they are nothing very particular, but as soon as they get out
   to the suburbs, they are wonderful people! This Brother says, "I have
   been in and out of the chapel for months and nobody ever speaks to me."
   The fact is, I expect, that he keeps a grocer's shop and some of these
   people deal with him, so they do not know him on Sunday, of course,
   because he is only a grocer!

   I hope that you will never get such abominable notions into your heads!
   This wretched caste that divides us up into little sets, reminds me of
   the Hindus. Keep it up in the world if you are foolish enough to do so,
   but do not bring the evil into the Church of Christ! Here, at any rate,
   we are Brothers and Sisters. Let us feel that we are one in Christ and
   put away from us all that stiffness which would make us keep our petty
   nobodies to ourselves! If there is a man who is a really great man, I
   always notice that he is the most condescending and gentle man that
   there is. But it is your nobody who always makes himself appear
   somebody! Now, dear Friend, if you have come in and out of this place
   and you have not been noticed by anybody, I pray you to begin to notice
   somebody, yourself! And if you have come in and out of any place of
   worship and nobody has spoken to you, remember that the Lord has His
   hidden ones and you may be one of them. It may be that quite from
   inadvertence, not from unkindness, you have not been spoken to, so
   begin to break the ice, yourself, by speaking to someone else and may
   God bless you so that you may, in that sense, be no more a hidden one!

   Now I ask you to think, for a minute, of another way in which some of
   God's people are hidden ones. I mean this-- do you suppose that God has
   none of His people in churches and communities that are steeled in
   error? If you think so, I do not! It is always a comfort to my heart to
   believe that in the great Romish Church there are hundreds of thousands
   who have found the Savior and are resting in His atoning
   Sacrifice--they are God's hidden ones. I have, here and there, stumbled
   upon some of these, myself. And when we have come to speak about the
   Cross and the wounds of Christ and His precious blood--all that rubbish
   about the Virgin and the saints has been forgotten--and I have found
   myself much nearer akin to those hidden ones than I had thought I might
   have been!

   And there are many books that have been written by persons who are
   members of that church which, nevertheless, are full of such a savor of
   Grace and holy fellowship with God that we cannot but believe that the
   authors of them are God's hidden ones. Yes, and it is a very curious
   thing that you will find that just the very persons you would have
   least thought would possess the Light of God have, nevertheless,
   received it. Have I not been, sometimes, in a place where I thought the
   Gospel of Christ had never come and yet I have found clear proofs that
   it was there? Not long ago it was so with me. As I passed a certain
   spot, I noticed a kind of glitter in the eye of a person who looked at
   me. It was a servant in a place where I could not have thought I should
   find a friend. And when I came back that way, his greeting to me, was,
   "God bless you, Sir! You don't know me, but I take in the sermons every
   week and I have found the Savior." Where least I expected it, I
   stumbled on a friend and a disciple who was fed on the Word of God that
   I have preached! Does it not do your heart good, sometimes, after you
   have thought, "Well, I shall never find anybody here with whom I can
   sympathize," to meet with just one of the very persons with whom you
   have had the best of fellowship for many a day and many a year to come?

   God has His hidden ones, also, in the midst of ungodly families. Do not
   you, who have to visit those who are joining the Church, sometimes find
   yourselves in houses where everything betokens drunkenness and all that
   is bad--and yet there is a dear child who has been converted, or
   perhaps it is the wife whom God, in Sovereign Grace, has looked upon
   and saved? There are many such hidden ones in London. There are some of
   them who cannot get out to worship--they are not permitted to come--and
   yet they are God's own dear ones, hidden away in ungodly homes. Breathe
   a prayer for them, now! Say, "Lord, help Your hidden ones in such cases
   as these!" God has a people--I was going to say, up to the

   very gates of Hell--He has an elect people, chosen by His Grace, who
   know Him, trust Him and love Him although they are not known to the
   rest of their Brothers and Sisters in Christ!

   Once more, however, all God's people are His hidden ones because all
   the saints are, at present, unrevealed. "It does not yet appear what we
   shall be: but we know that when He shall appear," that is, the hidden
   and veiled Christ, when He shall be manifested, "we shall be like He,"
   we shall be manifested, too! There is a great future for you, my
   Brother! There is a grand future for you, my Sister. Hardly can you
   hold your own, today, against the contentions of the adversary, but be
   firm, be true, cry to God for help and you shall not always be hidden
   as you now are, in the midst of the dust, strife and conflict--you
   shall come out as when the sun shines in his strength! Therefore, be of
   good cheer, you who are hidden ones, today--you shall, in due time,
   shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of your Father.

   II. I must not say more upon the first point, but must turn to the
   second question. WHAT IS THEIR SPECIAL HONOR? They are God's hidden
   ones. Their peculiar honor is that they are the Lord's.

   Will each one of you do himself the favor to put to himself the
   question, "Am I the Lord's?" Never mind about the friend sitting next
   to you, but let each of you say, "Am I the Lord's?" If so, the Lord
   knows you, for, "the Lord knows them that are His." He knows whom He
   chose and redeemed. He knows whom He has called. He knows whom He has
   justified. He has not done any of those things in the dark. He has a
   familiar acquaintance with all that His Grace has done for you.

   Remember, also, that though you are hidden, you are not hidden from the
   Lord. You are hidden by Him, but you are not hidden from Him. He can
   read your thoughts. He sees that hot tear that is beginning to lift the
   eyelid. He knows the troubles that are yet to come as well as those
   that have come--He reads you as I read the pages of this Bible.

   Then, again, some of God's hidden ones are among the very choicest of
   His children. I think there are some who are so very dear to God that
   He keeps them to Himself. I have known some saints whom God has loved
   so much that He has taken away from them all that they loved, that He
   might have all their hearts. He loved their love so much that He would
   have it all Himself. "Oh!" you say, "perhaps that is the reason why I
   have been so tried and why I have so many graves in the cemetery."
   Well, it may be--and that you are one of the Lord's hidden ones whom He
   has hidden away in His own bosom from every other love--that you may be
   altogether His own.

   Remember, too, that hidden as you are, He has engaged to keep you. His
   very hiding of you shows that He means to keep you in safety. You shall
   never perish for, "He keeps the feet of His saints." You shall not be
   overcome by the enemy, for you are the Lord's. If you belonged to
   somebody else, you might be deserted. But as you are the Lord's, you
   never shall be forsaken. Human masters sometimes leave their old
   servants to perish, but God never deserts His old servants! Even to
   hoar hairs and to the end of life He will be with you, and He will bear
   you until He brings you Home to Glory, above, to be with Him forever
   and ever!

   III. I have spoken very briefly on the second point, but our time is
   nearly gone, so I must close with this third question. If the Lord has
   the hidden ones of whom we have spoken, WHAT THEN?

   Well, the first thought that comes to my mind is this--let us rejoice
   that the Lord has more people than we know. He has His hidden ones. I
   know the tendency to say, as Elijah did, "I, even I, only, am left, and
   they seek my life, to take it away." It is not so--the Lord still has
   many thousands of knees that have not bowed to Baal. One of the wonders
   of Heaven will be to find so many people, there, that we never thought
   would get there. We shall say to ourselves, "We did not think that
   those people knew the Lord, yet they did!" The Grace of God can live
   where you and I could not. I know some people that I would not like to
   live with on earth, for they are very strange, yet I hope that they are
   God's people. Well, we shall live with them very well in Heaven--they
   will be changed before they get there. They will have had their hearts
   washed, their whole natures renewed and they will be right enough,
   then! The Lord has some very strange people among His chosen ones. If
   you had to deal with some of God's people that I know, you would give
   me credit for a little patience, at any rate, in dealing with them! You
   have need of patience with your own children and God's children are, in
   some respects, very much like our children. If you draw a parallel
   between them, you will find childish faults and infirmities in the
   children of God which have to be borne with, even as we have to bear
   with the faults and infirmities of our own children at home.

   My next remark is--let us be on the look out for these hidden ones
   wherever we are. If you and I have to go and live where we do not wish
   to go--away from our dear acquaintances, here--let us believe, when we
   get to that distant place,

   wherever it is, that God has some hidden ones there. You are going to
   Canada, are you? Or you are about to start for Australia? Or, in the
   Providence of God, you are to live in some village far away from the
   means of Grace. You say to yourself, "Whatever shall I do?" Do? Why,
   find the Lord's hidden ones and you shall have company! Though you may
   say, "Surely, there is no child of God there," you shall find that
   there is someone living there whom you are sent to help--while he is
   placed there that he may help you! Wherever you go, do not say to
   yourself, "This place is wholly abandoned," but believe that there is a
   child of God living there.

   I remember reading of a godly man who went into a village, some fifty
   years ago, and asked, "Is there a Christian person living in this
   place?" He enquired if there was anyone in the village who made a
   profession of religion. They shook their heads and said that they did
   not know of anybody. "Is there anyone here who fears God?" Then they
   laughed. However, after making a good many enquiries, one man said that
   there was a hypocritical canting Methodist woman who lived down a
   certain lane. He said, "That is the person I want to meet, depend upon
   it." He knew at once what they meant--there was one who was different
   from the rest and, therefore, she had undeservedly earned those titles!
   He went and found that she was a Christian woman walking in meekness
   and sorrow because she had no one at all to speak to.

   When our missionary, Mr. Thomas, went to Calcutta at the end of the
   last century, it is said that he advertised for a Christian and could
   not find one. Advertise for a Christian? Well, thank God, we shall not
   have to do that! Even if you live in a place where there are very few
   Christians, still believe that there are some and look out for God's
   hidden ones!

   In the next place, since God has hidden ones, let us take care never to
   act or speak so as to grieve them. Sometimes, when Christian men get
   conceited and proud--and think themselves very great--they speak in a
   hard, domineering way that grieves God's people. "No," you say, "/
   would not use such language if I knew that one of them was about." Well
   then, do not use it at all--because you do not know when they may not
   be about, for God has His hidden ones in places where it is least
   suspected! Speak as you would wish the very least of God's people to
   hear you and do not use vain and haughty language. If you get to be
   like the Prophet's bullocks that pushed with horn and shoulder and
   drove away the weak ones, God may deal roughly with you and make you to
   be as hateful in His sight as they were! Let the remembrance that God
   has His hidden ones be a check upon your tongue and upon your whole
   conduct.

   And, lastly, although God has His hidden ones, let not one of us hide
   himself more than is necessary. I speak to some of you who love the
   Lord, but who have never come out on His side. God has His hidden ones,
   but they ought to come forward and confess Christ. Remember that the
   Gospel message is, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved."
   "If you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe
   in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be
   saved. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation." To the secret faith of the
   heart there ought to be joined the public profession of the lips! Why
   should you be ashamed of Jesus? Why should you be afraid to acknowledge
   that you belong to Him? Some whom I know, who love their Lord but have
   never confessed Him, are like the mice behind the wainscot. They come
   out of a night, when the cat is not there, to get some of the
   crumbs--and then they run back and hide in their holes. I shall not set
   a trap for you, but, at the same time I would like to stop up all the
   holes where you hide, so that you who are Christians would be obliged
   to come out and admit it! I leave the matter to your conscience, but I
   pray the Lord, Himself, to fetch you out if you are His hidden ones,
   for His dear name's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 83.

   This is a Psalm that is not often read and very seldom expounded, I
   should think. According to the title, it is, "A Song or Psalm of
   Asaph." Asaph is one of a little group of poets who flourished side by
   side with David. This is a patriotic hymn. The nation was about to be
   attacked by many adversaries, so, like a true patriot, the poet desired
   that God would give the victory to His people, and deliver them. You
   may regard this Psalm as a prophecy--it reads like a prayer or wish of
   the writer and, no doubt it is, but it may also be read as a prophecy
   of what will happen to the enemies of God's people.

   Verses 1, 2. Keep not Your silence, O God: hold not Your peace, and be
   not still, O God. For, lo, Your enemies make a tumult: and they that
   hate You have lifted up the head. God's enemies are making a noise and
   the Psalmist's prayer is that

   the Lord, Himself, will speak and answer them. God's voice made the
   heavens and the earth--"He spoke and it was done; He commanded and it
   stood fast." A single word from Him will win the day! The poet's prayer
   is not, "Grant a leader bold and brave," but, "Lord, speak, speak!"
   "For, lo, Your enemies make a tumult." The enemies of Israel were the
   enemies of God. If they were our enemies, only, we might keep silent,
   but as they are also the enemies of God, our loyalty to the Lord
   compels us to cry unto Him to speak against them!

   3. They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, and consulted
   against Your hidden ones. Craft goes with power in plotting against
   God's people. The seed of the serpent are like he from whom they came,
   and of him it is said, "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast
   of the field which the Lord God had made." And the seed of the serpent
   are full of crafty counsel and subtlety. This, the Psalmist mentions in
   his prayer, and then he looks to God to frustrate their minds, to
   baffle their craft and, by His wisdom, to save His people.

   4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
   that the name of /srael may be no more in remembrance. So terrible was
   the anger of these nations against God's people that nothing would
   content them but the destruction of Israel--the blotting out of its
   very name from the memory of men! And I am sure that if the world could
   have its way, it would extinguish the Church of Christ. You notice, in
   these days of boasted liberality and pretended charity, that the
   charity is only for error--for the old Gospel there is no charity! The
   cry concerning it is, "Let it be cut to pieces! Let it be destroyed! It
   is an old nuisance, put it out of the way." This is how the enemies of
   God would have it, "that the name of Israel may be no more in
   remembrance."

   5. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
   confederate against You. There were many nations of heathens and they
   were agreed in nothing except in their hatred of Israel. There they
   were agreed, as Herod was the friend of Pilate while Christ was under
   examination, but not at any other time. The Psalmist mentions ten
   different nations which had banded themselves together against God's
   chosen people Israel. Ten against one is heavy odds, but then God was
   on the side of Israel! One man with God is in the majority, however
   many there may be on the other side, for God counts for more than all
   who can be against Him!

   6. The tabernacles of Edom. These descendants of Esau, Jacob's twin
   brother, ought to have been the best friends of Israel, but they were
   the worst of their enemies. How often does it happen that kinship in
   blood makes no kinship in Grace! "A man's foes shall be they of his own
   household."

   6. And the /shmaelites. These, again, were near akin to the seed of
   Abraham and Isaac, but the Ishmaelites were always among the most
   bitter enemies of Israel.

   6. Of Moab. Moab was descended from a daughter of Lot.

   7. And the Hagarenes. Perhaps descended from Hagar by some other
   husband.

   7. Gehal, andAmmon, andAmalek. All these were hereditary enemies of
   Israel--Amalek especially so, for God had determined that there should
   be war with Amalek throughout all generations.

   7. The Philistines--These were the old enemies of Israel. Remember how
   Samson fought with them and what tugs of war David had with them?

   7. With the inhabitants of Tyre. What were they doing in warring
   against God's people? They were merchants, shippers. Yes, but it
   sometimes happens that when worldly craft is in danger, men of trade
   and commerce can be as bitter against true religion as anybody else!

   8. Assur also is joined with them: they have helped the children of
   Lot. Selah. Here is a mention of the growing power of Assyria. What a
   host there was! What a band of enemies against God's people! Oh, dear
   Friends, I trust that none of us will have our names written in this
   black list! Be not enemies of God and of His Truth, for, if so, you
   will wage a losing battle! Let the gunnysack fight with the flame, or
   the dust with the wind--they will speedily be overcome--and woe be unto
   the man who contends with his Maker! What can he do? Let us, Brothers
   and Sisters, be on God's side. God grant, by His Grace, that we may
   never lift a hand against His cause! Now comes the prayer or prophecy
   of the poet.

   9. 10. Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
   at the brook of Kishon: which perished at Endor: they became as dung
   for the earth. In those great battles, the enemies of the Lord and His
   people were utterly cut in pieces. Mighty men as they were, they left
   their corpses to manure the soil.

   11. Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yes, all their princes
   as Zebah, and as Zalmunna. These were four princes who were slain by
   Gideon and his allies--two of them bore the names of wolf and
   raven--cruel names, but war is always a cruel thing. But what had they
   done, these men of arms, these mighty warriors? The Psalmist tells us--

   12. Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
   They were not content with their own houses--they wanted God's houses.
   And there are some men who can never rest unless when they are doing
   mischief to the cause and Cross of Christ! Woe unto them, for the fate
   of Oreb and Zeeb shall be theirs in due time!

   13. O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
   Or rather, "You shall make them a wheel," never still. The real
   translation, I think, would be, "Make them like those light dry flowers
   which are blown by the wind across the plains." Mr. Thomson, in his
   Land and the Book, speaks of the branches of the wild artichoke which
   form a sphere or globe a foot or more in diameter, and he says that he
   has seen thousands of them come wheeling along. Isaiah calls them, "a
   rolling thing before the whirlwind." A puff of wind would come and take
   them in one direction and then a contrary wind would drive them in
   quite another direction! They are so light, downy, gossamer-like, that
   they never can rest.

   Now this is just what happens to many men who set themselves against
   God and His Grace. They are like rolling things never at
   rest--believing nothing, knowing nothing, hoping nothing, comforted by
   nothing--they are like a wheel. Oh, that we may never know, by personal
   experience, what this means! "Make them like a wheel, as the stubble
   before the wind"! You know how that is--the stubble is blown up, down,
   to the right, to the left, whichever way the wind blows. Are any of you
   like that, tonight? Have you no stability? Have you no good hope for
   the future? When you think about death and eternity, are you like the
   stubble before the wind? If so, God have mercy upon you, and bring you
   to the only place where you can obtain salvation and stability!

   14. As the fire burns a forest and as the flame sets the mountains on
   fire. Travelers tell us that they have, sometimes, seen the sides of
   mountains all ablaze where the timber, growing old, and everything
   being dry in the heat of summer, a chance spark has set the whole on
   fire. This is what God will do with His enemies. He will as certainly
   and as readily destroy them as the forest is burnt with fire, or the
   mountain's side is consumed by the raging flames! Who will stand
   against God? Who will dare attempt it? Consider His great might and
   flee from His wrath!

   15. So persecute them with Your tempest. Or, "You will so follow them
   up with Your tempest."

   15, 16. And make them afraid with Your storms. Fill their faces with
   shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD. That is the prayer which
   we might pray, tonight, for all those who are denying the Godhead of
   Christ and His great Sacrifice of the Cross--and for all who reject the
   Inspiration of Scripture and the blessed Doctrines of Grace. "O Lord,
   fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name!" Oh, that
   men did but know their own character! If they did but feel ashamed of
   their own sin, they might be led to seek the name of God.

   17. Let them be confused and troubled forever. Or rather, "They shall
   be confused and troubled forever." That is an awful passage, "Confused
   and troubled forever."

   17, 18. Yes, let them be put to shame and perish: that men may know
   that You, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, are the Most High over all the
   earth. You notice that when I read the Scriptures, wherever I find the
   word, LORD, in capital letters, I read it as Jehovah, for so it should
   be. I wish that the translators of the Revised Version had had the
   courage of their convictions and had so translated it, for we need that
   grand name back--Jah, Jehovah. Let me entreat You never to trifle, as
   some do, with that sacred word, Hallelujah, or, Hallelu-Jah--praise to
   Jehovah!

The Living Care of the Dying Christ

   (No. 2368)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 8, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   15, 1888.

   "Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He: if, therefore, you seek
   Me, let these go their way: that the saying might be fulfilled which He
   spoke, Of those which You gave Me have I lost none." John 18:8,9.

   THE two remarkable miracles which our Lord worked in the Garden of
   Gethsemane ought not to be lightly passed over. The first was the
   falling to the ground of the soldiers and the servants of the priests.
   Jesus did but speak to them and there was such power and majesty about
   His Presence and His voice that, "they went backward, and fell to the
   ground." They were quite unable to seize Him. Here was a display, in
   some measure, of Christ's Divine Power. These men would have fallen
   into the grave and into Hell, itself, if Jesus had put forth the full
   force of His strength! He only spoke a word and down they fell--they
   had no power whatever against Him. Beloved, take comfort from this
   miracle! When the enemies and foes of Christ come against Him, He can
   easily overthrow them. Many times have there been crises in the
   Church's history when it seemed as if the Truth of God would be
   destroyed. Then has come the opportunity for Divine interposition. A
   word from Christ has vanquished His enemies! They that were waiting,
   like lions, ready to leap upon their prey, have been disappointed.
   Jesus has but spoken and they have fallen backward to the ground.
   Therefore, take heart and be not dismayed even in the darkest hour. Let
   Christ only utter a word and the victory is certain to be with

   Him!

   The other miracle was this, that seeing the company that came together
   to take Him, He should be able, at pleasure, to screen His disciples so
   that not one of them was injured. The ear of the High Priest's servant
   was cut off--it was the opposite party that received the wound--but no
   ear of Peter or finger of John was struck. The Apostles escaped
   altogether unharmed. The were not able to protect themselves, being a
   very small number compared with the posse that had come forth from the
   High Priest, yet their Master preserved them! From this we learn that
   the Lord Jesus Christ is able to take care of His own. When they seem
   to be like so many lambs in the midst of wolves, He can keep them so
   that no wolf can devour them. He has done it and He will continue to do
   so! "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to
   give you the Kingdom." He will preserve you by His own miraculous power
   and you need not be dismayed at any force that is arrayed against you.

   Think, then, of those two miracles. You may need to remember
   them--there may come a time when it shall be a great joy for you to
   think of Christ, all ruddy from the bloody sweat, yet driving back His
   adversaries with only a word, and rescuing the little handful of His
   disciples from anything like harm.

   But in my text I notice something which seems to me very
   remarkable--"If, therefore," said Jesus, "you seek Me, let these go
   their way: that the saying might be fulfilled." After such an
   expression, you naturally expect some Old Testament text--something
   said by David in the Psalms or by one of the Prophets--but it is not
   so! It is, "that the saying might be fulfilled, which He spoke, "Of
   them which You gave Me have I lost none." It is but an hour or two
   since Jesus uttered this sentence, but it is already among the Inspired
   Scriptures and it begins to take effect and to be fulfilled at once! It
   is not the age of God's Word, but the Truth of it that constitutes its
   power! What Christ had said that very night in prayer was as true and
   as much the Word of the King as that which God had spoken by His Spirit
   through holy men ages before!

   Beloved, learn this lesson--the Word of Christ is to be depended upon!
   You may hang your whole destiny upon it! What Christ has said is full
   of the Truth of God. He is, Yes and Amen, and so are all His
   Words--they stand fast forever

   and ever, like His own eternal Godhead. Therefore, since this Word of
   Christ, which had only just been spoken, must be fulfilled, believe
   that every Word of His will be carried out to the utmost! Heaven and
   earth shall pass away, but not one Word which was spoken by our Savior
   shall ever fail--it shall not fail even the least of us in our worst
   hour of peril! I read this Truth of God in the text with very great
   delight. We might have expected to find an Old Testament Scripture
   quoted here, but the New Testament Scripture is put upon the same level
   as the Old and, coming from the lips of Christ, we are pleased to see
   it so soon fulfilled.

   The soldiers and officers from the chief priests had come forth that
   night especially to arrest Christ. Peter, James, John, Bartholomew,
   Thomas and the rest of the Apostles are all there, but Judas has come
   to betray, not the servants, but their Master. And they who are with
   the traitor have come to take not the disciples, but their Lord. To me,
   there is something encouraging about this fact, although it is a dismal
   one. The fight of the great adversary is not so much against us as
   against our Master. Satan's emissaries are very furious, sometimes,
   with the faithful defenders of the Truth, but their fury is not so much
   against them as against the Truth and against the Christ who is the
   center of that Truth. In olden times, they hated Luther, Calvin and
   Zwingli, and the rest of the Reformers, but the main point of attack
   was the Doctrine of Justification by Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

   And at this day the great fight is around the Cross. Did Jesus die as
   His people's Substitute? That is the question and there are some, I
   grieve to say it, to whom that text is applicable, "He that despised
   Moses' Law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how
   much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has
   trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the
   Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done
   despite unto the Spirit of Grace?" This is the chief aim of the enemy's
   assaults--to get rid of Christ, to get rid of the Atonement, to get rid
   of His suffering in the place of men! They say they can embrace the
   rest of the Gospel, but what, "rest," is there? What is there left? A
   bloodless, Christless Gospel is neither fit for the land nor for the
   dunghill-- it neither honors God nor converts the sons of men!

   This is our consolation, that the attack is, after all, against the
   Master, Himself. Our Lord Jesus Christ is still the great target for
   the archer's arrows. Though His enemies do not always let His disciples
   go their way, yet they do seek Him--it is against Him that they rave
   most of all. As it is the quarrel of God's Covenant, He will fight it
   out to the end! And so far as your part in the battle is concerned, as
   it is for His Truth, His eternal power and Godhead and His great
   Sacrifice, you may safely go through with it, for he who fights for
   this cause shall surely have God with him.

   Now let us come to our text and try to learn some lessons from it. I
   notice here, first, Christ's dying care for His disciples. Then, next,
   I see that His care extends to their bodies. And, thirdly, I observe
   that His care offers Himself instead of them. He thrusts Himself upon
   the edge of the adversaries' sword and says, "If, therefore, you seek
   Me, let these go their way."

   I. First, then, I call upon you to notice in our text CHRIST'S DYING
   CARE FOR HIS DISCIPLES. Let me correct what I have said and put it, THE
   LIVING CARE OF THE DYING CHRIST, for you see He is occupied, first of
   all, with His disciples' safety. The soldiers have come to seize Him,
   but He does not seek to escape. They bind Him, but He does not burst
   His bonds. They will take Him to prison and to death, but He has not a
   word to say in His own defense. He utters no curse against His
   persecutors. His one thought is for His disciples! His ruling passion
   is strong in death--His love still masters Him.

   This was the more wonderful because He was in the first brunt of the
   danger. He had been betrayed by Judas and the High Priest's servants
   were gathering about Him to capture Him, yet He was calm and quiet, and
   His one thought was concerning the 11 who were with Him. Usually, we
   become quieter when we get used to a trouble--it is in the first
   fluster of it that we are disconcerted and thrown off balance. I
   suppose it is so with you. I know it is so with me. We learn, after a
   little while, to look calmly around us. We gird up the loins of our
   mind and we begin to think as we should think--but at first we are like
   birds driven out to sea by a rough wind--that have not learned, yet, to
   manage their wings in the gale. It was not so with our Savior. In that
   first moment of attack He still thought of His disciples. Oh, the
   splendor of that love which could not be disturbed! Many waters could
   not quench it even at their first breaking out, nor could the floods
   drown it when they were swollen to their highest! Beloved, Jesus never
   forgets you who are His own. Never does anything happen in this world
   or in Heaven that leads Him to forget you. He has engraved your names
   upon

   the palms of His hands--they are written upon His heart! So be it, the
   first brunt of your battle or of His own, He still thinks of you and
   cares for you.

   But it is more remarkable, still, that Jesus thought of His disciples
   in the faintness of His agony. All crimson from the bloody sweat, He
   rose from under the olive trees, came forward and stood there in the
   torchlight before His persecutors. But the light that fell upon His
   brow revealed no care for anything but the safety of His followers. His
   whole soul had gone out to them. That crimson sweat meant a heart
   flowing out at every pore with love for those whom His Father had given
   Him, and whom He had so long preserved. I doubt not that He was faint
   with the dreadful agony. He must have been brought to the very lowest
   point of endurance by it, yet He still thought of His disciples!
   Beloved, when you and I are sick and faint, other people do not expect
   us to think of them. We grow a little selfish when we are weak and
   ill--we want someone to moisten our lips, we expect our friends to
   watch over us and wipe the sweat from our brow. It was not so with our
   Master! He came, not to be ministered unto, but to minister! And He
   does so by saying to the rabble throng, "If, therefore, you seek Me,
   let these go their way."

   And mark, dear Friends, that our Lord Jesus was not only in the brunt
   of danger, and in the faintness of His agony, but He was in full
   prospect of a cruel death. He knew all that was to be done to Him. When
   you and I have to suffer, we do not know what is before us--it is a
   happy circumstance that we do not. But Jesus knew that they would
   buffet Him, that they would blindfold Him, that they would spit in His
   face, that they would scourge Him. He knew that the crown of thorns
   would tear His temples. He knew that He would be led forth like a
   malefactor, bearing the gallows on His shoulder. He knew that they
   would nail His feet and hands to the cruel Cross. He knew that He would
   cry, "I thirst." He knew that His Father must forsake Him on account of
   the sin of man that would be laid upon Him. He knew all that! These
   huge Atlantic billows of grief already cast their spray in His face.
   His lips were salt with the brine of His coming grief, but He did not
   think of that--His one thought was for His Beloved, those whom His
   Father had given Him. Till He dies, He will keep His eye on His sheep
   and He will grasp His Shepherd's crook with which to drive the foe from
   them. Oh, the all-absorbing, self-consuming love of Christ! Verily, it
   was like coals of juniper which have a most vehement flame! Do you know
   that love, Beloved? If so, let your hearts reciprocate it--loving Him
   in return with all the strength of your life and all the wealth of your
   being! Even then you can never love Him as He has loved you.

   I must add that it was all the more remarkable that Jesus should
   continue to think of His disciples at such a time when He knew what
   they were. They had been asleep, even while He was in the bloody sweat!
   Even the three whom He had chosen as His bodyguard and stationed within
   a stone's throw of His terrible agony, had slept! Jesus also knew that
   the 11 would all forsake Him and flee, and that one of them would even
   deny Him. Yet He thought of them. O Lord, how can You think of such
   sinful creatures as we are? I feel glad that these Apostles were not
   perfect. We must not rejoice in anything that is evil, but still, it is
   some comfort to me that though they were such poor creatures as they
   were, Jesus cared for them, for now I can believe that He loves me!

   Though I sleep when I ought to wake and watch with Him, yet He loves
   me. Although, under the brunt of a strong temptation, I may flee--He
   still loves me! Yes, and even if I should deny Him, yet I can
   understand that, as He loved Peter, He may still love me. O faulty
   saints, you who love Him and yet often fail Him! You who trust Him and
   yet are oftentimes dismayed! Gather strength, I pray you, from this
   wonderful love of Jesus! Is not the love of Christ a mass of miracles,
   all wonders packed together? It is not a subject for surprise that He
   should love, but that He should love such worms as we are--that He
   should love us when we were dead in trespasses and sins, that He should
   love us into life, should love us despite our faults, should love us to
   perfection--and should love us till He brings us to share His Glory!
   Rejoice, then, in this wondrous care of Christ--the dying Christ with a
   living care for His disciples!

   II. But now, secondly, HIS CARE EXTENDS TO THEIR BODIES.

   I will not be long upon this point, but I want you to note some of the
   sweetness there is in it. When I was reading to you, just now, you must
   have noticed that our Lord said, "Those that You gave Me, I have kept,
   and none of them is lost." Surely He meant that He kept them from
   wandering into sin, did He not? Did He not mean that He kept them unto
   eternal salvation? Undoubtedly He did, but the greater includes the
   less. He who keeps a man, keeps the whole man-- spirit, soul and body.
   So our Lord Jesus, here, interprets His own prayer, which dealt with
   the souls of His people. He mainly interprets it as to their bodies,
   for He bade those who came to seize Him to let His disciples go,
   saying, "If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go their way."

   You say to me, "That is a small interpretation of a great utterance." I
   know it is and that is the comfort of it, that if there are small
   meanings to the promises, you may quote them and pray for them, as well
   as believe in and pray for the greater and immeasurable meaning of the
   promises! I like to believe that He who loves me as an immortal spirit,
   loves me as a mortal man. He who loves me as I shall be before His
   Throne in Glory, loved me as I was when I hung upon my mother's
   breast--and loves me as I now am--with many a weakness and infirmity
   clinging to me! He who takes care of the soul, takes care of the body,
   too.

   Notice that this care of our Lord was effectual. Is it not amazing that
   none of those soldiers and servants of the High Priest touched one of
   the eleven? Is it not remarkable that Malchus, having lost his right
   ear, did not feel it his duty to thrust at Peter? But the Savior
   interposes and just touches the wounded ear, and it is healed! And
   Peter is allowed to go. That act of Peter was enough to bring on a
   battle royal all round and we know that the whole eleven had only two
   swords between them. They could have made only a very feeble stand
   against a band of armed men, yet not one of them was injured. How well
   does Jesus protect His own!

   What is more remarkable, the Apostles were not harmed at the time of
   Christ's death. It would not at all have surprised me if the mob that
   cried, "Crucify Him, crucify Him," had also said, "Here are some of His
   disciples, let us also put them to death! Let us increase the agonies
   of the dying Nazarene by the slaughter of His disciples before His
   eyes." Yet not a dog moved his tongue against them! And when it was
   reported that Christ had risen from the dead, why did not His enemies
   pounce upon Mary Magdalene and the rest of the women? Forty days was
   Jesus on the earth and I do not find that in all that time there was
   any hindrance to the coming or going anywhere of any of His disciples!
   After the Holy Spirit had been poured out, there came a time of
   persecution, but until then it was not in the Savior's mind that the
   Jews should touch one of His disciples--and they could not. The devil
   cannot go any farther than his chain permits--and the worst enemies of
   Christ can do no more than Christ allows. What an effectual care was
   this of the Master which held the broad shield of His Divine protection
   not only over the eleven, but also over all the rest of the faithful!
   He was at His lowest when they took Him, bound Him and led Him away,
   but even then, with His Sovereign Word, He protected His people from
   all harm--as to their bodies as well as their souls.

   Notice, also, that it was necessary that they should have special
   protection. Jesus meant them all to remain alive to see Him after His
   death, that they might be witnesses of His Resurrection. They were a
   little handful of seed corn and He would not have one grain wasted,
   because it was by that precious wheat that His Church was to be fed and
   the world was to be sown with spiritual life!

   Besides, they were not ready, yet, to bear persecution. Afterwards they
   bore it manfully, joyfully--but just now they were poor feeble children
   until the Spirit of God was poured out. Brothers and Sisters, the Lord
   Jesus Christ can shelter us from sickness and from every kind of bodily
   affliction until we are fit to bear it. And He can also preserve us
   from death till our work is done. It is a good saying, though it is not
   a Scriptural one, "We are immortal till our work is done." If God has
   given you anything to do, get to the doing of it! The time is short,
   but dream not that you shall be cut off too soon! You have a work for
   your time and you shall have time for your work. Believe it and you may
   go between the jaws of behemoth without a fear, while God has work for
   you to accomplish for Him! Therefore, be not afraid, for Jesus says,
   "Let these go their way."

   Once more, the care which the Lord took of His people was much better
   than their own care. See, Peter is going to take care of his Master,
   but he makes a poor mess of it. But when his Master took care of him,
   that was a very different affair. Peter is going to fight for his
   Brothers--out comes the sword--off goes the ear of Malchus! And Peter
   probably regretted that he had not cut off his head. But what good did
   Peter do? He only increased the danger they were in and made the men
   feel the more furious against them. But Christ's Word was ample--here
   was sufficient defense for all the Apostles, "Let these go their way,"
   and go their way they did! Brothers and Sisters, we would do a deal
   better in many things if we did not do anything at all! There is many a
   man who is drowning and makes his drowning sure by his struggling. I am
   told that if he could but lie still on his back, he would float! And I
   believe that in many a trouble we make the trouble 10 times worse by
   our kicking and plunging.

   "O rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him." Especially do so if
   it is a matter of scandal. If anybody speaks evil of you, do not answer
   him. I have had a great deal of experience of this kind--perhaps as
   much as anybody--and I have always found that if I get a spot of mud
   anywhere on my coat, and I proceeded to brush it off, it is much worse
   than be-

   fore. Leave it alone till it is dry--then it will come off easily.
   Perhaps even then you had better leave somebody else to do your
   clothes-brushing and your boot-cleaning--you cannot do it nearly so
   well, yourself, as somebody else can do it for you. I say again, we
   should do better, often, if we did nothing. These 11 Apostles did best
   when Peter had put up that ugly old sword of his and left off fighting
   and, at His Master's Word, went away safe and sound from the armed men
   who had arrested His Lord.

   Beloved, you are all right if you are in Jesus Christ's hands--right
   for your body, right for your estate, right for your character, right
   for little things as well as for great--if you just leave all in those
   dear hands that never fail, because they act for the dear heart that
   never ceases to beat with infinite affection towards all those whom the
   Father has given to

   Him.

   III. I have continued longer than I intended, so I am coming, now, to
   the third and last point, which is this-- CHRIST'S CARE LED HIM TO
   OFFER HIMSELF INSTEAD OF HIS PEOPLE.

   Jesus said, "If, therefore, you seek Me, let these go their way." This
   was as much as to say, "You cannot hurt both Myself and My people."
   This is a great Truth of God, though I put it very simply to you. When
   the judgments of God are abroad, it is not possible that they should
   fall on both Christ and His people. Was Jesus Christ the Substitute for
   His people? Grant that, then, if the punishment of sin fell on Christ,
   it cannot fall on those for whom Christ died! It is not according to
   natural justice, much less Divine Justice, that the Substitute should
   suffer first, and then the person for whom He stood as Substitute
   should also suffer. That cannot be! Why have a Substitute at all unless
   that Substitute, by His suffering, clears those for whom He was
   substituted?

   I will give you a very simple illustration. You will find it in the
   Book of Deuteronomy. There is the old Divine ordinance that when a man
   found a bird's nest and there were young birds in the nest, if he took
   the young, he must let the mother bird go free, he must not take
   both--that was contrary to the Divine Law. So, Christ may die, or His
   people may die--but not both of them. Justice will not have it that
   they shall both suffer. And the Lord Jesus Christ gives a tongue to
   that great Law when He says, "If you seek Me, here I am, but let these
   go their way, for you cannot take us both." That were contrary to the
   sacred Law and to the Divine equity which lies at the bottom of
   everything that is true. Did Christ, my Ransom, die for me? Then I
   shall not die. Did He pay my debt? Then it is paid and I shall not be
   called upon to pay it--

   "If You have my discharge procured, And freely in my place endured The
   whole of wrath Divine. Payment God cannot twice demand-- First at my
   bleeding Surety's hand, And then, again, at mine."

   Did Jesus suffer in my place outside the city gate? Then, turn you, my
   Soul, unto your rest, since He died for you! Justice could not claim
   both the Surety and those for whom He stood as Substitute! And,
   Beloved, it was the Master who died. They did seek Him, they did take
   Him, they did crucify Him--He did bear it all as His people's
   Substitute. "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." Do not
   be deceived about this matter, but grip it as a fact most sure that the
   Lord Jesus Christ did bear His people's sins in His own body on the
   tree. "The chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes
   we are healed." Brothers and Sisters, I am not making this up and
   telling you words of my own. These are the precious Truths of Holy
   Writ, Divinely Inspired. Oh, that all would believe them!

   Christ has suffered in the place of His people. What then? As I have
   said to you, before, both cannot suffer, therefore, as Jesus suffered,
   you who are His people are clear. Perhaps you will go down to the
   grave. Unless the Lord should speedily come, we shall die, but, since
   Jesus died, death cannot hold us! The resurrection trumpet will ring
   out its silver note and this will be the message to the dull cold ear
   of death, "Since I died, let these go their way," and every sepulcher
   shall open wide, the caverns of death shall no longer enclose the
   bodies of the saints, but from beds of dust and silent clay the whole
   of Christ's redeemed shall rise! Because He lives, they shall also
   live! Death sought Him and, therefore, death must let these who belong
   to Him go their way!

   And as for Justice, there comes the dread tremendous day, the day for
   which all other days were made--the Day of Judgment and of condemnation
   of ungodly men! Shall I stand shivering before that eternal Judgement
   Seat? No, not so! Shall I feel the earth quake beneath me and see
   Heaven splitting above me, and the stars falling like withered leaves
   in

   autumn? Doubtless it will be so. Will the avenging angel come with his
   dread sword of fire and sweep us poor sinful ones away? He will, unless
   we are in Christ! But if we are among the blood-redeemed ones, he must
   stay his fiery vengeance, for there shall come a voice from the risen
   and reigning Savior, "You have smitten Me, therefore let these go their
   way." And because He died for us, we shall go our way! Which way? Up
   yonder shining staircase made of light! Up where the angels come and
   go, we shall make our way, like children who run upstairs at home, up
   into the world of the Light of God and to the home of Glory where our
   Savior's face is the sun and His Presence makes Heaven! Yes, and this
   shall be our permit for ascending there--Jesus has loved us and has
   died to redeem us from our sins.

   With this I close, dear Hearers. When I come into this pulpit and
   especially during the last two or three Sunday nights when I have felt
   my head swim at the sight of you, I seem like one standing on a high
   cliff, half afraid to remain there--and I think to myself, "Shall I
   long preach to these people?" Well, well, whether I do or do not, I
   would press home this question upon your consciences as I shall meet
   you in that Great Day--have you a share in Jesus Christ's love and
   care? Did He bear your sins in His own body on the tree? Do you believe
   in Him? That is, do you trust Him? Have you put your soul into His
   hands that He may save it? If so, you are justified by Him, you are
   saved in Him!

   Say, dear Friend, next--do you obey Him? Is He your Master and Lord? Is
   His will the supreme law of your life? Or do you wish it to be so and
   pray to make it so? Then again you may go your way, for Christ has
   stood in your place. Do you suffer with Him? Are you willing to suffer
   for Him? There are some who will go with Christ if He will put on His
   silver slippers, His purple mantle and His jeweled crown. How good they
   are! How bravely will they say, "I am a Christian," when everybody will
   throw primroses in their path! Yes, but when people sneer and call you
   an old Puritan, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, or some other pretty
   name--and when those who preach to you are much abused and evil things
   are said of them--can you take the side of a despised Christ? Can you
   stand at His Cross? Can you acknowledge Him when the blood is dripping
   from His wounds, when everybody thrusts out their tongue at Him and
   have ill words for the Crucified One? Can you say, "I still love Him"?

   Remember the good Scotch woman, when Claverhouse had murdered her godly
   husband. "Ah," he said, "what do you think of your bonny husband, now?"
   She answered, "I always thought my man was very beautiful, but I never
   saw him look as lovely as he does now, that he has died for his
   Master." Can you say the same of Christ? He was always precious to me.
   I love Him in every shape and form, but when I see Him put on His
   crimson robe and bleed at every pore for me. When the rubies are in His
   hands and on His feet, and I see Him still despised and rejected of
   men, I love Him more than ever! And I love His Cross and take it up. I
   love His shame and His reproach, and count it "greater riches than the
   treasures in Egypt." If it is so with you. If you are with Him in His
   shame, I will guarantee that you shall be with Him in

   His Glory!

   I count it to be a mean position to be only with a reigning Christ on
   earth and to go with Him only in fair weather. Oh, but this is the
   pledge and proof of love--if you are with Him when the snowflakes blow
   into your face and the storm comes hurtling against you--and you can
   follow bravely where He leads the way! God make you such followers of
   the Crucified! May your feet know what it is to be pricked with thorns,
   or your head will never know what it is to feel the weight of the Glory
   diadem! May you be willing to be despised and rejected, for if not, you
   have thrown away your crown! God bless you, dear Friends, and blessed
   be His name for helping me, again, to speak to you tonight! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 17:1-12; 18:1-14.

   1. These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up His eyes to Heaven, and said,
   Father, the hour is come. This is, in a very special sense, our Lord's
   prayer. What a word that is from the lips of Jesus, "Father"! This was
   the night of His deepest sorrow and His heaviest woe, but He begins His
   prayer with this tender expression, "Father, the hour is come." The
   hour of darkness, the hour of His passion and death had now arrived.

   1. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son, also, may glorify You. Did Jesus
   look upon His suffering as His Glory? He does not merely pray, "Sustain
   Your Son," but, "Glorify Your Son." In truth, our Lord's lowest stoop
   was His highest Glory! He was never more resplendent than when He hung
   upon the Cross--that was His true spiritual throne, so He prayed,
   "Glorify Your Son"--Enable Him to bear the agony and to pass through it
   to Glory. "That Your Son, also,

   may glorify You." The death of Christ was a great glorifying of God. We
   see His love and His justice rendered more glorious in the death of
   Christ than they would have been by any other method!

   2. As You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give
   eternal life to as many as You have given Him. In this verse you get
   the doctrines of General and Particular Redemption blended. By His
   death, Christ obtained power over all flesh. His death had some
   relation to every man, but the special objective of it was the
   salvation of the elect. The purpose of the shower is to water one
   particular field, but the rain falls everywhere, so plenteous is the
   bounty of God. The objective of Christ's Atonement is to purchase
   eternal life for those who were given to Him by His Father, but He has
   also obtained power over all flesh.

   3. And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent. To know God is eternal life.
   If you know God, if you know Jesus Christ whom He has sent, you are
   spiritually quickened. That knowledge has brought to you, no, it is, in
   itself, the new life--"This is life eternal"--not life for a few years
   but life eternal. Mark the final perseverance of the saints, how they
   shall hold on and hold out forever.

   4. I have glorified You on the earth: I have finished the work which
   You gave Me to do. Jesus regards His work as already done, although He
   had yet to die, to pay the ransom price for His people. Yet, by a leap
   of holy faith, He says, "I have finished the work which You gave Me to
   do."

   5. And now, O Father, glorify You, Me, with Your own Self with the
   Glory which I had with You before the world was. Jesus had laid aside
   His Glory for our sakes. Now He asks that His work, being regarded as
   done, His Glory may be given back to Him.

   6. I have manifested Your name unto the men which You gave Me out of
   the world: Yours they were, and You gave them Me: and they have kept
   Your Word. God's people belong to Him. He gives them to His Son--Christ
   gives them His Word and they keep it. "They have kept Your Word." Do we
   keep God's Word? Do we hold to it? Do we make it the guide of our whole
   life? Do we seek to obey it? This is the token of God's chosen people.

   7-12. Now they have known that all things whatever You have given Me
   are of You. For I have given unto them the Words which You gave Me; and
   they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from
   You, and they have believed that You did send Me. I pray for them: I
   pray not for the world, but for them which You have given Me; for they
   are Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I am
   glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in
   the world, and I come to You, Holy Father. Keep through Your own name
   those whom You have given Me, that they way be one, as We are. While I
   was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name: those that You
   gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son ofperdition;
   that the Scripture might be fulfilled. Christ always has kept His
   people! He still keeps His people and He will keep His people forever!
   The sheep shall be delivered into the hands of the Father in full
   number--there shall not be one of them missing in that day when they
   shall pass under the rod of the Great Shepherd. We cannot read all this
   prayer of our Lord, tonight. We must now go, in the language of the
   next chapter, with the Master into the garden of His grief.

   John 18:1. When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His
   disciples over the brook Kidron. A dark, foul brook through which
   flowed the blood and refuse from the Temple. King David crossed that
   brook one night in bitter sorrow--and now the Savior crossed it when it
   was near to midnight--"He went forth with His disciples over the brook

   Kidron."

   1-2. Where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His disciples.
   And Judas, also, which betrayed Him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes
   resorted there with His disciples. Our Lord went there to pray and
   Judas knew that this was His custom. Are we such men of prayer that
   others know where we pray? Have you some familiar place where you go to
   meet your Lord? I am afraid that many know where we trade and many know
   where we preach but, perhaps, few know where we pray. God grant that we
   may be often at the Mercy Seat! We would be better men and women if we
   were more frequently at the Throne of Grace.

   3. Judas, then, having received a band of men and officers from the
   chiefpriests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and
   weapons. "Lanterns" to give light to the Sun! "Torches" to discern the
   Light of the World! "Weapons" with which to fight with the Lamb of God,
   the unarmed Sufferer! Strange treatment, this, for Him who came to save
   and bless!

   4. 5. Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that should came upon Him,
   went forth and said unto them, Whom do you seek? They answered Him,
   Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am He. Or, "I Am." It is
   remarkable that Jesus should, in His betrayal, twice use this
   expression, thus uttering the very name of Jehovah!

   5. And Judas, also, which betrayed Him, stood with them. What a
   hardened wretch he must have been, to be able to stand with them! One
   would have thought that, having betrayed his Master, he would have
   hidden himself away for shame, but no, "Judas, also, which betrayed
   Him, stood with them." His heart must have been steeled.

   6. As soon, then, as He had said unto them, I am He, they went backward
   and fell to the ground. Christ's Almighty Power cast them down at once!
   He needed not to lift His hand or even His finger--He only said, "I am"
   and, "they went backward and fell to the ground."

   7. Then asked He them, again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of
   Nazareth. Do they return to the fray? Having once felt Christ's Divine
   Power, do they summon courage enough to attack Him again? Yes, for
   there is no limit to the malice and impudence of the human heart!

   8-10. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He: if, therefore, you
   seek Me, let these go their way: that the saying might be fulfilled,
   which He spoke, Of them which You gave Me have I lost none. Then Simon
   Peter--Always ready to boil over. Always full of zeal and rash
   impetuosity, Peter--

   10. Having a sword, drew it and struck the High Priest's servant and
   cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Mal-chus. Peter struck at
   his head--he was not content with trying to wound--he meant to kill
   Malchus. But he, "cut off his right ear."

   11-14. Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath:
   the cup which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it? Then the
   band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound Him,
   and led Him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas,
   which was the High Priest that same year. Now Caiaphas was he which
   gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die
   for the people. Saying a great deal more than he thought he was saying,
   for he uttered a great Gospel Truth when he said, "It was expedient
   that one man should die for the people."

Blood Even on the Golden Altar

   (No. 2369)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 15, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   6, 1888.

   "And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
   of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the Tabernacle of the
   Congregation." Leviticus 4:7.

   ALL through Holy Scripture you constantly meet with the mention of
   "blood." "Without shedding of blood is no remission." "The blood of
   Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin." "You were not
   redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
   conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the
   precious blood of Christ." The word, "blood," is recorded over and over
   again, and if any complain of the preacher that he frequently uses this
   expression, he makes no kind of apology for it--he would be ashamed of
   himself if he did not often speak of the blood! The Word of God is as
   full of references to blood as the body of a man is full of life and
   blood.

   But what does, "the blood," mean in Scripture? It means not merely
   suffering, which might very well be typified by blood, but it means
   suffering unto death. It means the taking of a life. To put it very
   briefly, a sin against God deserves death as its punishment, and what
   God said by the mouth of the Prophet Ezekiel still stands true, "The
   soul that sins, it shall die." The only way by which God could fulfill
   His threatening sentence and yet forgive guilty men was that Jesus
   Christ, His Son, came into the world and offered His life instead of
   ours. His life, because of the dignity of His Person, and the majesty
   of His Nature, was so vast in its value that He could give it not only
   for one man, but for the whole multitude of men who should believe in
   Him! Now, that by which men are saved is the suffering of Jesus Christ
   even unto death, as Peter writes, "Christ, also, has once suffered for
   sins, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." Paul
   puts it, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made
   a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is everyone that hangs on a
   tree." And again, "He has made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him."

   All the sacrifices under the Law of God, when their blood was poured
   out, were typical of the life of Christ given for men as a Sacrifice in
   the place of those who had offended unto death against the Law of God
   and, therefore, were doomed to die. You who hear me constantly know
   very well what I mean. Have I ever given any uncertain sound about this
   great central Truth of God? There is no way of salvation under Heaven
   but by faith in the Substitutionary Sacrifice of Jesus Christ! And the
   way by which we are redeemed from eternal wrath is by Christ having
   stood as Substitute for us and having died in our place, as it is
   written, "The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His
   stripes we are healed."

   It is worthy of note that in the death of Christ, the shedding of blood
   was made very conspicuous, as if to refresh our memories about the
   teaching of the types of the Mosaic Law. Jesus was scourged unto
   bleeding. His temples were pierced and lacerated with a crown of
   thorns. His hands and feet were nailed with iron to the Cross. His side
   was opened by the soldier's spear and forthwith there flowed blood and
   water. There are many ways by which men may die without the shedding of
   blood--the capital punishment of our own country is free from this
   accompaniment--but our Savior was ordained to die by a death in which
   the shedding of blood was conspicuous, as if to link Him forever with
   those sacrifices which were made as types and symbols of His great
   atoning work! My dear Brother, Mr. Pearce, in his prayer, seemed to set
   forth Christ evidently crucified among you. I wish that even though you
   have to use your imaginations a little, you would think that you see
   Jesus on the Cross. Picture Him here, tonight, and lovingly watch Him.
   You will need few words from me if you do but catch sight of Him.
   Behold your Savior pouring out His life's blood that He might bear your
   guilt away, dying for you that you might live forever!

   In the verse before our text we read that the priest was to take of the
   blood of the bullock of the sin offering and sprinkle it seven times
   "before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary." The veil concealed
   the inner dwelling place of God and this veil was to be sprinkled seven
   times, that is, perfectly. There was to be a perfect presentation of
   the precious blood before the place where God was concealed. After that
   was done, the priest was to take some of the blood of the bullock and
   smear with it the four horns of the golden altar which stood just in
   front of the veil, and near the golden candlesticks. This altar was
   intended for the burning of sweet incense upon it and the priest was to
   smear with blood the four horns of it. What was meant by that act? Let
   me read the text again and then at once seek to explain it. "The priest
   shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet
   incense before the Lord."

   I. My first observation is this--THE ATONEMENT WAS PRESENTED WITH A
   VIEW TO THE LORD.

   Have you not often heard it said that all the Atonement accomplished
   was something in relation to us? We think upon the death of Christ and
   it stirs our affections, but some teachers say that is the only
   result--it brings us to God, but it does not bring God to us! That is
   what they say, but when we turn to Holy Scripture we find that the
   blood shedding was with reference to God, Himself, as well as with
   reference to us, because in the text it is distinctly said, "The priest
   shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet
   incense before the Lord."

   Its place was where the Lord would especially see it. I would like the
   young people, when they get home, to take a pencil and mark in the
   first chapters of the Book of Leviticus how often the expression is
   used, "before the Lord." The bringing of the bullock, the killing of
   the sacrifice, the sprinkling of the blood--all was to be done, "before
   the Lord." Whether any man saw it or not, was of small account, for it
   was, "before the Lord." True, it was done in the presence of the
   congregation, but it is specified over and over, again, that it was,
   "before the Lord." I would remind you that in the memorable type of the
   paschal lamb, the Lord gave special instructions as to where the blood
   was to be sprinkled. Was it to be within the house? Remember that all
   the people were inside the house--on the Passover night there was not a
   man outside! Where, then, was the blood put? Upon the interior walls of
   the house where they could see it? Might it not tend to comfort them if
   they could look upon it? That was not the Lord's plan--the blood was
   not put where the people could see it--it was sprinkled outside the
   house! And the Inspired account tells us that the Lord, Himself, said
   to Moses and Aaron, "And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on
   the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses...and when
   I see the blood, I will pass over you." It was put where God could see
   it, and, as if to show that that was the main point, it was put where
   the people could not see it--that it might be distinctly said to them,
   "It is, after all, God's sight of the great sacrifice which saves you."

   Next, the place of the blood is where the Lord sees it in reference to
   us. Understand where the Lord sees it with reference to us. They charge
   us with teaching that the Atonement in some way changes the Nature of
   God. We have never said so and we never dreamed anything of the kind!
   Above all things, we have always taught that God is Immutable and
   cannot be changed either in His Nature or in His purpose. They tell us
   that we teach and, they tell others that we teach, that the Sacrifice
   of Christ was offered to make God love His people. We have, over and
   over and over again, denied this, and declared that--

   "'Twas not to make Jehovah's love

   Towards the sinner flame,

   That Jesus, from His Throne above,

   A suffering Man became!

   'Twas not the death which He endured,

   Nor all the pangs He bore,

   That God's eternal love procured,

   For God was love before."

   Christ in His Sacrifice is the result of God's love, not the cause of
   it! Yet, dear Friends, we do confess, without any hesitation, to this
   fact, that the death of Christ has a reference to God's dealing with us
   in this way--the claims of Divine Justice must be met. The Judge of all
   the earth must do right and He cannot suffer sin to go unpunished! Our
   own conscience confirms that Truth of God--there is no sinner, even
   when he is most hardened, who deep down in his soul does not know that
   to be true! And when he lies dying, it causes him great trouble to
   think that he is going where God must visit his sin upon him!

   Now, what Christ has done is this--the Father has given us, in Christ,
   that which satisfies the claims of Infinite Justice. God can be just
   and yet the Justifier of him that believes. Executing the death penalty
   upon our Surety, He declares that whoever believes on Him shall not
   perish, but have everlasting life! Oh, dear Friends, it is God's
   looking on and seeing in His Son the vindication of His law, the
   honoring of His holiness--it is this which is the very essence of
   Christ's Sacrifice as to its result upon us!

   I believe that the great Lord, the just Judge of all, looks on Jesus
   Christ with extreme delight as having suffered for His people. He sees
   in the sufferings of Christ the honoring of His own holiness. Jesus
   loved holiness so much that He would sooner die than that holiness
   should be impugned. He was so true, so upright, so just, that He would
   rather suffer to the death on the tree than that God should, in the
   least degree, violate His Word, or infringe His Justice. The Father
   looks on Christ's great Sacrifice and He takes great delight in it
   because He sees in it His own holiness honored and glorified!

   And what a delight He must take in the love of Christ when He sees that
   Jesus loved us with a love which many waters could not quench, and
   which death, itself, could not drown! The great Father looks to the
   death of Christ and sees Christ's love triumphant on the tree, and He
   is charmed with it. I do not think that you and I can ever tell what
   pleasure the Father has in the finished work and Sacrifice of His dear
   Son. We read that He "smelled a savor of rest" in what was only a
   typical sacrifice--but what a savor of rest must the great heart of the
   Infinite Jehovah find in the Infinite Sacrifice of His Well-Beloved!
   You look upon it with bleared and bedimmed eyes, yet you see enough to
   make you wonder and adore. But what does God see in the Atonement of
   Jesus? Ah, Beloved, we cannot fully answer you, but we know that He
   sees there that which He eternally looks upon with infinite complacency
   and, for the sake of it, He looks upon us, poor guilty ones as we are,
   with complacency, too! He loves us because of what Christ has done in
   reference to us!

   That is my first remark and though I have but feebly set it forth, yet,
   Beloved, it is a great and glorious Truth of God! The Atonement has a
   bearing towards the Lord, Himself, and, therefore, in this ancient
   type, the blood was smeared upon the altar of sweet incense before the
   Lord.

   II. But now, secondly, coming to the very heart of the text--THE
   ATONEMENT GIVES POWER TO THE ITER-CESSION OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.

   That altar of sweet incense was the type of Christ pleading for men,
   making intercession for the transgressors. The horns of the altar
   signify the power of His intercession and the power of Christ's
   intercession lies in His Sacrifice--lies in the blood. If I might be
   allowed to picture such a scene, I seem to see the Divine Son pleading
   with His Father and He pleads the merit of His own blood.

   The Father sees it, first, as a reason why the Son should plead with
   Him, for the blood shows His nearness of kin to man. Has Jesus blood?
   "Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He,
   also, Himself, likewise took part of the same." Here is the token to
   His Father that He is truly Man! Here is the sure testimony of His
   identification with His people for whom He makes intercession! The mark
   is made by His own blood upon the horns of the altar and its presence
   there proves that He is qualified to plead for men, seeing that, while
   He is God, His blood shows that He is evidently also Man!

   I hear Him begin to plead and if Justice would stay Him and say, "How
   can You plead for the guilty? Before this Great White Throne, unsullied
   by a stain, how can You ask that God should bless the impure and foul?"
   Jesus points to His own blood as the token of His removal of impeding
   sin. "The Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world," has taken
   it away by the shedding of His own blood! "The blood of Jesus Christ,
   His Son, cleanses us from all sin." "Hear Me, My Father," He cries,
   "hear My plea on behalf of the penitent sinner! I have put away his
   sin. Answer My prayer and bless him, for I have taken away the sin that
   cursed him. I have borne its penalty and made expiation for it by My
   death."

   Do you not think, also, that this blood, which is the very power of
   Christ's intercession, signifies His fulfillment of Covenant
   engagements? We read of "the blood of the Everlasting Covenant." Jesus
   had engaged with His Father "to finish the transgression and to make an
   end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in
   everlasting righteousness," and He has done so! By His death, He could
   say, of His work as the Messiah, "It is finished!" By that death He had
   fulfilled His Suretyship engagement to His Father in connection with
   the Covenant of Grace and this, Beloved, is the very sinew of His
   strength in interceding for His people--this is the very essence of His
   pleading! He has done all that He

   agreed to do, therefore He asks the Father to fulfill His part of the
   Everlasting Covenant and to save the people redeemed by the blood shed
   on Calvary.

   And, it seems to me, that Christ also uses His blood as the great power
   of His pleading in His claim of reward. "Have I not died for My people?
   Then will You not let them live, O My Father? Behold, O Justice, with
   uplifted sword, if you seek Me, let these go their way." Jesus seems to
   say, "My Lord, My God, I have become Your Servant. I took upon Myself
   the form of a Servant and was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. And
   I have performed all the service You did lay upon Me. Reward Me, then,
   for all My toil. Let Me see of the travail of My Soul. Let Me be
   satisfied according to the promise which You did make to Me when I
   undertook this work."

   Do you not see, then, my Brothers and Sisters, that the blood on the
   horns of the altar means this--that Christ's blood is the very strength
   of His pleading with God? Because He died for guilty men, therefore,
   today, when He asks for the sinner's salvation, He will have it granted
   to Him, for the blood prevails with God, speaking better things than
   that

   of Abel!

   III. And now, in the last place, I want to say to you that THIS BLOOD
   GIVES ACCEPTANCE TO OUR WORSHIP.

   We bring to God sweet incense through Jesus Christ our Savior. Our
   prayers, our praises, our services are like the mixture of sweet
   perfumes which were burnt of old upon the altar before God. But it is
   the blood-mark on the altar that makes the incense acceptable. It is
   the atoning Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ that gives prayer,
   praise and service acceptance in the sight of God.

   In beginning to speak upon this point, I want you to notice that the
   blood is on the altar before we begin to pray. It was the blood that
   gave acceptance to the incense burnt upon the altar--it was not the
   stacte, onycha and galbanum--those, "sweet spices with pure
   frankincense," that, by themselves, ascended with fragrance unto the
   Lord. There must be the blood of the sacrifice sprinkled on the horns
   of the altar! What does this mean? Why, Beloved, that God accepts us in
   Christ because of Christ, Himself, and Christ, alone! It is true that
   we are to bring forth good works, for faith without works is dead.
   Still, the reason of our acceptance with God is not our good works, but
   Christ and His atoning Sacrifice, alone! As we come to Him, we sing--

   "Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling."

   Before you have performed a single work of holiness, before you have
   felt any of those sweet emotions which come out of the possession of
   Divine Love shed abroad in your heart, if you believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, you are accepted with God--Christ has saved you! Therefore is
   it that a man is justified by faith without works, for it is the faith
   that justifies him as it lays hold on Christ. There shall be an
   abundance of sweet spices on the altar, by-and-by, but apart from them,
   and before there has been a living coal smoking there, the altar has
   been consecrated unto God by the sprinkling of the blood of the
   Sacrifice! I like to think of that glorious fact! Let your good works
   be multiplied, but keep all of them at a distance from the Sacrifice of
   Christ! Never dream of adding them to Christ's Sacrifice to make it
   complete, for it is perfect without anything of yours. When you repent
   of sin, if you begin to trust in your repentance, away with your
   repentance! When you serve God, if you begin to trust in your service,
   away with it! Away with it! It becomes an antichrist if it takes the
   place that should be occupied by Jesus, only, for His precious blood,
   alone, can put away sin!

   But now I want you to note, dear Friends, that whenever you come to God
   with your worship, you must take care that you notice the blood on the
   altar, because it removes the sin of our worship. The best worship that
   we ever render to God is far from perfect. Our praises, ah, how faint
   and feeble they are! Our prayers, how wandering, how wavering they are!
   When we get nearest to God, how far off we are! When we are most like
   He, how greatly unlike He we are! This I know, that my tears need be
   wept over, and my faith is so mingled with unbelief that I have to
   repent of that sad admixture! Brothers and Sisters, keep your eyes
   fixed on the blood of Jesus! There is no prayer, no praise that can
   come before God, of itself, for it is so imperfect. Therefore, keep
   your eyes on the blood of Jesus, that even the sin of your holy things
   may be put away by the Sacrifice once offered on Calvary.

   Do you not think, also, that we would pray a great deal better if we
   thought more of the blood on the altar as our plea in prayer? I
   remember a Primitive Methodist Prayer Meeting at which a Brother could
   not get on with his supplication. He was very earnest and fervent, but
   he could not make any progress. He did not seem as if he had power to
   pray.

   He shouted, as Methodists do, but there is not much in that--yet he
   could not get on with real praying till a friend at the back end of the
   room cried out, "Plead the blood, Brother! Plead the blood!" He did so
   and then he began to pray with mighty power! Here lies the force of all
   your pleas in prayer--if you can plead for Jesus' sake and in His name,
   by His agony and bloody sweat, by His Cross and passion--then you have
   discovered the great secret of prevailing with God! Your hand is on the
   lever and you can move the world if you will!

   Should we not, also, make the precious blood of Jesus the highest note
   of our praises? When we are praising God, we think a great deal of the
   music. I do not blame anybody for doing that, especially if he is the
   leader of the Psalmody, but, Brothers and Sisters, we may come to think
   more of the melody and the harmony than we do of the heart and soul of
   praise! Keep your eyes on the crucified Christ and then sing as loudly
   as you like. Fix your gaze on those five precious wounds--they shall
   help you to praise Christ better than all the notes of the scales, for
   what higher note can we ever reach than this, "Unto Him that loved us,
   and washed us from our sins in His own blood"? Now you have sounded out
   the very highest note in the scale! Oh, the precious blood, the atoning
   Sacrifice, the great Substitution of our Lord Jesus Christ! The
   Hallelujah Chorus of all the redeemed shall have no nobler note than
   this, "He loved us and saved us. He loved us and died for us and we are
   washed in His blood."

   Let me here say that every sort of worship, not only prayer and praise,
   but every kind of worship that we can render to the Lord, will be
   acceptable with God in proportion as we exhibit, with it, the blood
   upon the altar. I find it a very sweet way of worshipping God to sit
   down and meditate. I hope you feel the same. You do not need any words
   at such seasons. You have been reading a chapter of the Bible and God
   has spoken to you and you, perhaps, have knelt in prayer and have
   spoken with Him. Now you sit down and meditate. I like to sit quite
   still and look up, or sit quite still with closed eyes, and just think.
   Now, the thinking, the meditating, the contemplation which will be best
   for you and most acceptable with God is that which keeps close to the
   Cross and near the precious sacrifice. Do you notice what holy men and
   women say when they come to die? You stand at their bedside and talk to
   them. If they are in any trouble and distress of conscience, what do
   they begin to talk about? Why, about the precious Sacrifice of Christ
   upon the Cross! It does not matter to what sect they belong, or to what
   denomination they have been joined in life--they always come back to
   this point at the last. There is no passing out of this life with
   comfort--there is no hope of entering into Heaven with delight--except
   as we are resting upon the precious blood of Christ!

   Ah, dear Friends, there may be some here who do not think much of this
   theme. There always were such. It is nothing to you that Jesus should
   die. But if there is anything that sanctifies, any Truth of God that
   digs deep into the heart and puts the Seeds of Life into the very
   center of our being--if there is anything that makes the Christian
   devout, humble, holy--it is the Doctrine of the Cross! I can almost
   gauge your piety to a certainty by what you think of the bleeding
   Savior. If He is nothing to you, you are not in the blessed secret. But
   if Jesus Christ is first and last with you. If you preach Christ
   crucified--if you love Christ crucified--in that proportion God dwells
   in you and you dwell in Him! This is not theory that I am talking--this
   is no Truth of God that lies upon the borders of the Christian religion
   and may, or may not be accepted! This is the very heart of the Gospel
   and if you take this away, you have killed it!

   You are no Christian if you disbelieve this Truth of God! If you are
   not saved by the precious blood of Christ, you are damned! There is but
   one gate of life and that is sprinkled with the blood of Christ. If you
   turn away from that door, you have chosen the broad road that leads to
   destruction. O you who feel your guilt, come to my Lord for pardon! O
   you who confess your sin, come to His blood for cleansing! It is still
   true that--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for you."

   How many years have I come to this pulpit, telling this old, old story,
   telling it very poorly and very imperfectly, and yet you are not tired
   of hearing it! Look how the crowds still throng this house! I might
   have given you some pretty novelties every now and then, but had I done
   so, I believe I would have lost you! But this old Truth of God, even if
   you do not accept it, commands your attention. You cannot help coming
   to hear it--oh, that you would also believe it! It has made me
   supremely happy. I was about to say that it has given me an angel's
   happiness and, sometimes, I could even say without exaggeration it
   gives me solid peace with which I can live, and with which, by-and-by,
   I hope to die!

   It enables me to stand alone against unnumbered foes and feel as happy
   as if everybody were with me, for, in this great Truth that Jesus died
   for me, that Jesus bore my sins in His own body on the tree, there is a
   rock beneath my feet!

   He who is on that rock may stand there and defy even death and Hell!
   Oh, that you would come and trust my Lord, you restless ones, you who
   do not know what peace means! Trust Him! Believe that He died for you!
   Trust Him and you shall have peace like a river--and righteousness like
   the waves of the sea!

   May we now come to the Communion Table thinking much of the precious
   blood once shed for many for the remission of sins!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Leviticus 16:1-31; Hebrews 9:1-22.

   Verse 1, 2. And the LORD spoke unto Moses after the death of the two
   sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died, and the
   LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron, your brother, that he come not
   at all times into the Holy Place within the veil before the Mercy Seat,
   which is upon the Ark, that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud
   upon the Mercy Seat. The way into the heavenly places was not yet made
   manifest. The inner shrine called the Holy of Holies, was specially
   guarded from human access. No one could have said, in those days, "Let
   us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace," for only the High Priest
   could approach the Mercy Seat at all--and he must go within the veil
   strictly in accordance with the instructions given to Moses by the
   Lord. Nadab and Abihu appear to have entered into the Presence of God
   wrongfully. They had probably been drinking, for there was a command,
   afterwards, given that no priest should drink wine or strong drink when
   he went into the House of the Lord. God, in His righteous anger, slew
   these young men at once and now, lest any others should intrude into
   the secret place of communion, a Law was given to tell when and how man
   might approach his God.

   3. Thus shall Aaron come into the Holy Place: with a young bullock for
   a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. There is no access to
   God except by sacrifice--there never was, and there never can be any
   way to God for sinful man except by sacrifice!

   4. He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
   breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen belt, and
   with the linen miter shall he be attired: these are holy garments;
   therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on. Our
   great High Priest offered Himself without spot to God and He is,
   Himself, without sin. But the Jewish High Priest must make himself
   typically pure by putting on the snow-white garments of holy service
   and, before doing so, he must wash himself with water, that he might
   come before God acceptably. None might approach the Holy God with
   impurities upon them.

   5. 6. And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel
   two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt
   offering. And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
   is for himself, and make an Atonement for himself, and for his house.
   These priests were sinful and, therefore, they must first, themselves,
   be purged from guilt before they could come near to God; but the true
   High Priest of God, our Lord Jesus, needed to offer no sacrifice for
   Himself, for He was pure and without blemish or stain or sin.

   7. And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at
   the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. These two goats were
   not for himself, but for the people. You must regard them as if they
   were but one offering, for it needed both of them to set forth the
   Divine Plan by which sin is put away--one was to die and the other was,
   typically, to bear away the sin of the people.

   8. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD,
   and the other lot for the scapegoat. One goat was to show how sin is
   put away in reference to God by sacrifice, and the other goat was to
   show how it is put away in reference to us, God's people, by being
   carried into oblivion.

   9-14. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell and
   offer him for a sin offering. But the goat on which the lot fell to be
   the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an
   Atonement with Him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the
   wilderness. And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering,
   which is for himself, and shall make an Atonement for himself, and for
   his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for
   himself: and he shall take a censer full of burning coals offire from
   off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense
   beaten small, and bring it within the veil: and he shall put the
   incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense
   may cover the Mercy Seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
   and he shall take of the blood of the bullock,

   and sprinkle it with his finger upon the Mercy Seat eastward; and
   before the Mercy Seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
   seven times. This was his first entrance within the veil, with holy
   incense to denote the acceptance which Christ has with God, though He
   is always well-beloved, dear and precious to His Father. This incense
   sent up a cloud that veiled the Glory of the Shekinah which shone
   between the two wings of the cherubim and so the High Priest was better
   able to bear the wondrous brilliance by which God revealed His
   Presence. When Aaron had thus filled the place with the
   sweetly-perfumed smoke, he took the blood of the bullock of the sin
   offering and carefully sprinkled it seven times on the Mercy Seat, and
   on the ground around the Mercy Seat. What a mercy it is for you and me
   that the spot where we meet with God is a place where the blood of the
   Great Sacrifice has been sprinkled, yes, and that the ground of our
   meeting with God, the place on which the Mercy Seat rests, also has the
   blood mark upon it!

   15. Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
   people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as
   he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the Mercy
   Seat, and before the Mercy Seat. Twice, you see, is the Holy Place thus
   sprinkled, first with the blood of the bullock and then with that of
   the goat.

   16. And he shall make an Atonement for the Holy Place because of the
   uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their
   transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the Tabernacle
   of the Congregation that remains among them in the midst of their
   uncleanness. If God is to dwell in the midst of sinful men, it can only
   be through the blood of the Atonement. Twice, seven times, were the
   Holy Place and the tabernacle to be sprinkled with blood, as though to
   indicate a double perfectness of efficacy of the preparation for God's
   dwelling among sinful men.

   17-19 And there shall be no man in the Tabernacle of the Congregation
   when he goes in to make an Atonement in the Holy Place, until he come
   out, and has made an Atonement for himself, and for his household, and
   for all the congregation of Israel. And he shall go out unto the altar
   that is before the LORD, and make an Atonement for it; and shall take
   of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it
   upon the horns of the altar round about. And he shall sprinkle of the
   blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow
   it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. Even this altar to
   which we bring our prayers and our thank offerings has sin upon it.
   There is some defilement, even, in the saltwater of our penitent tears!
   There is some unbelief, even, in our most acceptable faith! There is
   some lack of holiness about our holiest things! We are unclean by
   nature and by practice, too--what could we do without the sprinkling of
   the blood? See how the Lord insisted upon it in the case of His ancient
   people, yet there are some in these modern times who deride it. God
   forgive their blasphemy!

   20, 21. And when he has made an end of reconciling the Holy Place, and
   the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the
   live goat: and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
   goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
   and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the
   head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into
   the wilderness. Notice the, "all," in this 21st verse--"Aaron shall lay
   both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all
   the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions
   in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall
   send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness." This was
   the second part of the Atonement showing not sacrifice, but the effect
   of sacrifice, and explaining what becomes of sin after the sacrifice
   has been accepted and the blood has been presented within the veil.

   22-25. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
   land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. And
   Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation and shall put
   off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy
   Place, and shall leave them there: and he shall wash his flesh with
   water in the Holy Place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and
   offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and
   make an Atonement for himself, and for the people. And the fat of the
   sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. Only the fat of it, the best
   of it, was burnt upon the altar, for sin offerings were not acceptable
   to God. They were regarded as being filled with impurity by reason of
   the sin which they brought to mind. For this reason the bullock and the
   goat of the sin offering had to be burnt outside the camp--"Therefore
   Jesus, also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood,
   suffered outside the gate," as our Sin Offering. Yet, inasmuch as the
   fat was accepted upon the altar, so is Christ, even as our Sin
   Offering, acceptable before God.

   26, 27. And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
   clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the
   camp. And the bullock for the sin offering and the goat for the sin
   offering, whose blood was brought in to make Atonement in the Holy
   Place, shall one carry forth outside the camp; and they shall burn in
   the fire their skins, and their

   flesh, and their dung. All must be burnt--and the last is mentioned
   because it more strikingly sets forth the impurity of the sin connected
   with the sin offering! All must be burnt right up. There must not be a
   particle of the sin offering left unconsumed.

   28. And he that burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh
   in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. Everything that
   has to do with God's service must be clean and purified by fire, and
   purified by water. An Atonement cannot be made by that which is,
   itself, defiled--it must be without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing
   before it can put sin away. This is the virtue of Christ's Atonement,
   for He was altogether without sin of any kind.

   29-31. And this shall be a statute forever unto you: that in the
   seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your
   souls, and do no work at all, whether it is one of your own country, or
   a stranger that sojourns among you: for on that day shall the priest
   make an Atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from
   all your sins before the LORD. It shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you,
   and you shall afflict your souls, by a statute forever. This shows what
   sacred-ness the Lord attached to the great Day of Atonement and gives
   us more than a hint of the preciousness of our Lord's atoning work for
   us. Now let us turn to the Epistle to the Hebrews and see how the
   Apostle spiritualizes the services of the Mosaic dispensation.

   Hebrews 9:1 Then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of
   Divine service and a worldly sanctuary. An external sanctuary, a
   material structure and, therefore, belonging to this world.

   2. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
   candlestick, and the table, and the showbread: which is called the
   sanctuary. Or, "the Holy Place."

   3-8. And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
   Holiest of All; which had the golden censer, and the Ark of the
   Covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
   that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the Tables of the
   Covenant; and over it the Cherubims of glory shadowing the Mercy Seat;
   of which we cannot now speak particularly. Now when these things were
   thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle,
   accomplishing the service of God. But into the Second went the High
   Priest, alone, once every year, not without blood, which he offered for
   himself, and for the errors of the people: the Holy Spirit thus
   signifying that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made
   manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing. Notice
   especially those words, "Not without blood." There could be no approach
   to God under the old dispensation without the shedding of blood and
   there is no access to the Lord, now, without the precious blood of
   Christ.

   9-22. Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
   offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the
   service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; which stood only in
   meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed
   on them until the time of reformation. But Christ being come an High
   Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect
   tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,
   neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, He
   entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption
   for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
   heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the
   flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal
   Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
   dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause He is the
   Mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the
   redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament,
   they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
   For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of
   the testators. For a testament is offorce after men are dead: otherwise
   it is of no strength at all while the testator lives. Whereupon neither
   the first testament was dedicated without blood. For when Moses had
   spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took
   the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and
   hyssop, and sprinkled both the Book, and all the people, saying, This
   is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined unto you. Moreover
   he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the
   ministry. And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood; and
   without shedding of blood is no remission. That is the great Gospel
   Truth that was set forth by all the sacrifices under the Law of
   God--"without shedding of blood is no remission."

"Christ First, Me Last--Nothing Between But Love"

   (No. 2370)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, JULY 22, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 10,
   1888.

   "The faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me,"
   Galatians 2:20.

   Paul looks at the matter of salvation from the point of view suggested
   by Grace. If any man might have said, "The Son of God, whom I have
   loved, and to whom I have given myself," it would have been the
   Apostle. On another occasion, speaking of the Lord, he said, "Whose I
   am, and whom I serve." But here he thinks not of himself, or of what he
   had been led to do for the Lord, but only of what the Lord had done for
   him! He dug down to the foundation of salvation--he traced the stream
   of Grace back to the Fountainhead and, therefore, he spoke of "the Son
   of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

   You will not do wrong, my Beloved Friends, if you meditate on what the
   Grace of God has enabled you to do--if you do it humbly and if you
   praise God for it. I think that we sometimes forget to give Glory to
   the Lord for the sanctifi-cation we have already received. I have heard
   persons thank God for their health and for their wealth, but I have not
   so often heard them express gratitude for Divine Grace. I do not know
   that I wish to hear them praise God for their virtue, but still, if
   they have any, and they know that they have, let them praise God for
   it--for what virtue have they which they have not received? If you have
   any faith, if you have any hope, if you have any love--if there is any
   difference between you and your fellow men, if you possess anything by
   which God is glorified--you ought to thank Him for it and to praise and
   bless His holy name. Still, there would always be a tendency, in
   dwelling even on what we have done by the Grace of God, to begin to get
   unduly exalted and, on the whole, it is far wiser to think of what
   Christ has done for you than of what you have done for Him!

   I say, again, you may think of what you have done for Christ and give
   God the Glory for it, but it will not be well to dwell upon that
   thought to any great extent. I am sure it will not do to think upon it
   in the hour of deep distress of mind, or especially in the prospect of
   death. Then we gather up all our good works and throw them overboard!
   We look upon the best things that we have ever worked, even by the
   power of the Spirit of God, as quite secondary to what Christ has
   worked out for us and brought in and laid before His Father as the
   ground of our acceptance with Him.

   I like to think of our text and I invite you to think of it in the
   light of Free Grace. "Who loved me and gave Himself for me." I cannot
   preach much at this time, but I can talk to you a little of what I have
   tasted, handled and felt--and I pray the Holy Spirit to help you--not
   so much to hear the text explained, as to feel its gracious influence
   moving over your spirit and awakening in your heart happy memories of
   gratitude for blessings received.

   I. Our first division shall be THE FACT REMEMBERED--"Who loved me, and
   gave Himself for me."

   Paul speaks of it as a fact ascertainable and one which he had,
   himself, ascertained--that Jesus Christ loved him and gave Himself for
   him. He is not speaking, now, of the love of benevolence which the Lord
   Jesus Christ has towards all men, or even of that aspect of His work
   which bears upon every creature under Heaven. He is thinking of that
   special love, that discriminating Grace which had lighted upon him.
   That is the point around which our thoughts are to gather as we
   meditate upon Paul's words, "Who loved me, and gave Himself for me."
   The Apostle knew that Christ had loved him and had given Himself for
   him. And we, also, may know it. It is not necessary for us to go
   through life merely hoping and fearing, questioning and enquiring--we
   may come to the certain knowledge of the fact, if it is a fact, that we
   have an interest in the special love of Jesus Christ, that we are
   redeemed from among men, that we are called and separated to be the
   Lord's peculiar people, that each of us may be able to say of the Lord
   Jesus Christ--"Who loved me, and gave Him-

   self for me." I would not distress the mind of anyone who is feeble in
   faith and who is clinging to Christ, but has never, yet, received full
   assurance of salvation. But I would encourage such a person never to
   rest until he gets rid of all questions and is able to say without the
   slightest trepidation, "Who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

   Christ died to save sinners--the sinners who are saved by Him are those
   who trust Him. I trust Him, therefore He has saved me. This is a good,
   sound argument. "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life." I
   believe on Him, therefore I have everlasting life. This is solid ground
   to rest upon. "He loved me, and gave Himself for me," of which the
   evidence is that I trust Him. I rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no
   confidence in the flesh. To this will be added the evidences of a work
   of Grace in the heart. "We know that we have passed from death unto
   life, because we love the brethren." "One thing I know, whereas I was
   blind, now I see." We know this, also, by the witness of the Holy
   Spirit, for, "the Spirit, Himself, bears witness with our spirit that
   we are the children of God." And so, at last, we come to say with as
   much confidence as Paul, himself, could say it, "Who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me." Away, then, with all doubts and questions! Be gone,
   you evil birds that pollute the Sacrifice! By a simple childlike faith
   we come to Jesus and we take Him to be our Savior. We know that we
   cannot come to Jesus unless the Father, who sent Him, draws us.
   Therefore we know that we are drawn by Divine Grace and that He has
   loved us with an everlasting love, because with loving kindness He has
   evidently drawn us to Himself. So, you see, Paul is speaking of a fact
   that is ascertainable, and a fact that, in his own case, was
   ascertained. If we do not get to know it for ourselves, we cannot
   rejoice in it.

   Now just think for a few minutes of some well-known but very blessed
   Truths of God which gather about this fact-- "Who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me." And first, it is a Divine Love. Paul speaks of "the
   Son of God, who loved me." There are some persons who would be greatly
   delighted if they heard that some nobleman loved them! And if we were
   informed that some prince or princess loved us, we might feel ourselves
   elevated--yet there would be very little in it to make us proud. If we
   were informed that an angel loved us with all the great heart of an
   unfallen spirit, we might take comfort from the fact--but the text
   reminds us that it is the Son of God who has loved us! I cannot talk
   about this Divine Love as it deserves, but I want you to try and feel
   in your soul, "Jesus Christ loves me; not merely feeds me, thinks upon
   me, is favorably inclined to me, but He loves me."

   Love is a grand word, even in its silver use among men and women, but
   love in its golden use with God in Heaven, what does it not mean? Oh,
   marvelous, indeed, is the love of God towards His people! I say again
   that I cannot worthily speak of it--words seem such poor things to
   express the love of God. They break their backs in trying to convey the
   wondrous weight of meaning. If this love is shed abroad in your heart
   by the Holy Spirit, your heart's love will best read and understand
   this wondrous fact that the Divine Being, the Everlasting Father, and
   His ever-blessed Son, and the sacred Spirit, the great Trinity in
   Unity, loves you. Oh, delight yourselves in this glorious Truth! It is
   a sea of sweetness-- dive into it and be filled with it!

   The language of the text also suggests to me that I should remind you
   that the love of Jesus was an ancient love. It is true that He loves us
   now, but Paul also truly wrote, "Who loved me." The verb is in the past
   tense. Jesus loved me upon the Cross. He loved me in the manger of
   Bethlehem. He loved me before the earth was. There never was a time
   when Jesus did not love His people! "Before the earth was," I said just
   now, and I repeat it--He saw us in the glass of His eternal purposes,
   He foreknew us, He looked ahead and saw what we would be, who we would
   be and His love went forth to us before the day-star ever began to
   shine! Think of it--"The Lord has appeared of old unto me, saying, Yes,
   I have loved you with an everlasting love." That He should love us at
   all is a wonder. That He should have loved us always is a wonder of
   wonders! And this love is a part of His eternal purposes and is as old
   as His arrangements for the history of the universe. "Who loved me, and
   gave Himself for me." Truly, this was an ancient love!

   Note further that as this love was Divine and ancient, so it was a
   preeminently practical love--"Who loved me, and gave Himself for me."
   Jesus could not give any more than Himself. He not only gave His crown,
   His Throne, His Manhood, His life, His sufferings, His death, His
   offices, His excellences, His merits--He gave Himself, His Godhead, His
   Humanity! "Who loved me, and gave Himself for me." It is not possible
   for you to measure the unknown depths of Christ's sufferings, but if
   you could, you would not have arrived at, "Himself." It is not merely
   that which He did and said that Jesus gave for us--He gave Himself. It
   was not simply that which belonged to Him which Jesus handed over for
   us, but He gave Himself--"Who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

   O Beloved, I wish I had the strength and the ability to think and to
   speak to you upon this practical display of our Lord's love as it
   deserves, but I have not. Meditate upon it, I pray you. He gave Himself
   for you in the Everlasting Covenant when He stood as your Surety and
   Representative. He gave Himself for you through the long ages in which
   He waited to come to earth to redeem you. He gave Himself for you when
   He assumed your nature and became bone of your bone, and flesh of your
   flesh. He gave Himself for you through a life of toil and
   righteousness. He gave Himself for you as your Substitute when He, "His
   own self, bore our sins in His own body on the tree." In the scourging,
   the shame, the spitting, the bloody sweat, the Crucifixion, He gave
   Himself for you! Take these blessed words of the Apostle and put them
   in your mouth--and let them lie there as wafers made with honey till
   they melt into your very soul--"Who loved me, and gave Himself for me."
   In all these wondrous senses, keeping back nothing, reserving for
   Himself nothing, no, not even the name of Himself, He loved me, and
   gave Himself for me! Truly, this was practical love.

   And I may say of it, in the next place, that it was a love altogether
   immeasurable. If you measure a love by its gifts, you have certainly an
   immeasurable love, here, because it was proven by an immeasurable gift!
   The Nature of the Lord Jesus Christ is not to be comprehended. The
   wondrous union of Godhead and Manhood made Him, I was about to say,
   something more than God, for He had added to all the Infinity of His
   Godhead, the capacity to suffer as a Man. But He gave Himself at His
   utmost--the boundless, the inconceivable, the indescribable--He gave
   Himself for me! There is a limit to everything else, but not to the
   love of God. You say to the sea, "To here shall you come, but no
   farther," but you cannot say that to this boundless sea of Divine Love!
   You do not know by experience how much God loves you--you have only
   drunk a little of the sweetness of this wondrous well of Living
   Water--but you cannot tell the depth of it. There is no bottom to it!
   You cannot exhaust its supply--you may drink, and drink, and drink
   again, through a long life, yes, and throughout eternity you may go on
   receiving of this love, but you will never measure its heights, depths,
   lengths and breadths. That is quite beyond your power. You can only
   love, dear Mother, to a certain degree, though you love your child to
   the death. You can only love, dear Husband, up to a certain point,
   though you are willing to lay down your life to raise your spouse from
   a sick bed. But God stops nowhere in His love--it is as boundless and
   infinite as He is, Himself!

   Our Lord Jesus Christ cannot possibly or conceivably be limited in His
   love. I want you to try to get hold of this thought. Notice it. HE
   loved me! Such a one as He is, He loved me--

   "Christ first, me last--nothing between but love." Those words are very
   sweet to me. I read them somewhere and they cling to my memory. "Who
   loved me," the first word is, "who." The last word is, "me," and there
   is "nothing between but love." Oh, that is a blessed position for
   anyone to be in! Christ shall be first--I will be glad to be anywhere,
   to be nothing, to be last--so long as there shall be this sweet link of
   love between my soul and my Savior--"Who loved me and gave Himself for
   me."

   "WHO LOVED ME"

   GALATIANS 2:20

   Three blessed sunbeams, guiding all I see. Three tender chords, each
   full of melody. Three healing leaves, balm for my agony. HE loved
   me--the Father's only Son, He ga ve Himself--the precious, Spotless
   One-- He shed His blood and thus the work was done! HE LOVED, not
   merely pitied. Here I rest. Sorrow may come, I to His heart am
   pressed-- What should I fear while sheltered on His breast? Wonder of
   wonders! Jesus loved me! A wretch! Lost, ruined, sunk in misery! He
   sought me, bound me, raised me, set me free!

   My soul the order of the words approve Christ first, me last--nothing
   between but love. Lord, keep me always down--Yourself above! Trusting
   to You--not struggling restlessly So shall I daily gain the victory.
   "I"--"yet not I but Christ,"--WHO LOVED ME!]

   Let us reflect yet a moment further that this love is an abiding
   love--"Who loved me." But He is unchanging, so that He still loves me!
   He cannot love me more, He will not love me less. He has loved me at no
   period more than He loves me, now, and if just now I may be groaning
   because of my imperfections, and mourning because of my tribulations,
   yet He loved me so as to give Himself for me--and He has never abated
   from that love and He never will! It is a very fine thing, no doubt, to
   have worldly substance, but it melts like the hoar frost in the sun. It
   is a very great mercy to have bodily health, but how small a thing soon
   takes it away and turns the joy of life into the shadow of death! But
   if you get this love of Christ, you have a treasure which can never be
   lost, a blessing that will never be exhausted. "Who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me!" Sit down, dear child of God, and say to yourself,
   "Here I have something which I shall never lose. It cannot be taken
   from me. Oh, that by Grace I may be enabled to rejoice in it and to
   return the love of my poor heart to Him who ceases not to love me!"

   There is a great deal that might be said of such a Savior as this, but
   I feel a consolation in my heart in being unable to say any new and
   fresh thing, tonight, for the subject, in itself, ought to be to you
   full of joy. And if your heart is right, it will be. If your heart is
   not right with God, you will be craving for fine expressions and pretty
   phrases. Judge your own spiritual condition, then, by this test--does
   this theme, in itself, touch you? "Who loved me, and gave Himself for
   me!" I will use it as a thermometer and drop it into your heart to see
   the warmth of your affection to Christ. If you are as you should be,
   full of a devout attachment to Him, you will say, "Yes, that is all I
   need to feel and know--He loved me, and gave Himself for me!"

   So much, then, upon the fact remembered.

   II. Now, secondly, Beloved Friends, let me speak to you for just a few
   minutes on THE FAITH CONFESSED. Paul says, "I live by the faith of the
   Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

   Observe, first, that the faith which made Paul live was faith in a
   Person--"the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself
   for me." Possibly, some of you are trying to get faith and yet you do
   not know what saving faith is. You have heard a great deal about it,
   but it is an astonishing thing that the best definition of faith in the
   world does not make men see what faith is! The gas may be very bright,
   but a man who is blind does not see any better because of the
   brilliance of the light. The eyes of our soul must be opened if we are
   to see what faith is.

   Now, saving faith is faith in a Person, faith in the living, loving
   Lord who gave Himself for us. Do you believe in Jesus Christ? I do not
   merely mean, do you believe in His teachings? You must believe in them.
   But to be saved you must believe in Him, "who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me." There He stands--my faith seems to see Him, even now,
   at the right hand of God, risen from the dead and gone into Glory--and
   I come and trust Him and take Him to be my Savior. If He is my Savior,
   it is His business to save me. I am not to save myself. I put myself
   into His hands that He may keep me. I bring my foul self to Him, that
   He may cleanse me--my dead self to Him, that He may quicken me--my
   naked self to Him, that He may clothe me. I bring my good-for-nothing
   self to Him that He may be precious to me and that I may be made
   precious in Him! He is to be everything to me! It is not merely what I
   read about Him that I am to believe, but I am to trust Him. Now,
   Beloved, let those of us who have believed in Jesus long ago exercise
   that faith afresh in this gracious loving way by now living by faith
   upon the Son of God, who loved us, and gave Himself for us.

   This faith, you perceive, is a faith in a clear and distinct fact--"the
   faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me." To go,
   again, over the sacred ground on which we trod just now, the Apostle
   does not say, "I have faith in the Son of God, of whom I hope that He
   loved me." He knows it! He is sure of it and there is no comfort to
   come out of faith until it learns to speak without stammering--and to
   say of the Lord Jesus, "who loved me, and gave Himself for me." This
   either is a fact, or it is not, and if it is a fact, full of every
   consolation, why should I not know it? Ought you to give sleep to your
   eyes until you know that He loves you and that you are His? This can be
   proven, as I have already shown you. He that believes in Jesus has the
   sure token of Divine Love. If you trust Him, trust Him wholly and
   alone,

   then He loved you and gave Himself for you--for you the manger at
   Bethlehem, for you the Cross at Calvary, for you the empty sepulcher,
   for you His pleading before the eternal Throne--He loved you, and gave
   Himself for you, and it is for your faith to learn to speak this great
   Truth of God plainly!

   This faith was, next, an appropriating faith--"Who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me." No faith except a personal faith will save the soul.
   Another man's faith will not save me. I must have a Christ of my own.
   The love that Christ has to others is pleasant to reflect upon, but it
   cannot give me peace. It must be love which He has to me if it is to
   save me-- "Who loved me, and gave Himself for me." Somebody says that
   such a desire as that is selfish. I answer that it is nonsense to talk
   so! A wife is not thought to be selfish because she rejoices in her
   husband's love. A child is not selfish because he is happy in his
   father's love. How, dear Friends, can I take any joy in the love of
   Christ to men in general, if I have no sense, whatever, of His love to
   me? Of what use could it be to me? In order that I may love my fellow
   men, I must first come to know that Christ loves me. How can I have a
   blessing in the saving of the souls of others if my own soul is not,
   first, saved? Let your religion begin at home--and when you make sure
   of its presence there, then you may sing--

   "Now will I tell to sinners round What a dear Savior I have found."

   It would be a poor occupation to go out and tell them of a dear Savior
   that you had not found, to tell them of manna that you had never
   gathered and of waters of which you had never drunk! No, in order to be
   truly useful in the Lord's service, you must, first of all, know in
   your own experience the truth of Paul's words, "Who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me." Our text is the language of faith. Unbelief says,
   "Yes, Christ is very loving," but if you have true faith, you will say,
   "He loved me." Unbelief says, "I know that Christ loves His people, but
   I am afraid that He would never love me." Such talk as this is
   mistrustful and ruinous to the soul! But Faith, as soon as it opens its
   mouth, begins to make a personal appropriation of the blessings of the
   Grace of God. What do you do when you come to the Communion Table? Do
   you come there to see other people eat bread and drink wine? No, but in
   Communion, you, each of you, eat, and each of you drink--that is the
   very essence of Communion. So must each of you take Christ to be yours,
   personally, and say, "He loved me, and gave Himself for me." This is
   the faith which is mentioned by the Apostle--an appropriating faith.

   And as I read the text, it looks to me as if it was a faith full of
   wonderment. Though the Apostle speaks of it as a matter of fact, yet he
   seems to be much astonished, as he says, "Who loved me, and gave
   Himself for me." I am sure that if the Lord will put into your soul a
   sense of the love of Christ, it will ravish your heart and it will
   carry you away with astonishment. You will go home and say to yourself,
   "The greatest wonder in the two worlds of Heaven and earth is this,
   that He loved me, and gave Himself for me!" And in consequence you will
   be filled with holy joy and rejoicing. "He loved me, and gave Himself
   for me," will ring like marriage bells in your heart! Not all the harps
   of Heaven can sound out sweeter music than this text when the Holy
   Spirit speaks it to our soul, "the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
   Himself for

   me."

   III. I must not tarry longer on this sweet theme, but must finish with
   this point--THIS FAVOR ENJOYED. There is a certain power that lies in
   this fact, remembered, and that grows out of this faith, confessed.
   Paul says that he lived by the faith of the Son of God who loved Him,
   and gave Himself for him.

   Beloved Friends, a sense of the love of Christ to you, personally, will
   affect your whole life. It will change it, at first, but it will keep
   it changed ever afterwards, and it will go on increasing in its power
   over you till, when you fully know it, every thought, every word and
   every action will seem to be set in the key of love--"who loved me, and
   gave Himself for me." That religion which does not affect the whole
   life is a dead and worthless religion, but this essence of our holy
   faith, "who loved me, and gave Himself for me," is Divinely operative
   upon the entire man. Alone, or with others in the family, or in the
   business, whatever his calling is, this will tincture it all with a
   heavenly sweetness, "who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

   And this will be particularly seen in the relieving of your griefs.
   Full of pain, you will say to yourself, "Yet He loved me. He has not
   sent this pain for nothing. He does not afflict willingly, for He loved
   me and gave Himself for me." If you are very poor, you will say to
   yourself, "He gave the riches to Dives, but Lazarus lay in His bosom.
   He loved me, and gave Himself for me, and that is better than wealth."
   And if ever you come to be despised for His sake, and men cast out your
   name as evil, you will say, "I do not mind it at all. I can even
   rejoice in it, for He loved me, and gave Himself for me!

   And I may well give up myself, my reputation and everything else for
   Him." Sorrow ceases to be sorrow when once there is in the heart a
   sweet sense of the infinite love of Christ!

   This thought will also help you in your labor. When you have something
   to do for Jesus that rather tries you. When you feel disappointed and
   baffled and the devil tempts you to give it all up and run away, you
   will say to yourself, "How can I? He loved me, and gave Himself for
   me." By Gethsemane and Calvary you will bind yourself to the sternest
   labor for His dear sake. Nothing is too hot or too heavy for a man
   whose heart is on fire with Divine Love! When the torrents of love
   sweep through the soul, then every obstacle is overcome. I can go as a
   missionary to the Congo and joyfully die in that malarious climate when
   I know that He loved me, and gave Himself for me! I can try to preach
   in the streets of London amid the jeers and the noise of the passers-by
   when I know that He loved me, and gave Himself for me! You will go
   cheerfully to the slums, you will visit the lodging houses, you will
   teach the ignorant, you will look after the foul and the depraved when
   you get this Truth of God impressed on your heart--"He loved me, and
   gave Himself for me."

   And, Beloved Friends, this will help you in prayer. When you are at the
   Mercy Seat, tremblingly asking for some great favor, tempted to fear
   that you will not receive it--your faith will become very strong when
   you hear the whisper, "who loved me, and gave Himself for me." He that
   spared not Himself, how shall He not give me all things? We ask with
   great confidence and assurance when we feel the force of this blessed
   Truth of God.

   By-and-by we shall come to die. I am constantly reminded of this fact.
   During the last two or three weeks we have lost more friends than I
   remember being taken away in a similar period at almost any other time.
   We are getting old, together, and so there are more dying than there
   used to be when the young people first joined the Church. Well, I shall
   soon be going and so will you, but we shall not dread the grave, for
   Jesus loved us, and gave Himself for us! Will He not be with me even in
   my last moments? Certainly He will! I shall not dread the terrors of
   the Great Judgment Day, for, "He loved me, and gave Himself for me."
   Who is He that condemns, now that Christ has died, and risen again, and
   sits at the right hand of God to plead for us? The terrors of the world
   to come, the quivering earth, the burning sky, the falling stars--all
   these will cause no perturbation of mind when we are fully assured that
   He loved us, and gave Himself for us.

   Thinking of this sublime passage, one seems to feel his wings growing
   and is ready to take flight to the upper sky, for what, even in Heaven,
   is there brighter or more blessed than this Jesus, "who loved me, and
   gave Himself for me"? Is not this Heaven's own song, "Unto Him that
   loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood"?

   O my dear Hearers, I stand here and try to talk to you in my feeble way
   about these great Truths of God, but do you know them yourselves? If
   you do, you know more than Solomon ever knew! If you know this love of
   Christ, you know more than all the Greek philosophers put together! You
   need not be ashamed in any company--the knowledge of the love of Christ
   is the most excellent of all the sciences--there is none that can be
   compared with it. But if you do not know it, I pray my Lord, in His
   infinite mercy, to disturb and disquiet you until you do know it! What
   right have you to rest without faith in Jesus? You have no
   safety--indeed, you have no hope! Without God, without Christ, you will
   die without forgiveness or hope of Heaven! God bring you to seek His
   face tonight, before another sun has risen! Seek Him. Seek Him! Trust
   in the Savior's finished work and I hope we shall yet see you, again,
   as you come forward and say, "Yes, He loved me, and gave Himself for
   me, and here am I to confess it to the glory of His Grace." God grant
   it, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK"-116 (SONG II), 248, 731.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Galatians 2:16-21; 3.

   Galatians 2:16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the work of the
   Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus
   Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
   the works of the Law: for by the works of the Law shall no flesh be
   justified. This is the primary Truth of God to be proclaimed by the
   Christian ministry. It is the foundation stone of all Gospel preaching
   and yet, somehow or other, such is the hardness of the human heart,
   that it is the most difficult thing to induce our hearers to build on
   this foundation. Many of them are always trying to lean upon their own
   works and so struggling to get back under the old legal dispensation,
   instead of rejoicing in the lib-

   erty of the dispensation of Grace. One objection to the Doctrines of
   Grace rather than the Doctrine of Law is this, that some think it will
   lead to sin. The Apostle puts it thus--

   17. But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are
   also found sinners, is, therefore, Christ the minister of sin? God
   forbid! For the tendency of the Gospel of Grace is to excite gratitude
   in those who receive it. If I am freely pardoned, then I must love Him
   who has thus generously forgiven me. Gratitude is the root of true
   virtue and the mainspring of all holiness. If there are base-minded men
   who can suck poison out of this honeycomb, is Christ to be blamed for
   their evil doing? God forbid! But if, on the other hand, you and I go
   back to trusting in works, then we are, indeed, guilty in the sight of
   God.

   18. For if I build, again, the things which I destroyed, I make myself
   a transgressor. If I once said I would not trust in my good works and
   now go back to trust in them, I have already, whatever may be my
   outward conduct, perpetrated a great sin!

   19. 20. For I, through the Law, am dead to the Law, that I might live
   unto God. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
   but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
   live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for
   me. I do not know a better epitome of Christian experience than this.
   This is the daily walk of a true child of God. If he lives after any
   other sort, then he lives not a Christian's life at all! Christ living
   in us, ourselves living upon Christ and our union to Christ being
   visibly maintained by an act of simple faith in Him--this is the true
   Christian's life.

   21. I do not frustrate the Grace of God: for if righteousness comes by
   the Law, then Christ is dead in vain. If a man can be saved by his own
   works, and willings, and doings, then Christ's death was an unnecessary
   piece of torture and, instead of being the most glorious manifestation
   of Divine Love, it was a shameful waste, putting upon Christ a terrible
   burden of suffering which was totally unnecessary.

   Galatians 3:1. O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you
   should not obey the Truth of God, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has
   been evidently set forth, crucified among you? These Galatians thought
   that they were very philosophical and very intellectual, but the
   Apostle says, "O foolish Galatians!" They thought that they had been
   led by reason and guided by the learning of their teachers--but Paul
   calls it witchery--"Who has bewitched you?" he asks, as if anything
   which led a man to trust in his own works should be as much abhorred as
   the incantations of a witch! "Who has bewitched you?" It is a dangerous
   state, it is a devilish snare to be brought into--to be led to trust to
   frames, feelings, experiences, works, prayers, or to anything else but
   Christ! It is a strange thing that those who have seen Christ should
   ever go back to these things! Lord, keep us every day, among our other
   sins, from our own self-righteous nature! Now the Apostle is going to
   reason with the Galatians against their self-righteousness.

   2. This, only, would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the
   works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? "You know that the Spirit
   of God is necessary to salvation. You have received that. Did you get
   the Spirit through the works of the Law, or by simply hearing the
   Gospel and believing it?" The answer comes at once if we have received
   the Spirit! It was by the hearing of faith and not by the works of the
   Law.

   3. Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now made
   perfect by the flesh? Surely, the way in which the Christian life
   begins is the method in which it is to be sustained. "As you have
   received Christ Jesus, the Lord," the Apostle says in another place,
   "so walk in Him." If you have begun in the flesh, go on in the flesh,
   but if you really know that your beginning was in the Spirit, then do
   not go back to the flesh.

   4. Have you suffered so many things in vain? If it is yet in vain. This
   is another pertinent question.

   5. He, therefore, that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles
   among you, does he do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of
   faith? They had miraculous gifts among them as a Church and the Apostle
   asks them whether these were works of the Law, or whether they were not
   exercised as the result of faith. The answer is clear. It was the
   believing man who worked the miracle, not the self-righteous man! Paul
   is now going to take the Galatians far back in Jewish history.

   6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
   righteousness. He was not saved by his works, but by his faith. His
   faith was the means of the imputation to him of the righteousness of
   the Savior who was yet to come.

   7. Know you, therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the
   children of Abraham. He was called the father of the faithful,
   therefore the faithful, those who believe as he did, and are full of
   his faith, are his children.

   8-10. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
   through faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you
   shall all nations be blessed. So, then, they which are offaith are
   blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the
   Law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is everyone that
   continues not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to
   do them. Now, if everyone who has once violated God's Law is cursed
   forever, how mad are those who hope to enter Heaven by that very Law
   which is the gate to shut them out! How dare they confide in that which
   is their worst enemy--which is sworn to curse them in time and in
   eternity!

   11. But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God, it is
   evident: for, The just shall live by faith. Scripture lays it down as a
   rule that justified men live by faith! If this is the rule, then
   certainly they should not live by works.

   12. And the Law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live
   in them. So that the justified man is not justified by the Law, but by
   faith. He stands before God, not in what he does, not even in what the
   Spirit enables him to do! His own prayers, tears, communings with
   Christ. His own labors, his earnest and indefatigable attempts to
   extend the Kingdom of Christ--all count for nothing in the matter of
   his justification! He hangs them all upon the Cross of Christ and
   relies only upon the Cross, looking in no manner, whatever, to anything
   which comes of himself.

   13. 14. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a
   curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is everyone that hangs on a
   tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
   Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
   faith. We were all under the curse of the Law, but Christ voluntarily
   took our place and was made a curse for us, so that the blessing might
   be ours.

   15, 16. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men. Though it is but a
   man's covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds
   thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says
   not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which
   is Christ. Notice how important a single letter of the Scriptures may
   be! If vital Doctrine may depend upon the use of a singular or plural
   noun, therefore let us jealously guard the smallest jot or tittle of
   the Inspired Word of God.

   17-19. And this I say, that the Law, which was four hundred and thirty
   years later, cannot disannul the Covenant that was confirmed before by
   God in Christ, the Law, that it should make the promise of no effect.
   Or if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no more ofpromise: but God
   gave it to Abraham by promise. What purpose, then, does the Law serve?
   Some might argue that as the Law cannot justify, it is useless, but, on
   the contrary, it serves a very definite purpose, as Paul goes on to
   show.

   19-22. It was added because of transgressions till the seed should come
   to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand
   of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
   Is the Law, then, against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there
   had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteousness
   should have been by the Law. But the Scripture has concluded all under
   sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them
   that believe. Paul constantly comes back to this point, that salvation
   is all of Grace, through faith in Jesus Christ.

   23-25. But before faith came, we were kept under the Law, shut up under
   the faith which should afterward be revealed. Therefore the Law was our
   schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by
   faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
   schoolmaster. The Apostle is not speaking of a schoolmaster as we
   understand that word, but of the slave or servant who took the boys to
   school, watched over them in school and out, and even used the rod if
   occasion demanded.

   26. For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. The
   Fatherhood of God is common to all Believers-- but there is no
   universal fatherhood, as many teach it in these days.

   27-29. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
   Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
   there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
   And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs
   according to the promise. May this be true of all of us, for Christ's
   sake! Amen.

Freedom At Once and Forever

   (No. 2371)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 29, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   13, 1888

   "To proclaim liberty to the captives." Isaiah 61:1.

   I DO not know whether you generally read the daily newspaper. I think
   we might get up a "Society for the Suppression of Useless Knowledge." A
   great deal that appears in the newspapers amounts only to that--and
   much time is wasted reading the paper. But sometimes we get a gem among
   the news and, to my mind, there was a gem contained in a Reuter's
   telegram, from Rio Janeiro, May 10th--"The Brazilian Chamber of
   Deputies has voted the immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery
   in Brazil." My heart rejoiced as I read that paragraph! I hope it does
   not mean that this vote can be defeated in some other Chamber, or the
   abolition can be prevented by some other power. But if it means that
   slavery is to be immediately and unconditionally abolished in Brazil, I
   call upon you all to thank God and rejoice in His name! Wherever
   slavery exists, it is an awful curse, and the abolition of it is an
   unspeakable blessing. All free men should praise God and especially
   those whom Christ has made free, for they are, "free indeed."

   I am not going to preach about the slavery in Brazil and yet the
   message about its abolition will be a great part of my theme. There is
   another slavery, a slavery into which we were born, a slavery in which
   we have lived and, alas, a slavery under which some of us still smart.
   And Jesus Christ has come, as the Great Liberator, "to proclaim liberty
   to the captives." There is no question about that emancipation! It is
   not a Chamber of Deputies which has voted it and it is not a thing
   which may be thrown out by another parliamentary body. Jesus Christ,
   the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, has, Himself, come with Divine
   authority--authority never to be questioned or disputed--to proclaim
   liberty from the slavery of sin!

   When there was a royal proclamation to be made in the olden times, they
   used to employ men to go with trumpets through the streets of the city
   and to the villages and towns in the country, to summon the people to
   the market cross, to hear the king's message. That is what I am here
   for tonight--to sound the Gospel trumpet as best I can, and to make
   this proclamation--"O yes, O yes, in the name of the great King of
   Kings, there is liberty for the bond slaves of Satan, deliverance for
   those who are under captivity to sin." I am going to proclaim that good
   news with all my might and with joyful earnestness to tell the slaves
   of sin and Satan that there is liberty for them through the Great
   Emancipator, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!

   I. I shall begin by describing THE NATURE OF THIS LIBERTY. Let me turn
   to my newspaper paragraph again-- "The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies
   has voted the immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery in
   Brazil."

   So the proclamation which I have to make, tonight, concerns immediate
   liberation. You have been the slave of sin long enough! You need not be
   sin's slave any longer. Christ has not come to work out for you a
   deliverance which will take hours, days, weeks, or months to
   complete--He has come to knock your fetters off with a single stroke
   and to set you free at once! If His gracious power is manifested in
   this assembly, the former slave of sin will go out of the Tabernacle
   door free--not half-free, with one or two of his fetters broken--there
   shall be for him immediate liberty! It does not take any time to work
   in the human heart the great change which is called regeneration. There
   may be a great many things going before it and coming after it which
   take up much time, but to pass from death to life is the work of an
   instant! It must be so. If a man is dead and he is made alive, there
   can be no interval between the state of death and the state of life.
   There must be a second in which the transition takes place. When a
   blind man's eyes are opened, it may be that he does not see for some
   time very clearly, but there is an instant in which the first beam of
   light enters the eyes and falls

   upon the retina, and in which the eyes become conscious of the power of
   light. So, in a moment, while I am speaking, the Lord can save you! In
   an instant, you slaves of sin and Satan, He can make you free! It is
   the immediate abolition of slavery that I have to proclaim to you!

   I believe that, in Brazil, they have been trying a system of
   apprenticeship. It was the Emperor's intention--and God bless that
   Emperor--he thought that all slaves should be free, but he thought that
   a little time ought to be taken to prepare them for liberty, to educate
   them up to the state in which they could act as free men. So they were
   apprenticed and liberation came gradually to certain of them after a
   period of servitude. But this act of the Deputies, if it is really
   carried, is for immediate abolition and no apprenticeship. Now, I do
   not want any of you to be apprenticed, as it were, and to wait awhile
   before you get free! I know that, with regard to the slavery of
   drunkenness, men think that they will drink a little less, and a little
   less, and gradually give it up. Do not drink any at all! Have done with
   it right now--you ought not to need to have any apprenticeship to the
   evil thing! So is it with the lusts of the flesh--men suppose that they
   can gradually subjugate their passions and lift themselves out of that
   slavery. No, dear Sirs, it must be done at a stroke! And it will be if
   it is really done! You shall be immediately and on the spot set free!

   That poor creature who had left his father's house and went into a far
   country and reduced himself to such poverty that he was feeding
   swine--degrading work for a Jew to perform--how did he get back to his
   father? He said, "I will arise and go to my father. And he arose and
   went to his father." If he had stopped. If he had reasoned with his
   master. If he had said, "You must set me to feed sheep and not pigs."
   If he had asked for an increase of wages, he would have remained in the
   far country. He never gave his old master ten minutes' notice, but he
   ran to his father straight away. That is the only way to be saved--to
   run for it--just as Lot fled out of Sodom! There must be no hesitation,
   no staying, but an immediate, determined resolve to quit the dominions
   of sin and to fly to the shelter of God's Grace! O great King of Kings,
   may it be immediate liberation to many here, tonight, without any sort
   of apprenticeship! May they come to Christ and at once find liberty!

   There is a notion abroad that you cannot be sure that you are saved
   till you come to die. Is that the Gospel? Am I to proclaim liberty only
   to men who are about to die? I will preach no such Gospel! I come to
   proclaim, in my Master's name, immediate abolition, instantaneous
   pardon, a present change of heart, the breaking of the chain and
   setting the captive free at once! Do not believe that you are to go
   through all your life only hoping and fearing, doubting and hesitating.
   That is like the old Popish doctrine! But good, true, Protestant, Bible
   doctrine is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved." "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life." The moment
   you believe, you have it! You have passed from death unto life, and
   shall never come into condemnation! I am glad that I have to proclaim
   the immediate abolition of slavery to all who trust Christ. However
   badly I may tell it, it is such good news that any here who feel their
   slavery--and long to be set free--will leap to hear the glad tidings.

   But, in the next place, if I look at my paper, again, I find that it
   says, "The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies has voted the immediate and
   unconditional abolition of slavery in Brazil." I like that word,
   "unconditional." It demands no payment! It does not say, "You must
   bring so much and then you shall be set free." No, if the slave has not
   a penny. If he is utterly bankrupt, he is set free by the decree of the
   Chamber. And likewise, there is no payment for Gospel liberty! You are
   bid to come and take the Free Grace of God, "without money and without
   price." You could not bring sufficient anything to pay for salvation,
   even if God were willing to sell it! It cost the Savior His life--you
   cannot have anything to match with that wondrous redemption money! That
   which only Christ could buy, and buy with His blood, you certainly
   cannot purchase with any merits of your own, even if God allowed you to
   do so! Come then, and take this liberty--it is unconditional, that is,
   without payment!

   Unconditional also means that it is given without any promises on the
   slave's part. It might have been made a condition that he should be set
   free provided that he did so much at certain times, or if he promised
   this, and promised that. But no, this liberation in Brazil is
   unconditional. The man is free in the largest sense of the word--there
   is no mortgage upon him to be paid off, by and by--he is wholly,
   absolutely and unconditionally free. What a Gospel this is that we
   preach! It sets poor sinners free without an, "if," or a, "but," asking
   nothing of them, giving everything to them! Even the requirements of
   Grace are the gifts of Grace. If you are bid to repent, your repentance
   is given to you by Him who is exalted on high to give it! Faith is
   asked of you, but even faith is a gift of God and the work of the
   Spirit of God! Salva-

   tion is unconditionally given to those whom God has chosen, who have
   proven their choice by hearing the Word with faith and accepting it
   unconditionally.

   It took me a long time to get hold of this Truth of God. I kept
   thinking that I must do something, or that I would have to suffer
   something. I thought that I would be driven to despair, or be made to
   agonize and so forth. God knows that I had enough of that experience,
   but I always kept thinking that my hope lay there. Oh, what a mercy it
   is to catch the meaning of this word, "unconditional!" Whatever you may
   be or may not be, Jesus Christ comes to set poor sinners free! And when
   they believe on Him, they are set free without any condition. You see a
   horse in a meadow, sometimes, with a halter on. It is easy work to
   catch him. Ah, but God does not turn us out into a meadow with a halter
   on! He takes the halter off when He sets us at liberty and the devil,
   himself, cannot catch us again! The Lord takes the fetters off the one
   whom He makes to be His child. He does not leave him with a long chain
   on one of his legs, and say, "You are free, all but that." Oh no, it is
   unconditional emancipation! Who is there who will refuse to accept
   deliverance from slavery which is immediate and unconditional?

   But I notice, next, in my newspaper, here, that, "the Chamber of
   Deputies voted the immediate and unconditional abolition of
   slavery"--that is to say, that there is not to be any more slavery in
   Brazil. Slavery actually ceases to exist there! You cannot find a
   slave. Not only are slaves free, but slavery, itself, is abolished! Oh,
   is not this a wonderful fact? Sin is one great slavery, but Christ
   comes and pardons it and He so pardons it that sin, itself, ceases to
   be! "In those days, and in that time, says the Lord, the iniquity of
   Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none." Part of the work
   of the Messiah, as revealed to Daniel, was, "To make an end of sins."
   Well, if He makes an end of sins, there's an end of them, is there not?
   Jesus comes to drown our sins in the depths of the sea, to blot them
   out as a cloud is blotted out, so that they actually and absolutely
   cease to exist! He has come to remove from us the penalty and the guilt
   of sin so entirely that there is an abolition of the slavery of sin
   which is immediate and unconditional.

   Then the Lord Jesus Christ also comes to abolish the power of sin. He
   takes away from us our slavery to our passions, our lusts, our
   infirmities, our constitutional temperaments. "Oh," says one, "I am
   glad to hear that! Do you mean to say that the Lord Jesus Christ can
   set me free from the power of sin?" Yes, I do mean to say that, and He
   can do it immediately! He can do it now, while you are sitting in that
   seat. If you have come in here fond of strong drink, the Grace of God
   can make you go out hating the very sight of it! If you have come in
   here proud, the Grace of God can make you go away broken-hearted and
   humble! If you have come in here lascivious, the Grace of God can take
   out of your soul the impurity and make you love that which is sweet,
   and pure, and holy!

   "Well," says one, "I do not believe in such amazing changes." I did not
   say that you did, but if you had ever felt them, you would believe in
   them! Some of us have experienced these changes and there are many,
   now, in Heaven, who were once among the foulest of the foul! But the
   Lord Jesus came and set them free from the power of their corrupt
   na-tures--and they became holy people, a people who were examples to
   others--and that same Lord Jesus Christ can give you immediate,
   unconditional deliverance from the power of sin!

   I will tell you another thing. There is one power that sin has over us,
   and that is a feeling full of dread. Conscience co-operates with it
   and, sometimes, very properly so. But these slaves in Brazil, when they
   are set free, will not have to come up once a month to have their backs
   made bare and to receive 20 lashes apiece. Oh, dear, no! It is
   unconditional abolition of slavery they are to have. And when the Lord
   sets His people free from the guilt and power of sin, He delivers them
   from the lash of sin, takes away the spirit of bondage and gives them
   the spirit of liberty! They were afraid of God, before, but now they
   come to Him, crying, "Abba, Father," entering into His presence with
   joy and delight! It is wonderful how soon this unholy dread, this
   slavish fear, is cast out of the heart. Immediate and unconditional
   abolition of slavery means the removal, not only of sin, but also of
   the guilt, the penalty, the dread and the bondage which come of sin! We
   have to proclaim that emancipation tonight!

   These slaves in Brazil, if they are, indeed, set free, will not be
   slaves again. The decree of the Deputies is not that they are to be set
   free for six years, but forever! I hope that Brazil will be like our
   own country in this respect. You know how Cowper sang--

   "Slaves cannot breathe in England. If their lungs Receive our air, that
   moment they are free! They touch our country and their shackles fall!"

   Well, so it is in the Kingdom of Grace--there will be no going back to
   slavery if Christ once sets you free. "If the Son shall make you free,
   you shall be free, indeed"--and free forever!

   The slaves in Brazil, if they are set free, will be emancipated
   lawfully--they will not have stolen their liberty. No, if anybody were
   to speak to one of these emancipated slaves, and say, "You have no
   right to be free," he would answer, "I have! I am authorized to be free
   by the highest authority--the rulers of the land have made me a free
   man." Oh, Beloved, if we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we are set
   free from the law of sin and death by the highest possible authority!
   The Law of God, Himself, has set us free! Justice demands our freedom,
   and mercy secures it. So, you see that it is immediate and
   unconditional abolition of slavery that we have to proclaim by the
   preaching of the Gospel!

   And listen once more. This proclamation is universal throughout all
   Brazil. Some slaves are very black, but nowadays some slaves are nearly
   white. I have heard of a good many who were in slavery and who had not
   a discernible tint of black about them--and yet they were slaves. Well,
   there is liberty for the whitest and for the blackest, too! I do not
   know whether you are whites or blacks--it may be that you are very
   black, that you have gone very far into sin--but there is liberty even
   for you! It may be that you are not so very black--you are a brown sort
   of sinner, neither very good nor very bad. Or it may be that you are
   nearly white. Well, well, the same Christ gives liberty to all who put
   their trust in

   Him!

   Some of these slaves in Brazil are probably very young. Perhaps some of
   them were only born a day or two ago, but they are now free. O you
   young children, boys and girls, young men, young women--you cannot be
   free too soon! You cannot obtain the liberty with which Christ makes
   His people free too early in your lives! A young slave is a dreadful
   sight. It is sad to think that while he is yet so young, he should have
   lost his liberty. God set you young slaves free! But if there is a man
   in Brazil who is a hundred years old and he is a slave, this
   proclamation makes him free. Even so, if you have lived a long while in
   sin, Jesus is able to set you free from it! He can take away your old
   habits! The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the leopard his
   spots, but Christ can wash Ethiopian sinners white and He can change
   leopard sinners so as to make them gentle as fawns! Do not doubt
   Christ's power because of your age! You are neither too young nor too
   old to have the liberty that He gives to all who trust Him!

   Slaves in Brazil were generally born slaves and you, also, were born
   slaves. But the Lord Jesus Christ can deliver you from the mischief
   worked by Adam and set the home-born slaves at liberty from original
   sin! Some become slaves willingly. I do not suppose that many do so,
   literally, but we have, all of us, willingly bowed our necks to the
   yoke of sin. This is the worst part of the slavery, that it is the
   slavery of our wills. We have willed to sin and we have taken pleasure
   in it, but, Beloved, even if it is so, Christ is able to set us free!
   Perhaps some men swore to their masters that they would never leave
   them, that they always would be with them as their slaves. But this
   decree of the Deputies has set them free. There may be somebody here--I
   hope there is not--but there may be a man, here, who has sold himself
   to the devil. There may be some woman, here, who has given herself up,
   body and soul, to work iniquity. But even if it is so, the Lord can
   say, "Your Covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement
   with Hell shall not stand." You never were your own, so you could not
   give yourself to Satan! You are released from all your rash promises
   and your wicked oaths! You cannot be bound by any covenant that you
   have made with the devil and with sin! Come and be free, for thus says
   the Lord, there is immediate, unconditional emancipation for all such
   as desire to be delivered from sin and to have the liberty wherewith
   Christ makes His people free!

   II. Now, secondly, and very briefly, I am going to speak upon THE
   METHOD OF LIBERATION. I have described the nature of the liberty, now
   let me tell you the method of liberation.

   It is not thus in Brazil, but what I am going to speak about has to do
   with the Kingdom of God's Grace. Listen and learn! This is the method
   of liberation. First, Heaven provided a Ransom. When our slaves in
   Jamaica were set free, it was a glorious act, and you remember that the
   English nation paid many millions of pounds to the owners of the
   slaves. There has been a Ransom paid for the sons of men--Jesus Christ
   bore on the tree the Ransom for me, and for you, also, if you believe
   in Him. This is the basis of our liberty, that Christ has bought us
   with a price and set us free!

   The next thing is that Sovereign Grace proclaims the blood-bought
   sinner free. God, from His Throne, declares that those for whom Christ
   has died shall live, that those whom He has bought shall be His in that
   day when He makes up His jewels. God, the all-glorious Jehovah,
   proclaims the blood-bought sinner free, and free he is!

   But, next, Almighty Grace secures the believing one's emancipation.
   Grace comes to the soul and finds it a captive. But Grace resolves that
   it shall be free. At first the sinner does not care for freedom--he
   hugs his chains like the Israelites did in Egypt, when they cried, "Let
   us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians." God will not have it so! He
   turns the heart of the Egyptians against Israel and they oppress the
   Israelites--and make them hate their bondage. Oh, it is a blessed thing
   when God begins to make you feel uneasy in your slavery! Some of you
   have got on very well under the dominion of the devil up till now, but
   you are beginning to fret a little--you do not enjoy sin as you used to
   do. You have been gathering in part of the wages of sin, which is
   death. Some receive these wages in their bodies, others receive them in
   their minds when they begin to feel despondency and despair creeping
   over them. The prospect of death is unpleasant to you. Sin begins to be
   a burden hard to bear. I am glad of it! The greatest, hardest work of
   Grace is to make the slave of sin willing to be set free. Grace is
   doing that and, having gone so far that it has made you hate your
   chains and long for liberty, it will bring you out of captivity!

   You may be a long time before you see the outer gate of the prison and
   escape from the house of bondage, but you shall see it. If you see it,
   tonight, I pray the living God to help you run through that open gate
   and to be free tonight-- tonight--for I cannot help desiring that my
   subject, the immediate abolition of slavery, may come home with saving
   power to some heart! Oh, you young men, and lads of fifteen, I remember
   when I came into a House of Prayer--a very small one it was--and sat
   under the gallery with all my fetters on. But then I wanted to be free!
   I longed to be set at liberty and when I heard that blessed message,
   "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth," I
   looked--and I tell you it was my surprise, and it is still my
   surprise--that my fetters were all gone in a moment! They seemed to be
   of iron, and of iron they were, but they melted as the morning frost
   melts in the sun when the beams of the Grace of God, in the glorified
   and exalted Savior, came streaming in upon my soul! I was free in a
   moment! It was immediate, unconditional abolition of slavery! Grace had
   done it! Grace had done it! O Lord, let Your Grace do the same for
   others now!

   Often, when I come in at the door and my eyes fall on this vast
   congregation, I feel a tremor go through me to think that I should have
   to speak to you all and be, in some measure, accountable for your
   future state. Unless I preach the Gospel faithfully and with all my
   heart, your blood will be required at my hands. Do not wonder,
   therefore, that when I am weak and sick, I feel my head swim when I
   stand up to speak to you, and my heart is often faint within me. But I
   do have this joy at the back of it all--God does set many sinners free
   in this place! Some people reported that I was mourning that there were
   no conversions. Brothers and Sisters, if you were all to be converted
   tonight, I should mourn for the myriads outside! That is true, but I
   praise the Lord for the many who are converted here. When I came last
   Tuesday to see converts, I had 21 whom I was able to propose to the
   Church--and it will be the same next Tuesday, I do not doubt. God is
   saving souls! I am not preaching in vain. I am not despondent about
   that matter--liberty is given to the captives and there will be liberty
   for some of them tonight! I wonder who it will be? Some of you young
   women over yonder, I trust. Some who have dropped in here, tonight, for
   the first time. Oh, may this first opportunity of your hearing the Word
   in this place be the time of beginning a new life which shall never
   end--a life of holiness, a life of peace with God!

   This, then, is how sinners are liberated. Christ pays the ransom price,
   the Father declares them free, the Grace of God secures their liberty
   and, further, if they are once made free, then a righteous Law protects
   them. The masters in Brazil cannot get back their slaves. There is an
   old villain who used to flog his slave. He said that he had the right
   to beat his own as much as he liked. But when once the Negro is free,
   he dare not touch him. He would like to get him back, again, but what
   would the black man do if his master tried to make him a slave again?
   Why, he would appeal to the law! And so will we! If Christ has made us
   free, we will appeal to the Law of God! We will go to the High Court of
   Justice and say to the Judge of All, "Lord, You have made me free. Will
   You not preserve to me my liberty?" It is God that justifies! Who is he
   that condemns? Who can make him a slave whom God declares to be free?
   Oh, that you might all know this liberty and enjoy it! God grant it to
   you, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake!

   III. I finish with the third point, which is this--THE PERSONS WHO
   OBTAIN THIS LIBERTY. I will say only a

   very little upon this head, but I am hoping that many here will be able
   to say, "I belong to that lot, the persons who obtain this liberty."

   First, they were once slaves. These Brazilian Deputies cannot set a man
   free if he is not a slave. The Grace of God cannot heal a man who is
   not sick. God Almighty cannot make a man alive who is not dead. It is
   essential to us that we be in slavery, or else we cannot be liberated!
   Come now, what do you say about this? Does anyone answer, "I was born
   free,

   and was never in bondage to any man. I am as good as my neighbors, yes,
   and better than most of them"? I have nothing to say to you. "They that
   are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick." There
   is no Christ for you who have no sin! There is no salvation for you who
   never dreaded condemnation! How could there be? Does Christ come to
   give clothes to those who are already well clad? Does He come to feed
   those who are already feasted, or to enrich those who are increased in
   goods and have need of nothing? Not He! He comes to preach repentance
   to the sinner and pardon to the guilty. You must be a slave, or there
   is no freedom for you!

   And, as far as my piece of paper is concerned, the slaves who are set
   free must be slaves in Brazil, that is, for the time being, slaves
   under the reign of Grace. If they are not in Brazil, the Brazilian
   Deputies cannot set them free. And you must come into the Kingdom of
   Christ if you would be emancipated! O you slaves, you must come under
   the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ! You must be willing, from this
   time on, to call Him King, to obey Him and to abide by His laws. You
   must come to Him just as you are, quit your life of sin and love Him!
   And love His holiness and seek to serve Him! If you come under the
   dominion of the Lord Jesus Christ, then there is absolutely proclaimed
   to you, tonight, immediate, unconditional abolition of slavery! God
   grant that you may obtain this priceless Gift!

   And, once more, this emancipation is for all who will accept it
   unconditionally. Now, one would think that when the freedom is to be
   given unconditionally, everybody would say, "That suits me. If there
   are no conditions, I am sure that I do not want any, for if there were
   conditions, I might not be able to comply with them." But I find that
   every man will have conditions. One says, "Yes, yes, I would like to be
   saved, but then I do not want to give up my sins." Do you not? Then you
   must remain a slave! "Well," says another, "I would like to give up
   most of my sins, but there is one which I could not give up. The fact
   is, I have to make my living through it--I cannot give that up." You
   must either remain a slave, or you must come to be unconditionally set
   free!

   "But I do not wish to be set free by Grace," says a third, "I would
   like to do something towards my salvation." I know you would. You would
   like to have some of the honor of it, but it will never be written up,
   "Christ and Company, Saviors, Limited." It would be very "limited," I
   am sure, if it were so! You must have all Christ, or no Christ! Christ
   must save you from the A to the Z of the alphabet, or else you will
   never be sacred at all! Will you surrender unconditionally, since God
   gives His Grace unconditionally? Away with all terms and conditions!
   Come as you are. Come now. Come immediately! Come unconditionally and
   you shall be saved! The Lord grant you Grace to yield to His mercy and
   to yield at once!

   "What shall I do?" asks one. "I think I will go home and pray." Well,
   you may do so, if you like, but the Gospel message is, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." Still, do pray, for God does
   hear prayer. That is a wonderful story that came to us lately. You may
   have seen it, perhaps, in the paper. There was picked up, on the shore
   of Western Australia, (I forget the town for the moment), an albatross.
   It was dead on the beach and on the bird's neck was a card tied with a
   string. The man who picked up the card took it to someone in authority,
   for on it was written, "Thirteen of us sailors cast away on the
   Crozets." These are a number of rocky islands in the far south of the
   Indian Ocean. The ship in which these men had sailed had been wrecked
   and they were left with a certain quantity of biscuits on the Crozet
   Islands. I do not know how they caught the albatross, but it shows the
   genius of man and the love of life, for they managed to catch this
   great strong-winged bird and fastened the card about his neck. And he
   must have taken a flight of nearly 2,000 miles, and have fallen down on
   the shore with the shipwrecked mariners' message!

   The French Government dispatched a man-of-war to the Crozets--and so
   did the English Government. These poor fellows had not only sent
   tidings by the albatross, but they had also gathered a great pile of
   stones, and put a flag on the top, to attract the attention of any who
   might pass that way. Nothing has been seen of them, for they did not
   wait long enough--they put out to sea in the two boats in which they
   reached the islands and they have never been heard of since, so far as
   I know--but see what efforts they made! They piled the stones to
   attract the attention of passing sailors and they hung the card about
   the neck of the albatross. Why, there did not seem one chance in a
   thousand that the bird would ever go to a shore where that message
   would be read, yet the men did what they could!

   Now, I exhort you, if you are dying and perishing, do anything that you
   can that may bring you relief! Send a petition up to Heaven. Though it
   may seem as if you hung your prayer upon a poor bird's neck, send it
   flying! Pile up the stones with the flag on the top--your groans, cries
   and tears--that you may attract attention to your desperate state! Yet
   you are not, after all, driven to such bare chances as these! You may
   pray as much as you like, but the Gospel message

   is, "Believe, and live." Bear the royal proclamation and ask for
   nothing more! There is redemption--the ransom price is paid--the slave
   is free! Believe it. Accept it. Act upon it--go forth and prove it to
   be true! Oh, that some soul would do that tonight! Believe that God has
   provided for your emancipation and accept the liberty Christ has
   purchased! Why should you quarrel with it?

   I know that sinners try to find reasons why they should not be saved.
   If there is a person in prison, tonight, condemned to be hanged, and if
   I were to go to him, and say, "I have every reason to know that your
   life will be spared," I do not believe that he would sit down and try
   to prove to me that it could not be! I do not think that he would
   attempt to argue that he should be hanged! At any rate, I would not
   talk that way, myself, if it were my case. As far as ever my logic
   would carry me, I would try to argue my neck out of the hangman's
   noose, not into it! O poor Soul, do not argue yourself into Hell! Do
   not argue against Divine Mercy! As we sang just now--

   "Take salvation

   Take it now, and happy be."

   Say to yourself and say to your God, "I believe it! I accept it! I will
   go my way made free by Sovereign Grace and I will act as a free man
   should, to the praise of my great Master and to the glory of His
   Grace." The Lord bless you, dear Friends, for Jesus Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Luke 4:14-32.

   Verse 14. And Jesus returned, in the power of the Spirit, into Galilee.
   Ah, dear Brothers and Sisters, if our Lord Jesus needed "the power of
   the Spirit," how much more do you and I need it! We have no power of
   our own, but He was the Son of God. He was a Divine Teacher and yet,
   when He went to His work, it was, "in the power of the Spirit." Tarry,
   Brothers and Sisters, till you have that power--it is of no use for you
   to go without it.

   14, 15. And there went out a fame of Him through all the region round
   about. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. There
   was a wondrous power about His teaching--"Never man spoke like this
   man." Perhaps His hearers did not understand what the power was, but
   they glorified the new Teacher who had come into their midst!

   16. And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. It is always
   a difficult thing for a young man to begin preaching in his own native
   town. A Prophet is not without honor except in his own country, yet
   Jesus, "came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up."

   16. And, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
   Day, and stood up to read. It was the custom to read parts of Holy Writ
   in the synagogue and then to say a few words by way of exposition--and
   this the Savior did.

   17. And there was delivered unto Him the book of the Prophet Isaiah.
   And when He had opened the book, that is, unrolled the parchment
   containing Isaiah's prophecy--

   17. He found the place where it was written. You will find the passage
   in the 61st Chapter of Isaiah.

   18, 19. The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me
   to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the
   broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
   of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to
   preach the acceptable year of the Lord. There He stopped--it was all of
   the passage that, then, seemed suitable.

   20. And He closed the book, and He gave it again to the minister, and
   sat down. In those days, the preacher sat down, and those who listened
   stood up, I daresay that practice tended to keep the hearers awake and
   it was all the easier for the speaker! Well might the Savior sit down,
   weighted as He was with a burden of holy instruction that He was about
   to impart to the people, or, perhaps, sitting down as if Himself at
   rest, He appeared the more ready to give rest to them.

   20. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened
   on Him. The young Nazarene, who had left them for a while, and had come
   home, again, was the center of His fellow-townsmen's attention.

   21. And He began to say unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled
   in your ears. He thus declared that He was the anointed Messiah.

   22. And all bore Him witness and wondered at the gracious word which
   proceeded out of His mouth. They did not, at first, ridicule or deny
   what Jesus said--His doctrine was pleasing and comforting--and they
   were ready to accept it.

   22. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? Now they began to
   question--"Is not this the son of the carpenter?"

   23. And He said unto them, You will surely say unto Me the proverb,
   Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do
   also here in Your country. "You have been doing great things over
   yonder at Capernaum, do the same at Nazareth. You should not leave Your
   own native town without working miracles here." Now there was an
   opportunity for Jesus to ingratiate Himself with the people and win
   their good word. If He would only perform miracles among them, He would
   be highly exalted in their esteem.

   24. 25. And He said, Verily I say unto you, No Prophet is accepted in
   His own country. But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel
   in the day, of Elijah, when the Heaven was shut up three years and six
   months, when great famine was throughout all the land. Many husbands
   died, and many widows in Israel were left desolate in those terrible
   days of trial.

   26. But unto none of them was Elijah sent, save unto Zarephath, a city
   of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. This was as much as to say,
   "It is not because I lived here that I shall work miracles in this
   place. There were many widows round about Elijah, but he was not sent
   to one of them. He was sent to a widow in Zarephath, a city of Sidon, a
   heathen woman in another country." Mark the Sovereignty of God! He
   bestows His mercy where He wills, according to His declaration to
   Moses, "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show
   mercy on whom I will show mercy." We dare not ask God why He does this,
   "for He gives not account of any of His matters." He acts wisely, but
   He acts according to the good pleasure of His own will.

   27. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the Prophet;
   and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman; the Syrian. He, too, was
   a heathen from a distant country. Healing came to him, but to none of
   the lepers of Israel. God will do as He pleases with His own mercy and
   Grace. The question that He asks is, "Is it not lawful for Me to do
   what I will with My own? "This doctrine of Divine Sovereignty was not
   according to the taste of these people--they did not like it--and some
   of you, I fear, do not like it. They grew very angry. They began to
   gnash their teeth and to say, "This young Man must be silenced! We will
   not listen to such doctrine as this from Him."

   28. And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were
   filled with wrath. They did not mind hearing the first part of His
   teaching, but now that He exalts the Sovereignty of God, and lays the
   sinner low, He speaks too plainly for them--"They were filled with
   wrath."

   29. 30. And rose up, and thrust Him out of the city, and led Him unto
   the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast
   Him down headlong. But He, passing through the midst of them, went His
   way. They could not destroy Him at that time. His work was not done and
   He was immortal till it was fully accomplished.

   31, 32. And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them
   on the Sabbath Day. And they were astonished at His doctrine: for His
   word was with power. God grant that His Word may be with power tonight!
   Amen.

A Page From a Royal Diary

   (No. 2372)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 5, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 17,
   1888.

   "Look You upon me and be merciful to me, as You used to do to those who
   love Your name." Psalm 119:132.

   ["We believe that David wrote this Psalm. It is Davidic in tone and
   expression and it tallies with David's experience in many interesting
   points. In our youth, our teachers called it, 'David's pocketbook,' and
   we incline to the opinion often expressed that here we have the royal
   diary written at various times throughout a long life."--C. H.
   SPURGEON'S Note in The Treasury of David as to the author of Psalm
   119.]

   PERHAPS YOU noticed, while I was reading, that during the writing of
   several of the verses, David occupied himself with the praises of God's
   Word. He kept to that point, extolling with all his might those
   Scriptures in which God had spoken to his heart, but he could not go on
   long without prayer. If these meditations were written in his
   pocket-book, day by day, it is noteworthy that although he fervently
   praises the Word of God, yet he also frequently breaks out into prayer.
   However the child of God may occupy his mind--and he very properly
   employs it in many holy occupations--yet he often turns to prayer, for
   he cannot live without it. Well does Montgomery say--

   "Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, The Christian's native air."

   We must pray. Brothers and Sisters, we are bound to praise God for all
   His goodness. We cannot help bearing testimony to His faithfulness and
   His Truth. We are delighted to engage in all acts of holy service, but,
   in addition to all that, we must pray. Prayer is a sine qua non with
   us--we continually come back to that sacred exercise, for, without it,
   we are nothing and can do nothing. Therefore, again I say, we must
   pray.

   Notice, also, how brief David's prayer is, and yet how full of matter!
   I believe that very often, the longer the prayer is, the less there is
   in it, and that the best prayers that were ever prayed have usually
   been the shortest. An arrow may easily be too long and prayers should
   be like arrows shot from the bow of faith. If they are short, it does
   not matter, as long as they are sharp and went on their way with a good
   pull of the bowstring. The first petition, here, is very short, but
   very full--"Look You upon me." The words are few, but the sense is
   deep, as I shall have to show you. Oh, that we all spoke with greater
   freshness and naturalness in prayer--that we had no thought about
   keeping on with fine language, but great anxiety as to holding on with
   a firm grip of wrestling, pleading prayer!

   The whole of our text is but short, yet it contains much more meaning
   than I can bring out to you in this one discourse. I want to call your
   attention to four things in it. First, David's brief petition--"Look
   You upon me." Secondly, his humble confession (it is not given in so
   many words, but it lies hidden away like the perfumed violet beneath
   the green leaves)--"Be merciful unto me," which is a virtual confession
   of sin. Thirdly, his tacit profession, for he says, "as You used to do
   unto those that love Your name," which is tacitly saying that he loves
   God's name, or else he could not pray the Lord to deal with him as He
   used to do with such people. And, fourthly--and here I shall enlarge
   somewhat--his gracious aspiration. The highest, loftiest wish that
   David had was that God would deal with him as He was accustomed to do
   unto those that love His name. He did not want to fare either better or
   worse than the rest of the Lord's family, so he boldly prayed, "Look
   You upon me, and be merciful unto me, as You used to do unto those that
   love Your name."

   I. To begin with, here is, in our text, DAVID'S BRIEF PETITION--"Look
   You upon me."

   I think that these words came to David's mouth from his heart and that
   he prayed, "Look You upon me," because his own eyes had failed him.
   Turn to the 123rd verse. If you look at it, you will see that one thing
   in a saint may suggest another. In that verse he wrote, "My eyes fail,"
   and in our text he says, "Look You upon me. Lord, when I feel as if I
   could not look at You, do You look at me! My eyes fail me. I have
   washed them out with rivers of water, I have flooded them with
   fountains of grief. Unbelief has come in. I cannot see as I would--the
   dust of the world and the smoke of care have dimmed my eyes--I seem to
   grow blind, my Lord, and though I would always look at You and never
   take my eyes off You, yet my eyes fail me!" In such a case as that, it
   is so sweet to pray to God, "Look You upon me."

   Brothers and Sisters, there is great virtue in our looking to
   Christ--it is the way of salvation! What virtue, then, must there be in
   Christ's love-gaze upon us! A faith-look at the blood of Jesus gives us
   peace, but, as I always remind you, it is God's sight of the blood that
   brings us salvation. Did He not say to Moses and Aaron, "When I see the
   blood, I will pass over you"?--

   "When your eyes of faith are dim Still trust in Jesus, sink or swim."
   When you cannot see your God, still say with poor Hagar, "You God see
   me." Jehovah is the all-seeing One--remember that and be comforted. If
   your eyes are put out, His eyes can never be blinded--still does He
   look upon you with compassion and see you with His eyes of Grace. Again
   I say, Lord, if ever I should forget to look to You, or if ever I
   should be in such a state of despondency that I cannot look up to You,
   look You upon me!

   Next, notice that man's eyes had misjudged David. I think the
   Psalmist's prayer is to be read in this light, that he had been
   condemned and persecuted by the ungodly and he was evidently under the
   oppression of man as we noticed in reading the 134th verse--"Deliver me
   from the oppression of man." Men had misconstrued his words and
   misrepresented him, so now he says, "Lord, look You upon me! Whenever
   evil men look at me, they look with disapproval--they do not see what
   should be seen, but they see a great deal that is not really there.
   Lord, I know what they say of me, but You look upon me!" It has fallen
   to the lot of many of us to pass under the censure of men and the cure
   for that censure is to cry, "Lord, look You upon me." Mr. Blind-Man,
   the foreman of the Vanity Fair jury that condemned Christian's brother,
   Faithful, said, "I see clearly that this man is a heretic." And the
   blinder bad men are, the more fault they can see in God's people, even
   when there is nothing of evil to be seen! They will make it up if they
   cannot find it and they will swear to it even if they know that it is
   not so. It is not for a child of God to battle with them about the
   matter, but to turn his eyes to the Lord who is our only Judge and,
   with David, to pray, "Look You upon me."

   Again, do you not think it was this that made the Psalmist pray in this
   way? He knew that God's eyes perceive what His servant needs. David
   opened his mouth and panted--he knew he needed something, but he hardly
   knew what it was! At times we do not know how to word our prayers
   because our sense of need is so very great. It seems idle to ask for
   one thing when we need everything! When we are quite emptied out, we
   scarcely know where to begin, and when our case is very puzzling and
   perplexing, we cannot tell what to ask for when we come to the Throne
   of Grace. That is a sweet thought, "You, my heavenly Father, know what
   things I have need of before I ask for them!" Prayer is not for God's
   information, but for our instruction! We need to be made to learn what
   our needs are, but God always knows them. It is a very blessed thing,
   when we cannot tell what our needs are, to utter such a prayer as this,
   "Look You upon me, O Lord! You will see what I need. You will see
   wherein I fail. You will see how I struggle. You will see what I
   suffer. Lord, look You upon me!"

   This is also, to my mind, such a lovely and God-honoring prayer because
   it leaves all with God. David does not say what he thinks the Lord
   should do. When prayer dictates to God, it has gone beyond its lawful
   bounds and it is not, then, proper prayer. But the Psalmist prays,
   "Lord, look You upon me." When he was very sick, he did not say, "Lord,
   heal me," but he prayed, "Lord, look You upon me." An ordinary
   physician's look, alone, is not worth much, but one glance of the Great
   Physician's eyes is sufficient to cure all the maladies of the heart!
   We need the earthly physician's hand and his medicine and, possibly,
   the surgeon's knife. Ah, but we get everything in a look from our Lord!

   When Jesus turned and looked upon Peter, did He preach a sermon? He did
   a great deal more than that! Did He rebuke the liar? He did a great
   deal more than that! Did He draw the wanderer back to Himself? He did a
   great deal more than that! Oh, nobody knows how much lies in one look
   of the eyes of God! Let us, each one, present this prayer
   to-night--"Lord, here is my case. I do not understand it--I know what I
   would like--but I am not sure whether it would

   be right for me to ask for it. I put myself before You--look You upon
   me. I sit, like the blind man by the wayside, and all I ask is that You
   will but turn Your face this way and see me where I am, and see what I
   am. And if You will but do that, do what else You please. I will not
   dictate to You as to what You should do. I will leave myself and my
   affairs entirely in Your hands--only look You upon me."

   I think David also meant this petition, "Look You upon me," in the
   sense in which we sang just now--

   "Look upon me, Lord, I pray You, Let Your Spirit dwell in mine!"

   In this sense, God's look will be a sign of Divine favor. Frequently,
   in Scripture, God is represented as turning His face away in anger. But
   when He looks towards His chosen ones, it is in love. Brothers and
   Sisters, is there anything under Heaven more delightful than to be
   loved by God and to know it? The love of God, in itself, is
   inexpressibly sweet, but if you do not apprehend it, it is a sea of
   sweetness of which you do not taste, or like a mountain of honey to
   which you cannot gain access! But oh, to be loved of God and to know it
   would make a man dance if he were in chains! It would turn a dungeon
   into a palace if the poor prisoner were sure that God loved him! And
   that is precisely what David means when He prays, "Look You upon me.."
   "...Make Your face shine upon Your servant." Do you see men scowling,
   and do you hear them howling? What does it all matter? God is smiling
   and that is an end to all the oppression of man! One sun soon puts an
   end to all the darkness. One glimpse of God's smiling, reconciled,
   eternally-loving face, drives away all sorrow from the Believer's
   heart! The Psalmist's prayer, "Look You upon me," means just that.

   I think, too, that David meant one thing more, that is, that God's look
   could prepare him for future obedience. When David said to the Lord,
   "Look You upon me," he meant, "Look at me and see that I am armed for
   the fight against evil. O Lord, look me up and down, search me all over
   and see that I do not lack any necessary thing! Look at me inside and
   outside. Look at my brain, look at my heart, look You upon me to see
   that there is nothing omitted that will be necessary for my future
   conduct in the world, in the Church, in the household, or alone with
   You!"

   Does not the Psalmist mean all that I have said? And did I not speak
   truly when I told you that this little prayer, "Look You upon me," has
   much more in it than I can draw out of it in a single discourse? I
   advise you to pray it as it is, with all the meanings packed away in
   it--"Look You upon me." God help you to do so!

   II. Our next division is DAVID'S HUMBLE CONFESSION. It is not actually
   expressed in words, but it is hidden away in his next utterance--"Be
   merciful unto me."

   The Psalmist's confession is the link between his first prayer and this
   second supplication. His prayer grew out of this confession. He prayed
   to the Lord, "Look You upon me," because he could not, himself, look to
   God. And then he added this petition because he realized his need of
   Divine mercy. "Be merciful unto me." Do you remember the Savior's
   parable, or the fact the Savior described when He said, "Two men went
   up into the Temple to pray. One of them, the publican, standing afar
   off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon
   his breast, saying, 'God be merciful to me a sinner'"? Surely David,
   long before that story was told, was acting it out! He dared not look
   up to God. He could not look up, or he would not have prayed, "Look You
   upon me."

   Then he cried, "Be merciful unto me." By this petition he evidently
   sought forgiveness. Mercy is only for guilty people. Favor may be for
   the miserable, but mercy is for the guilty. One said, the other day,
   "Oh, I am such a great sinner!" And a wise person, who stood by, said,
   "I am glad to hear you admit it." "Oh," answered the other, "but I am
   lost." "It is so," responded the friend, "and I am pleased to hear you
   confess it." "And why are you so pleased? It sounds rather cruel to be
   glad because I am a sinner, and pleased because I am lost." "Ah," said
   the wise Christian instructor, "but Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners. He, Himself, said, 'the Son of Man is come to seek and to
   save that which was lost.'" There would be nobody to receive mercy if
   nobody were guilty! Oh, that you might all feel, whether you are saints
   or sinners, that the language of the text suits you! "Be merciful unto
   me." "Oh," said one, "I do not think I have been as guilty as some."
   Nevertheless, there is no way to Heaven but one--and that way is open
   for the vilest as well as the most moral. "Be merciful unto me," is the
   prayer you must learn to pray if you hope to enter the Kingdom of God!

   It is evident, also, that upon this ground, alone, the Psalmist sought
   for the blessing he desired--"Look You upon me, and be merciful unto
   me." Do you see what he means? "Lord, I do not expect a look from You
   except as a proof of Your mercy. If You only give me a glance of Your
   eyes, it will be a token of mercy." If we get a crumb from God's table,
   it is a mercy. If we get a promise out of His Word, it is a mercy--if
   we get anything from the Lord it is a mercy--but if we re-

   ceive forgiveness of sin, what a mercy that is! Did you ever try to
   fathom the depth of mercy that lies in the forgiveness of a single sin?
   There are some sins in our lives which will always be remembered by us.
   That night when you gave way to that one particular fit of temper which
   led to that one dreadful act of sin, has God forgiven that? Ah, yes,
   for "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." When
   you cannot forgive yourself, yet you may know that God has, for
   Christ's sake, forgiven you. You may have all the more pleasure in
   knowing that He has forgiven you because you cannot forgive yourself.
   That sin which overwhelms you and lays you in the very abyss as you
   remember it--that is the sin God delights to pardon! What a blessing it
   is that it is so, that we are able to assure you that, "He delights in
   mercy," and especially in this particular form of mercy, the blotting
   out of sin! After David had sinned with Uriah's wife, or after other
   great transgressions, this prayer was especially suitable, "Be merciful
   unto me."

   There I will leave this part of my subject, but I pray God the Holy
   Spirit not to leave it, but to lay it home to some hearts here. People
   are getting ready for Whitsuntide--some will be going into the country,
   and others are obliged to keep their shops open late before the
   holidays--therefore we are fewer in number, here, than usual, but I
   have been wondering whether God does not intend to save somebody who
   has come in here, tonight, because it is the holiday season? The Lord
   grant that it may be so! What can be more appropriate to you who are
   conscious of guilt and groaning under the heavy burden of sin, than
   that you should pray these two petitions of David's supplication--"Look
   You upon me, and be merciful unto me"?

   III. The third point, upon which I will not detain you long, is DAVID'S
   TACIT PROFESSION. There is, again, hidden away, here, not uttered in
   words, but secretly implied, a profession of love for the Lord--"Look
   You upon me, and be merciful unto me, as You used to do unto those that
   love Your name"

   If the Psalmist does not actually declare that he loves God's name, he
   does at least say, "Lord, put me down among them that love Your name.
   Count me with them. I want to love Your name, O Lord; therefore, treat
   me as You treat

   them!"--

   "With them numbered may I be, Now, and through eternity!"

   David hardly dares to say that He loves God's name, but he does
   practically say it by praying that God will treat him as He treats
   those who do love His name. Some of those who love God best are not the
   loudest in proclaiming their love. I believe there are some, here, who
   would die for Christ if it were necessary, yet they have not had the
   courage to come out and confess Him. I heard of a good woman who was
   afraid to testify before the Church, of her faith in Christ. As she was
   going away, she turned round and said to the minister, "I cannot speak
   about my faith, Sir, but I would die for Christ." "Come back," he said,
   "come back! That confession is better than any other sort of speaking."

   There have been some, in the time of the martyrs, who have been very
   loud in their professions, but they have recanted at the last--while
   others, who have been very timid have been the bravest of all when the
   burning day came. I remember that one martyr, when chained to the stake
   with two others, slipped down from under the chain and was hidden by
   the firewood some two or three minutes. All thought he had recanted,
   but he came back and placed himself in the chains, again, and stood up
   boldly to be burned to death. He said to a Brother at his side, "I lost
   sight of my Lord's face, and I could not stand there to burn until I
   had found Him, again. He has come to me so sweetly and now, by His
   Grace, I shall die like a man."

   If we have Christ with us, how strong we are! But if He is not with us,
   we are weakness itself! I cannot, therefore, condemn those who are
   afraid to say very boldly that they love the Lord's name. I hope,
   however, that they will have the courage, at any rate, to slip in
   edgeways and sandwich themselves between some other Believers, and say
   in the words of the text, "Be merciful unto me, as You used to do unto
   those that love Your name."

   But the true child of God does love his Lord's name. What does that
   mean? He loves God's name, that is, he loves the Person of God. He
   loves God! His heart goes out towards the infinitely glorious Jehovah.
   He loves the Character of God. There are a great many, nowadays, who
   want Jehovah to be improved upon. When they read of the God of Holy
   Scripture, they do not like Him--they say they want a kinder and more
   tender God. These are the men who worship the gods of modern
   thought--gods newly come up which are more like the devil than the true
   God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob--the God and Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ! But the true child of God loves God as he finds Him
   and as he

   finds Him in Holy Scripture--the one living and true God who made all
   things, and by whom all things consist. This is the God we love, adore
   and worship!

   The genuine child of God also loves God's Revelation. That is often
   what is meant by the expression, "His name." He who is right with God
   loves every Doctrine of the Scriptures and every part of that Doctrine.
   He does not try to alter and improve the Scriptures, nor to prepare an
   addendum to the Word of God--he loves the Revelation given to us in the
   name of God and loves every point of it. By the, "name," is sometimes
   meant the Glory of God. I trust that the very feeblest of us can say
   that we love the Glory of God. When we hear Him praised, our hearts are
   all aglow. When we hear anything that is said against Him, our
   indignation burns vehemently, for we love His name. Oh, that God would
   grant us Grace to love Him far more than we do!

   I must not say more on this point, for I have only a little time left,
   and I need that for the last division of my discourse.

   IV. Fourthly, we are to consider DAVID'S GRACIOUS ASPIRATION. What he
   asks is that God would be merciful to him as He is accustomed to be to
   those who love His name. That is our aspiration, too--I trust we want
   God to deal with us as He deals with the rest of His people.

   Notice, here, that David would be dealt with as saints have always been
   dealt with. If God treats us as He treats His children, I think we may
   be perfectly satisfied. There was a time when, if anybody had said to
   me, "The Lord will put you among His children and treat you as one of
   them," I would have been ready to dance for joy! And I do not run back,
   today, from the solemn conviction that if He will only treat me as He
   treats the rest of His family, I shall be perfectly satisfied. How is
   that? How does the Lord deal with His children?

   Well, you know what He used to do to those who loved His name. He used
   to come and visit them. For instance, there were Abraham, Isaac and
   Jacob. These all had visits from the Lord, as did Moses, when God was
   in the burning bush. In olden days, God could be found in the desert or
   in a bush. He came to His people by the brook side, by the river, in
   the fiery furnace and in the lions' den. And it is still the use and
   habit of God to visit His people! Did He ever visit you? Pray that He
   may visit you as He used to do to those who loved His name. Lord, come
   and visit me under a tree, as You met Abraham! Come and meet me beneath
   the city wall as You met Joshua of old! Come to the river's brink, as
   You came to Ezekiel by the river of Chebar! Come to the lonely island,
   as you did to John in Patmos!

   God not only used to visit those who loved His name, but He used to
   instruct them. What teachings they had from Him! What revelations and
   manifestations of Himself! Lord, teach me as You used to teach those
   who loved Your name!

   How patient, also, He was with them! They had many faults and
   failings--and they grieved His Holy Spirit--but He forgave them and
   went on teaching them! And when they fell and wandered from Him, He
   restored them and brought them back.

   Then you know, dear Brothers and Sisters, the Lord was always faithful
   to those who loved His name. When He made them a promise, He always
   kept it. He said He would meet them, and He did. He said that He would
   help them, and He did. He said that He would strengthen them, and He
   did. He said that He would give them victory, and He did. He never was
   a liar to them--He never left them in need. By the mouth of His
   servant, Jeremiah, He asked, "Have I been a wilderness unto Israel?" He
   never broke a single condition of His Covenant, so I think we can, each
   one, pray, "Lord, look You upon me, and be merciful unto me, as You
   used to do unto those that love Your name!"

   But notice this, also, the Lord used to whip them when they needed it!
   Those who loved His name were chastened. Asaph said, "All the day long
   have I been plagued and chastened every morning." Well, suppose you
   should have the same treatment? You can thank God that He is doing to
   you as He used to do to those who loved His name! If He had a child of
   His who was strong, He used to try and test him. If he was brave, He
   made him fight. If he was vigorous, He made him bear burdens. You will
   always find that, in proportion to the strength the Lord gives, so He
   sets the trial. That is how He used to do to those who loved His name.

   You cannot tell how it has comforted me, sometimes, when it has been
   said to me, "You are reproached." "Very well," I say to myself, "that
   is how the Lord used to allow it to be done to those who loved His
   name." "But you have lost your reputation through standing up for the
   Truth of God." "Yes," I answer, "that is how it used to be done to
   those who loved God's name. That is the way His servants have always
   gone to Glory." You can go to Hell with a whole skin if you wish to do
   so, but you must go to Heaven with many a bruise and gash. If you would
   be faithful to the Lord,

   you must expect to be despised--but take it all as part of the lot that
   belongs to you and do not quarrel with it. Do you expect to be carried
   to the skies on flowery beds of ease? I should be sorry to see you
   trying such a plan of going to Heaven, for that is not how the Lord
   used to do to those who loved His name! Do you expect to go all the way
   to Heaven, clapped and applauded by an eager throng, crying, "Well
   done"? Is that how He used to do unto those who loved His name? Far
   from it! Therefore, be satisfied if God deals with you as He used to do
   with those who loved His name.

   I think, also, that when using these words, David meant that He was
   quite willing that God should deal with him in His usual way, in His
   regular order. He did not want to have some special railway thrown up
   for him in which he could ride first-class to Heaven, but he was
   willing to go the old way, the way the holy Prophets went, and the
   saints, and martyrs, and confessors of God! That is to say, he did not
   want salvation without holiness. He did not want justification without
   sanctification. He did not want pardon without regeneration. He asked
   God to do with him as He used to do with those who loved His name and,
   with them, you know, the water and the blood always went together--they
   had the new heart as well as the new robe. Acceptance in the Beloved
   did not come without there also being an acceptableness of holy
   character given by the Spirit of God.

   Next, David did not want profit without exertion. He was not one of
   those who said, "I want to be happy, but never to do anything. I want
   to take the promises, but to have no part in Christian service. I want
   to understand without reading the Scriptures. I want to be taught and
   comforted without coming to hear sermons--I want to lie down and sleep
   myself into Glory." No, He was willing that God should do with him as
   He used to do unto those who loved Him.

   David did not expect to have answers without prayer. The Lord Jesus
   said, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock,
   and it shall be opened unto you." We should be willing to have it as it
   was done to those who loved the Lord's name. David said, "Look You upon
   me and be merciful unto me, as You used to do unto those that love Your
   name." Some of our Churches expect prosperity without Prayer Meetings
   and hope to get many converts without unitedly asking for them. Perhaps
   half-a-dozen Christians meet for prayer on Monday evenings, or perhaps
   a few gather on Wednesdays when there is half a lecture and half a
   Prayer Meeting, so that they can say that they do have a Prayer Meeting
   when, in reality, they do not have one at all! But David said, "Make me
   pray, Lord. Do not give me anything unless I pray for it! Compel me to
   plead with You and then give me Your blessing!"

   Then, again, David did not expect to pass through life without
   experiencing difficulties. He had to fight Goliath and he had to go
   into the cave of Adullam. He expected to have troubles and he certainly
   was not disappointed. Nor will you be. Do not reckon that God will give
   you a life without difficulty! Tell me, if you can, of any child of His
   who ever had such a portion? He had one Son without sin, but no son
   without sorrow. No, that Son who had no sin was the Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief--so you must expect the Lord to deal with you as
   He does with the rest of His household.

   Lastly, you cannot expect that you shall have continual enjoyments of
   the light of Christ's Countenance and a blessed experience of the
   sweets of His love, without having struggle of soul and conflict of
   spirit which come from the fact that the devil is not dead, that the
   world is not changed, that sin still dwells within you and still causes
   you grief. "Deal with me, O Lord, as You used to do with Your children!
   I do not want to be picked out from the rest and treated as a
   favorite." David once had a favorite child, Absalom, and a dreadful
   fellow he turned out to be! God does not fill us with sweetmeats--it is
   not His custom to take away all trouble and give us nothing but joy.
   Sweetmeats at night mean medicine in the morning! God grant us Grace to
   be willing to take the bitter with the sweet, to be baptized with
   Christ's Baptism and to drink of Christ's cup--and to always be
   satisfied as long as we may follow where the bleeding Savior leads the
   way!

   Now, dear Friends, I have done. I hope there has been a word for
   everybody. And if there has been a word from me to you, let there be a
   word from you to God--and let this be the prayer that you utter before
   leaving this house, "Look You upon me and be merciful unto me, as You
   used to do unto those that love Your name."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 119:129-144

   Verse 129. Your testimonies are wonderful: therefore does my soul keep
   them. Every true Believer admires God's Word and, more than that, it
   amazes him--"Your testimonies are wonderful." View them from any point
   you may select, they are wonderful--wonderful in themselves, wonderful
   in their operation, wonderful in the way in which they endure all kinds
   of testing and yet remain the same--"Your testimonies are wonderful."
   This wonder, however, in the true Believer, leads to godly practice, to
   holy living--"Therefore does my soul keep them." Our soul must be like
   a golden case in which we store the priceless jewels of the Word of the
   Lord. You cannot rightly keep God's Word anywhere but in your soul. To
   keep it merely in the memory, or in the intellect, is of no avail.

   130. The entrance of Your Words give light. The very first
   principles--the elements of God's Word--are full of light and no sooner
   does it come into the heart than there is light, directly. How much
   more light does it give when it penetrates into the secret chambers of
   our being and we begin to understand its deeper mysteries!

   130. It gives understanding unto the simple. God's Word gives
   understanding to those who feel that they have very little mental
   ability--"the simple." They are only plain people who must have the
   Truth of God put very simply before them or else they cannot comprehend
   it, but as soon as ever God's Word enters their heart, even such people
   get understanding. It is not the Word outside the heart that gives the
   blessing--it is the entrance of the Word that gives true life to the
   soul!

   131. I opened my mouth and panted. That was an admirable way of
   praying--no words were used by the Psalmist, but his soul expressed
   itself by panting, "As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants
   my soul after You, O God."

   131. For I longed for Your commandments. The very best kind of prayer
   is that inarticulate panting in which there is a longing, a sighing,
   that cannot be expressed in words.

   132. 133. Look You upon me and be merciful unto me, as You used to do
   unto those that love Your name. Order my step in Your Word. "Lord, I
   have found the way into Your Word. That is the road I intend to travel.
   Now I pray You to guide my every step." They say that, "Order is
   Heaven's first law," and certainly a Christian should lead an orderly
   life. He should be a "Methodist"--he should have a method in all that
   he does--and he should pray for God to order his steps according to His
   Word.

   133. And let not any iniquity have dominion over me. A hypocrite says
   to himself, "I do not swear, I do not steal and I do not lie, yet I
   allow other sins to have dominion over me." But a true man of God will
   not have any master but the Lord Jesus Christ. He will not put his neck
   under the foot of even the most attractive sin. "Let not any iniquity
   have dominion over me." That is the Psalmist's prayer. Here is the
   Apostle's answer to it--"Sin shall not have dominion over you."

   134. Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep Your
   precepts. He does not mean that he will not keep God's precepts if he
   is not delivered from man's oppression, but there are persons in such
   circumstances--Christian wives with wicked husbands, godly servants
   with ungodly masters, Believers who are greatly oppressed by evil
   men--and they desire to be delivered from the oppression of man that
   they may be the better able to keep God's commandments.

   135. Make Your face to shine upon Your servant. What a blessed prayer
   that is! Let each one, here, pray it tonight-- "Make Your face to shine
   upon Your servant." The Lord is our Sun! He is the very Sun of
   Heaven--they need no sun, there, because they see His face!

   135. And teach me Your statutes. The Lord's servant ought to know the
   Law of his Lord's house. How can he be an obedient servant if he does
   not know his Master's will? So the Psalmist prays, "Lord, I will take
   it as a favor if You will teach me Your statutes, that I may not only
   know, but also do them!"

   136. Rivers of waters run down my eyes because they keep not Your Law.
   Some think that the Psalmist meant that his eyes wept because they,
   that is, his eyes did not keep God's Law. You know how easily sin comes
   in through the eyes and goes out through the eyes, too. Well may those
   eyes weep in sorrow that have lusted towards sin. But I think the
   Psalmist alludes, here, to the ungodly. The sins of sinners are the
   sorrows of saints. "Rivers of waters run down my eyes because they keep
   not Your Law." Perhaps David referred to his own children, or he may
   have meant his soldiers--those rough, rugged warriors who were led by
   Joab. He met with many in his own country who turned aside from God and
   he wept over them. It is a blessed sign of Grace when you can weep over
   other men's sins. Do not say, "So-and-So has gone wrong," and treat the
   matter with indifference. If you can do so, you may question whether
   you have Grace in your own heart, for a true Christian ought to be
   tender and compassionate at the thought of the sinful things around
   him. There

   are some who can look upon the error and false doctrine which abound
   everywhere and say, "Oh, let it alone! Do not trouble yourself about
   that." But he who walks with God is not of their mind--it is a constant
   grief and agony of spirit to him that men keep not God's Law.

   137. Righteous are You, O LORD, and upright are Your judgements. It is
   always well to set God in contrast with wicked men. If others are
   unjust, He is not. If they forsake the Truth of God, He does not.

   138. Your testimonies that You have commanded are righteous and very
   faithful. True to the letter, true always, true to the core.

   139. Your zeal has consumed me, because my enemies have forgotten Your
   Words. Yes, God's faithful servants become the more zealous when others
   grow cold. When they see that God's Words are forgotten by others, they
   remember them all the more and they grow exceedingly zealous for the
   Law of the Lord.

   140. Your Word is very pure: therefore Your servant loves it. It is
   pure in the sense of being unadulterated and it is pure in the sense of
   being holy. There is nothing in the Scripture that would lead us to
   sin, nor excuse it--it is a wonderful condemner of sin. "Your Word is
   very pure." Notice the Psalmist's use of the word, "very." In the 138th
   verse, he says, "Your testimonies are very faithful." And now, in the
   140th, "Your Word is very pure." "Therefore Your servant loves it."
   When purity draws out our love, it proves that our heart, itself, loves
   that which is pure--and the heart that loves purity is a pure heart.

   141. I am small and despised: yet I do not forget Your precepts. He was
   poor but pious, little but loving, despised but devoted. It was the man
   who had but one talent who went and dug in the earth and hid his Lord's
   money. David was not of that kind. He was small, but he knew he was not
   too small to sin. He was despised, but he did not, on that account,
   think that he might turn aside from the right path.

   142. Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness. God's Word
   does not change, it is everlasting, and the righteousness which it
   reveals and which it proclaims to us is everlasting.

   142. And Your Law is the Truth. God's Word is not only true, but it is
   "the Truth." The Truth is God's Law and God's Law is the Truth.

   143. Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me. Just now he said that
   he was despised and now he says he is unhappy. Trouble without and
   anguish within seemed to grip him as in a vice.

   143. Yet Your commandments are my delights. A man of the world cannot
   understand how a Christian can be in trouble and yet be full of
   delight, but it is true. We can be cast down, but not destroyed. We can
   be sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. We can be poor, yet make many rich.
   Here you have another holy paradox--"Trouble and anguish have taken
   hold on me, yet Your commandments are my delights"--not only his
   delight, but his delights! As if he had a whole host of them--a great
   company of joys, and a chorus of holy mirth!

   144. The righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting: give me
   understanding. That is a great prayer, not only, "give me to
   understand," but, "give me understanding." It is one thing to tell a
   man the Truth of God, but quite another thing to make him understand
   it. And if you make him understand a particular Truth, he may not
   understand another, but David asks for understanding with which he
   might be able to comprehend all the Truths of God--"Give me
   understanding"--

   144. And I shall live. God grant that this prayer may be offered by
   each one of us and heard by the Lord, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

The Weary Dove's Return

   (No. 2373)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 12, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   20, 1888.

   "But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned
   into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole
   earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark
   to himself." Genesis 8:9.

   NOAH knew that God would, in due time, let him out of the ark. He was
   quite sure that the Lord had not put him into the ark to make a great
   coffin of it--that he and all those living creatures that went in with
   him should perish there. And, because he believed in God, he,
   therefore, removed the covering of the ark and looked abroad,
   expecting, by-and-by, to see not only the tops of the mountains, but
   also a dry and green earth once more. True faith often goes to the
   window. If your faith turns her face to the wall and expects nothing, I
   do not think it is genuine faith. Faith has eyes and, therefore, she
   looks afar off, and she often watches as the watchman of the night
   looks for the gray dawn of the morning. You remember the story of the
   child who went to a Prayer Meeting which was called together to pray
   for rain? She expected that God would send the rain, so she took her
   umbrella with her because she needed to get home dry. I wish that you
   and I had learned the same simple art of faith. Having prayed, and
   having believed, let us expect! Let us open the window and look out!
   God never failed an expectant people, yet, but a great many of His
   people fail to expect. And if you do not expect, you are not likely to
   receive! David said, "My soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation
   is from Him." And when your expectation is from Him, it will not be
   disappointed. It is a great pity when we keep the shutters up so that
   we cannot look out of the window to see the dry land.

   Next, because Noah expected the earth to be dry, he sent out the raven.
   And when the raven did not answer his purpose, he sent out the dove.
   After the dove came back with no tidings, he waited seven days and then
   sent her out again. And when she returned with only an olive leaf in
   her mouth, he waited seven more days and then sent her out again. Oh,
   dear Friends, often send out your doves! Be looking for blessings! You
   have asked for them--God has promised to give them--send out your doves
   to see whether the blessings are not there! And if you do so constantly
   and perseveringly, verily, I say unto you, you shall have your reward!

   Still, notice that Noah, when he had the best evidence that he could
   get that the earth was dry, did not dare to go out of the ark till God
   opened the door. So, gather all the information you possibly can about
   your position and act according to the rules of commonsense. But, after
   you have done that, still wait upon God! When you know from your ravens
   and your doves that the earth is getting dry, do not come out till He
   that shut the door opens it for you. Dear people of God, I wish that we
   had more of that old habit of looking to Providence! We have become so
   wise, nowadays, that we do not require the fiery-cloudy pillar! We run
   without Divine guidance, but, mark you, we often have to run back,
   again. We are guests at the table of Providence and if we will let God
   carve for us, our plate will always have plenty of food on it--but if
   we get to carving for ourselves, we shall cut our fingers--and not cut
   much else! And we shall have great cause to be ashamed that, instead of
   trusting God, we took to trusting ourselves! Do not trust your raven or
   your dove, trust your God! And if you go where He guides you, you will
   go the right way, even if it should be a rough way. And you will have
   to say, "Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
   life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

   Now, to come a little closer to the text and to what we are about to
   say upon it. I do not know where the raven rested, whether he did, as
   some suppose, alight on the corpses floating on the flood, which I
   hardly think is likely, for

   God was preparing the earth for Noah to come back to it, and He would
   not leave it strewn with carcasses, as some have imagined. Whether the
   raven returned to the ark, but refused to come in, or whether it found
   a resting place on the slimy boughs of trees, or on the tops of the
   mountains, which we are told began to be visible, I cannot tell. This,
   I do know, that, wherever the raven rested, the dove could not do
   so--there was no clean place fit for the dove's clean nature. So it had
   to return to the ark and when, weak and weary, it could hardly reach
   the ark, being heavy with the damp, perhaps mired with the filthy water
   into which it may have fallen in its weariness--while just able to get
   as far as the ark--it might have perished in the waters had not Noah
   perceived his little bird coming to the window. I suppose he was
   already there looking out for her and he stretched forth his hand, and
   caught her, and pulled her in, and she was safe in the ark again.

   There are three lessons which I am going to try to teach you from this
   simple little incident. I. The first is, that THUS GOD RECEIVES HIS
   SERVANTS. He receives them unto Himself, just as Noah received this
   dove into the ark.

   Upon this I remark, first, that sometimes God's servants wander. How I
   wish that they never did! Oh, that we so loved our Noah that we never
   left Him and never went away from Him who is our Rest! We are tempted
   and the flesh is frail. Oh, how sadly have some good men wandered! We
   speak this to our shame. We make no excuse for ourselves. We have
   wandered like silly doves--we have left the place of peace and safety
   and joy--and we have gone abroad, flying, we know not where! Perhaps I
   speak to some such at this time.

   Now, if you are one of Christ's doves, you will never rest till you go
   back to Him. Time was when you could have found pleasure in the ways of
   sin, but you cannot do so now. You may try to find it, but you cannot.
   When you were a raven, you might have done so, but now that the Holy
   Spirit has made a dove of you, you are spoilt for the raven's ways.
   When a true child of God wanders into sin at any time, and goes back to
   the old haunts, he thinks to himself, "I used to enjoy myself in this
   place of amusement. I used to make merry with such and such company.
   The pipe and the bowl were once like Heaven on earth to me. But now,"
   he says, "I do not know how it is, but these things seem so vapid, so
   empty. There is not the life, there is not the vivacity about them that
   I knew in my younger days. It seems to be all a more hollow sham, now."
   Ah, my Friend, it is not these things that have altered--it is you that
   the Grace of God has changed! If God means you to live in Heaven, you
   shall never find your Heaven in this world! If He has chosen you to be
   His, and means you to be His, and has put His Spirit within you, you
   must be always restless till you come back and find rest in Him.

   "May I come back?" says one. May you come back? Your Noah is at the
   window waiting for you! Speed towards Him with both your wings! Rest
   not till He puts forth His hand to you and grasps you, and draws you
   into Himself. "But will He have me? Will He have me again?" O bird of
   the weary wing, He is not weary of you! O bird of the wet wing that has
   been soiled in the filthy flood, He will not reject you! He washed you
   once--He will wash you again! He waits to be gracious! Jesus loves to
   receive backsliders. It is the joy of His heart, not only to make a
   sheep out of a goat, but to find one of His sheep that has gone astray!
   Not only to adopt a stranger into His family, but to restore the
   prodigal son! That is the meaning of that parable--it is the
   backslider's parable. Oh, that you would understand it and know that
   the infinite mercy of God is as ready to receive a returning backslider
   as Noah was to receive his wandering dove!

   Now I will turn to another point. The dove in this narrative was not to
   blame, for it had not gone astray, but Noah sent it out and, every now
   and then, the Lord Jesus sends a dove of His to go and spy out the
   world. It is a business upon which we must go if He sends us. Now, what
   is our report of the world? Our report is that there is nothing in the
   world upon which we can rest the sole of our foot. The world is said to
   be progressing, advancing, improving, but we cannot discover it. The
   same sin, the same filthiness, the same universally abounding unbelief
   that our fathers complained of, we are obliged to complain of still!
   And we are weary with the world, weary with the 19th Century and all
   its boasted civilization. There is nothing upon which the sole of our
   foot can rest.

   "What of the Church?" asks one. Well, look at the Church, too. There is
   nothing to rest on. There is much for which to be thankful, but there
   is nothing that can content a spirit that seeks after the Truth of God
   and holiness. I speak what I know, for with weary wings have I fled
   across the waters, and with anxious eyes have I scanned the horizon,
   but there is no place of rest for the sole of my foot! What then? What
   then? Is the servant of God weary with his flight? See what Noah did to
   the dove, for this is what the Lord will do to His servant--"he put
   forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."
   O dear child of God, if you cannot rest in the Church, you can rest in
   Christ! If you cannot

   rest in the world, you can rest in the Lord! "He pulled her in unto
   him." It is a delicious sensation to get away from all men and all
   things to Christ, Himself. He never seems so sweet as when all else is
   bitter! He never appears so substantial as when all else melts before
   you. "He pulled her in unto him." She had done her work; she had taken
   her flight; she had made her investigation. Now she has come back and
   she is in his bosom. "He pulled her in unto him." May that be the
   portion of all my dear friends in Christ who at this time feel heavy
   about the signs of the times! May the Lord draw you into nearer,
   dearer, sweeter fellowship with Himself than you have ever enjoyed
   before, and this will be your best reward!

   Again, to give another case, the Lord's servants are sometimes sent
   forth that they may bring something back with them. You Sunday school
   teachers go out on the Sabbath hoping to bring some child back with
   you. You street-preachers (and may your number be multiplied!) are
   trying to bring something or somebody to Jesus! Workers of different
   sorts who are here, tonight, you go flying abroad to try to find
   someone for Jesus. It may be that you have not picked up even an olive
   leaf, yet--not one "son of peace" has, at present, received your
   benediction. Well, this dove was welcome though she brought nothing
   back. She came back with nothing in her mouth the first time, but then
   we read, "Noah put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto
   him into the ark."

   What, though no child is saved as yet? What, though no hearer in the
   street has responded to the invitation of love? What, though you have
   labored in vain and spent your strength for nothing? You are accepted
   of your God if you have done your best, trusting in the power of the
   Holy Spirit and, tonight He pulls you in unto Himself. If you are
   weary, O Martha, come and sit with Mary! If you are encumbered with the
   serving, come and be refreshed with the communing! After all, you can,
   perhaps, glorify your Lord more by receiving than by giving. You shall
   find it more blessed to yourself to receive Christ than if you could
   bring a soul to Him--He can make it to be so if He pleases. At any
   rate, your hope of going out, again, and bringing in an olive leaf,
   by-and-by, will lie in your coming in, now, and getting in unto your
   Noah and resting on Him until He sends you out again!

   Only one more observation will I make on this first point and it shall
   be a very brief one. As far as I can see, this dove was sent out in the
   morning and she came back in the evening--and Noah pulled her in unto
   him. Brothers, let that be a picture of every day in your lives. When
   you wake in the morning, perhaps the factory bell is ringing. At any
   rate, it is time for you to be off to business. You must think about
   your business. Perhaps yours is a work that is mental. You must give
   your mind to it, so all day long you feel like the dove flying abroad.
   Well, take good heed that when the sun goes down, you make your way
   back home to your Lord! Lock up your heart every morning before you go
   out and give Christ the key to keep till you come home. And then, when
   He opens it at night, the sweet perfume that you had in the morning
   will be there in the evening! It is best if we can keep up our thoughts
   of Christ all day long, but perhaps we cannot--then let the dove, that
   flew away in the morning, be sure to fly back at night! It is where you
   go when the day's toil is done that tells what sort of a man you are!

   I think I have, before now, used the simile of the crows. You cannot
   tell where the crows live early in the morning-- they are out on the
   land following the plow. Farther on in the day they are inspecting a
   field of turnips, perhaps, watching to see if they can find a fly or a
   worm. Where do they live? Wait until the evening, when they get
   together, and then you will see that they make a straight line for
   those tall trees where their nests are! Where do your thoughts go at
   night? Where do they go when your day's toil is done? When you have
   done with the business of the day, which is like the crows picking up
   the worms, which way do you go? That shows where your soul lives, so
   take care that in the evening you make your way back to your Noah. Oh,
   how sweetly does Christ come to us in our evening prayer and put out
   His hand and pull us in unto Himself--and we rest once more--

   "As in the embraces of our God, Or on our Savior's breast."

   Thus have I spoken to you upon my first division, showing that God
   receives His servants as Noah received the dove.

   II. I will now go on to the second part of my subject which is equally
   practical and will be useful to another class of people. THIS IS WHAT
   THE LORD JESUS CHRIST DOES TO SINNERS. I have spoken, first, of His
   servants. Now I want to speak of sinners who are seeking His face.

   Note, then, that the Lord Jesus Christ does not despise the condition
   of the sinner who comes to Him. I have imagined that this dove might
   have fouled its wings. Certainly it was not the beauty that it was when
   Noah sent it out in the morn-ing--but he did not, therefore, refuse to
   take it into the ark. It was very weary and ready to drop into the
   waters, yet

   Noah did not refuse it, but there he stood, at the open window, to meet
   it when it came! And you feel very foul, very unworthy, very unfit, and
   very unsafe--nevertheless, Jesus Christ will not refuse you! Whatever
   your condition may be, He casts out none who come to Him. Come as you
   are! Come even though you feel that you cannot come! Come anyway, for
   He will not reject you.

   The first thing that Noah did with this dove was to display his
   power--"He put forth his hand." I have known the Lord display His power
   very remarkably when poor souls have been coming to Him, putting forth
   His hand, sometimes in Providence, doing some extraordinary thing to
   bring them to decision. Sometimes He has used a sermon, or a stray word
   from some gracious soul, or He has put forth the power of His hand in
   the preaching of His Word. Sometimes He has used a religious book, or a
   little tract as His agent. It has not mattered what the instrumentality
   has been, it is the power which God has put forth which has been the
   means of laying hold upon the coming sinner! Sometimes there has been
   no book and no sermon, but the Holy Spirit, without any apparent means,
   has made an impression upon the conscience and upon the heart. There
   has come over the sinner, when he has begun to seek the Lord, a
   singular melting power, a feeling of solemnity such as he never had
   before. He cannot understand it. He seems to be on the borders of a new
   world. He hears the chimes of bells which he never heard before,
   ringing out of invisible places, and summoning him to his God! I know
   what this experience means and I pray that some of you may know
   it--that just now, at this very moment--our blessed Noah may put forth
   His hand to you poor fluttering doves! You cannot do anything, but
   Jesus can! You cannot save yourselves, but He can save you, even as
   Noah put forth his hand and saved the dove from perishing.

   Then we read, next, that Noah took the dove, seized her, captured her,
   held her. That is what my Lord does. Jesus takes hold of sinners. Oh,
   that He might get a blessed hold of some of you, tonight! I have
   sometimes thought that Noah stood something like this [leaning forward,
   with hands outstretched,] looking out of the window, and when the dove
   came back and was ready to drop, he caught her between his hands, as
   one would tenderly hold a dove, encompassing her, and then he pulled
   her in unto him. What a blessing it is when the Gospel of Christ seems
   to surround you and you get a hand beneath you, and a hand above you,
   and you feel as if Christ had laid hold of you and was leading you
   joyfully captive! Some of you remember when that happened to you--when
   the hand of Jesus was first held out, and then was put round about
   you--and you were taken prisoner and held in gracious bondage to the
   love and power of Christ!

   Then we read that, "He pulled her in," and thus Jesus draws in sinners.
   There is something of a pull needed. Oh, what blessed pulls the Lord
   sometimes gives to bring sinners to decision and put an end to their
   hesitancy! They want to wait a little longer, but the Lord Jesus will
   not have it! Providence and Grace end their delays. They are very
   fearful, fluttering like this dove, afraid of her best friend, but the
   Lord Jesus Christ gives a pull that ends their fears and kills their
   despair. They are His and His powerful love wins the day! Sometimes, it
   is ignorance that keeps sinners back from Christ, for God's doves are
   often very silly creatures. They do not know the way into the ark. They
   miss the window. But Jesus does with them as Noah did with the
   dove--"He pulled her in." I hope I am not talking beyond the experience
   of many of you, or, if I am, I pray my Master to make this to be your
   experience even now. May these poor simple words of mine induce some of
   you to come to Christ at once! Why will you perish? Why will you delay?
   Why not be pulled in tonight, even as the dove was pulled in by Noah? I
   cannot pull you in. I would if I could, but Jesus can! And He cannot be
   less willing to bless you than I am!

   Notice where Christ draws sinners. Noah pulled the dove in unto himself
   and that is what Christ does with His poor fluttering doves! He draws
   them to Himself. You say that you need a lot of things. No you do
   not--you only need Jesus. If you have Him, you have everything! You
   need to be pulled into peace, to joy, to holiness, to rest. Yes, but
   what you really need is to be pulled into Jesus and you will get all
   the other blessings! Drawn to His wounds, poor doves, you shall find
   your hiding place! Drawn to His wounds, poor doves, you shall find the
   truest cleansing! This is what your Master must do for you, even as
   Noah pulled the dove in unto himself.

   And when he had pulled her into himself, then she was in the ark and
   she soon found other doves. Thus, Jesus draws sinners in unto
   salvation. When He draws a man to Himself, then He draws Him to the
   Church and he comes where he shall meet with fit society that shall
   console him and help him during the rest of his days. I cannot preach
   as I would, but I know that I am telling you that which, if my Lord
   will but bless it, will save and comfort your souls! I pray Him to put
   me on one side, altogether, and to come--and with His own pierced hands
   pull you in unto Himself!

   III. So I finish with this third point. THAT WHICH JESUS DOES TO HIS
   SERVANTS AND TO SINNERS, HE WOULD HAVE US DO. Now, you people of God,
   listen to me, and do what I now entreat of you in my Master's name.

   In the first place, look out for souls. Now, Noah, go to the window!
   There is that dove, you know, fluttering some-where--go and look out
   for it, go to the window, Noah! He does not need to be told to go, for
   there he is. Noah loves his dove, so he is watching for her at the
   window. Dear people of God, often go to the window! In your families
   look for the salvation of your children. In your workshops look for the
   salvation of your employees and those with whom you work! Perhaps that
   is a new thought to some of you. If you can get them to work for a
   little less money, you look out for that, but oh, that you would look
   out for their salvation! To see your employees saved is the best profit
   that you can, any of you, have! Watch for their souls and do so, not
   only at home, but when you come to your place of worship. We have
   friends in this Tabernacle who are looking all over the place while I
   am speaking. I do not say that they are not attending to my message,
   but I do not think they are attending so much to my words as to those
   to whom I am speaking! I have frequently seen a Brother making his way
   very quietly down to a certain spot where he has noticed some of you
   sitting very attentively, some newcomers, perhaps, who have never been
   here before, and it is more than likely that he will speak to some of
   you before this service is over.

   I hope somebody will ask you whether you are saved and, if so, you will
   begin to find that there are some who desire to bring you into close
   quarters! I think that it ought to be so. I cannot bear the thought of
   your coming here without getting a blessing. I have to fire the Gospel
   cannon from this platform--it is loaded with grape shot and it often
   does great execution--yet many of you may not be hit that way, but,
   happily, my friends can come to you with their little pocket pistols
   and so reach many whom I miss! Get to close quarters with them,
   Brothers and Sisters! Find out whether they are saved or not! We need a
   great deal of this kind of work. Now then, Noah, go to the window and
   look out--be you an old Christian or a young Christian--be on the look
   out for sinners!

   Noah goes to the window and, sure enough, there is his dove. Then Noah
   stretches out his hands, as I want you to do. Stretch out a hand to
   sinners. Do it very gently, for doves are not bears, you know--the
   souls of men are not like the skins of tigers. Stretch out your hands
   to sinners, but do it in a very loving and gentle way. Try, if you can,
   to let them see that there is a friend near who will be happy to help
   them to Christ. Stretch out your hands and if you can, lay hold of
   them. I do not know how Noah caught his dove, whether by the wings, or
   the legs, or the neck, but he did catch her, and pulled her into the
   ark. Now try if you can to lay hold of a soul for Christ--get a firm
   grip on it! This is not child's play! He that can catch doves with his
   hands is a wise man and he that would win souls must be wise. Try to
   catch souls, if you can, but do it gently. Remember that they are doves
   and, therefore, be very tender and very gentle with them. But, being
   doves, they are apt to fly away--therefore hold them fast--and do not
   let them go.

   Perhaps they will not like you to touch them. Never mind that--go on as
   mildly and lovingly as you can, yet do seek to give them a pull and do
   not rest until they are with you in the ark, that is to say, till they
   are in Christ! Till they are trusting Him, till they are resting in
   Him, till His precious blood has washed them and they are saved, as you
   trust you are!

   I do not think that we are half earnest enough in dealing with our
   fellow men. I remember a young man who, when dying, said to his
   brother, "I am afraid I am lost, my brother, and I cannot help saying
   to you, 'Why were you not more earnest about my salvation?'" His elder
   brother answered, "John, I have spoken to you once or twice about your
   soul." "Once or twice!" replied the other, "You ought to have been
   always at me." "Well, but I did frequently speak to you about Divine
   things." "But," said he, "if you knew that I was perishing, why did you
   not shake me? Why did you not do something unusual with me? Why did you
   not weep over me? Why did you not force me to think? My soul is lost
   and you have shown but very little care about it."

   Perhaps that was a very hard thing to say, and an unkind thing, and a
   self-excusing thing, but do you not think that some people might say
   that of you and of me? We have never been earnest enough in seeking the
   salvation of their souls. Mr. Rowland Hill's story about this matter is
   a good one. He said, "I hear them say that poor old Mr. Hill makes a
   great noise and often shouts when he is preaching, the poor old
   gentleman gets quite excited." "Yes," added Mr. Hill, "and I was one
   day walking out at Wotton-under-Edge, and I was going by a gravel pit,
   or a chalk pit, and it fell in and buried a man. And I went running
   down into the village as fast as ever my old legs would carry me,
   crying out that there was a

   man likely to be buried alive--and the people rushed out to try to save
   him! And they did not say, then, as they do, now, 'Poor old Mr. Hill is
   making a deal of noise.'"

   Oh, that we were as earnest about the souls of men as we can sometimes
   be about their bodies! Do try, then, you who love the Lord, to pull
   them in, even as Noah pulled the dove in unto himself into the ark.

   I leave the text with you. When I cannot preach, I always wish that all
   of you may be preaching. If the preacher seems to speak feebly, take up
   what he has said and work at it, and go and do better with it. And if
   you will do so, it will be better than if I, alone, had done better.
   The Lord bless you, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Genesis 8.

   1. And God remembered Noah. Noah had been shut up in the ark for many a
   day and, at the right time, God thought of him, practically thought of
   him and came to visit him. Dear Heart, you have been shut out from the
   world, now, for many days, but God has not forgotten you. God
   remembered Noah and He remembers you.

   1. And every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the
   ark. Does God remember cattle? Then He will certainly remember men made
   in His own image! He will remember you, though you think yourself the
   most worthless one on the face of the earth! "God remembered Noah and
   every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark."

   1. And God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters subsided.
   Winds and waves are wholly under God's control. I suppose that this was
   a very drying wind, so the waters began to turn to vapor and gradually
   to disappear. It is God who sends the winds. They seem most volatile
   and irregular, but God sends them to do His bidding. Blow it east, or
   blow it west, the wind comes from God! And whether the waters increase
   or are subsided, it is God's doing. Are the waters very deep with you,
   dear Friend? God can dry them up and, amazingly enough, he can stop one
   trouble with an-other--he can dry up the water with the wind. I have
   known Him act very strangely with His people and when they thought they
   were quite forgotten, He has proved that He remembered them, and both
   the winds of Heaven and the waters of the sea have had to work their
   good! There is not an angel in Heaven but God will make him to be a
   servant to you if you need him--there is not a wind in any quarter of
   the globe but God will guide it to you if it is necessary--and there
   are no waves of the sea but shall obey the Lord's will concerning you.

   2. The fountains, also, of the deep and the windows of Heaven were
   stopped, and the rain from Heaven was restrained. God works upwards and
   stops the windows of Heaven. He works downwards and stops the breaking
   up of the fountains of the deep--

   "He everywhere has sway,

   And all things serve His might." Be not afraid! He can open the windows
   of Heaven and pour down abundant blessings for you, and He can let down
   the cellar-flaps of the great deep and stop its flowing fountains--

   "When He makes bare His arm,

   What shall His work withstand?" 3-5. And the waters returned from of
   the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days,
   the waters were abated. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the
   seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. And the
   waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month,
   on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. God
   told Noah when to go into the ark, but He did not tell him when he
   should come out again. The Lord told Noah when to go in, for it was
   necessary for him to know that, but He did not tell him when he should
   come out, for it was not necessary that he should know that. God always
   lets His people know what is practically for their good. There are many
   curious points on which we should like to have information, but God has
   not revealed them, and when He has not revealed anything, we had better
   not try to unravel the mystery! No good comes of prying into
   unre-vealed Truths of God. Noah knew that he would come out of the ark
   one day, for was he not preserved there to be a seed--to keep the race
   alive? Noah was not told when he would be released and the Lord does
   not tell you when your trouble will come to an end. It will come to an
   end, therefore wait and be patient, but do not want to know the time of
   your deliverance. We would know too much if we knew all that will
   happen in the future. It is quite enough for us if we do our duty in
   the present--and trust God for the rest.

   Still, I think that Noah must have been very pleased when he felt the
   ark grating, at last, on the mountains of Ararat. He could not build a
   dock for his big ship, but God had prepared a berth for it on the
   mountain side. Now, as he looked out, he could see, here and there, a
   mountaintop rising like an island out of the great expanse of water.

   6, 7. And it came to pass at the end offorty days, that Noah opened the
   window of the ark which he had made: and he sent forth a raven, which
   went forth, to and fro. Sometimes alighting on the ark, then flying
   away again.

   7-10. Until the waters were dried up from of the earth. Also he sent
   forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the
   face of the ground; but the dove found no rest for the sole of her
   foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on
   the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand and took her,
   and pulled her in unto him into the ark. And he stayed yet another
   seven days. I wonder whether Noah sent out these creatures on the
   Sabbath mornings. The mention of seven days and the resting in between
   seems to look like it. Oh, dear Friends, sometimes people send out a
   raven on the Lord's-Day morning and it never brings them anything. Send
   out a dove, rather than a raven! Come to the House of God with quiet,
   gentle, holy expectation and your dove will come back to you! It may be
   that it will bring you something worth bringing one of these days, as
   Noah's dove brought to him.

   10, 11. And again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove
   came unto him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf
   pluck off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
   The waters were abated as far as the fruit trees--not only the tallest
   forest trees, but some of the fruit trees were uncovered from the
   water. The dove had plucked off "an olive leaf." Perhaps you have seen
   a picture of the dove carrying an olive branch in its mouth, which, in
   the first place, a dove could not pluck out of the tree and, in the
   second place, a dove could not carry an olive branch even if she could
   pluck it off. It was an olive leaf, that is all. Why cannot people keep
   to the Words of Scripture? If the Bible mentions a leaf, they make it a
   branch, and if the Bible says it is a branch, they make it a leaf.

   12. And he stayed yet another seven days; and sent forth the dove;
   which returned not again unto him any more. Noah could read something
   from that leaf that the dove brought to him, but he learned more when
   she did not return to him. He knew that she had found a proper resting
   place and that the earth was clear of the flood!

   13. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
   first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
   off the earth. That was a happy New Year's day for Noah! He was glad to
   find himself at rest once more, though not yet at liberty.

   13. And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold,
   the face of the ground was dry. Why did not Noah come out? Well, you
   see, he had gone in by the door and he meant to come out by the door.
   And He that opened the door for him, and shut him in, must now open the
   door for him and let him out. He waits God's time and we are always
   wise in doing that. You lose a great deal of time by being in a hurry.
   Many people think they have done a great deal when they have really
   done nothing. Better take time in order to save time. Slow is sometimes
   faster than fast. So Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked
   out, but he did not go out till God commanded him to do so.

   14. And in the second month. Nearly two months Noah waited for the
   complete drying of the earth.

   14. On the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
   "The face of the ground was dry" in the first month. "The earth was
   dried," the second month. Noah might have thought it was dry enough,
   before, but God did not think so--there was enough mud to breed a
   pestilence--so Noah must wait until God had made the earth ready for
   him.

   15- 16. And God spoke unto Noah, saying, Go forth of the ark. Noah must
   wait till God speaks to him. Oh, that some people would wait for God's
   command, but they will not! He shall bless your going out and your
   coming in if you will go forth and come in when He bids you. "Go
   forth," says the Lord, "Go forth of the ark."

   16- 19. You, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with
   you. Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you, of all
   flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that
   creeps upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and
   be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth, and his
   sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: every beast, every
   creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatever creeps upon the earth,
   after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. That was a very wonderful
   procession! It was the new beginning of everything upon the earth!
   Whatever evolution or any other folly or evil of man may have done,
   everything had to begin over. Everybody was drowned save these great
   fathers of the new age--and all must begin from this stock.

   20. And Noah built an altar unto the LORD, and took of every clean
   beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
   altar. Commonsense would have said, "Spare them, for you will need
   every one of them." But Grace said,

   "Slay them, for they belong to God. Give Jehovah His due." I have often
   admired that widow of Zarephath. When she had but a handful of meal,
   she made a little cake for God's Prophet, first, but then God
   multiplied her meal and her oil. Oh, if we would but seek, first, the
   Kingdom of God and His righteousness, all things would be added unto
   us! Out of the small stock he had, Noah took of the clean beasts and of
   the clean fowls, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

   21. And the LORD smelled a sweet savor. Noah's faith was pleasing to
   God. It was Noah's confidence in a bleeding sacrifice that gave him
   acceptance with the Lord. God thought upon His Son and that great
   Sacrifice to be offered long afterwards on the Cross and He, "smelled a
   sweet savor."

   21. And the LORD said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground
   any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil
   from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
   as I have done. God always speaks comfortable words to those who bring
   an acceptable sacrifice. If you would hear the voice of a Divine
   promise, go to the atoning blood of Jesus. If you would know what
   perfect reconciliation means, hasten to the Altar where the great
   Sacrifice was presented.

   22. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,
   and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. They never
   have ceased. We have had, this year, a long and dreary winter. It
   looked as if spring would never come. Only a few days ago the chestnuts
   were just beginning to turn green and then there came the little
   spikes. And now you can see them in full flower. How faithfully God
   fulfils His Covenant with the earth! How truly will He keep His
   Covenant with every believing sinner! Oh, trust in Him, for His promise
   will stand fast forever!

Blessed Discipline

   (No. 2374)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 19, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 24,
   1888.

   "Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O LORD, and teach out of Your
   Law; that You may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the
   pit is dug for the wicked. For the LORD will not cast off His people,
   neither will He forsake His inheritance. But judgment shall return unto
   righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it." Psalm
   94:12-15.

   THERE are times when the wicked seem to have things all their own way.
   This earth is not the realm of final justice--we are not yet standing
   before the Lord's great Judgement Seat. God permits many things to be,
   for a while, in confusion. They who are highest with Him are often
   lowest with men and, those for whom He has no regard seem to heap up
   the treasures of the world till their eyes stand out with fatness, and
   they have more than heart can wish! Let no child of God be astonished
   at this arrangement. It has often been so in the past and it has been
   the great enigma that has puzzled the world. The children of God have
   also sat down and looked into it, but it has been, even to them, a
   great deep which they could not fathom. They have sighed over it, but
   their sighs have not altered the facts. It is still true that often the
   wicked triumph and the servants of iniquity delight themselves in the
   high places of the earth. The righteous need not wonder that they
   suffer, now, for that has been the lot of God's people all along, and
   there have been certain times in human history when God has seemed to
   be altogether deaf to the cries of His suffering people. Remember the
   martyr age and the days of the Covenanters, who were hunted upon the
   mountains like the partridge. You must not wonder if the easy places of
   the earth are not yours and if the sentinel's stern duties should fall
   to your lot. It is so, and so it must be, for God has so ordained it.

   To comfort any of the Lord's children who have begun to worry
   themselves because things do not go with them as they desire, I have
   selected this text, and I pray the Lord to bless it to them.

   I. First, I shall ask you to notice that GOD'S CHILDREN ARE UNDER
   INSTRUCTION.

   Other children may run about and take holiday. They may wander into the
   woods, gather the flowers and do very much what they like, but God's
   own children have to go to school. This is a great privilege for them,
   although they do not always think so. Children are not often good
   judges of what is best for themselves. No doubt we should like to play
   the truant--we should be very glad to put away our schoolbags, quit the
   schoolhouse, go out by ourselves and wander at our own sweet will--but
   our heavenly Father loves us too well to let it be so with us. Because
   we are His children, therefore He will have us trained and prepared for
   that high destiny which awaits us, by-and-by.

   Note how this tuition is described in our text. The very first word
   concerning it is, "chasten." "Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O
   Lord, and teach," as if the chastening were the primary part of the
   teaching, as if it occupied so large a share of it that it was put
   first. "Blessed is the man whom you chasten, O Lord, and teach." In
   God's school house the rod is still extant--with the Lord, chastening
   is teaching. He does not spoil His children, but chastens them, yes,
   even unto scourging, as the Apostle puts it. His chastening is the most
   severe with those whom He loves best--"Whom the Lord tenderly loves He
   chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives." Some of us know
   what it is to have this teaching by chastening. I have often told you
   that I am afraid I have never learned anything of God except by the rod
   and, in looking back, I am afraid that I must confirm that statement. I
   have forgotten some of the gentle lessons, but when they have been
   whipped into me, I have remembered them.

   I met with a friend the other day who said that it was the very reverse
   with him. He could not remember any benefit that he had ever gained by
   chastening and he thought that all the good he had received from the
   Lord had come to him by tenderness and prosperity. I did not argue with
   him about the matter, for the experiences of God's people may differ,
   but this I know, dear Friends, that some of us have learned much from
   the Lord's chastening rod!

   For instance, we have learned the evil of sin. "Before I was afflicted
   I went astray: but now have I kept Your Word." There are some sorrows
   that evidently come as the result of our own folly. We have to reap the
   harvest of the seed that we sow and, by this process we are made to see
   that it is an exceedingly evil and bitter thing to sin against God.
   This is an important lesson. I wish that more had thoroughly learned
   it. I wish that some Christian professors had anything like a true idea
   of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, but I believe that instruction upon
   this point often comes from the chastening hand of God.

   Our chastening teaches us the unsatisfactory nature of worldly things.
   We can easily become attached to the things which we possess. It is a
   very difficult thing to handle gold without allowing it to adhere to
   your fingers and, when it gets into your purse, you need much Grace to
   prevent it getting into your heart. Even our children can soon grow
   into idols--and our health and our comfort may make us forget God. I
   never knew affliction and trial to make us do that, but when the gourds
   are taken away, then the sun shines on us. How often has God shaken all
   the leaves off our trees and then we have seen the heavens which we
   never saw when all the leaves were green! By losing this, and losing
   that, we are made to feel that all the things which we possess perish
   in the using and are such temporary joys that we cannot hope to fill
   our hearts with them.

   Do we not, also, learn by affliction our own frailty and our own
   impatience? We are wonderfully patient when we have nothing to suffer,
   as we are all great heroes and very courageous when there is no
   fighting to be done. We sometimes say to one another, "What a mass of
   faith that Brother has! What a vast mountain of faith that Sister
   possesses!" We are almost inclined to envy them, but we remember the
   fable of the stag which had such magnificent antlers that he said to
   himself, as he looked at his fine figure in the water, "It is most
   absurd for us stags to be afraid of dogs. The next time I hear a dog
   bark, I will just toss him on my horns and there will soon be an end of
   him." Yes, so he thought, but just then the baying of a hound was heard
   in the distance and the boastful stag took to his heels and ran as fast
   as the rest of the herd did! So it is often with those who seem to have
   great faith when they do not need it--but when they do need it, where
   is it? Stretch some men upon a bed of sickness for a week or two and
   see whether they will be able to swagger at the rate they now do! They
   would sing another song, I guarantee you, if once they had such a twist
   of pain as some of us have had to endure, and the beads of perspiration
   stood on their brow while they tried to bear it. Ah, yes, we find how
   great our weakness is when first, one thing is taken away, and then
   another, and the chastening hand of God makes the blows to fall thick
   and heavy upon us!

   Do we not, then, learn also, the value of prayer? I said to this friend
   to whom I have referred, "Did you not pray much more under your
   affliction than you did before?" "Oh, yes!" he replied. "I grant you
   that--

   Trials give new life to prayer."

   Do we ever pray in such dead earnest as when everything seems to be
   sinking from under our feet and our sweetest cups are full of
   bitterness? Then we turn to God and say, "Show me why You contend with
   me." I do not think that we ever pray with such fervor of supplication
   in our prosperity as we do in our adversity.

   And then how precious the promises become! As we only see the stars
   when the shadows gather at night, so the promises shine out like
   newly-kindled stars when we get into the night of affliction! I am sure
   that there are passages of Scripture which are full of consolation, the
   depths of which we do not even imagine--and we shall never know all
   that is in them till we get into the deeps of soul trouble which
   correspond with them. There are points of view from which scenery is to
   be beheld at its best and, until we find out those points of view, we
   may be missing the sight of some of the most beautiful objects in
   nature! God leads us one way and another by our chastisements to
   understand and prize His promises.

   And, oh, dear Friends, how should we ever know the faithfulness of God
   if it were not for affliction? We might talk about it and theoretically
   understand it, but to try to prove the greatness of Jehovah's love and
   the absolute certainty of His eternal faithfulness--this comes not
   except by the way of affliction and trial!

   I might talk on forever about the sweet uses of adversity and not
   exhaust the subject. You experienced people of God know even more than
   I do about this matter, for some of you have done business in deeper
   waters than my boat has yet plowed, and yet, I think my keel has passed
   over the deep places of the sea of trouble, and there may be deeper
   depths before me still. I have probably said enough to prove to you
   that chastening is a Divine way of instructing us. You will find that
   if you want the most Christ-like saints, and the most deeply
   experimental Believers, and the Christians who are best acquainted with
   the Word of God, you must look for them among those who are the most
   intimately acquainted with the fiery furnace and its burning heat.

   If you read the text through, dear Friends, you will notice that the
   rod is not without the Word. I call your special attention to
   that--"Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O Lord, and teach Him out
   of Your Law." The rod and the Book go together! The rod drives us to
   the Book and the Book explains the meaning of the rod! We must have
   them both if we would be fully instructed in the things of God. The
   Word of God is our school book. At first, it is our primer, and when we
   get furthest advanced in Grace, it will be our most profound classic!
   And all the way along it will supply us with our choicest poetry and
   everything else that we desire.

   We look to the Bible for comfort when we are chastened--we turn over
   its pages and seek to find a passage which fits our case and ministers
   relief to our necessity. Have you not often done so? Why, this Book is
   something like the locksmith's bunch of keys! Perhaps you have lost the
   key of your drawer and you cannot get at your things. You send for the
   smith and he keeps on trying different keys till, at last, he finds one
   that exactly fits the wards of your lock. So, if you keep on fingering
   away at the promises, you will come, at last, upon one that was made on
   purpose for your case! Perhaps your lock is one with very peculiar
   wards--you could never make out why it was shaped just as it is--but
   now that you have found the key that opens it, you understand that both
   lock and key were made to fit each other.

   The Word of God is not only used at such times for comfort, but also
   for direction. How frequently you have been unable to see your way! You
   have wished that there was some Prophet of God with the Urim and
   Thummim, that he might tell you what to do. The great guiding
   principles of God's Truth, His Law and His Gospel, faith in Him and in
   His Providential care, have furnished you with a direction quite as
   clear as if some Prophet had plainly told you what to do. You have
   sought the direction of the Word of the Lord when you have gone to
   enquire in His Temple--He has answered you out of the secret place of
   thunder--and you have known without a doubt the way that you should
   take. That, then, is the second use of the Word, first for comfort, and
   next for direction.

   At such times, too, we have proved, dear Friends, the power of the Word
   of God. When your vessel is sailing along very smoothly, the Word of
   God may grow to be a dead letter with you, but when the waves are
   rolling mountains high, and dashing over you, and you are soaked
   through and through and fear that the deep will swallow you up, then
   you begin to test the promises and to prove the power of the Word of
   God! When its inexpressible sweetness reaches your heart, then you can,
   indeed, feel that you have been taught out of God's Word. You see how
   the two things go together--"Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O
   Lord, and teach Him out of Your Law." O Lord, still use the rod if You
   see that it is necessary. But go on teaching us out of Your Word! We
   are slow to learn and poor scholars at the best, but You may yet make
   something of us.

   That leads me to say that, according to our text, God Himself is our
   Teacher. He is not satisfied with giving us a Book and smiting us when
   we are inattentive to its teachings, but He, Himself, teaches us. Was
   there ever a Teacher so full of wisdom, a Teacher who understood His
   pupils so well, a Teacher so altogether master of the whole art of
   teaching? Was there ever a Teacher so patient, so able to apply His
   lessons to the heart, itself, so full of power to give understanding as
   well as to make the thing clear to the understanding when it is given?
   Happy people, who have God to be their Tutor! Happy pupils, even
   though, when the school bell rings, you have half a mind to stay away
   and play with yonder children who do not belong to your school! Yet
   happy are you if you are truly God's scholars. Even if, every now and
   then, your days are spent in weeping, and your lessons are so badly
   done that they bring the rod upon you, yet are you happy children.
   "Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O Lord, and teach Him out of Your
   Law." So much, then, for our first head.

   II. Now upon our second point I will say a little, and only a little.
   We have had God's children under instruction. Now let us think of GOD'S
   CHILDREN EDUCATED. The Lord has chastened and taught His child for this
   purpose-- "That You may give him rest from the days of adversity, until
   the pit is dug for the wicked." "What?" you ask, "chas-

   tened to give us rest? It is usual for chastening to break our rest."
   Yes, I know that it is so with other chastening, but in very deed this
   is the way in which God gives rest to His people.

   First, we learn to rest in the will of God. Our will is naturally very
   stubborn and when we are chastened, at first we fight back, like a
   bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, but by degrees we feel that we must
   bear the yoke. We then go a little further and we feel that we ought to
   bear it, even though God should lay upon us anything He pleases, and we
   should feel it very galling. By-and-by, the yoke begins to fit our neck
   and we come even to love it. I do not suppose that many of us will ever
   get like Samuel Rutherford, when he said that he began to wonder which
   he loved better--Christ or his cross--for his cross had brought him so
   much blessing that he was quite in love with it. No, we have not
   reached that point, yet, so that we love our cross--still, we can say
   this, that we have learned that it is--

   "Sweet to lie passive in His hands, And know no will but His."

   If we struggle against God's will, we only increase our sorrow. Our
   self-will usually lies at the root of our greatest griefs. Give way,
   and you have won! Yield to God and you have obtained the blessing you
   desire. The bitterness is gone out of your grief when you consent to be
   grieved if God will have it so.

   We make advances in our spiritual education when we learn to rest after
   our afflictions. When any trouble is over, great delights often come to
   us. It is with us as it was with our Master--He had been with the wild
   beasts--worse, still, He had been tempted of the devil. But angels came
   and ministered to Him. There is, to a Believer, sometimes, a
   wonderfully clear shining after the rain. Perhaps there is no happier
   period of life than the state of convalescence, when the sick man is
   gradually recovering his former strength after a long illness. So God
   gives surprising peace to His people when He takes away their troubles,
   but He also gives them a great measure of peace in their troubles.
   Thus, for another lesson, we learn to rest in adversity. The Lord
   chastens us in order that we may learn how to stand fast and bear up
   bravely while the trouble is yet upon us.

   I have often had to notice the singularity of my Lord's loving kindness
   and tenderness to myself in the time of need. I do not say that it is
   singularity for Him, for He is often doing it, but the singularity lies
   in the fact that the Lord does it when nobody else could or would do
   it. He gives us comfort when nobody else is either willing or able to
   render any comfort to us. This very afternoon I have had a remarkable
   instance of how good cheer is sent to me by my gracious God just when I
   most need it. I was heavy and sad at heart and there came to my door,
   to see me, a foreign gentleman, an officer of considerable rank in the
   Italian army. He spoke to me in very good English, but I cannot tell
   you all that he said to me, though it was most cheering and kind. I
   asked him why he should come so far to see me.

   He spoke of me as though I were a great man and I assured him that he
   was quite mistaken, for I was nothing of the kind. As we walked along
   and talked, he said, "But you are the greatest man in all the world to
   me." "Why is that?" I asked. And He answered, "I was a Catholic, and a
   bad Catholic, too. I did not rightly know anything about the Lord Jesus
   Christ and I was fast becoming an infidel. But I met with a sermon of
   yours in Italian and, by reading it, I was brought into the light and
   liberty of the Gospel. I found the Savior and I felt that I must come
   and tell you about it." Then he further cheered and encouraged my heart
   by letting me see how much he knew of our Lord Jesus--and he had
   learned it all from nothing but the Bible, itself--which he had read
   after being guided to it by a stray sermon of mine.

   "Well," I thought, "my Master sends this man all the way from the south
   of Italy to come just at this particular time, when I was sorely
   needing just such a comforting message." Why should He do so? Only that
   He likes, when His children have to take bitter medicine, to give them
   a piece of sugar after it! Therefore, my Brothers and Sisters, be
   willing to take your medicine, otherwise there may come a sharp
   chastening with it. Oh, for Grace so to suffer, and so to endure, that
   we may give ourselves up into the hands of the Ever-Blessed One, and
   thus He will perfect in us the instruction of His wonderful Word! Then
   shall it be true that the Lord has taught us to rest even in the days
   of our adversity.

   Much more might be said upon this part of my subject, especially about
   learning to look beyond this present life, but I have not the time or
   the strength to say it.

   III. I must now go on to the third point which is that GOD'S CHILDREN
   ARE STILL DEAR TO HIM. We have

   thought of them at school, chastened and instructed, and we have seen
   them learning a few lessons. Now let us notice how dear they are to
   their Lord at all times, for the text says, "The Lord will not cast off
   His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance."

   First, then, the Lord will not cast off His people. Sometimes you are
   cast down, but you are never cast off. Sometimes others cast you off,
   but the Lord will not cast off His people! Sometimes you are cast into
   the furnace. Yes, it may be so, but in the furnace you are not cast
   off. Metal put into the furnace is not thrown away. Had it been
   worthless, it might have been left on the heap with the slag. But it is
   put into the furnace because it is of value. When you are put into the
   furnace and into the greatest heat that can be obtained, it is that the
   Lord may take away your dross and purify you for His service--

   "In the furnace God may prove you. There to bring you forth more
   bright. But can never cease to love you-- You are precious in His
   sight! God is with you, God, your everlasting light."

   "The Lord will not cast off His people." Lay hold of that precious
   assurance! Even if Satan should come and whisper to you, "The Lord has
   cast you off," do not believe it! It cannot be. The devil has his
   cast-offs, but God has no cast-offs. Sometimes He takes the devil's
   castaways and makes them to be the trophies of His mighty Grace--and
   when He has done so, they are His people, concerning whom the Psalmist
   says, "The Lord will not cast off His people."

   Then, further, the Lord will not forsake His people, for it is added,
   "Neither will He forsake His inheritance." He chose them to be His
   inheritance. He has bought them as His inheritance and He will never
   forsake them! Still shall you be supported by the Lord, but never
   forsaken by Him! Still shall you be owned by Him, but never forsaken.
   Still shall you be kept, defended against all comers, and preserved to
   be the Lord's own people, for He will not forsake His inheritance!

   I do not feel as if I need say much more upon this theme, but it is
   enough for me, I think, just to remind you of those precious Words of
   our great and gracious Father which are many times repeated in His
   Word, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you," and leave them with
   you, His children. Take them and feed upon them! God give you to know
   the full comfort of them!

   IV. So I shall close with this fourth point--GOD'S PEOPLE WILL BE
   RIGHTED IN THE END. "Judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all
   the upright in heart shall follow it."

   Just now, judgement has gone away. It has gone up to its own land.
   Judgment is within the veil, but there are reasons for its absence from
   us. Judgment has gone away, perhaps, that it may try the faith of God's
   people. The Lord does not, today, strike down the profane, nor slay the
   hypocrite, as He might if He dealt with them in strict justice.
   Judgment has gone out of the world for a while, though it watches and
   records all things. It is gone, partly, for our trial and testing, that
   we may learn to trust an absent God and Savior. Judgment is also gone
   away in order that mercy may be extended to the ungodly, that they may
   live and that they may turn to God, for He wills not the death of any,
   but that they may turn to Him and live. Judgment has gone up to the
   Throne for a while until the wicked shall have completed the full
   measure of their sin, "until the pit is dug for the wicked." Not yet is
   the iniquity of the Amorites full--and judgment has gone away and will
   stay away until it is.

   Do not be in a hurry, child of God! The Lord has timed His absence.
   Listen to this next Word--"Judgement shall return unto righteousness."
   You shall soon hear the trumpet. You shall hear the sound of that
   blast, "the loudest and the last," telling you that the day of the
   great assize has come and that the Judge has arrived to right all
   wrongs, to punish all iniquity and to reward all virtue, all true,
   faithful service! "Judgment shall return." We cannot tell how long it
   will linger, but it will return. Christ will come again! As surely as
   He ascended into Heaven, He will so come in like manner as He went up.
   He shall judge the earth in righteousness and His people with His
   Truth. Behold, He comes! And when He comes, judgment shall return unto
   righteousness.

   And what then? Judgement shall be welcomed by the godly. When it comes,
   "all the upright in heart shall follow it." The chariot of
   righteousness shall lead the way and all the people of God shall follow
   it in a glorious procession. Then shall they receive their Lord's
   commendation, "Well done, good and faithful servants." They shall
   follow it as they wear their golden crowns, no, as they cast them at
   the foot of the Throne of God, saying, "You are worthy, O Lord, to
   receive glory, and honor, and power." Saints will follow the chariot of
   judgment coming forth from their concealment and shining as the sun in
   the Kingdom of their Father! They shall come from the places where
   slander has banished them and

   show themselves, again, and God shall be glorified in them! Now you who
   love the Lord, be not in a hurry to have all this fulfilled. Leave your
   cases in the dear hands of Him who will, ere long, judge all
   righteously.

   I have done when I have reminded you that He is accursed who has never
   felt the chastening hand of God, or sat at His feet to learn of Him.
   But he is blessed, indeed, who yields himself entirely up to the
   discipline of the Lord. May it be so with everyone of you, for our Lord
   Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON:

   Let us read, this evening, the 94th Psalm, and may the Spirit of God
   instruct us while we read it!

   Verse 1. O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom
   vengeance belongs, show Yourself. God is the God of Justice and when
   iniquity and oppression prevail, it is natural that His people should
   call upon Him to come forth out of His hiding places. Sometimes, when
   oppression and iniquity and error prevail, it seems as if God had
   hidden Himself away. Hence the prayer of the Psalmist, "O Jehovah, the
   God of recompenses (or revenges, as the margin has it), show Yourself."

   2. Lift up Yourself, You judge of the earth: render a reward to the
   proud. As one who is about to strike a heavy blow lifts himself up to
   increase the force of the stroke, so the Psalmist prays to the Lord,
   "Lift up Yourself, You Judge of the earth. The proud are lifted up;
   lift up Yourself. They boast, they glory, Lord, show them how great a
   God You are in the defense of righteousness; lift up Yourself, You
   Judge of the earth."

   3. LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
   That question, "how long?" uttered twice over, sounds a little like
   howling, and, sometimes, God's saints get so dispirited that they cry
   to God and weep and wail before Him until their wailing becomes almost
   like howling--"Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the
   wicked triumph?"

   4. 5. How long shall they utter and speak hard things? And all the
   workers of iniquity boast themselves? They break in pieces Your people,
   O LORD, and afflict Your heritage. Their words are heavier than stones
   and when they hurl them at the Lord's people with cruel intent, they do
   great mischief. "They utter and speak hard things. All the workers of
   iniquity boast themselves." It seems to be the mark of the righteous
   that they are humble and lowly--and the mark of the wicked that they
   are boastful and proud. They have nothing of which they ought to boast,
   yet they boast very loudly. Pride is ingrained in our evil nature and
   the more there is of sin in us, the more there is of boasting by us.

   6. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Do
   you wonder that the Psalmist prayed, "O God of Vengeance, show
   Yourself"? Can you see the fatherless robbed and the widow and the
   stranger oppressed, without feeling your indignation burn? He who is
   never indignant has no virtue in him! He who cannot burn like coals of
   juniper against evil does not truly love righteousness. The Psalmist
   was not a man of that sort--he was righteously angry with the wicked
   who slew the widow and the stranger--and murdered the fatherless.

   7. Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob
   regard it. They were practically atheists, for, if they had a god,
   nominally, they regarded him as a god who did not observe sins, a blind
   deity, a god who took no note of evil! Do you not think that this is
   the prevailing religion of today? Are there not many who say, "Jehovah
   shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it"? God is not in
   all their thoughts. He is, to them, a nonentity, not the Omniscient
   Jehovah and hardly even a person, but a kind of secondary power or a
   feeble force--an unknown something or other of not much
   account--"Jehovah shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard
   it."

   8. Understand, you brutish among the people. When a man turns away from
   God, he casts off his manhood. He ceases to be a man and becomes like a
   brute, a boar, for so this expression might be read, "You boars among
   the people."

   8, 9. And you fools, when will you be wise? He that planted the ear,
   shall He not hear? Did the Lord make men's ears, and put them near the
   brain in the very best place for hearing, and shall He not, Himself,
   hear? The argument is overwhelming! God gave us ears and made us
   hear--is He, Himself, deaf?

   9. He that formed the eye, shall He not see? God makes all eyes. Is He
   without eyes? The supposition is an absurdity! It needs only to be
   mentioned to be held up to ridicule. "He that planted the ear, shall He
   not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?"--

   "Shall He who, with transcendent skill,

   Fashioned the eye and formed the ear-- Who modeled nature to His will--
   Shall He not see? Shall He not hear?"

   10. He that chastises the heathen, shall not He correct? Whole nations
   were driven out of Canaan to make room for Israel. Many other nations
   have been crushed, doubled up, utterly destroyed on account of their
   sin. Everybody who reads history knows that this has been the case, so
   the Psalmist argues, "He that chastises the heathen, shall not He
   correct?" He that executes judgment upon heathen nations, can He not
   deal with sinful man and with single individuals? He that broke the
   power of Persia, Assyria, Greece and Rome--will He not punish guilty
   men when they dare to set themselves up as oppressors of His people?

   10. He that teaches man knowledge, shall not He know? Our translators
   finish the question by putting, "Shall not He know?" But those words
   are not in the original and they are not at all necessary to the
   argument. It is as if the Psalmist abruptly broke off his utterances,
   as much as to say, "It is of no use arguing with you fellows," or else
   as if he said, "Finish my sentence, yourselves--I put the truth so
   clearly before you that there is no escaping from it." "He that teaches
   man knowledge." If God has taught men all that they know, does not He,
   Himself, know all that is to be known? The Psalmist does not say so
   much as that in words, but he leaves us to draw that as the only
   inference from what he says.

   11. The LORD knows the thoughts of man. God knows not only men's words
   and acts, but also their thoughts. God knows thoughtful men, the best
   sort of men, when they are at their best, when they are thinking. And
   what does God think of the thoughts of man?

   11. That they are vanity. Yet people talk about the thoughtful men of
   the age and want us to bow down and worship their thoughts! This
   boasting about man's thoughts is only like the cracking of rotten
   sticks! "The Lord knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity."

   12. Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O LORD, and teach him out of
   Your Law. Here is the truly blessed man-- not the boaster, not the
   infidel, not the proud thinker--but the Divinely-chastened man! He is
   sore through the chastening of the Lord, his bones are full of pain,
   his heart is heavy and his home, perhaps, is a place of torture to him,
   but still it is true that he is a blessed man--"Blessed is the man whom
   You chasten, O Lord, and teach him out of Your Law."

   13. That You may give him rest, from the days of adversity, until the
   pit is dug for the wicked. Christ has gone to prepare Heaven for His
   people. It is a prepared place for a prepared people. So is it with the
   ungodly and their eternal inheritance--it is a prepared place,
   "prepared for the devil and his angels." And when men make themselves
   like demons and so, are ripe for Hell, then is the pit ready to receive
   them!

   14. For the Lord will not cast out His people, neither will He forsake
   His inheritance. If any of you are deeply troubled, I counsel you to
   get a hold of this promise! Perhaps it seems to you as if two seas of
   sorrow had met around you and that you were in a whirlpool of trouble.
   Then I say again, lay hold of this text and grip it firmly--"Jehovah
   will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance."

   15. 16. But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
   upright in heart shall follow it. Who will rise up for me against the
   evildoers? Who will rise up for me against the workers of iniquity?
   Well, David, you may ask the question, but we cannot tell you who among
   your fellow men will stand up for you! It sometimes happens that God's
   people are left without an earthly friend. Their case is so hard, their
   cause involves so much question, so much shame, perhaps, that nobody
   will stand up for them. If this is your trying condition just now,
   listen to the Psalmist's testimony--

   17. Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
   silence. If it had not been for God, he would not only have had no hand
   to help him, but not even a voice to speak for him! He might not have
   suffered quite in silence, because he would have, himself, spoken, but
   what he would have said would only have made the matter worse. What
   would he have said if he had broken the silence?

   18. When I said, My foot slips. "It is going, it is gone! My foot is
   now slipping"--what then?

   18. Your mercy, O LORD, held me up. God is grand at holding up His
   people in slippery places--and not only in slippery places--but when
   their feet actually slip. When they think that they are gone, they are
   not really gone. "Underneath are the everlasting arms." "Your mercy, O
   Lord, held me up."

   19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me--"I cannot collect my
   thoughts--they will not be gathered into orderly array. They rush to
   and fro, there is a multitude, a mob of them." It is good to have
   thoughts, but sometimes you

   may have too many of them, and they may come helter-skelter,
   blasphemous thoughts, perhaps, despairing, proud, unbelieving, all
   sorts of thoughts! "In the multitude of my thoughts within me"--

   19. Your comforts delight my soul. "Comforts which You bring me,
   comforts which arise from thoughts of You, the comforts of the
   Comforter, the comforts of the God of All Comfort, Your comforts
   delight my soul." You must often have noticed that troubles seldom come
   alone. If you get one trial, you will probably have a whole covey of
   them. It very rarely happens, I think, to any one of us to have a lone
   sorrow. In another place the Psalmist says, "Deep calls unto deep at
   the noise of Your waterspouts; all Your waves and Your billows are gone
   over me." It is so with some of us at this time--we have a multitude of
   troubled thoughts within us. But have you also noticed that God's
   mercies do not come alone? They come in flocks! The Psalmist says,
   "Your comforts"--not merely one comfort, but a great host of them--
   "Your comforts delight my soul." they not merely sustain me, and keep
   me alive, but they delight my soul. God never does anything in
   halves--when He gives us comfort, He does it thoroughly. The Lord's
   flowers bloom double! He gives us not only comfort, but delight--"Your
   comforts delight my soul." Now the Psalmist turns to God in prayer and
   says--

   20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with You, which frames
   mischief by a law? Oh, how strong are the wicked! They think they can
   have everything their own way, that they can make what laws they like
   and crush out anything that they despise! Yes, there are many thrones
   of iniquity, but God has no fellowship with them! And if God has no
   fellowship with a throne, that throne will tumble down--God will not
   uphold it. The day will come when He will no longer tolerate its
   iniquity and then one blow of His mighty right hand shall shiver it to
   atoms!

   21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous
   and condemn innocent blood. Agreed about nothing else, they all agree
   against Christ and against the holy seed--"the soul of the righteous."
   They would blot out the righteous from under Heaven if they could.

   22. But the LORD is my defense; and my God is the rock of my refuge. I
   commend these expressions to all Believers, let them treasure them up.
   "My God." Ah, you must personally appropriate God to yourself if He is
   to bless you! Another man's god is nothing to you unless you can also
   say, "My God." When you have said, "My God," you have uttered the
   grandest words that human lips can frame! If God is yours, all things
   are yours--earth and Heaven, time and eternity! "My God is the rock of
   my refuge." You are on the Rock. You are in the Rock. You are behind
   the Rock. You must be safe now.

   23. And He shall bring upon them their own iniquity. That is the
   punishment of sin. It seems strange that it is so, but sin is the
   punishment of sin. When a man has once sinned, it is part of his
   punishment that he is inclined to sin, again, and so on, ad infinitum.
   "He shall bring upon them their own iniquity."

   23. And shall cut them off in their own wickedness. It needs no fire
   nor worm to torment the ungodly--their own wickedness, itself, is fire,
   worm and pit without a bottom--and the Hell that ends not. 23. Yes, the
   LORD our God shall cut them off--

   "Surrounded by His saints, the Lord

   Shall, armed with holy vengeance, come

   To each his final lot award

   And seal the sinner's fearful doom." God save us from being of that
   company! May we all be numbered with His people forever and ever! Amen.

Found By Jesus--And Finding Jesus

   (No. 2375)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, AUGUST 26, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   24 ,1888.

   "The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and He found
   Philip, and said to him, Follow Me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the
   city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We
   have found Him, of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets, did write,
   Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." John 1:43-45.

   FOR a soul to come to Jesus is the grandest event in its history! It is
   spiritually dead till that day, but it then begins to live--and a saved
   man may reckon his age from the time in which he first knew the Lord.
   That day of first knowing Christ is important in the highest degree
   because it affects all the man's past life. It sheds another light on
   all the years that have gone by. If he has lived in sin, as no doubt he
   has, the transaction of that day blots out all the sin. The day in
   which a man comes to Christ--that very day--his transgressions and
   iniquities are blotted out, even as the thick clouds are driven from
   the sky when God's strong wind chases them away! Is not that a grand
   day, in which our sins are cast into the depths of the sea so that from
   then on it can be said of them, "They may be sought for, but they shall
   not be found; yes, they shall not be, says the Lord"?

   I say that the day in which a soul comes into contact with Christ is
   the greatest day of its history because all the past is changed by it!
   And, as for the present, what a different life does a man begin to live
   on the day in which he finds the Lord! He commences to live in the
   Light of God instead of being dead in the darkness! He begins to enjoy
   the privileges of liberty, instead of suffering the horrors of slavery!
   He is started on the way to Heaven, instead of continuing on the road
   to Hell! He is such a new creature that he cannot tell how changed he
   is. One said to me, "Sir, the change in me is of this kind--either the
   whole world is altered, or else I am." So is it when we are brought to
   know Christ--it is a real, total, radical change.

   With many, it is a most joyous alteration. They feel like the man who
   had been lame, and who, when Peter spoke to him in the name of Jesus,
   and lifted him up so that his feet and ankle bones received strength,
   was not satisfied with walking, for we read, "He, leaping up, stood and
   walked, and entered with them into the Temple, walking, and leaping,
   and praising God." He was walking, leaping and praising God! Do you
   wonder at it? If you had lost the use of your legs for a while, you
   would feel like leaping and praising God when you had them all right,
   again! And thus is it with a soul when it first finds the Savior. Oh,
   happy, happy day when the miraculous hand of Christ takes away the
   infirmities of the soul and makes the lame man to leap as a hart, and
   causes the tongue of the dumb to sing!

   The day in which a man comes to Christ is also a wonderful day in its
   effect upon all his future. It is as when the helm of a ship is put
   right about--the man now sails in a totally different direction. His
   future will never be what his past was. There may be faults. There may
   be infirmities and shortcomings, but there will never be the old love
   of sin any more. "Sin shall not have dominion over you." This is God's
   own promise to us, given through His servant, Paul. When Christ comes
   to our soul, He so breaks the neck of sin, that though it lives a
   struggling, dying life and often makes a deal of howling in the heart,
   yet it is doomed to die. The Cross of Christ has broken its back and
   broken its neck, too, and die it must! Henceforth the man is bound for
   holiness and bound for Heaven!

   Now, dear Friends, have any of you come to Christ? I know that you
   have, the great mass of you, and I bless God, and so do you, that it is
   so with you. But if there are any of you who have never come to the
   Savior, I wish that this might be the night when you should find Him. I
   am but a poor lame preacher--you are not often troubled with the sight
   of one

   sitting down and preaching--yet I think that if I had lost my legs and
   had always to lie on my back, I would like, even then, to preach Christ
   Crucified, and to--

   "Tell to sinners round, What a dear Savior I have found." I do pray
   that some of you, tonight, made to think all the more by the infirmity
   of the preacher, may be led to seek and to find the Savior. And then it
   shall be a happy day, indeed, for you, as it has been for so many more.

   I am going to talk to you about Philip's conversion and first, I ask
   you to notice, in our text, the convert's description of it-- "Philip
   found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him, of whom Moses in
   the Law, and the Prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
   Joseph." That is Philip's description of it--"We have found Jesus." It
   was a true description, but it was not all the truth, so, in the second
   place, we will notice the Holy Spirit's description of it--"The day
   following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip."
   Philip's account of the incident is that he found Christ, but the Holy
   Spirit's record of it is that Christ found Philip. They are both true,
   however, although the latter is the fuller. We will talk a little about
   both descriptions of Philip's conversion.

   I. First then, THE CONVERT'S DESCRIPTION OF HIS COMING TO CHRIST is
   given in these words, "We have found...Jesus," and what he says is
   perfectly true.

   If any of you is saved, it will be by finding Christ--by your
   personally making a discovery of Him, as that man did who found the
   treasure that was hid in the field. There must be a search for Christ,
   but if there is a search for Him, we may be certain of this one
   thing--there will first be a consciousness of needing Him.

   Philip had sought Christ, or else he would never have said that he had
   found Him, but, before that, Philip knew that there was need of a
   Messiah. When he looked round about on the world and on the Church, he
   said to himself, "Oh, that the promised Messiah would come! There is
   great need of Him. The people need Him, the Church needs Him, the world
   needs Him." When Philip looked into his own heart, he said, "Oh, for
   the coming of the Messiah! I feel that I need Him! I have urgent need
   of Him."

   Dear Hearer, do you feel that you need a Savior? You never will seek
   Him until you feel your need of Him. You must recognize that there is
   sin in you, sin for which you cannot make Atonement, sin that you
   cannot overcome. You must realize that you need another and a stronger
   arm than your own, that you need Divine help, that you need One who can
   be your Brother to sympathize with you, and be patient with you, and
   yet who can be the Mighty God to conquer all your sin for you! You need
   a Savior--that is the first thing that will prompt you to search for
   Him.

   Needing a Messiah, Philip read the Scriptures concerning Him. He speaks
   about Moses and the Prophets and of what they had written concerning
   the promised Deliverer. O my dear Hearers, if you need to find Christ,
   you must search the Scriptures, for they testify of Him! Oh, that you
   did search the Scriptures, more, with the definite objective of finding
   the Savior! Probably the great majority of unconverted people never
   read their Bibles at all, or they read only just enough to satisfy
   their curiosity, or their conscience. Perhaps they read the Bible as a
   part of literature which cannot be quite ignored, but they do not take
   down the Holy Book and read it carefully and prayerfully, saying, "Oh,
   that I might find holiness, here! Oh, that I might find Christ, here!"
   If they did, it would not be long before they found Jesus. Well does
   Dr. Watts sing--

   "Laden with guilt and full of fears, I fly to You, my Lord, And not a
   glimpse of hope appears But in Your written Word!

   The volume of my Father's Grace Does all my griefs assuage, Here I
   behold my Savior's face Almost on every page."

   He who reads the Bible with the view of finding Christ will not be long
   before some passage of Scripture will seem to leap up to attract his
   attention, as though it were set on fire--and then it will speak to him
   of Jesus, whispering to him of the great Sacrifice on Calvary and
   speaking to his heart of Divine Love and Mercy. Philip was a searcher
   after Christ in the place where Christ loves to be--in the pages of
   Scripture--and you must be the same if you desire to find Jesus!

   But then Philip also gave himself to prayer. We are not told so, but we
   feel sure of it. He asked the Lord to reveal Christ to him, to guide
   him to where the Christ would be, to let him know the Christ. Oh, if
   you want to be saved, be much in prayer! I do not mean merely saying
   prayers--what is the good of that? I do not mean simply saying fine
   words of your own, merely for the sake of uttering them. Prayer is
   communing with God! It is asking the Lord for what you really feel that
   you need. What wagon loads of sham prayers are shot down at God's door,
   as if they were so much rubbish thrown away! Let it not be so with your
   prayers, but speak to the Lord out of your very soul when you come to
   the Throne of Grace. I cannot give you a better prayer than the one we
   have been singing--

   "Gracious Lord, incline Your ear, My requests vouchsafe to hear! Hear
   my never ceasing cry-- Give me Christ, or else I die! Lord, deny me
   what You will, Only ease me of my guilt Suppliant at Your feet I lie,
   Give me Christ, or else I die! You freely save the lost. Only in Your
   Grace I trust: With my earnest suit comply-- Give me Christ, or else I
   die! You have promised to forgive All who in Your Son believe-- Lord, I
   know You cannot lie Give me Christ, or else I die!"

   With the open Bible before you to guide your understanding, kneel down
   and say, "O God, graciously reveal Christ to me by Your Holy Spirit.
   Bring me to know Him! Bring me, this day, to find Him as my own
   Savior!"

   It is certain, also, that Philip realized that he might claim the
   Messiah for himself. One of the things that every man, who would find
   the Savior must do is to make sure of his right to come and take the
   Savior. The question that puzzles many is, "May I have the Savior?" My
   dear Friends, every sinner in the world is permitted to come and trust
   the Savior, if he wills to do so. "Whoever will, let him take the water
   of life freely." "But," asks some troubled soul, "will Christ have me?"
   That is not the question--the question is, "Will you have Christ?" He
   says, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." It is you who
   cast out the Savior, not the Savior who casts you out! The bolt to the
   door is on the inside--it is you who have bolted it and it is you who
   must undo the bolt and invite the Savior to enter your heart. He is
   willing enough to come in--wherever there is a soul that wants Him, He
   comes at once! Therefore, do not raise any quibbling questions about
   whether a sinner may come to Christ, or may not come! Is he not
   commanded to come? We are told to preach the Gospel to every creature,
   and He who gave us our great commission also added, "He that believes
   and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be
   damned."

   Philip accepted Christ as the Messiah. Do you ask, "What am I to do
   that I may find the Savior?" Well, what you have to do is, practically,
   this--accept Him! If you were sick and the doctor stood before you with
   the medicine ready prepared, you would not say, "What am I to do with
   this medicine, Sir? Am I to rub my hand on the outside of the bottle?"
   You know very well that there are certain directions as to how much is
   to be taken and how often. What you have to do with the medicine is to
   take it! "But I cannot make that medicine work for my restoration." Who
   said you could? All you have to do is to take it. It is just this that
   you have to do with Christ--take Him, accept Him, receive Him. Remember
   the 12th verse of this chapter out of which our text is taken--"As many
   as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even
   to them that believe on His name."

   That is it, you see, receive Him, believe on His name. "But surely I am
   to do some good works." Certainly, you will do good works after you
   have received Christ. But for your soul's salvation, you are to do no
   good works, but simply to receive Christ. "Oh, but I must lead a holy
   life!" Yes, and you will lead a holy life after you have received
   Christ. But in order to the leading of a holy life you must have a new
   heart--and to get a new heart--you have to receive Christ! He will
   change you, He will renew you, He will make you a new creature in
   Himself! What you have to do is to receive Him and to believe on His
   name. O my dear Hearers, I trust that I am speaking to some, this
   evening, who will understand

   what I am saying! I fear that I am addressing many who will not
   believe, though I may put the Truth of God as plainly as it can be
   preached. You know that you may hold a candle right against a blind
   man's eyes and yet he will not see, even then. The Holy Spirit must
   open your eyes to see what is meant by this receiving Christ, or else
   you will not understand what you are to do. You are not to give
   anything to Christ--you are to take all from Him! You are not to bring
   anything to Christ--you are to come to Him just as you are--and He will
   bring to you everything that you need. Then, when you have accepted Him
   by the simple act of faith, you will say with Philip, "We have found
   Jesus!" That is the convert's description and a very good one, too--"We
   have found Jesus."

   II. But now, secondly, what is THE HOLY SPIRIT'S DESCRIPTION? I will
   read to you the very words again. Here they are--"The day following
   Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip." Jesus finds
   Philip before Philip finds Jesus. Philip finds Jesus because Jesus has
   found Philip.

   Now, notice, that this is the previous work. It came before Philip's
   own finding. Jesus would go forth into Galilee to find Philip. Dear
   Friends, I remember very well that after I had found the Lord, I did
   not, at first, fully understand the Doctrines of Grace. I had heard
   them preached, but I had not comprehended them. I think at the time I
   would have been very much puzzled with the Doctrine of Election if
   anybody had spoken to me about it. But I was sitting down, one day,
   gratefully reflecting on what God had done for me. I knew that my sins
   were pardoned, I knew that I was accepted in Christ Jesus and I knew
   that I was renewed in heart--and in one moment the revelation came to
   me--"All this is the work of God!" The instant I saw that Truth of God,
   I said to myself, "Yes, that is the fact, and God be glorified for it!
   But why has this great work been worked in me?"

   I knew that there was no merit in me before the Lord had dealt in mercy
   with my soul, so I said to myself, "This is the effect of Sovereign,
   Distinguishing Grace." Then I understood in a moment how it is that God
   begins with us and that it is God's will and God's eternal purpose,
   which, after all, lie deeper down than our will or our purpose--and
   God's will and God's eternal purpose must have the Glory! What a
   revelation it was to me! I saw the Doctrines of Grace immediately and I
   think that anybody who has been brought to find the Savior and who,
   prayerfully studies the reasons for his salvation, can see the same
   Truths of God that the Lord revealed to me.

   Because, first of all, you began to be thoughtful, did you not? Who
   made you thoughtful? You would never have found the Savior if you had
   not become thoughtful instead of careless and indifferent. Who made you
   think of Divine things? What influence was it which worked upon you and
   caused you to feel that you must think about eternity, and Heaven, and
   Hell? Surely it was God the Holy Spirit going forth, in the name of
   Jesus Christ, and dealing with you in mercy!

   Then you had a sense of your need and of your sinfulness. There was a
   time when you had no such sense. Who gave it to you? Where do you think
   that repentance, that sorrow for sin, that desire after Christ came
   from? Did all that grow in your own fallen human nature? Ah, believe
   me, that dunghill never brought forth such fair flowers as these! No,
   it was Christ who sowed the good Seed in your soul--it was He who made
   you feel your need of Him!

   Next, when you read the Bible, you understood it. You perceived that
   Jesus was the only Savior of sinners. You saw His fitness to meet your
   case and you understood the plan of salvation. Who made you understand
   it? I know that it is plain enough for a child to comprehend, but no
   one ever understands spiritual things except by the operation of the
   Spirit of God! It was the Holy Spirit who gave you the spiritual power
   by which you were able to grasp the simple Truth concerning the way of
   salvation.

   Then you began to pray. I have already spoken of that matter. But who
   taught you to pray? You had not been accustomed to real prayer--you had
   often had great mouthfuls of words--that was all. But now you began to
   cry, "God be merciful to me, a sinner!" Oh, the groaning of your spirit
   and the anguish of your heart as you cried to God! Who gave you that
   anguish? Who broke you all to pieces and made every broken bone cry out
   for mercy? Who, indeed, but Christ who worked mightily in your soul by
   the power of the Holy Spirit?

   And when you yielded yourself up to Christ, when you believed in Jesus
   and found salvation, where did that faith come from? Is it not always
   the work of the Spirit of God? Is not faith the gift of God and do you
   not confess that it is so in your case? Once, when I was a little
   child, I thought I saw a needle moving across the table and I would
   have been wondering who made the needle march as it did, but I was old
   enough to understand that somebody was moving a magnet underneath the
   table and the needle was following the magnet which I could not see.
   Thus the Lord, with His mighty

   magnet of Grace, is often at work upon the hearts of men, and we think
   that their desire after God and their faith in Christ are of
   themselves. In a sense, the desire and the faith are their own, but
   there is a Divine Force that is at work upon them, producing these
   results! It is Jesus finding Philip, though Philip does not know it.
   Philip thinks that he is finding Jesus, but behind the veil it is Jesus
   finding Philip! This was the previous work.

   And, dear Friends, this was very delightful work for the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Notice how it is put--"The day following Jesus would go forth
   into Galilee, and He found Philip." O my blessed Lord, how He will go
   forth to find a soul! A journey is never too long for Him and He never
   wastes a day. "The day following Jesus would go forth, and He found
   Philip." Oh, may my Lord delight to come forth and find some of you!
   You are, tonight, in a place where He has found a good many. I pray
   that He may find some of you. Perhaps you do not know how it was that
   you came here. You did not mean to come out, tonight, but here you are
   in this crowd, in the thick of this great throng. My Lord has found
   many a precious jewel here--to itself it seemed nothing but a poor
   pebble, but to Him it was a diamond of the first water! O my Master,
   find some more of Your jewels tonight! Lord Jesus, come and find
   Philip, and find Mary, and then let Philip and Mary declare that they
   have found You!

   When our dear Master goes forth to find a soul, it is very effectual
   work. He said to Philip, "Follow Me," and Philip at once followed Him.
   Christ did not need to preach a long sermon. His discourse contained
   only two words, "Follow Me." I will gladly end my sermon here if my
   Master will preach to some of you His two-worded sermon, "Follow Me,"
   "Follow Me," "Follow Me!" "Come, poor Soul, you do not know the way!
   'Follow Me.' You need someone to go before you, to be your leader,
   'Follow Me.' You need someone to be your shelter, your companion, your
   all, 'Follow Me.'" That is what you have to do, good woman. You have
   been worrying about what you have heard from different preachers.
   Christ says to you, "Follow Me." That is what you have to do, young
   man! You have been reading those modern thought books till you do not
   know whether you are on your head or on your heels. Burn them! Jesus
   says, "Follow Me." I know that some of you have been distracted with
   all sorts of silly talk--let that go to the dogs. Jesus says, "Follow
   Me." The crucified Savior says, "Follow Me." Take Him for your
   Atonement! The risen Savior says, "Follow Me." Take Him for your life!
   The Savior on the Throne of God says, "Follow Me." Take Him for your
   joy! The Savior coming in Glory hereafter says, "Follow Me." Take Him
   to be your hope! "Follow Me." "Follow Me"--that is the text for
   tonight--and that is the sermon, too! Jesus said to Philip, "Follow
   Me," and Philip followed Him, directly. And he not only followed
   Christ, but he immediately began to try to get others to follow Him!

   Please notice, also, that Philip was found by Christ in a very
   different way from the other disciples. Two of them had been found
   through the teaching of John the Baptist, but Philip had apparently had
   no teaching. Another of the little company had been found through the
   private call of his brother. Philip may not have had any relative or
   friend to speak to him, but the Savior just said to him, "Follow Me,"
   and he followed Him! Dear Friends, do not begin comparing your
   conversion with somebody else's. If the Lord Jesus Christ calls you and
   says to you, "Follow Me," and you follow Him, if there never was
   another soul converted in exactly the same way, it does not matter at
   all! If you have come to Him, if you have trusted in Him, you are
   saved.

   The pith of all that I have to say is this. Do not get to worrying
   yourselves, as some of you do, about God's eternal purpose and about
   the secret working of the Holy Spirit--and about how this can be
   consistent with your following Christ when He bids you. They are
   perfectly consistent! Some persons have asked me, at times, to
   reconcile these two things, and I have said to them, "Very well, tell
   me the difficulties, and I will reconcile them." It would be quite as
   easy to state them as to meet them, for, in fact, there are none! "Oh,
   but," says one, "you tell me to believe in Christ and yet you
   constantly preach that faith is the work of the Spirit of God!" I know
   that I do. "You say that God has a chosen people." Yes, I do. "And yet
   you say that men are to choose Christ?" I do. "Well, how do you
   reconcile those two things?" Show me that there is any difficulty about
   the two things and then I will reconcile them. You imagine the
   difficulty, for there is none in reality! There does not exist any in
   practical life!

   I believe that God has predestinated whether I am going down to the
   Lord's Supper at the close of this service, but I shall go down as well
   as my legs can carry me. "Oh," you say, "you make it out to be a matter
   of your own free will?" Yes, I do. "And yet you believe it to be God's
   eternal purpose?" Yes, I do. "Well, then, reconcile the two things."
   Again I say that there is no difficulty in the case! There is nothing
   to be reconciled, for both statements are true! You might as well ask
   me to reconcile the land and the water, or to reconcile the dog-star,
   Sirius, and a farthing rushlight. There is no

   quarrel between them and I have no time to waste on needless argument.
   Come to Christ! And if you do, it will be because the Holy Spirit draws
   you! If you find the Savior, it will be because the Savior first found
   you! Perhaps, in Heaven, you may see some difficulties and get them
   explained. Down here you need not see them and you need not ask to have
   them explained. Salvation is all of God's Grace, from first to
   last--yet is it true that the Grace of God leads men to do what Moses
   did, according to our subject this morning [See Sermon #2030, Volume
   34--Moses--His Faith and Decision] to make a choice and to choose
   rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the
   pleasures of sin for a season. God grant that you may make an equally
   wise choice!

   I have done when I have said this one thing more. Philip, Peter and
   Andrew were all of Bethsaida--"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of
   Andrew and Peter." These three good men, these three Apostles, were all
   of Bethsaida. That ought to be some comfort to many of you, my dear
   Hearers, because there are numbers of you who are here, tonight, who
   are of Bethsaida. Sitting all round me, I see people who, I believe,
   are of Bethsaida. "Oh," you say, "we were never there in all our
   lives!" Listen. Bethsaida was one of the places in which Christ had
   done many of His mighty works and you remember that when the people
   repented not, Jesus uttered over them that sad lamentation, "Woe unto
   you, Chorazin! Woe unto you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which
   were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have
   repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall
   be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Day of Judgment than for
   you. And you, Capernaum, which are exalted unto Heaven, shall be
   brought down to Hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in
   you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But
   I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom
   in the Day of Judgment, than for you."

   Now, there are some of you here who have heard the Gospel for many
   years and have seen the power of the Grace of God in your families--and
   it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, and for Sodom and
   Gomorrah in the Day of Judgement, than it will be for you, inasmuch as
   you have rejected the Savior! But, as there were these three
   men--Philip and Peter and Andrew who were of Bethsaida--and I should
   think that the home of James and John was not very far off from the
   same place--why should you not come to Christ? Why should you not
   become members of His Church and, if it is the Lord's will, preachers
   of His Word? God grant that it may be so!

   Oh, how I long in my soul for the salvation of every one of you! Many
   of you who have come here, tonight, are strangers to me. I trust that
   you will not be strangers to my Master! Tonight, I pray you, here in
   the very heat of midsummer, before the harvest shall be past and the
   summer shall be ended, "Seek you the Lord while He may be found! Call
   you upon Him while He is near! Let the wicked forsake his way and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and He
   will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly
   pardon." Receive Christ! Trust in Him! God grant that you may do so,
   for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 1:29-51

   Verse 29. The next day--This chapter is a record of the events that
   occurred on different days. Sometimes God does great things in a single
   day--one extraordinary day may have more in it than a hundred ordinary
   years! It is well for us to try to live by the day and not to let any
   day pass without some good action having been done in it. Let us never
   have to cry, "I have lost a day."

   29. John saw Jesus coming unto him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God,
   who takes away the sin of the world. We ought never to be slow in
   delivering such a message as that which John the Baptist uttered! I do
   not wonder that as soon as John knew that Jesus was the Messiah, he
   told the good news to others! Have you found Jesus? Tell your brother,
   tonight, or, if not tonight, go as soon as you can, and bid him,
   "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world."

   30-34. This is He of whom I said, After me comes a Man who is preferred
   before me: for He was before me. And I knew Him not: but that He should
   be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
   And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven
   like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew Him not: but He that
   sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you
   shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is He
   which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. And I saw, and bare record that
   this is the Son of God. John was acquainted with Jesus, for they were
   related to one another, and were brought up together, but he did not
   officially know Him as the

   Messiah until He saw the Holy Spirit descending and remaining on Him,
   for that was the Lord's token by which he was to recognize Him. He
   refused, therefore, to follow any knowledge or judgment of his own. He
   would not know Jesus as the Christ until he saw the private sign for
   which the Lord had told him to look. As soon as he saw that, then John
   said that he knew Him, and as soon as he thus knew Him, he began to
   preach Him! Has the Lord given you in your soul a token that Christ is
   your Savior? Do you know Him by the witness of the Holy Spirit? Then go
   and speak of Him to others and, like John, say, "Behold the Lamb of
   God!" Let this be your one business between here and Heaven.

   35, 36. Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
   and looking upon Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!
   "Again the next day." See how the Evangelist goes by days in his
   record. John preached the same sermon two days running--and if you
   proclaim Christ and Him crucified--you may preach Him 200 days running,
   but you will never preach Him too often! If you preach Christ as the
   Lamb of God, the great Sin-Bearer, you may be always at that blessed
   work. There are some who very seldom preach Christ as bearing the sin
   of men, so that others of us must do it all the more often to make up
   for their shortcomings. As for me, I can say with Charles Wesley--

   "His only righteousness I show, His saving Truth proclaim; 'Tis all my
   business here below, To cry, 'Behold the Lamb!'"

   37. And the two disciples heard Him speak and they followed Jesus. It
   is hard preaching when you preach away your congregation, but John did
   this deliberately. He wished these two no longer to be his disciples,
   but to become the disciples of Jesus. He had mastered the meaning of
   his own words, "He must increase, but I must decrease," and he was
   quite willing that it should be so--"The two disciples heard Him speak
   and they followed Jesus."

   38, 39. Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and said unto them,
   What do you seek? They said unto Him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being
   interpreted, Master,) where do You dwell? He said to them, Come and
   see. He gave them a full invitation to come to the place where He
   tarried and see for themselves. That is what Jesus still says, "Come
   and see." If any of you want to know Him, "Come and see." You are
   perfectly welcome to "Come and see" all that Jesus has to show you!

   39. They came and saw where He dwelt and abode with Him that day: for
   it was about the tenth hour. The best part of that day was the portion
   which they spent with Jesus--it was the best day they had ever enjoyed,
   for they lived with Jesus! It was also the beginning of better days for
   these two disciples, for, having once lived with Jesus, they learned
   never to live without Him. Oh, that we, also, may abide with Him!

   40, 41. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed Him, was
   Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his own brother, Simon,
   and said to him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being
   interpreted, the Christ. Where should missionary work begin? A brother
   should begin with his brother. It is all very well to have a desire to
   go to the heathen in Africa, but you had better begin work as a
   missionary in England, and then go to Africa. He who cannot win his
   brother is not likely to win anybody else. "He first found his own
   brother, Simon." This Andrew, who was afterwards to bring so many to
   Christ, must begin at home and succeed there. If we are not faithful
   with one or two relatives, how can God trust us with a pulpit and a
   congregation?

   42. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, He said,
   You are Simon the son of Jonas. "Simon, son of a dove, your name may
   point you out as being timid--mind where you wing your flight."

   42. You shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone.
   Something more solid than the son of a pigeon! Something more stable
   than the son of a dove! Christ changes men's names and changes their
   natures, too. He can make the most fickle of us to become firm and
   steadfast. Oh, that He would thus work by His Grace upon us!

   43, 44. The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and found
   Philip, and said to him, Follow Me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the
   city of Andrew and Peter. "The day following." See, Friends, what a
   wonderful chapter this is! There is a book called, The Book of Days. I
   call this chapter, the Chapter of Days. Every day seems memorable for
   some great event. "Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter," was a
   poor, miserable village, but God greatly honored it. Great works often
   begin in little places. The best of beings came out of the despised
   town of Nazareth! And three of the best of men--Philip, Andrew and
   Peter--came out of Bethsaida.

   45. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found Him, of whom
   Moses in the Law, and the Prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the
   son of Joseph. True faith may make blunders. Jesus was not the son of
   Joseph, except by repu-

   tation, and He was Jesus of Bethlehem quite as much as He was Jesus of
   Nazareth--but true faith is accepted of God even though it makes some
   mistakes. It believes God's Word and it believes God's Son and,
   therefore, it shall be accepted.

   46. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there be any good thing come out
   of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see. Christ had said, "Come
   and see." Now Philip used the same words, "Come and see." It is always
   right to follow the example that the Lord Jesus has set for us!

   47, 48. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an
   Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael said to Him, When did
   You know me? You may remember that, a short time ago, I preached a
   sermon upon Nathanael. [See Volume 34, No. 2021, "Nathanael--Or, the
   Ready Believer and His Reward.] He was a kind of Jewish John Blunt, a
   man who always spoke his mind. He had a mind and he had a mind to speak
   it--and he spoke his mind! So, the moment that Christ spoke of him, he
   asked, "When did You know me?" He was conscious that Christ knew him
   and, being a man who was altogether free from cunning and craftiness,
   he pointedly asked how Christ came to know him.

   48. Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called you,
   when you were under the fig tree, I saw you. What was he doing under
   the fig tree? Jesus knew and Nathanael knew, but nobody else knew and,
   perhaps, nobody else ever will know. That was a secret between Christ
   and Nathanael. He was doing something there that he regarded as quite
   private--and the Savior's allusion to his being under the fig tree was
   the most plain proof he could have of Christ's Divinity. "Oh," he
   thought, "He who can remind me of that secret transaction must be God."

   49, 50. Nathanael answered and said to Him: Rabbi, You are the Son of
   God; You are the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him,
   Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe?
   You shall see greater things than these. You who are honest in heart.
   You who can be convinced by a single argument--and, mark you, one good
   argument is as convincing as 20 good arguments, and a great deal better
   than a 100 bad ones--you who are willing to be led by a single thread
   shall be led! If you are willing to believe on what is clear evidence,
   you shall have more evidence--"you shall see greater things than
   these." God will show much to that man who has eyes with which to see.
   He who will not see and does not wish to see, shall grow more and more
   blind--and the darkness shall thicken about him.

   51. And He said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter you
   shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending
   upon the Son of Man. He could see actually what Jacob saw only in a
   dream when he beheld that wonderful stairway of Light which leads from
   earth to Heaven, even the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by His Manhood and
   His Godhead bridges the distance between us and God!

"I Will," Yet, "Not As I Will"

   (No. 2376)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   1, 1883.

   "Father, I will." "Not as I will." John 7:24, Matthew 16:39.

   We have, here, two prayers uttered by the same Person, yet there is the
   greatest possible contrast between them. How different men are at
   different times! Yet Jesus was always essentially the same--"the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever." Still, His mood and state of mind
   varied from time to time. He seemed calmly happy when He prayed with
   His disciples and said, "Father, I will that they, also, whom You have
   given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My Glory, which
   You have given Me." But He was in an agony when, in Gethsemane, having
   withdrawn from His disciples and fallen on His face, He prayed, saying,
   "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me:
   nevertheless not as I will, but as You will." It is the same Man and an
   unchangeable Man, too, as to His essence, who uttered both prayers, yet
   see how different were His frames of mind and how different the prayers
   He offered! Brother, you may be the same man and quite as good a man
   when you are groaning before God as when you are singing before Him.
   There may be more Grace, even, in the submissive, "Not as I will," than
   in the triumphant, "Father, I will." Do not judge yourselves to have
   changed in your standing before God because you have undergone an
   alteration as to your feelings. If your Master prayed so differently at
   different times, you, who have not the fullness of Grace that He had,
   must not wonder if you have a great variety of inward experiences.

   Notice, also, that it was not only the same Person, but that He used
   these two expressions almost at the same time. I do not know how many
   minutes--I had better say minutes rather than hours--intervened between
   the Last Supper, the wonderful high-priestly prayer and the agonizing
   cries of Gethsemane. I suppose that it was only a short walk from
   Jerusalem to the olive garden and that it would not occupy long to
   traverse the distance. At one end of the walk Jesus prays, "Father, I
   will," and at the other end of it, He says, "Not as I will." In like
   manner, we may undergo great changes and have to alter the tone of our
   prayers in just a few minutes. You prayed, just now, with holy
   confidence. You took firm hold of the Covenant Angel and, with
   wrestling Jacob, you said, "I will not let You go, except You bless
   me." And yet it may be equally becoming on your part, within an hour,
   to lie in the very dust and, in agony, cry unto the Lord, "Pardon my
   prayers, forgive me that I was too bold, and hear me, now, as I cry to
   You and say, 'Not as I will, but as You will.'"--

   "If but my fainting heart is blessed With Your sweet Spirit for its
   guest, My God, to You I leave the rest-- 'Your will be done!'"

   Never be ashamed because you have to mend your prayers! Be careful not
   to make a mistake if you can help it, but, if you make one, do not be
   ashamed to confess it and to correct it as far as you can. One of our
   frequent mistakes is that we wonder that we make mistakes. Whenever a
   man says, "I should never have thought that I could have done such a
   foolish thing as that," it shows that he does not really know himself,
   for had he known himself, he would rather have wondered that he did not
   do worse, and he would have marveled that he acted as wisely as he did.
   Only the Grace of God can teach us how to run our prayers down the
   scale from the high note of, "Father, hear me, for You have said, 'Ask
   what you will,'" right down to the deep, deep bass of, "Father, not as
   I will, but as You will."

   I must further remark that these two prayers were equally
   characteristic of Christ. I think that I should know my Lord by His
   voice in either of them. Who but the eternal Son of God may dare to
   say, "Father, I will"? There speaks Incarnate Deity! That is the
   sublime utterance of the well-beloved Son. And yet, who could say as He
   said it, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless
   not as I will, but as You will." Perhaps you have uttered those words,
   dear Friend, but in your case they were not concerning such a cup of
   woe as Christ emptied! There were but a few drops of gall in your cup.
   His was all bitterness, from the froth to the dregs--all
   bitterness--and such bitterness as, thank God, you and I can never
   taste! That cup He has drained to the dregs and we shall not have to
   drink one drop from it. And it was of that cup that He said--and I
   detect the voice of the Son of God, the Son of Man, in that brief
   utterance--"Not as I will, but as You will."

   My two texts make up a strange piece of music. Blessed are the lips
   that know how to express the confidence that rises to the height as far
   as we can go with Christ--and descends, even, to the deeps as far as we
   can go with Him in full submission to the will of God! Does anybody say
   that he cannot understand the contrast between these two prayers? Dear
   Friend, it is to be explained thus. There was a difference of position
   in the Suppliant on these two occasions. The first prayer, "Father, I
   will," is the prayer of our great High Priest with all His heavenly
   garments on--the blue, and purple, and fine twined linen, and the
   pomegranates, and the golden bells, and the breastplate with the 12
   precious stones bearing the names of His chosen people. It is our great
   High Priest, in the Glory of His majestic office and power, who says to

   God, "Father, I will."

   The second Suppliant is not so much the Priest as the Victim. Our Lord
   is there seen bound to the altar, about to feel the sacrificial knife,
   about to be consumed with the sacrificial fire, and you hear Him as
   though it were a lamb bleating, and the utterance is, "Not as I will,
   but as You will." The first petition is the language of Christ in power
   pleading for us. The second is the utterance of Christ made sin for us,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. That is the
   difference of position that explains the contrast in the prayers.

   Let me tell you, also, that there is a difference in the subject of His
   supplication which is full of instruction. In the first prayer, where
   our Lord says so majestically, "Father, I will," He is pleading for His
   people. He is praying for what He knows to be the Father's will. He is
   officiating, there, before God as the very mouthpiece of God, and
   speaking of something about which He is perfectly clear and certain.
   When you are praying for God's people, you may pray very boldly. When
   you are pleading for God's cause, you may speak very positively. When
   you know you are asking what is definitely promised in the Scriptures
   as part of the Covenant ordered in all things and sure, you may ask
   without hesitation, as our Lord did.

   But, in the second case, Jesus was praying for Himself--"If it is
   possible, let this cup pass from Me." He was praying about a matter,
   concerning which He did not, as Man, know the Father's will, for He
   says, "If it is possible." There is an, "if," in it--"If it is
   possible, let this cup pass from Me." Whenever you go upstairs in an
   agony of distress and begin to pray about yourself, and about a
   possible escape from suffering, always say, under such circumstances,
   "Nevertheless not as I will, but as You will." It may be given you,
   sometimes, to pray very boldly even in such a case as that, but, if it
   is not given you, take care that you do not presume. I may pray for
   healing for my body, but not with such confidence as I pray for the
   prosperity of Zion and the Glory of God. That which has to do with
   myself I may ask as a child of God asks of his Father, but I must ask
   submissively, leaving the decision wholly in His hands, feeling that,
   because it is for myself, rather than for Him, I must say,
   "Nevertheless not as I will, but as You will."

   I think that there is a plain lesson, here, for Christians to take heed
   that, while they are very confident on one subject for which they pray,
   they are equally submissive on another, for there is a heavenly
   blending in the Christian character, as there was in Christ's
   Character, a firm confidence and yet an absolute yielding to the will
   of God--let that will be what it may--

   "Lord, my times are in Your hands. All my sanguine hopes ha ve planned
   To Your wisdom I resign, And would make Your purpose mine."

   Now all this while, you may say that I have only been going round the
   text. Very well. But, sometimes, there is a good deal of instruction to
   be picked up around a text. The manna fell round about the camp of
   Israel. Perhaps there is some manna round about this text. May the Lord
   help every one of us to gather his portion!

   I want you now, for a few minutes, to view this great Suppliant in the
   two moods in which He prayed, "Father, I will" and, "Not as I will,"
   and then to combine the two. We will, first, view Jesus in the power of
   His intercession. Next,

   we will talk of Jesus in the power of His submission. And in the third
   place, we will try to combine the two prayers, "I will," yet, "Not as I
   will."

   I. First, let us view Jesus IN THE POWER OF HIS INTERCESSION, saying,
   "Father, I will." Where did He derive that power? Who enabled Him thus
   to speak with God and say, "Father, I will?" First, Jesus prayed in the
   power of His Sonship. Sons may say to a father what strangers may not
   dare to say and such a Son as Jesus was so near to His Father's heart,
   He was One who could say, "The Father has not left Me alone; for I
   always do those things that please Him." He was One of whom the Father
   had said, "This is My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Well
   might He have power with God so as to be able to say, "Father, I will."

   Next, He derived this power from the Father's eternal love to Him. Did
   you notice how, in the very verse from which our text is taken, Jesus
   says to His Father, "You loved Me before the foundation of the world"?
   We cannot conceive what the love of the Father is to Christ Jesus His
   Son! Remember, they are one in Essence. God is one--Father, Son and
   Holy Spirit and, as the Incarnate God, Christ is unspeakably dear to
   the Father's heart. There is nothing about Him of which the Father
   disapproves. There is nothing lacking in Him which the Father would
   desire to see there. He is God's ideal of Himself--"In Him dwells all
   the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Well may One who is the subject of
   His Father's eternal love be able to say, "Father, I will."

   But our Lord Jesus also based this prayer upon His finished work. I
   grant you that He had not yet actually died, but in the certain
   prospect of His doing so, He had said to His Father, "I have glorified
   You on the earth: I have finished the work which You gave Me to do."
   Now, He has actually finished it, He has been able, in the fullest
   sense, to say, "It is finished," and He has gone up to take His place
   in Glory at His Father's side. You remember the argument with which
   Paul begins his Epistle to the Hebrews--"God, who at sundry times and
   in divers manners spoke in times past unto the fathers by the Prophets,
   has in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He has appointed
   heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds; who being the
   brightness of His Glory, and the express image of His Person and,
   upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had, by Himself,
   purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
   being made so much better than the angels, as He has, by inheritance,
   obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels
   said He at any time, You are My Son, this day have I begotten You? And
   again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?"

   When the Father looks at Christ, He sees in Him Atonement accomplished,
   satisfaction presented, sin annihilated, the elect redeemed, the
   Covenant ratified, the everlasting purpose settled on eternal
   foundations! O Beloved, since Christ has magnified God's Law and made
   it honorable--and since He has poured out His soul unto death--He may
   well possess the power to say, "Father, I will."

   Remember, too, that Jesus still possesses this power and possesses it
   for you and for me. O my dear Hearers, you may well go to Christ and
   accept Him as your Mediator and Intercessor, since all this power to
   say, "Father, I will," is laid up in Him on purpose for poor believing
   sinners who come and take Him to be their Savior! You say that you
   cannot pray. Well, He can--ask Him to plead for you! And I thank God
   that, sometimes, when we do not ask Him to plead for us, He does it all
   the same, as He did for Peter, when Satan had desired to have him, but
   Christ had prayed for him. Peter did not know his danger, but the
   Savior did, and He pleaded for him at once. What a blessing it is to
   think of Christ, clothed with Divine authority and power, using it all
   for us! Well does Toplady sing--

   "With cries and tears He offered up

   His humble suit below!

   But with authority He asks,

   Enthroned in Glory now

   For all that come to God by Him.

   Salvation He demands,

   Points to their names upon His breast

   And spreads His wounded hands.

   His Covenant and Sacrifice

   Give sanction to His claim----

   'Father, I will that all My saints

   Be with Me where I am.'"

   Further, that power of Christ will land every Believer in Heaven.
   Notice how Christ turns all His pleading with God that way. He says,
   "Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with Me
   where I am; that they may behold My Glory." The devil says that we
   shall never get to Heaven, but we remember that declaration of Moses,
   "Your enemies shall be found liars unto you," and the arch-enemy will
   be found to be the arch-liar, for the Lord's Prayer will be heard and,
   as He pleads that those whom the Father gave Him should be brought up
   to be with Him where He is, you may depend upon it that they will all
   arrive safely in Heaven! And you, if you are among those who are given
   to Christ-- and you may know that by your faith in Him--shall be among
   that blessed company!

   I shall have finished with this first point when I have said this--that
   power which Christ had, may, in a measure, be gained by all His people.
   I dare not say and I would not say that any of us will ever be able to
   utter our Savior's words, "Father, I will." But I do say this--if you
   abide in Christ and His words abide in you--you may attain to such
   power in prayer that you shall ask what you will and it shall be done
   unto you. This is not a promise to all of you--no, not even to all of
   you who are God's people--but only to those of you who live wholly unto
   God and serve Him with all your heart. You can, by habitual communion
   with God, attain to such power with the Most High that men shall say of
   you what they used to say of Luther, "There goes a man who can ask what
   he likes of God and have it." You may attain to that glorious altitude!
   Oh, I would that every one of us would seek to reach this height of
   power and blessing! It is not the feeble Christian. It is not the
   worldly Christian who has just enough Grace to make him miserable--the
   man who has only about enough Grace to keep him from being absolutely
   immoral! That is not the man or woman who will prevail with God. You
   paddlers in Christianity who scarcely wet your toes--you who never go
   in beyond your ankles, or your knees--God will never give you this
   privilege unless you go in for it! Get where the waters are deep enough
   to swim and plunge in! Be perfectly consecrated to God! Yield your
   whole lives to His Glory without reserve! Then may you obtain something
   of your Master's power in prayer when He said, "Father, I will."

   II. Now I ask you kindly to accompany me, in the second place, to
   notice JESUS IN THE POWER OF HIS SUBMISSION. Our second text is all
   submission--"Not as I will."

   This utterance, "Not as I will," proved that the shrinking of Christ's
   Nature from that dreadful cup were all overcome. I do not believe that
   Christ was afraid to die. Do you believe that? Oh, no--many of His
   servants have laughed at death! I am sure that He was not afraid to
   die. What was it, then, that made that cup so awfully terrible? Jesus
   was to be made sin for us. He was to come under the curse for us! He
   was to feel the Father's wrath on account of human guilt and His whole
   Nature, not only His flesh, but His whole Being shrank from that
   fearful ordeal! It was not actual defilement that was to come upon Him,
   but it looked like it and, as Man, He could not tell what that cup of
   wrath must contain--

   "Immanuel, sunk with dreadful woe,

   Unfelt, unknown to all below--

   Except the Son of God--

   In agonizing pangs of soul

   Drinks deep of wormwood's bitterest bowl,

   And sweats great drops of blood." After dwelling in the love of God
   from all eternity, He was, in a few hours, to bear the punishment of
   man's sin, yet He must bear it and, therefore, He said, "Not as I will,
   but as You will." Do you wonder that He prayed, "If it is possible, let
   this cup pass from Me"? Is Christ to be blamed for this shrinking of
   Nature? My dear Friends, if it had been a pleasure to Him and He had
   had no shrinking, where would have been His holy courage? If it had not
   been a horrible and dreadful thing to Him, where would have been His
   submission, where would have been the virtue that made Atonement of it?
   If it had been a thing that He could not, or must not, shrink from,
   where would have been the pain, the wormwood, and the gall of it? The
   cup must be, in the nature of things, something from which He that
   bears it must shrink, or else it could not have been sufficient for the
   redemption of His people and the vindication of the broken Law of God!
   It was necessary, then, that Christ should, by such a prayer as this,
   prove that He had overcome all the shrinking of His Nature.

   "Not as I will," is also an evidence of Christ's complete submission to
   the will of His Father. "He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and,
   as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He opens not His mouth."
   There is no resistance, no struggling. He gives Himself up completely.
   "There," He seems to say to the Lord, "do what You will with Me; I
   yield Myself absolutely to Your will." There was on Christ's part no
   reserve, no wish, even, to make any reserve. I go further,

   and say that Jesus willed as God willed--and even prayed that the will
   of God, from which His Human Nature, at first, shrank, might be
   fulfilled. "Nevertheless not as I will, but as You will."

   O Brothers and Sisters--for you both need this Grace--pray God to help
   you to learn how to copy your Lord in total submission! Have you
   submitted to the Lord's will? Are you submitting now? Are not some of
   you like bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke? There is a text, you know,
   in the 131st Psalm, "My soul is even as a weaned child." I have
   sometimes thought that, for some of the Lord's children, the passage
   would have to be read, "My soul is even as a weaning child," and there
   are many of God's people who are very long in the weaning! You cannot
   get satisfaction, quiet and content, can you? Can you give yourself up
   entirely to God, that He may do whatever He likes with you?

   Have you some fear of a tumor, or a cancer? Is there before you the
   prospect of a painful and dangerous operation? Is business going badly
   with you, so that you will probably lose everything? Is a dear child
   sickening? Is the mother likely to be taken away? Will you have to lose
   your position and reputation if you are faithful to the Lord? Will you
   be exposed to cruel slanders? Will you probably be cast out of your
   employment if you do what is right? Come now, whatever you dread or
   expect, can you give yourself up wholly to God and say, "It is the
   Lord, let Him do what seem good to Him"? Your Lord and Master did--He
   said, "Not as I will." Oh, that He might teach you this Divine art of
   absolute resignation to the purpose and ordinance of God till you,
   also, would be able to say, "Not as I will"! Thus you will sing--

   "I bow to Your will, O God, and all Your ways adore! And every day I
   live I'll seek To please You more and more!"

   III. I have finished my discourse when I have just twisted these two
   sayings together a little. So, thirdly, let us COMBINE THE TWO
   PRAYERS-- "I will," yet, "Not as I will."

   First, let me say, Number One will help you very much to Number Two. If
   you learn to pray with Christ, with the holy boldness that almost says,
   "Father, I will," you are the man who will know how to say, "Not as I
   will." Is it not strange that it should be so? It looks like a
   contradiction, but I am sure that it is not so. The man who can have
   his will with God is the very man who does not want his own way with
   God. He who may have what he likes is the man who wishes to have what
   God likes!

   You remember the good old woman who lay near to death, and one said to
   her, "Do you not expect to die soon?" She answered, "I do not know
   whether I shall live or die and, what is more, I have no concern which
   way it is." Then the friend asked, "But if you had your choice whether
   you should live or die, which would you choose?" She replied, "I would
   rather that the Lord's will should be done." "But suppose the Lord's
   will were to leave it entirely to you to choose whichever you liked?"
   "Then," she said, "I would kneel down and pray the Lord to choose for
   me." And I think that is the best way to live--not to have any choice
   at all, but to ask the Lord to choose for you! You can always have your
   way, you know, when your way is God's way. The sure way to carry out
   self-will is when self-will is nothing else but God's will! Oh, that
   the Lord would teach us this mighty power with Him in prayer! It will
   not be given without much close fellowship with Him. Then, when we know
   that we can have what we will of Him, we shall be in the right state to
   say, "Not as I will."

   The next remark that I would make is, that Number Two is necessary for
   Number One. That is to say, until you can say, "Not as I will," you
   never will be able to say, "Father, I will." I believe that one reason
   why people cannot prevail in prayer is because they will not yield to
   God. And they cannot expect God to yield to them. God does this and
   that with you, and you quarrel with Him. And then you go upstairs and
   begin to pray--get down on your knees and make your peace with Him,
   first--for if you must not come to the altar till you have become
   reconciled unto your brother, how can you come to the Throne of Grace
   till you have given up your quarrel with God?

   But some people are never at peace with God. I have heard of a good
   friend who lost a child and he was wearing mourning clothes several
   years afterwards. And he was always fretting about the dear child, till
   a Quaker said to him, "What? Have you not forgiven God yet?" And there
   are some people who have not yet forgiven God for taking their loved
   ones. They ought always to have blessed Him, for He never takes away
   any but those whom He lent to us, and we should bless His name as much
   for taking them, again, as for lending them to us. Dear Friends, you
   must submit to the will of God or else you cannot have power with Him
   in prayer.

   "Well," you say, "you will not let me have my own way at all."
   Certainly, I will not let you have your own way! But when you say,
   "There, Lord, I have no quarrel with You. Do what You will with me,"
   then He will say, "Rise, My child, ask what you will, and I will give
   it to you; open your mouth wide and I will fill it."

   Notice, also, dear Friends, that Jesus will help us to have Number One
   and Number Two. He gives Himself over to us to teach us the power of
   prevailing prayer, but He also gives Himself over to teach us the art
   of blessed submission in prayer--and it is His will that these two
   should not be separated. "Father, I will," is Christ's word on our
   behalf. And, "Not as I will," is equally Christ's word on our behalf.
   When you cannot pray either of these prayers as you would, fall back
   upon Christ's prayer and claim it as your own.

   Lastly, I think that true sonship will embody both Number One and
   Number Two. It is the true child of God who knows that he is his
   Father's child, who says, "Father, I will." He is often very bold where
   another would be presumptuous. Oh, I have heard full often of
   somebody's prayers--I will not say who the somebody is--he seems so
   familiar with God in his prayer. Oh, yes, I know! You love those very
   stately prayers in which the bounds are set about the mountain-top and
   no man may dare to come near! You make the Throne of Grace to be like
   Sinai was of old, of which the Lord said, "Whoever touches the mount
   shall be surely put to death: there shall not an hand touch it, but he
   shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it is beast or man, it
   shall not live."

   "Oh, but," you say, "so-and-so is so familiar at the Mercy Seat!" Yes,
   I know, and you think that is a pity, do you not? Perhaps you are
   acquainted with a judge. Look at him on the bench wearing his wig and
   robe of office! But you will not dare to speak to him, there, unless
   you address him as, "My Lord," and behave very respectfully to him.
   By-and-by he goes home--and he has a little boy there, Master Johnny.
   Why, the child has seized hold of his father's whiskers! There he is,
   up on his father's back! "Why, Johnny, you are disrespectful!" "Oh, but
   he is my father!" says the boy, and his father says, "Yes, Johnny, that
   I am; and I do not want you to say, 'My Lord,' and talk to me as they
   do in the court." So, there are certain liberties which God's children
   may take with Him which He counts no liberties at all, but He loves to
   be treated so by them. He will let each one of them say, "Father, I
   will," because they are His children!

   Then, mark you, you are not God's child unless you can also say,
   "Father, not as I will." The true child bends before His father's will.
   "Yes," he says, "I would like so-and-so." His father forbids it. "Then
   I do not want it and I will not touch it." Or he says, "I do not like
   to take that medicine, but my Father says I am to take it," and he
   takes the cup and he drinks the whole of its contents. The true child
   says, "Not as I will," although, after his measure, he also says,
   "Father, I will."

   I have only been talking to you who are the Lord's people. I hope you
   have learned something from this subject. I know you have if the Lord
   has taught you to pray after the fashion of these two prayers, as you
   humbly, yet believingly may, copying your Lord.

   But oh, what shall I say to those of you who are not the Lord's people?
   If you do not know how to pray at all, may the Lord teach you! If you
   do not yet know your needs, may the Lord instruct you! And let me tell
   you that if ever there shall come a time when you feel your need of a
   Savior, the Lord Jesus will be willing to receive you! If ever you
   should yearn after Him, you can be sure that He is also yearning after
   you. Even now--

   "Kindled His relentings are,"

   and if you will but breathe the penitent's prayer, "God be merciful to
   me, a sinner," and turn your eye Christ-ward, and Cross-ward, there is
   salvation for you even now! God grant that you may have it, for Jesus'
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 17:15-26; Matthew26:36-46.

   We will read, this evening, a portion of two prayers offered by our
   Divine Lord and Master on that night in which He was betrayed. The
   first is that memorable intercessory prayer of His recorded in the 17th
   Chapter of the Gospel according to John.

   John 17:15. I pray not that You should take them out of the world, but
   that You should keep them from the Evil One. Christ did not pray that
   His disciples should be taken out of the world. It is very seldom that
   we ought to present such a petition. If that had been a proper prayer
   for us to offer, it would have been authorized by the Master. There are
   times

   when, in great pain of body, or in deep depression of spirit, the
   Believer, like Elijah under the juniper tree, requests for himself that
   he may die. If you ever do pray such a prayer, utter it very softly,
   for the Master does not authorize it and that is a matter that must be
   left to the Lord of Life and Death. Jesus says here, "I pray not that
   You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them
   from the Evil One." Sin is the real evil of the world--the danger of
   our being entangled in worldly customs, or dropping into the evil ways
   of an ungodly generation. Christ prays that we may be kept from the
   evil that is in the world and we, also, may and must pray that the Lord
   will keep us from the evil by which we are surrounded--and especially
   from the Evil One who seeks our destruction.

   16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. "They are
   of another race--they are swayed by other motives, they have another
   life--they have another destiny, 'They are not of the world.'" Is that
   true of you, dear Hearer? We are reading out of God's Book, remember.
   This is the description of Christ's people--does it describe you? "They
   are not of the world." They are not worldly, they are other-worldly.
   Their thoughts and hearts are set upon the world to come."

   17. Sanctify them through Your Truth: Your Word is Truth. What? Do they
   need to be sanctified? They are not of the world and are kept from the
   evil in the world--do they need to be sanctified? Yes, we shall always
   need sanctifying until we reach our heavenly Home where sin cannot
   enter. Every day we need the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit
   to lead us unto holiness! "Sanctify them through Your Truth: Your Word
   is Truth." It is only the Truth of God that can beget holiness. False
   doctrine is never the medium of sanctification. You can tell which are
   false doctrines and which are the true by our Lord's own test--"By
   their fruits you shall know them." The same men who reject the
   old-fashioned doctrines also rebel against the old-fashioned style of
   living! Loose living generally goes with loose doctrine. There never
   was an age in which the Doctrines of Grace were despised, but, sooner
   or later, licentiousness prevailed. On the other hand, when we had
   Puritan teaching, we had also pure and holy living. This prayer is
   still needed for all Christ's disci-ples--"Sanctify them through Your
   Truth: Your Word is Truth."

   18. As you have sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them
   into the world. This is the original Missionary Society and the model
   for all others. Christ sent, commissioned, of the Father, and every
   saint commissioned of Christ. Are you carrying out your mission, O you
   people of God? How dare you call yourselves by that name if you have no
   mission to anybody! If you are living here only for yourself, how can
   you belong to Christ who never lived a moment for Himself, but always
   lived wholly for others?

   19. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself. "I set Myself apart, as One
   who is consecrated, dedicated, devoted to a grand design."

   19. That they, also, might be sanctified through the Truth. This is our
   Lord's prayer for His disciples. In the ninth verse we read, "I pray
   for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which You have given
   Me; for they are Yours." Now our Lord Jesus prays for those who are to
   be His people. I wonder whether there are any of them here tonight?

   20. Neither pray I for these, alone, but for them, also, which shall
   believe in Me through their word. There is a great company of people
   who are not, at present, Believers, but who shall yet believe on Christ
   through the testimony of those who are already Believers on Him. O God,
   call out many such through our word!

   21. That they all may be one. This is Christ's prayer for all those who
   shall believe on Him, that they may be converted and brought into the
   one Church, together, with those who are already there--"that they all
   may be one."

   21. As You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they, also, may be
   one in Us: that the world may believe that You have sent Me. Christ
   would have all His people joined in communion with Himself and with His
   Father. And when that is the case, then will men know that Christ came
   into the world for a definite purpose--"that the world may believe that
   You have sent Me."

   22- 23. And the glory which you gave Me, I have given them; that they
   may be one, even as We are One: I in them, and You in Me, that they may
   be made perfect in one. Christ is the Incarnation of God, and the
   Church should be the incarnation of Christ. Oh, when shall this great
   prayer be answered?

   23- 26. And that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have
   loved them, as You have loved Me. Father, I will that they, also, whom
   You have given Me, be with Me where I am, that they may behold My
   Glory, which You have given Me: for You loved Me before the foundation
   of the world. O righteous Father, the world has not known You: but I
   have known You, and these have known that You have sent Me. And I have
   declared unto them Your name, and will declare it: that the

   love wherewith You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them. A very
   short time after our Divine Lord offered this intercessory
   supplication, He prayed a very different prayer, in a strangely-altered
   style. You will find it in the Gospel according to Matthew, chapter
   twenty-six. Remember that there was a very short interval between the
   utterance of the majestic prayer I have been reading and the
   presentation of the cries and tears of which we are now to read.

   Matthew 26:36-40. Then came Jesus with them unto a place called
   Gethsemane, and said unto the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and
   pray yonder. And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,
   and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then said He unto them, My
   soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: tarry you here, and
   watch with Me. And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and
   prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from
   Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as You will. And He came unto the
   disciples and found them asleep, and said unto Peter, What, could you
   not watch with Me one hour? He felt the need of human sympathy in that
   awful hour. Yet He trod the winepress alone.

   41. Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit,
   indeed, is willing, but the flesh is weak. Admire the tenderness of
   Jesus in making this apology for His disciples. What He said about them
   was true, but it is not everybody who would have uttered that gentle
   truth at such a trying time. Dear Friends, make excuses for one another
   whenever you can! Never make them for yourselves, but often make them
   for others, and especially when some treat you as you think very
   untenderly, be the more tender towards them.

   42-44. He went away, again, the second time, and prayed, saying, O My
   Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink it, Your
   will be done. And He came and found them asleep again: for their eyes
   were heavy. And He left them, and went away, again, and prayed the
   third time, saying the same words. You cannot use much variety of
   language when your heart is very heavy. You will usually dwell upon
   just a few words at such a time. Do not blame yourself for doing so--it
   is natural, and it is right. Even your Lord, the Master of language,
   "prayed the third time, saying the same words."

   45, 46. Then came He to His disciples, and said unto them, Sleep on
   now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of
   Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going:
   behold, he is at hand that does betray Me. May the Master never have to
   say this concerning any of us, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

Love Stronger Than Death

   (No. 2377)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY 5,
   1888.

   "When Jesus knew that His hour was come that He should depart out of
   this world unto the Father, having loved His own which were in the
   world, He loved them unto the end." John 13:1.

   THIS is a kind of preface to the story of the foot-washing, and a very
   wonderful preface it is, when coupled with the third and fourth verses,
   upon which I commented. "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all
   things into His hands, and that He had come from God, and was going to
   God, rose from supper and laid aside His garments; and took a towel,
   and girded Himself." This is the frame of the picture that is here
   presented to us. To what shall I compare it? It is like unto a gate of
   the Golden City--each gate is one huge pearl and surely this verse is a
   jewel of inestimable price! The foot-washing picture is set within this
   precious frame.

   This memorable and symbolical act took place at the end of our Lord's
   sojourn here below. The Passion was the end of His life and we may
   consider that the Passion was about to begin. That same night He would
   go to Gethsemane and, in less than 24 hours, the dear hands that washed
   the disciples' feet would be nailed to the accursed wood and He who
   spoke so tenderly to His little band of followers would be in His death
   agonies.

   It is an important thing to know how a man feels when he comes to the
   real crisis of his life. He has cultivated a great variety of feelings
   during his career, but what has been his ruling passion? You will see
   it now. It has passed into a proverb that, "The ruling passion is
   strong in death," and there is great truth in the saying. In the light
   of the man's departure, we shall see what power really ruled him. It
   was precisely so with our Divine Master. He had almost reached the end
   of His earthly life. He had come to a season of awful agony. He was
   about to endure the great and terrible death of the Cross, by which He
   was to purchase eternal redemption for all His people. What will be
   uppermost in His mind, now? What will He think of His disciples, now
   that He has so many other things to think of--now that the thought of
   His approaching death comes over Him--now that the agony and bloody
   sweat of Gethsemane are so near?

   What will Jesus think of His disciples at such a time as this and under
   such circumstances as these? Our text is the answer to that
   question--"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His
   hands, and that He had come from God, and was going to God, rose from
   supper and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded
   Himself." His love was burning as brightly at the Paschal Supper as
   ever it burned before! Yes, and it seemed as if, in that wondrous
   prayer that is recorded in the 17th Chapter of John, and in the
   wonderful discourse which accompanied it, the love of Jesus had never
   before flamed out so clearly! Then were the great beacon fires lit and
   the fierce winds that blew around the Savior fanned them to their full
   force of flame. Now can you say of Jesus, "Behold how He loved His
   disciples!" for even at the end of His life He still loved those whom
   He had loved before!

   With that thought in your minds, will you follow me while I take the
   text to pieces and dwell upon almost every word of it?

   I. First, then, concerning our blessed Master, let us consider WITH
   WHOM HE ASSOCIATED and of whom this verse now speaks. They are called,
   "His own." It is a brief description, but it is wonderfully
   full--"Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto
   the end."

   "His own." There was a circle--sometimes a wide circle--round the
   Savior. It was made up of publicans and sinners and He had a measure of
   love to all of them, a benevolent desire to bless them, but there was
   an inner circle, containing the 12 Apostles and some godly women who
   had joined themselves unto Him. These were, "His own." To them He often

   expounded the hidden meaning of a parable which He left unexplained to
   the crowd. To them He often brought many a dainty dish which was
   especially reserved for their table and not intended for the multitude.
   Bread and fish would do for the crowd, but Jesus had choicer fare for
   "His own." They were a special people--many knew them, many despised
   them--but Jesus loved them, and this was the main thing which made them
   "His own."

   You know how they came to be "His own." He chose them before the earth
   was. A man may surely choose his own wife and Christ chose His own
   spouse. He chose His own Church and, while the Scripture stands, that
   doctrine can never be eradicated from it. Before the day-star knew its
   place, or planets ran their rounds, Christ had made His choice and,
   having made it, He stood to it! He chose them for His love and He loved
   them for His choice.

   Having loved them and chosen them, He espoused them unto Himself. "They
   shall be Mine," He said. "I will be married to them, I will be bone of
   their bone and flesh of their flesh." Consequently, in the fullness of
   time, He came here, made one with our humanity, that He might be seen
   to be a true Husband to "His own"--"His own" by choice--"His own" by
   espousal.

   They were "His own" also, for His Father gave them to Him. The Father
   committed them into His hands. "Yours they were," said Jesus, "and You
   gave them to Me." The Father loved the Son and committed all things
   into His hands, but He made a special committal of His own chosen
   people. He gave them to Him and entered with Him into surety
   engagements on their behalf, that as they were His sheep, committed to
   His charge, He would deliver them up and not one of them should be torn
   by the wolf, or die by the frost or the heat, but that all should pass,
   again, under the rod of Him that counts them. That Great Shepherd of
   the sheep will take care of the whole flock that was entrusted to His
   care! He will not lose one of His sheep or lambs. At the last, Jesus
   will say, "Here am I, Father, and the children that You have given Me;
   of all that You gave Me, I have lost none." Thus, they are "His own" by
   His own choice, "His own" by espousal and, "His own" by His Father's
   gift!

   But these whom He called, "His own," were soon to be His by a wondrous
   purchase. He looked upon their redemption as being already
   accomplished, for in His prayer He said to His Father, "I have finished
   the work which You gave Me to do." Beloved Friends, have you ever
   thought how dearly we are Christ's by His redemption of us? "You are
   not your own; you are bought with a price." Have you ever realized the
   price that was paid for you? I sometimes think that if I could have
   been there, I would have said, "O great and glorious Lord, I beseech
   You not to pay such a price for me! It is too great a sacrifice that
   You should be made sin for me, that I might be made the righteousness
   of God in You!" But He would do it. He loved us better than He loved
   Himself! He would do it and He has paid the purchase price for us, and
   we are His--and we will not run back from the glad confession! Well may
   He call us, "His own," when it cost Him so much to redeem us!

   But we have become "His own" by His conquest of us. He had called His
   disciples by His Grace. He had drawn each one of them by cords of love
   and they had run after Him--and it is the same with you and me. You
   remember when He drew you, do you not? Can you ever forget when, at
   last, you yielded to the power of those bands of love, those cords of a
   Man? Often since then have you sung--

   "Oh, happy day, that fixed my choice On You, my Savior, and my God!
   Well may this glowing heart rejoice And tell its raptures all abroad!
   'Tis done! The great transaction's done! I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine-- He drew me, and I followed on, Charmed to confess the voice
   Divine." Beloved, you are "His own," now, because you have yielded
   yourselves to Him. You delight to think that you are His. There is no
   greater joy to you than to feel that you belong to Christ! The fact
   that you are truly Christ's is the fountain of innumerable pleasures
   and blessings to your heart! Jesus calls us, "His own"--His own sheep,
   His own disciples, His own friends, His own brethren, the members of
   His body! What a title for us to wear, "His own"! I have heard of some
   who have felt it an honor to be called, "The Devil's Own." I trust that
   you have escaped from such a title as that and now you are Christ's
   own. How many regiments have felt pleasure in being called, the King's
   Own, the Queen's Own, the Prince's Own! Oh, but we are HIS OWN! He owns
   us! He calls us, "His own." Thus He distinguishes us from the rest

   of mankind and sets us apart unto Himself. "My name shall be named on
   them," He says. We are "His own." Surely, this is the highest honor
   that can be put upon us even in the Last Great Day. "They shall be
   Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, is that day when I make up My jewels."

   Now I trust we can say that we desire to serve Christ in our vocation.
   I feel happy to be among the favored few whose vocation it is to serve
   Christ, those who are permitted to spend all their time and all their
   strength in that dear service. We are, "His own," but so are you, "His
   own," if you believe in Him. You, also, are Christ's own, up in an
   attic. Christ's own at the washtub. Christ's own in the fields at the
   plow. Christ's own making the hay. I am not wandering from my subject
   when I say this, for Christ has "His own" among all these classes! "His
   own" were fishermen. "His own" cast the net into the Sea of Galilee.
   "His own" drew it to shore. "His own" were the poor of this world. His
   own, His very own, His choicest and His best friends and followers,
   were just such! They were unlearned and ignorant men, yet they were
   "His own." So the Apostle says, "God has chosen the foolish things of
   the world to confuse the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of
   the world to confuse the things which are mighty; and base things of
   the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and
   things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are: that no
   flesh should glory in His Presence."

   Oh, the wondrous sovereignty of Divine Love! I trust that there are
   some here, tonight, who Christ calls "His own" although they do not yet
   know that it is so! Bought with His blood and they are not aware of it?
   Chosen before the foundation of the world and yet they have not
   discovered it? May the Lord reveal to you His everlasting love and help
   you to make your calling and election sure from this time forth!

   I have said as much as time will permit me to say about our Lord's dear
   associates, the disciples, whom He calls "His own."

   II. Now, in the second place, you have a full description of how Jesus
   had felt towards them up to that moment-- "Having loved His own."

   How much can be done with one stroke of a pen! I have sometimes
   marveled to see how much a great artist can do by a single touch. His
   work has seemed unfinished, but he has come with a brush and just
   thrown in a few strokes--and the canvas that was dead has seemed to
   live before you! Now, John is a great master of the art of
   word-painting and he gives you the whole history of Christ's dealings
   with His disciples in these few words, "Having loved His own."

   For, remember, that is how He began with them. They were poor and
   inconsiderable, but He loved them, and He showed His love to them by
   calling them to be His disciples. That love worked upon their hearts
   and made them obedient to His call. He began by loving them. David
   says, "You have loved my soul out of the pit." I do not know a more
   beautiful description of conversion and salvation. The love of God
   loves us up out of the pit and loves us to Christ. Thus Christ loved
   His people from the beginning and proved His love by drawing them to
   Himself--and the cords He used to draw them were the bands of His love.

   Having begun by loving them, He went on teaching them, but all His
   teaching was love, for they were such dull scholars, quick to forget,
   yet slow to remember, that He had to keep on loving them or He would
   have been tired of trying to train them! "Have I been so long time with
   you and yet have you not known Me, Philip?" There is a mass of love in
   that question! So was it when He was dealing with Thomas. In His
   tenderness He submitted without question to the doubting disciple's
   test. He said to Him, "Reach here your finger, and behold My hands; and
   reach here your hand, and thrust it into My side: and be not faithless,
   but believing." All His teaching was uttered with lips of love--and all
   His instruction consisted of lessons of love.

   The Lord kept on loving His disciples although their natures were
   amazingly imperfect, all of them! There was not one among them who had
   what one would call an all-round nature, unless it was John, and even
   he was nasty in temper and would have called down fire from Heaven upon
   certain Samaritans. Yet the Master kept on loving them. He had made up
   His mind to love them and He never ceased to love them as long as He
   was with them! And He has gone on loving them ever since. At the time
   when He was about to depart out of the world unto the Father, they
   still needed to have their feet washed, and He loved them enough to
   render even that lowly service for them. All the infirmities, the
   imperfections, the carnality, the dullness and the slowness of their
   nature which He saw much more clearly than they saw it, did not make
   Him cease to love them--"Having loved His own which were in the world,
   He loved them unto the end."

   Strangest of all, when He opened His eyes and looked into the future
   and saw that they would soon be cowardly and faithless, He loved them
   all the same! He said, "All you shall be offended because of Me this
   night," and so it came to pass, for, "they all forsook Him, and fled."
   He told Peter that he would deny Him three times and so he did. Yet it
   was true all the while, "Having loved His own which were in the world,
   He loved them unto the end." That sums it all up! There was never a
   touch of hate, there was never any anger, there was never any
   weariness, there was never any luke-warmness in Jesus towards His
   disciples--it was always just this--"Having loved His own which were in
   the world, He loved them unto the end." That is the love of Christ to
   His chosen and that is the love of Christ to me! I do not think that
   those gentlemen who have written a, "Life of Christ," could write this
   part of it. This is a portion of the life of Christ that needs not so
   much to be written as to be known in the heart and in the soul.

   How have you found Christ, my Brothers and Sisters? If you have known
   Him, what has been His conduct towards you? You answer, "Love." As for
   me, I never knew, I never heard of such a Lover as He is! I never
   dreamed that He could be such as He has been to me! Oh, how I must have
   vexed and grieved His gracious heart and caused Him pain! But never,
   never, never once have I had anything from Him but love! "Having loved
   His own." That expression sums up the whole of Christ's conduct towards
   His chosen people! It is like a miniature painting--it has every
   feature of His character. There it is, all of it. You may apply a
   microscope and look as long as you like, but you will find that it is
   all there. "Having loved His own."

   So then, you have seen your Lord associated with His disciples up to
   this point, and you have learned that He has manifested nothing else
   towards them but love.

   III. But now, thirdly, WHAT A CHANGE WAS COMING OVER HIM! "Jesus knew
   that His hour was come that

   He should depart out of this world unto the Father."

   Dear Friends, it was an amazing change that was coming over Him, for,
   in the first place, though it is so tenderly described here, yet He
   knew that He had to die. You do not wish me, I am sure, to tell you of
   all the surroundings of the Cross, of all the bitterness and woe that
   culminated in that cup of mingled wormwood and gall. Your heart can
   never fail to remember the wounds He endured when suffering for you.

   Well, now, if you and I had to bear all that Christ had to suffer, it
   would engross our thoughts--we should not be able to think of anything
   else but that--but it did not engross our Lord's thoughts! He still
   thought of "His own." He loved "His own" unto the end! He went on with
   that same calm, solid, resolute love which He had shown towards them
   before. He set His face like a flint to go up to Jerusalem, but there
   was no flint in His heart--it had all gone into His face. He had
   undertaken the work of His people's redemption and He must go through
   with it! Death, itself, could not change His love. You know the love of
   which Solomon sings at the end of the Canticles--"Many waters cannot
   quench love, neither can the deeds drown it." And he says, "Love is
   strong as death." Truly, in our Lord's case, love was stronger than
   that death of deaths which He deigned to die that He might make us
   live! Now is His great "hour" of trial, but He is true to "His own"
   even in this dread hour. He is about to die, but He still loves "His
   own."

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, that is not all! Jesus was about to depart
   out of this world, to go away from His disciples. After a while He
   would see them no more with His bodily eyes--neither would they hear
   His voice leading them and teaching them. It may be true that, "Absence
   makes the heart grow fonder," but, alas, we have met with many
   instances in which mortal men have quite forgotten those whom they
   professed to love when once the sea has rolled between them. Many
   hearts are dependent upon eyesight. It is a pity that it should be so,
   but it was not so with Christ. All the distance between earth and
   Heaven was soon to intervene between our Lord and His disciples, but
   still He loved them and He loves them still. No distance makes any
   difference between Jesus and "His own." "Having loved His own which
   were in the world, He loved them unto the end."

   Yet, remember, that the Savior was about to undergo a very amazing
   change in another respect--He was going to the Father. Have any of us
   the slightest idea of what He is, now, with the Father? I will not
   attempt to describe the supernal splendors of His Throne, the glories
   which His redeemed delight to lay at His feet, the songs which angels
   and cherubim and seraphim continually present before Him--but this
   verse we love and we can truly sing--

   "Now though He reigns exalted high, His love is still as great; Well He
   remembers Calvary, Nor lets His saints forget."

   I cannot describe these wonderful changes of our Lord, from life to
   death, from death to resurrection, from resurrection to ascension, from
   ascension to the glories of His Father's Throne. Would all these
   changes make any alteration in Him? No, none of them! "Having loved His
   own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end."

   I shall try to speak of that, presently, and that will be my last
   point. But before we come to that theme, we must see what would be the
   condition of "His own." I have shown you what would be Christ's
   condition, and the change that would take place in Him.

   IV. Now, fourthly, WHAT WOULD BE THEIR CONDITION?

   Why, they would remain where they were--"His own which were in the
   world." To me, there seems to be a great abyss of meaning in that
   expression, "in the world." Some of you know more about what this means
   than others of us do. The Church of God in London is nothing but a camp
   in the midst of heathendom. The sooner we believe that terrible truth
   the better, because it is really so--and the Church of God in the world
   is nothing but a traveling tent in the midst of a world that lies in
   the Wicked One. We are "in the world." Now, some of you know what it is
   to be "in the world." When you get home, tonight, there will be little
   but oaths and cursing. Some of God's dear people, whom He loves with
   all His heart, are still in the world, seeing that which vexes them as
   much as Lot was vexed by the filthy conversation of the men of Sodom.
   "In the world!" Now, those whom Christ was about to leave in the world
   would be left in the midst of all the abounding wickedness, idolatry
   and blasphemy in about as ungodly an age as man could live in--yet He
   left them "in the world."

   Being in the world, you see, they began to be persecuted. They were
   stoned. They were shut up in prison. They were dragged into the
   amphitheatre to be torn apart by lions. But "He loved them unto the
   end." You know how that blessed eighth chapter of the Epistle to the
   Romans concludes. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall
   tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
   peril, or sword? As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the
   day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. No, in all these
   things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am
   persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
   nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
   depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the
   love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   In addition to being persecuted, they were liable to be severely
   tempted. All kinds of bribes were put in their way and all sorts of
   pleasures and lusts were presented to them. They were men of like
   passions with ourselves, so those temptations were very real to them.
   They were "in the world" and Jesus had gone to Heaven. They were "in
   the world," also, in affliction. Ah, dear Friends, we find that we,
   too, are, in this sense, "in the world." However closely we live to
   God, we have pains of body and we have to grieve as we see our dear
   relatives suffering. We have losses and crosses because we are "in the
   world." God's curse still rests upon the earth--"Thorns, also, and
   thistles shall it bring forth to you." You may do what you like with
   it, but you cannot make it stop bringing forth thorns and thistles!
   They will continue to spring up as surely as the dust will return to
   the dust from whence it was taken.

   In the world, of course, they were in great labor, for they were left
   in the world to seek to convert it, or, at least, to call out the
   redeemed of Christ from among men by preaching the Gospel to every
   creature. And, being "in the world," they were surrounded by much
   weakness--weakness of body and weakness of mind--always needing to call
   to their Lord for help. He was up there upon the Throne of God and they
   were down in the dungeon! He was up there, clothed with all power, and
   they were down here in all weakness!

   V. NOW, HOW WILL JESUS BEHAVE TOWARDS THEM? That is our last question.
   We began with it and we will finish with it. Well, here is the answer.
   "Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the
   end." And we may rest sure that He always will love them and that He
   will never change from the tenderness of His heart towards them! "He
   loved them unto the end." What does that sentence mean?

   I think it means, first, that He loved them right on. The Hebrew, "His
   mercy endures forever," might be rendered, "His mercy endures to the
   end." That is, to the end which has no end, for there never will be an
   end to His mercy--and His love is continual, everlasting love, it will
   never come to an end! Christ, Himself, in His Passion, may be said to
   have come to an end--and He loved His disciples until His death--but it
   means that He loves them without any end, forever and ever. Having
   loved them while He was in the world with them, He loves them right
   straight on and always will love them when time shall be no more!

   I am sure, dear Friends, you believe in the everlasting love of God
   towards His people. If any of you do not, you are robbing yourselves of
   one of the greatest comforts that are to be found in the Scriptures. If
   the Lord can change, where are we? Everything has gone when His
   everlasting love is gone! I delight to believe that the mountains shall
   depart and the hills be removed but His kindness shall not depart from
   us, neither shall the Covenant of His peace be removed--it stands fast
   forever and ever!

   But the sentence may be rendered, "He loved them to perfection."
   "Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them to
   perfection." He could not love them any better--that was impossible. He
   could not love them more wisely--that would be out of the question. He
   could not love them more intensely--that is not supposable. Whatever
   the perfection of love may be--that is what Jesus Christ bestows upon
   His people! There is no such love in all the world as the love of
   Christ to His people! And if you were to gather up all the loves that
   ever were, of men and women, of mothers and children, of friends and
   friends, and heap up all these loves, the love of Jesus is of superior
   quality to them all, for none of those loves are absolutely perfect,
   but Jesus Christ loves to perfection!

   Those of you who have the Revised Version will find in the margin the
   following words, "to the uttermost." "Having loved His own which were
   in the world, He loved them to the uttermost"--to that which is
   uttermost, farthest and most distant--or, if I turn the word in another
   way, "He loved them utterly," unutterably, in such a way that you
   cannot tell, or conceive, or describe, or imagine how much He loved His
   people! He loved His people to the utmost stretch of love! So is it,
   there is no love like His and, as I said just now, all the loves in the
   world, compressed into one, would not equal it! "Having loved His own
   which were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost."

   Now, it seems to me that this Truth of God ought to tempt some poor
   soul to wish to enjoy Christ's love. "Oh," says one, "if I did but get
   that love, I would never lose it. He would love me to the uttermost.
   Oh, if I could but creep in among His people!" The way to discover
   Christ's love to you is that you should begin by trusting Him, and
   surely He will help you to do this. He is so true, so good, so able to
   save unto the uttermost, that if you will come and trust Him, trust Him
   wholly, trust Him, now, trust Him just as you are--He will save you to
   the uttermost and show His love to you to the uttermost! I have been
   preaching what I trust will comfort God's people, but I wish that some
   poor soul would come to Christ through it. I believe that is the right
   way to preach the Gospel.

   Have you not noticed, in the story of the Prodigal Son, that the father
   said, "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him; and put a ring on
   his hand, and shoes on his feet," and so on? But he did not go on to
   say, "Feed him." Do you notice what he said? It was, "Let us eat and be
   merry." "Well, but I thought he was thinking about his son." Yes, and
   he says, "Let us eat." So, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, let us
   eat and then sinners will begin to feel their mouths watering and they,
   also, will want to eat, and to have a share of the feast! This is the
   only way to make them eat! You can bring a horse to the water, but you
   cannot make him drink. But you are very likely to do so if you set
   another horse a-drinking! So, if you and I enjoy the sweetness of the
   love of Christ, there may be some in the gallery, and some downstairs
   who will say, "We wish that we knew it, too," and they will be wanting
   it! That is the way to make them eat. I pray the Lord, by His Spirit,
   to lead them to put their trust in this loving Savior, and each one to
   say--

   "Jesus, lover of my soul, Let me to Your bosom fly." He will let you
   fly to His bosom! therefore--

   "Come, and welcome, sinner, come."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 131-19

   Verse 1. Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His
   hour was come that He should depart out of this world unto the Father,
   having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the
   end. Our Lord Jesus Christ had a clear foresight of all He had to
   endure. Future things are happily hidden from our eyes. We do not even
   know the moment when we shall die, nor how it will be. It is well that
   it is so, but our Lord was able to anticipate His sufferings by knowing
   all about them--"Jesus knew that His hour was come." It was all
   appointed and nothing happens to any of us by accident--chance is
   banished from the Believer's creed! There is an appointed "hour" for
   each one of us and it will

   come in due season. "Jesus knew that His hour was come, that He should
   depart out of the world unto the Father." What a beautiful way of
   describing death! Christ's death was certainly a more trying one than
   ours will be, so that this description may apply to ours as well as to
   His.

   2. And supper being ended. I suppose that was the Paschal Supper.

   2. The devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's
   son, to betray Him. What a horrible purpose for Satan to put into the
   heart of Judas even in the Presence of Jesus! I hope that the devil
   will not put any such purpose into your hearts or into mine while we
   are in this House of Prayer, but no place is sacred from his intrusion,
   he will come in anywhere. Even where Christ, Himself, is at the head of
   the table, Judas may be sitting at that same table and Satan may then
   and there, put into his heart the horrible purpose of betraying his
   Master.

   3, 4. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His
   hands, and that He was come from God, and went to God, He arose from
   supper and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded
   Himself. Notice those words, "Jesus knowing...He took a towel, and
   girded Himself." If He had not known how great He was, there would not
   have been such condescension in His action, but He knew who He was and
   what the Father had entrusted to Him--"The Father had given all things
   into His hands." You might suppose that He would stand up, in a very
   dignified manner, and put on a purple robe and a golden belt, but,
   instead of that, He rose from the supper table, laid aside His
   garments, and took a towel, and girded Himself. He knew that He had
   come forth from God and that He was going back to God--and He performed
   this action on the way home to His Father. O dear Brothers and Sisters,
   if Christ thus stooped, how humble ought we to be! No office should be
   counted too lowly, no work for His servants should seem to be too
   humiliating, since Jesus "took a towel and girded Himself."

   5. After that, He poured water into a basin, and began to wash the
   disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was
   girded. You see that Jesus does His work well. He omits none of the
   details of it. He puts Himself in the place of a slave and He performs
   a slave's duty very thoroughly. I am afraid that, sometimes, we do our
   work for Him in a slovenly way, but Jesus was not satisfied with simply
   washing His disciples' feet--He must do the wiping, too. I bless Him
   that He did so, for this is a picture of what He has done for us. He
   has washed our feet and He often repeats the gracious act. The feet
   that Jesus washes, He will wipe--He has not begun His task without
   intending to finish it. I know that He will complete in my soul the
   work which He has undertaken, for He fulfilled, on the feet of His
   disciples, the office He had undertaken--"He began to wash the
   disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was
   girded."

   6. Then came He to Simon Peter: and Peter said to Him, Lord, do You
   wash my feet? I do not wonder that he said that. Would not you have
   been equally astonished had you been there? Peter had some faint idea
   who Christ was. He had confessed Him in such a way that Jesus had said
   to Him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona: for flesh and blood has not
   revealed it unto you, but My Father which is in Heaven." Knowing so
   much about Christ, Peter marveled at His action. He felt so astonished
   that He asked, "Do You wash my feet?"

   7. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do, you know not, now; but
   you shall know hereafter. I have heard this saying of our Lord applied
   to affliction and it is very true that what Jesus does, we do not, at
   present, understand, but we shall know, by-and-by. I do not think,
   however, that this sentence is very applicable that way, for there was
   no affliction in having his feet washed. The fact is, Brothers and
   Sisters, though it is a very humbling thing to say, we do not
   understand that which Jesus does--even His simplest actions are a
   mystery to us. We have never gone into the very depths of them so as to
   comprehend them. "What I do--even though I only wash your feet, plain
   and simple operation as that is-- you know not now; but you shall know
   hereafter." Our knowing times, dear Friends, are to come. We need not
   be so very anxious to know at present--this is the time of love. I
   would forego the filling of my head, for a while, if I could have my
   heart full, but, alas, we are generally so busy trying to attain merely
   head knowledge! My most intense longing is for a growing heart, a heart
   that truly loves the Savior. That is the way for the head to learn, for
   knowledge that comes by the way of the heart, and so enters the head,
   is the best of knowledge! Jesus said to Peter, "What I do, you know
   not, now; but you shall know hereafter."

   8. Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. That is just like
   Peter. If John had not told us who it was that said this, we would have
   known that it was Peter! He was always in such a hurry and he spoke so
   quickly that he made many mistakes, yet he was always so honest and so
   true, that his Master forgave his faults and helped him to correct
   them.

   8. He answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with Me. If
   Christ does not cleanse us, we do not belong to Him. If He does not,
   day by day, exercise a purifying influence over us, we are not His.

   9. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet, only, but also my hands
   and my head. How that pendulum swings to and fro! It went this way just
   now--"You shall never wash my feet." Now it goes right away to the
   other extreme-- "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my
   head." Go more gently, Peter, be more quiet! Why do you go so far in
   one direction and then rush off so far in another way? Your Master
   knows better than you know what is right for you.

   10. Jesus said to him, He that is washed, needs only to wash his feet,
   but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all. Dear Friends,
   when we believe in Christ, we are washed in the Fountain filled with
   blood, and we are clean. But this world is such a sinful place that we
   cannot walk through it for even a day without some of its mire and dust
   clinging to us. Besides, God's lilies are so pure that they are hardly
   fit to bloom in such a defiling atmosphere. Oh, how we need that the
   dew should wash the lily when the night comes! How greatly we need to
   have the foot-washing administered to us every day! We need not repeat
   the first great washing--the bath by which our sins were cleansed--when
   that was done, it was done once and for all. Our sin was pardoned as
   before a Judge, but we need it to be taken away as before our Father,
   for we are now under His loving discipline!

   Christ further said to His disciples, "You are clean, but not all."
   Does He say that to us at this time? "You are clean, but not all."
   Where sits the man, in this House of Prayer, who is not clean? The
   sinner who has not yet been washed by Jesus Christ? Where sits the
   woman who is not clean? The Lord have mercy upon you, dear Friends! You
   know, that in the olden days, they put a red cross on the door of the
   house where the plague was. We cannot put a cross upon you, but I pray
   you to consider yourselves as marked men and marked women in the sight
   of God. And I pray the Lord to take that mark away by causing you to be
   washed, that you may be clean every whit. How quickly He can wash the
   foulest sinners! He that believes in Jesus is washed in the precious
   blood and he is clean. God cleanse us all for His great name's sake!

   11-15. For He knew who should betray Him; therefore said He, You are
   not all clean. So after He had washed their feet, and had taken His
   garments, and was set down again, He said unto them, know you what I
   have done to you? You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so
   I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you,
   also, ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an
   example, that you should do as I have done to you. Christ's actions are
   the pattern for us to imitate! Oh, that we followed them more closely!

   16. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his
   lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. Sometimes
   we think that we are a deal too great to wash anybody's feet--we would
   like to see a person dare propose it to us, such big people as we are!
   If we talk like that, there is great need that we should be taken down.
   That would be the true way to rise in the likeness of Jesus! Oh, that
   we were lowlier in humility! We should be higher in Grace if we were.

   17. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them. Peter
   needed to know them. Jesus would have us do them.

   18. I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. Christ has a
   chosen people, though some will not believe it. Yet it is so, for He
   says, "I know whom I have chosen."

   18, 19. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, he that eats bread
   with Me has lifted up his heel against Me. Now I tell you before it
   comes, that when it has come to pass, you may believe that I am He.
   "That I am." So, you see, even the great trouble of the early
   Church--the betrayal by Judas--was used by Christ for the strengthening
   of His disciples' faith. He foretold that it would be as it came to
   pass. So, dear Friends, in these latter days, many forsake the Gospel,
   but Jesus told us that it would be so. He taught His servants to write
   that there would be a falling away and that in these last days there
   would be scoffers--and as we read the prophecies and compare them with
   the fulfillment--even the doleful fact, itself, confirms our faith in
   our Lord! God bless to us this brief reading of His own Word! Amen.

Pardon for the Greatest Guilt

   (No. 2378)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   8, 1888.

   "Manasseh did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto
   the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the
   children of Israel. And when he was in affliction, he asked the LORD,
   his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and
   prayed unto Him: and He was entreated of him, and heard his
   supplication, and brought him, again, to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
   Then Manasseh knew that the LORD, He was God." 2 Chronicles 33:2,12,13.

   THIS story of Manasseh is a very valuable one. I feel sure of this
   because you meet with it twice in the Word of God. It is a dreary
   story--a very dreary story--and the sad part of it is given twice in
   the Bible, while the consoling part of it is only recorded once. The
   Holy Spirit has some motive and reason for this, we may be sure. If you
   look in the Second Book of Kings, in the 21st Chapter, you will find,
   with some little alteration, the very same story that we have been
   reading, so far as the deplorable part of it is concerned. I take it
   that this is because God would have us pay great attention to this
   narrative. He would have us, again and again, dwell upon such wonders
   of Sovereign Grace as Manasseh presents to us.

   Dear Friends, you have, here, the history of a great sinner, saved--I
   might say, a very great sinner, saved--and this is narrated in the Word
   of God that other great sinners, seeing it, may be encouraged to seek
   mercy as Manasseh sought and found it! No man, I trust, will be so base
   as to turn the mercy of God into an excuse for sin. He would deserve
   the deepest Hell, who would take encouragement to sin from the
   greatness of pardoning love! I will not suppose that anyone here is so
   driven by the devil as to do that, but I will trust that some great
   sinner, in whom despair has fixed itself, who has said, "Because there
   is no hope for me, therefore I will go farther into sin," will be
   stopped in his evil course as he hears of the amazing, the immeasurable
   mercy of God to the greatest and most diabolical form of sinner!

   This case of Manasseh is put in Scripture that it may breed its like,
   not in its sinfulness, but in its faith, its prayer, its humiliation,
   its seeking and its finding mercy. How many souls have been converted
   by reading the story of John Bunyan as he has written it in his, Grace
   Abounding to the Chief of Sinners! I doubt not that many a swearing
   tinker has said, "There is mercy for me as well as for John of Elstow."
   Who, that has read the first part of the, "Life of John Newton," has
   not felt encouraged to seek and find the Savior? The story of Colonel
   Gardiner and how the Lord met with him has been blessed to many a
   soldier, and he has had hope against hope that there may be mercy even
   for him in the depth of his sin.

   I can well remember the time when I carefully treasured up every
   instance of God's mercy to sinners, as a man might store up pearls, for
   it seemed to me, then, that if I could find a soul like myself--equally
   sinful and equally convicted of sin, who, nevertheless, found
   mercy--then I, also, might find mercy, for I believed that God acted
   upon a certain style and scale and that He would do for me what He had
   done for others. "Then will I teach transgressors Your ways," said
   David, as much as if he had said, "If You save me, then I shall know
   that it is Your way to save great sinners, and I will go and tell other
   sinners what Your ways are, and my case shall be a proof of how You
   will act towards them."

   I pray that while the door of Divine Mercy is open, some of you may
   come in. When the door of Noah's Ark was open, you know that it was
   wide enough to let in the elephant and, consequently, there was plenty
   of room for the mouse, and where the camel could enter, you may be sure
   that the sheep could go. If you should not feel that you have sinned
   after the terrible fashion of Manasseh, yet, if there is room in God's
   love for such as he, there is room enough for you! And the silver
   trumpet is ringing out the joyous invitation that we have often sung--

   "Come, and welcome, to the Savior, He in mercy bids you come! Come be
   happy in His favor, Longer from Him do not roam. Come, and welcome,
   Come to Jesus, sinner, come!"

   The good Brother who prayed, just now, pleaded that God would give us
   an unusual blessing and your hearts, as well as mine, said, "Amen!" May
   it come to some of you who did not pray for it! May the Lord be found
   of them that sought Him not, according to His ancient promise! May He
   now say, "Behold Me, behold Me," to those who were not His people! And
   may some be found of Him who never could have been found of Him if His
   Grace were not most sovereign, most rich, and most free!

   Now, in coming close to our subject, we are going to do two things.
   First, let us examine the case before us. And, secondly, let us
   consider why there should be others like it.

   I. First, LET US EXAMINE THE CASE BEFORE US.

   We begin by noticing that Manasseh was the son of a good father. I
   think that it always aggravates sin in any man when he comes of a holy
   stock. You who were nursed amid a godly mother's prayers and trained by
   a faithful father's earnest teachings cannot sin as cheaply as others.
   You know that in doing evil you have to go against all your home
   influences--some of you would have to go over hedge and ditch to get to
   Hell, after having such parents as you have had. Mr. Whitefield tells
   us of a young man who said that he could not live in the house that his
   father had left him, for, as he coarsely put it, "Every chair and table
   in it stinks of piety." He could not be happy in it, he said, living as
   he lived, while he remembered what his father used to do there. If I am
   addressing any men or women who have sinned against early training, I
   remind them most solemnly that their guilt has an extraordinary
   blackness about it! I am sure that Absalom was a greater sinner because
   he rebelled against a loving father, who cried over him, "O my son
   Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for you, O
   Absalom, my son, my son!"

   Oftentimes, in my youth, I felt that I could not live without Christ,
   for my mother's sake, for my father's sake, for my grandfather's sake
   whom I revered so much. It was a great inducement to me to keep from
   the ways of sin and to seek after their God and Savior. And it should
   be to every right-minded young man, to every right-minded boy or girl,
   a sweet inducement to seek the Lord because He is your father's God.
   But if you throw this all away. If you are determined that you will not
   know the God of your fathers, then on your head shall rest the greater
   sin!

   In the next place, this young man undid all his father's actions. He
   repaired the altars that his father had thrown down and he threw down
   the altars which his father had built up. Do I address one who is
   trying to do that--seeking to change all that was done by those who
   went before you? You have turned the house upside down. You have
   altered the character of your father's business. You have discharged
   his godly servants. Everything that used to be is changed-- people
   hardly know the place, now, after the alterations which you have
   made--and you have gloried in them! You said to yourself, as you came
   in here, tonight, that if you lived, you would turn the thing upside
   down worse than ever! Oh, is it so, that you think it is such a
   desirable thing to be undoing all that was done by your godly ancestors
   and predecessors?

   Then, this Manasseh served false gods. You say that you do not so. Oh,
   but if I speak, and your conscience speaks, will not the still small
   voice whisper to you that you have been doing just that? Your lusts,
   are they not your god, young man? Are you not giving your very body to
   the commission of sin? And strong drink--do you not worship that vile
   thing? Or have you even taken to gambling? There are many ways in which
   men ruin themselves and this is one of the chief of them, just now, in
   this city. What is the sin of which you are most fond? That is your god
   and, oh, I fear that I am not talking to the wind! I fear that I am
   speaking distinctly into the ears of men and women who have forsaken
   the living God and given Him no thought, whatever, much less the love
   of their hearts. They are living for self, for vanity, for pleasure,
   for iniquity in some form or other! Are there not some whose god is
   their belly and others whose god is Mammon, all of them minding earthly
   things? I only speak in a quiet style to you, but, were I to address
   you as I might, I think that I could speak as with thunder and
   lightning on such a subject as this, for the multitudes of this city
   are not the worshippers of the one living and true God, but of other
   gods--many of them diabolical gods, for they are demons, and not God!

   This man, Manasseh, had gone farther, even, than that, for he had
   desecrated the Lord's courts. He had set up Baal and Ashtaroth in the
   courts of the Temple at Jerusalem! Well now, there are some, today, who
   do this, for they make even their attendance at the House of God to be
   an occasion for evil! I have been shocked, sometimes, when I have found
   persons going out from worship across to the nearest gin palace, or
   coming up to the place of prayer, not with any idea of hearing to
   profit, but to meet some friend and that for an evil, rather than a
   commendable design! O God, how is Your House defiled, even tonight!
   Some sit here who have come with the worst of motives--they are rather
   grieving the Holy Spirit by being in the assembly of God's people than
   bringing any blessing upon themselves!

   Manasseh had gone still farther in the way of evil, for he had
   dedicated his children to the devil by passing them through the fire
   unto Moloch. After they had been set apart unto God by circumcision, he
   tried, as it were, by giving them a baptism of fire, to dedicate them
   more fully to the false god. Nobody here will dedicate his children to
   the devil, surely, yet many do. Have I not seen a father dedicate his
   boy to the devil, as he has encouraged him to drink? I heard one say,
   the other day, "Take a pull at it, boy. Open your shoulders." He wanted
   him to drink like a man! And do not many in this great city dedicate
   their children to the devil by allowing them to go into all kinds of
   licentiousness until they become the victims of vice? Do I speak to any
   here who have brought up their children after a "fashionable" style?
   Well, there is not much difference between passing your girls and boys
   through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom and bringing them
   up very "fashionably!" I have known parents grow rich and then they
   have hardly cared to take their children to the humble place of worship
   where they used to go--they must devote them to the world and bring
   them up in such a way that if they do not go to Hell, it will be ten
   thousand miracles! Mind what you do with your children. If you are
   determined to perish, yourselves, yet add not to your other
   transgressions the great sin of passing your children through the fire
   in the valley of the son of Hinnom!

   Still, even this abomination did not satisfy Manasseh. He was a very
   glutton for iniquity, so he fraternized with the devil by seeking after
   all kinds of supernatural witcheries and wizardries. It seemed as if he
   could not get far enough away from God! Everything that was forbidden
   appeared just suited to his depraved taste and if he must not do it,
   why, then he resolved that he would do it! I am drawing my bow at a
   venture now, but the arrow will go between the joints of somebody's
   harness. I may be speaking to some who have made a covenant with death
   and an agreement with Hell. "Thus says the Lord, your covenant with
   death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with death shall not
   stand." Give yourself up to all manner of iniquities as you may, yet
   the Grace of God is able to deliver you from the terrible bondage!

   Not satisfied, even, with this awful form of evil, Manasseh led others
   astray. All Judah and Israel felt the force of this evil king's
   influence and the people seemed as eager for idolatry and every kind of
   vice as the king, himself, was. Alas, when the weather bell allures all
   the flock to their destruction! You, young man, know that you are
   leading others in the house away from God. And, young woman, your
   influence on your sisters is very destructive. I may be addressing some
   man who has even gloried in the shameful fact that he has led others in
   the ways of sin!

   It is an awful picture that I have to paint in giving you Manasseh's
   portrait. I hardly care to go through with it, but I must, in the hope
   that some other great sinner may say, "If such a man as that was,
   nevertheless, forgiven, why should not I be?"

   If worse could be, here was one thing worse than I have mentioned. God
   spoke to Manasseh, sent His Prophets to him, but he would not hear. He
   that is often reproved intensifies his sin. If you did not know better,
   if you had never been warned, if nothing had ever crossed your path to
   stop you from evil, why then, there might be some excuse for you!
   Behold, tonight, a hand lays hold upon your horse's bridle and throws
   the animal back upon its haunches--and a voice cries out in a tone of
   authority, "You shall go no farther! In the name of the living God, I
   bid you dismount and bow the knee and seek mercy." It may be that you
   will reject my feeble words as you have refused others, much more
   powerful, but that would be a terrible adding of sin to sin.

   And then, to crown all, Manasseh persecuted the people of God.
   "Manasseh shed very much innocent blood till he had filled Jerusalem
   from one end to another." It is said--we do not know whether it was so,
   or not--but it is highly probable that he caused Isaiah to be cut in
   sunder with a wooden saw. An awful agony of death, indeed, for so grand
   a Prophet. Now, you never killed anybody. You were not willing--you
   could not do such a thing, I know, but yet how many there are who have
   added to all their other sins--that of ridiculing God's people? O
   husband, if you have persecuted your wife, do not so again, I beseech
   you! There is sin enough for you to answer for without adding that
   awful iniquity.

   He that ridicules and persecutes the people of God, does, as it were,
   put his finger into God's eye, and it will not be long before Jehovah,
   Himself, will deal with him. The God of patience may bear long with
   him, but, in the end, the persecutor shall not go unpunished!

   Now, heaping up all that I have said, mountain on mountain, foul sin
   upon foul sin, I may say of Manasseh that he is a compound of every
   sort of wickedness! I scarcely know what more of evil he could have
   done, yet he was pardoned, and if you look straight up there, amidst
   the glorious band that sing before the Throne of God of Free Grace and
   dying love, you will see Manasseh in the front rank! And you will hear
   his voice among the sweetest and the loudest of them all, shouting, as
   we sang just now--

   "Oh may this strange, this matchless Grace,

   This God-like miracle of love,

   Fill the wide earth with grateful praise,

   And all the angelic choirs abo ve!

   Who is a pardoning Godlike Thee?

   Or who has Grace so rich and free?"

   When he was pardoned, this is how it came about. Being in great
   trouble, he turned to Jehovah, his God. Yes, it is by the way of
   trouble that many are rescued from sin. They are brought to have just a
   little taste of the fruit of sin and that tree bears very bitter fruit.
   And when they have a taste of it, then they turn to God. I could not
   help saying, the other day, of a young man, "Well, if he should have to
   suffer for his sin, it may be the saving of him." Sometimes the sorrow
   that follows upon transgression is the only way by which the
   transgressor can be delivered from it. So Manasseh was brought among
   the thorns and then he turned to Jehovah.

   And we are also told that he humbled himself greatly. Great sinners
   must have great humbling. If you want to be saved, you who have greatly
   transgressed, bow very low--lie in the very dust before God. Nothing
   will do for you but to prostrate yourself before the Lord in the
   confession of your sin. Do not attempt to cloak it. Make no apologies
   for it, but humble yourself greatly before God.

   Then it is added of Manasseh that he prayed. Prayer has wondrous power
   to bring peace to a troubled conscience, but, mind you, it must be
   prayer mixed with faith. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
   shall be saved," is the Gospel command to an awakened sinner! Pray with
   your whole heart until the Lord hears you and sends you a gracious
   answer of peace! God heard Manasseh, dealt graciously with him and
   brought him back to his kingdom. But, best of all, the Lord first of
   all brought him back from his sin and made a new man of him! And, by
   His Grace, Manasseh set to work to bring forth fruits meet for
   repentance, to lead back his people to the worship of God and to clear
   the House of the Lord from the idols with which he had polluted it! Oh,
   that the Lord would speak to some man, tonight, who has been a slave of
   sin and break his bonds asunder! It may be done in a moment! God's
   Grace can take a slave of Satan who wears manacles on his hands,
   fetters on his legs and chains about his heart--and the Lord shall only
   speak and that man's chains shall drop from him and, in a moment, he
   shall be free! And he shall go home to change everything and to
   astonish his old companions with the story of the marvelous miracle
   that the Grace of God has worked!

   I am not trying to preach to you with any fine words. I do not need to
   do that, but if God would apply His Truth to your hearts, it would be a
   thousand times better than the grandest of human oratory! And why
   should He not do so? Where is the man who would not ask Him to do it,
   the unsaved soul that came in here resolved on sin? O Spirit of the
   living God, lead that soul to cry to Jesus, now, and to trust Him to
   give immediate deliverance! You need not wait till you get home--this
   transformation may be worked in a moment! This marvelous change is the
   miracle of Christianity! Those who say that it does not take place, say
   so for lack of knowing better. We have seen it! Yes, we have felt it!
   Do I not remember when, from the depth of conscious sin, condemned as I
   was in my own judgment and ready to be swallowed up in the jaws of
   Hell, I leaped into eternal peace and into new life from hearing that
   word, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth"? Let
   some other poor soul look to Christ and he or she shall be saved as I
   was!

   There was more that I had meant to say about Manasseh's case, but I
   think I have said enough about his sin and his salvation, so now let us
   turn to the other side of our subject.

   II. I shall spend only a very few minutes upon my second head. LET US
   CONSIDER WHY THERE SHOULD BE

   OTHERS LIKE MANASSEH. I will give you a very few considerations. Will
   you please put them away in your hearts,

   you for whom they are intended, you who are great sinners and have not
   yet found the Savior? I should say, judging from many probabilities,
   that God will save other great sinners as He saved Manasseh.

   I should say so, first, because He speaks to such great sinners and
   commands them to repent. I will only give you the one command mentioned
   in that part of the first chapter of Isaiah which we have read and the
   other that is recorded in the 55th Chapter of the same Book. The Lord
   is speaking to men whose hands were full of blood--that is an awful
   condition for anyone to be in--yet He says, "Wash you, make you clean."
   "Come now, and let us reason together: though your sins are as scarlet,
   they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they
   shall be as wool." Well now, if the Lord bids men repent and turn to
   Him, He must mean that He will save them! It would be a cruel
   tantalizing of the human heart to say, "Repent," and yet not to save
   those who do so! God's calls to repentance are promises of forgiveness.
   Where He says, in the 55th of Isaiah, "Let the wicked forsake his ways
   and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the
   Lord," you do not wonder that it is added, "and He will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon." The very duty of
   repentance gives a hope of pardon. Is it not so? Do you not catch this
   idea? Do you not know that God has commanded even you to repent, great
   sinner as you are? If so, there is implied in the command a promise to
   receive you!

   But, then, notice, next, the great promises God has given to great
   sinners. The Bible is full of them and the promises are not put in for
   sinners of a certain degree, only, but all the guilty are bid to come,
   believe and live. "God so loved the world, that He gave His only
   begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." "Whoever will, let him take the water of life
   freely." The gate of mercy is set wide open and over the portal is
   inscribed the invitation, "Come and welcome; come and welcome." Have
   you never heard the story of a man who, in his dream, thought that he
   stood outside the gates of Glory? He saw a company come up to Heaven's
   gate, singing as they went along, and when they had entered, there were
   great shouts and much sounding of trumpets. And he asked, "Who are
   these?" And it was told him, "This is the noble host of Prophets who
   have spoken in the name of the Lord, and they have come up here." His
   eyes filled with tears as he said, "I cannot go in with them."

   Then there came another company, a slender band, who sang to the praise
   of Almighty Grace and entered Heaven amidst triumphant shouts, and he
   asked, "Who are they?" And the answer was, "That is the goodly
   fellowship of the Apostles." "Alas," he said, "I cannot enter with
   them." And the tears stood in his eyes, again. He was cheered as he
   heard the joyous tramp of others who came along--these wore the red
   uniform and they sang psalms of victory and, when they entered through
   the gate of pearl, there were exultant cries amidst the glorified, and
   the man said, "I pray you, tell me, who are these?" And they answered,
   "These are the noble army of martyrs." Then the tears flowed still more
   freely, for he said, "I cannot enter with them."

   He was in despair till he saw a great white-robed company coming up the
   hill, but, as he looked at them, he recognized Saul of Tarsus among
   them, and the woman who was a sinner, and the Philippian jailor, and
   Manasseh, and they came along chanting right lustily the praises of
   Free Grace and dying love. He heard that this was the company of
   sinners saved by Sovereign Grace and he said to himself, "I think I can
   enter with them," so he joined the train and stole in within the gate.
   But he said within himself, "There will be no songs of welcome, no
   shouts of exultation for us." What was his astonishment, however, to
   find all Heaven ringing with a louder shout than ever because great
   sinners had come home to Heaven, saved by the blood of the Lamb! This
   is not a dream, it is a fact, so I expect, since there are so many
   precious promises in God's Word that a good many great sinners will be
   saved!

   I expect it, again, from the Nature of God. God is merciful and He is
   Infinite in every attribute, so that He is prepared to be greatly
   gracious. Oh, yes, if there are any little sinners about, and they
   trust in Jesus, He will forgive them, but, oh, how He delights when
   there comes along a great sinner and He blots out all the sins of the
   Jerusalem sinner and makes him perfectly clean! You may be willing to
   sign a receipt for sixpence or a shilling, but really, it seems more
   worthwhile, when you do get a pen in hand, to write a receipt for a
   thousand pounds! So, God delights to give a receipt where there has
   been great sin and to pardon great iniquity! I should say, judging from
   the greatness of God's mercy, that there would be a great many sinners
   saved!

   And I should say it yet more positively from what I know of the value
   of the blood of Jesus. I see on yonder--

   "Green hill, far away, Outside the city wall,"

   there stands a tree and on it hangs the Glory of the universe put to
   shame by men, the everlasting Son of God bleeding and dying, "the Just
   for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." I cannot set a limit to
   Christ's love! I should not like to attempt the task--can you? He dies.
   His crimson tears put out the sun, the touch of His Cross tears the
   rocks asunder. O great sinners, from the Glory of our crucified Savior,
   I expect to see many of you saved!

   1 will say no more upon this point, but beg you to go and try it. Men
   and women, if you have not yet obtained mercy, go home and fall on your
   knees before God--and do not get up until you have received it! Even
   now, plead the promise, "O Lord, You have said that You will forgive
   all who believe in Christ. I know that You cannot lie. I trust Your
   dear Son, therefore, O Lord, save me!" Cast yourselves at the feet of
   the crucified Christ and, trusting in Him, pray earnestly until the
   answer of peace comes to your heart!

   Just notice this, that from now on impenitence is inexcusable! I can
   imagine a great sinner saying, "It is no use for me to repent, for I
   can never be forgiven." But now that we proclaim to you free pardon
   through the finished Sacrifice of Christ, impenitence becomes a
   sevenfold crime! Turn you, turn you, turn you, turn you! Quit your
   sins! Fly to Christ and begin a new life, for there is forgiveness for
   the very chief of sinners! There is forgiveness for theft, for lying,
   for fornication, for adultery, for murder--there is forgiveness for the
   most crimson and scarlet sins--for all who leave them and fly to Jesus!
   Trust Him, for His Grace will enable you to start anew!

   As for despair, it is damnable. While the story of Manasseh stands on
   record, no mortal has a just excuse to perish in despair! No one is
   justified in saying, "God will never forgive me." Read over again the
   history of Manasseh. See to what lengths of sin he went, to what
   extravagant heights of evil he climbed, and then say to yourself, "Did
   Sovereign Mercy reach him? Then it can also reach me! I will draw near
   to the great King at once and sue for pardon at His Mercy Seat."

   As I shall meet you again in that Great Day when Heaven and earth shall
   rock and reel beneath the footsteps of the coming Judge, I beseech you,
   let us meet on good terms on that day! Let me not be there to be a
   swift witness against anyone for his condemnation, but rather let me
   say, "We spoke together on that midsummer evening in 1888 and we
   remember it, for that night we gave our hearts to Christ, and now we
   meet in Heaven!"

   Now, dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I have not been talking to
   you, you see, but you are not like the prodigal's elder brother--you
   will not fit here and growl because there is nothing for you. I know
   what many of you have been doing--you have been praying, "Lord, bring
   Brother Prodigal home!" Perhaps, after all, some of you have been
   grumbling because you have not had even a kid to feed upon, tonight,
   that you might make merry with your friends. But if a sinner has come
   to Jesus, if Brother Prodigal comes home, why, then the calf will get
   killed and you will have your share of it, and we shall have music and
   dancing, tonight, over sinners saved! The great Father's joy shall flow
   over into our hearts and we will rejoice with Him! May He send a
   blessing! I beseech you, pray for it, for Jesus' sake!

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK"--201, 202, 568.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 Chronicles33:1-20; Isaiah 1:2-19.

   2 Chronicles 33:1. Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to
   reign. He was, therefore, born after the time when Hezekiah was raised
   up from the bed of sickness. That prolongation of life was not all
   mercy--I am not sure that we should be so eager for such an extension
   of earthly existence either for ourselves or for others. Had Hezekiah
   been able to foresee what would be the abominations of the first part
   of Manasseh's reign, should he come to the throne of Judah, I think
   that the godly king might have been content to die at once rather than
   live any longer to become the father of such a sinner--and one who
   would prove to be such an enemy of the true faith. "Manasseh was twelve
   years old when he began to reign." It was too early for a youth to
   reign over any nation. It is a great temptation and a serious peril,
   when an individual has too much power before he reaches his manhood. It
   would have been far better for Manasseh if his accession to the throne
   had been postponed for a good while. You who are very young and are
   entrusted with wealth and position, may God keep you from going wrong!
   It will need great Grace to preserve you in the right path.

   1. And he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. Manasseh's was a
   long reign, a varied reign and, at first, a wicked reign of the very
   worst kind. Sometimes men are spared, notwithstanding their sin.
   Manasseh's was one of the longest reigns on record--"He reigned fifty
   and five years in Jerusalem."

   2. But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the
   abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the
   children of Israel. The Lord drove out the Canaanites for the very sins
   that Manasseh committed! If we follow in the sins of others, we must
   not wonder if we share in their doom. It is a sad thing, however, when
   the child of such a father as Hezekiah does evil in the sight of the
   Lord, "like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom Jehovah had cast
   out before the children of Israel."

   3. For he built, again, the high places which Hezekiah, his father, had
   broken down. These high places were, at first, built for the worship of
   God, the true God--but, then, the Law of Jehovah was that there should
   be only one altar, namely, that at Jerusalem. This was not Popery, but
   Ritualism--it was adding something to the simple worship of God and,
   therefore, it was wrong. He who goes a little way in sin will soon go a
   long way. It is always a mercy to stop where you ought to stop and not
   begin going down. Hezekiah had broken down the high places and his son,
   Manasseh, rebuilt them.

   3. And he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped
   all the host of heaven, and served them. He not only worshipped them,
   but he served them. He threw his whole strength into the propagation of
   this form of idolatry. They who build altars to God, contrary to the
   Lord's Law, will soon have false gods! First, men set up images to
   remind them of the true God, and then they go off to the worship of the
   idols, or false gods. Oh, that we may have Grace to make no similitude
   of the Lord and to set up nothing contrary to the simple teaching of
   the Word of God!

   4-5. Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD
   had said, In Jerusalem shall My name be forever. And he built altars
   for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the House of the LORD.
   There was plenty of room elsewhere for them if Manasseh needed them,
   but nothing would do for him but that in the House of God, itself, must
   be built altars for the worship of the sun and all the host of stars!

   6. And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of
   the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and
   used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards.
   All which is imitated, nowadays, by certain persons who try to break
   through the veil which parts us from the spiritual world. Manasseh did
   this on a large scale.

   6-11. He worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to
   anger. And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
   House of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon, his son,
   In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the
   tribes of Israel, will I put My name forever: neither will I any more
   remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed
   for your fathers, so that they will take heed to do all that I have
   commanded them, according to the whole Law and the statutes and the
   ordinances by the hand of Moses. So Manasseh made Judah and the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom
   the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. And the LORD
   spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not listen.
   Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the
   king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him
   with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. If you will not learn
   anywhere else, you will have to be taught among thorns, in chains and
   in exile. There are some men who will never go to Heaven except through
   a sea of affliction and trial. Oh, for wisdom to yield to Almighty
   Grace at once!

   12, 13. And when he was in affliction, he asked the LORD his God, and
   humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto
   Him: and He was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and
   brought him, again, to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew
   that the LORD, He was God. He had set up Baal and Ashtaroth, but now he
   knows who is the true God, and he bows before Jehovah.

   14-17. Now after this, he built a wall outside the city of David, on
   the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the
   fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great
   height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. And
   he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the House of the
   LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the House of
   the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. And he
   repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings
   and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of
   Israel. Nevertheless the people did sacrifice, still, in the high
   places, They do the same, today, and we cannot get them

   away from them. Even some who love the Gospel yet cling to the old
   Romish rites and ceremonies. Ah, men do love to multiply outward
   performances instead of spiritual worship! The one altar of Calvary is
   not enough for them--they must have many altars--"Nevertheless the
   people did sacrifice, still, in the high places."

   17. Yet unto the LORD their God only. So far, it was well, but it would
   have been better if they had given up all those altars.

   18-20. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
   God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the
   LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings
   of Israel. His prayer, also, and how God was entreated of him, and all
   his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
   places, and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled:
   behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers. So Manasseh
   slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon,
   his son, reigned in his place. The short passage, which I am going to
   read from the first chapter of Isaiah, seems to get a fine illustration
   in this story of Manasseh.

   Isaiah 1:2, 3. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord has
   spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
   rebelled against Me. The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's
   crib: but Israel does not know, My people do not consider. Heaven and
   earth might well be called to witness such strange ingratitude as this
   of which the Lord had to complain of!

   4. Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers,
   children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have
   provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away
   backward. What a terrible indictment and every word of it was true!

   5-9. Why should you be stricken any more? You will revolt more and
   more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole
   of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds,
   and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither
   bound up, neither mollified with ointment. Your country is desolate,
   your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in
   your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. And the
   daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a
   garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. Except the LORD of Hosts had
   left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we
   should have been like unto Gomorrah. As the Prophet's vision proceeds,
   the true state of the people is seen.

   10-15. Hear the Word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
   the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah. To what purpose is the
   multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? says the LORD: I am full of the
   burnt offerings of rams, and the fat offed beasts; and I delight not in
   the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. When you come to
   appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to tread My
   courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
   Me; the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot!
   Away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and
   your appointed feasts My soul hates: they are a trouble unto Me; I am
   weary to bear them. And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide
   My eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear:
   your hands are full of blood. They were horribly wicked people, they
   could hardly have been worse. They were so bad that even their prayers
   were not fit for God to hear. Yet He says--

   16-19. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
   before My eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment,
   relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come
   now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are as
   scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool. If you are willing and obedient, you
   shall eat the good of the land. What blessed words of mercy! Oh, that
   everyone of us may prove them true in our own case, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

A Discourse to the Despairing

   (No. 2379)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   15, 1888.

   "Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his
   sons, Why do you look, one upon another? And he said, Behold, I have
   heard that there is corn in Egypt: get down there, and buy for us
   there; that we may live, and not die." Genesis 42:1,2.

   JACOB had reached an age in which natural vigor had gone out of him. He
   was getting very old and was worn and weary, yet here he seems to lead
   the way in providing for his family. It was he who spoke to the younger
   men, his sons, and urged them to go down into Egypt to buy food. Jacob
   was of a timorous disposition in his latter days--he had an old man's
   fear of that which is high and the grasshopper had become a burden to
   him--yet he proposed to his sons that they should make a venturesome
   journey into Egypt! It was a great undertaking for them, for they were
   stay-at-homes, and not travelers. They were shepherds, whose time was
   occupied in looking after the welfare of their flocks, and not in
   roaming over foreign countries. They thought it would be a burdensome
   responsibility and a perilous risk to cross the desert and go down into
   Egypt, yet Jacob proposed this to them as the only way of escape from
   famine and death. Here is an instance in which an aged father woke up
   his sons to action by telling them good news and by chiding them
   because of their despairing looks and words.

   I am going to use the passage in this way. There are many persons who
   are sitting down in a kind of stupor. They have no hope and, therefore,
   they are doing nothing at all. They need to be told the good and
   blessed tidings concerning salvation and to be urged to make a right
   use of that news and to avail themselves of the provision of which they
   are informed. I shall give myself, under the Holy Spirit's guidance, to
   the happy task of following out that line of thought under these three
   heads. First, despair is useless. "Why do you look, one upon another?"
   Secondly, hope is well-grounded. "I have heard that there is corn in
   Egypt." Thirdly, action is reasonable. "Get you down there, and buy for
   us there; that we may live, and not die."

   I. First, DESPAIR IS USELESS.

   I have never heard, yet, of anybody who derived any good from despair.
   Let me correct myself, there is a kind of despair which is the work of
   the Spirit of God. I wish that you all felt it--a despair of
   self-salvation, a despair of washing away your own sin, despair of
   obtaining any merit of your own by which you can become acceptable in
   the sight of God--but men never come to it unless the Spirit of God
   brings them. We are always ready to hope in ourselves with that
   self-conceited hope which is abhorrent to God. And it is a great mercy
   when, at last, the Spirit of God, like the hot blast of the Sirocco,
   passes over the green field and every flower therein is withered! What
   said the Prophet? "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness, thereof,
   is as the flower of the field: the grass withers, the flower fades:
   because the Spirit of the Lord blows upon it: surely the people is
   grass." That is a blessed kind of despair! But of any other sort of
   despair, in reference to eternal things, I cannot say anything that is
   good. I believe that Giant Despair has his dungeons full of the
   skeletons of men--he is a giant and devours those who come in his
   way--and he never helped a pilgrim on the road to the Celestial City.
   He never worked any good to any soul that came under his power. I
   cannot set you free from his grasp, but I can and do pray that the
   Spirit of God may deliver you out of his clutches!

   These sons of Jacob looked upon one another despairingly, it seems, and
   their old father watched their looks till, at last, he asked them, "Why
   do you look, one upon another?" Their looks expressed great sadness.
   They had never before been in such a plight. No corn for the asses, no
   bread for the children, no food for themselves. Not one of them smiled,

   but grim sadness sat on every countenance, and all their faces gathered
   blackness. One looked at his brother and saw that he was sad. And that
   brother looked at the next one and perceived that he was mournful and
   gloomy. The light of a man's countenance is often like the shining of
   the sun--one bright face will make another full of joy and
   gladness--but when all the sons of Jacob were sad, their sadness was
   increased as they looked, one upon another. Now, when a man knows that
   he has no hope. When he feels that he cannot save himself. When he
   hungers for the Bread of Life and yet has none of it--when he looks to
   others who are in same case, and they only reply, "It is even so. We
   are also starving. We are lost"--well, then, it is a sad, sad business
   altogether.

   Next, their faces expressed inability. Judah looked on Reuben and
   Reuben stared back at his brother, as much as to say, "Do not gaze at
   me, Judah, for I cannot do anything! I have emptied my last sack of
   corn." Then Reuben looked across to Simeon and Simeon turned to
   Zebulon--and they all shook their heads and each one said--"It is no
   use looking to me. I cannot relieve you in this time of famine, even in
   the slightest degree. I have more than I can do to take care of my own
   wife and children." So is it when one sinner looks upon another sinner.
   If really awakened to a true sense of his condition in the sight of
   God, each one says, "I cannot help you. I cannot even help myself."
   There are a number of foolish virgins with their lamps all gone out,
   and they have not a drop of oil between them and, therefore, not one of
   them can help another. So, sadness and inability are both implied in
   old Jacob's question to his sons, "Why do you look, one upon another?"

   Besides that, I have no doubt that there was a great degree of
   bewilderment expressed on their countenances. One asked his brother,
   "Cannot you suggest anything?" "No," replied the other, "I am at my
   wits' end. I never was so puzzled before." "But, surely, So-and-So, the
   one member of the family who has always been so quick with his
   suggestions, will have something to say in this crisis." No, not one of
   them had anything that he could contribute towards the hopefulness of
   the outlook. Sad, indeed, was the household in which all the brothers
   seemed, each one, more bewildered than the rest! So, if I were to
   gather, here, a company of men, awakened to a sense of their true
   condition as sinners, but not yet led to faith in Christ, and if I were
   to ask them, "What is to be done to deliver you from this sad state?"
   they would, in utter bewilderment, look first at me, and then at one
   another, and sadly say, "What can we do?" One of them might even cry,
   with John Newton--

   "The help of men and angels joined Could never reach my case" and in
   his perplexity he might forget to quote the two lines that follow--

   "Nor can I hope relief to find But in Your boundless Grace."

   Such a man might say, "If all in this world who love me were to
   conspire together to assist me out of the deep pit of sin into which I
   have fallen, they could not lift me a single inch!" Bewilderment, then,
   was upon the faces of the 12 sons of Jacob.

   Their looks also expressed apprehension. As they looked on each other,
   their faces wan, their persons gaunt, each one seemed to say to his
   brother, "I dare not tell you what I think." And the other would reply,
   "I knew what you meant before the dreadful words came from your lips,
   for what can this long famine bring but absolute starvation? We shall
   see our poor old father die, or, perhaps, we shall, ourselves, perish,
   and all our children with us before the old man passes away. Anyway, we
   are doomed. We cannot eat the grass. We cannot devour what the birds of
   Heaven might live upon-- there is nothing for us to do but to die.
   There is no corn in the land. There is universal famine--grim death
   will soon overtake us." So they looked at one another every day with
   more and more of anxious foreboding, for the famine was in the land of
   Canaan as well as in all the other parts of the earth.

   But, dear Friends, what good did their sad looks and their perplexed
   looks do? They did not make one mess of pottage for any of them! They
   did not grind for them even a single grain of corn! They were as bad
   off after all their despair as they were before it--their waiting was
   absolutely useless--no improvement in their condition came of it! And
   addressing you, my despairing friend, to whom I am sent tonight, I do
   not think that I ever saw you before, but you are here, and I am sent
   to speak thus to you! You have believed that there was no hope for you.
   You did not think that you could be saved and you have been, now, for
   years in that sad condition! What is the use of it to you? What is the
   good of all your despair? It has not improved you in the least! It has
   not even kept you back from sin. It has just made you sit in darkness,
   like one who is chilled and benumbed, and over whom death is slowly
   creeping. This despair is no benefit to

   you. God help you to shake yourself clear of it even now! There is a
   lie at the bottom of your despair--there is hope-- there is hope for
   the very chief of sinners! Do not believe what Satan tells you, that
   you must sit still and die.

   The waiting time of the sons of Jacob was wasting time. If they had
   started earlier, they might have reached Egypt and, perhaps, have been
   back, again, with the corn which they had bought. But now the weary
   hours which brought them no hope were depriving them of the possibility
   of deliverance. So, dear Hearers, you have waited because you did not
   think that there was a possibility of your being saved--and all this
   waiting time has been wasted! Would God that you had been converted
   when you were a boy! Would God that you had known my Lord when you were
   a young man and started out in business! Oh, that you had known Him
   even in middle life! But now you are growing gray. Surely, the time
   past suffices to have been wasted. May God help you to begin, tonight,
   to obtain that heavenly bread, that true corn upon which your soul may
   feed!

   These sons of Jacob had waited so long that if they delayed much
   longer, they could never go, for they would all be dead. Did not their
   old father hint at that when he said to them, "Get you down there, and
   buy for us there; that we may live, and not die"? Death seemed waiting
   for them outside the door and if bread did not soon come in, they would
   all have to be carried out as corpses. So, Sinner, you have waited long
   enough, and far too long! You have tarried so long that if you wait
   much longer, the great knell of your soul will toll out with that most
   dismal sound, "Lost, lost, lost, and lost forever!" God grant that this
   may not come to pass, but may the Word of the Lord, which I am
   declaring in my Master's name, lead you to another course of action
   than that of sitting still and looking, one upon another! I repeat what
   I said before, despair is useless! I think that you who have tried it
   are quite convinced that it is so--you cannot squeeze any juice out of
   this flint! You can dig nothing that will help you out of this barren
   soil!

   II. But now, secondly, HOPE, as we preach it to the very chief of
   sinners, IS WELL-GROUNDED.

   In the story before us, old Jacob said to his sons, "Behold, I have
   heard that there is corn in Egypt." Good news had been heard. Did you
   notice that the first verse put it rather differently--"Now when Jacob
   saw that there was corn in Egypt"? There is a good old proverb, quaint
   but true, "Faith sees with its ears." It is a new use for ears,
   according to some people's notions. My own opinion is that there is no
   organ that we have with which we can see so well as we can with our
   ears if we use them aright. In spiritual things, "faith comes by
   hearing," and that faith becomes the sight of things hoped for! Good
   old Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt and he heard that there was
   corn in Egypt. That is to say, he heard it upon such good evidence that
   the old gentleman seemed to see it! He had questioned some passing
   travelers, some Ishmaelites, some wandering Bedouins, who had answered
   him, "Oh, yes, there is corn in Egypt! We have been down there--we have
   bought sacks full of it! We have brought it away with us. We know it is
   so, for here it is." And Jacob, though yet very timorous, weighed the
   evidence, and judged all about the matter, and he said to himself, "Oh,
   yes! It is quite clear, I see that there is corn in Egypt."

   Well now, dear Friends, the most of you now present and, I should
   think, all of you who have come through the rain this wet night, have
   heard this good news! "Heard it?" you say, "we have heard it times out
   of mind." I wonder how many times you have heard it? It would be
   worthwhile to sit down and figure away, to see if you could calculate
   how many times you have heard the Gospel. You know, when a boy has a
   father who is what a father ought to be, he says to him, "Do not let me
   have to speak to you twice, Sir." If he does speak to him twice, he
   says, "Do you think I am going to speak to you three times? Listen, I
   shall not stop at speaking if you do not listen pretty soon!" Would you
   kindly set down on a sheet of paper, not perhaps on a slate, for you
   might wipe it off, there--write down how many times God has spoken to
   you, distinctly, in the preaching of the Word? I will not ask you to
   reckon up how many times He has spoken to you in private, on your bed
   and so on. Some of you have heard thousands of sermons, but they have
   done you no good. I am afraid that you are like Bunyan's Slough of
   Despond. Many thousands of tons of the best road making material had
   been poured into that slough and it took it all in--and it was as bad a
   slough as ever! And is it not so with some of you?

   I get astonished at some of you people who come and hear me whenever
   you can. I am not going to look at the particular persons to whom I
   refer, but it does astonish me when I know that there are those who
   have come here for years, and yet are as bare of religion as the palm
   of my hand is of hair! If you ask the wife or children about them, you
   will find that though they say, "we enjoy Mr. Spurgeon's ministry," yet
   they enjoy the drink rather more on certain other days! They would not
   miss a sermon! Yes, and they will even come to Prayer Meetings and
   enjoy Prayer Meetings. But still, ah me! Well, I will not say all that
   I know. May God have mercy upon such people! But what am I to do? Am I
   to keep on

   preaching to people like that? Am I to go on perpetually washing
   Blackamoors who will never be a bit the whiter? God have mercy upon you
   and upon me, too, and grant that I may not labor in vain towards you,
   lest in the end your guilt should be increased by the rejection of His
   Truth!

   The good news has been heard by all of you. Whatever may be the destiny
   of the heathen, they can, at the last, say, "We never heard of Christ.
   We were never bid to come and put our trust in Him. We never knew the
   story of the Cross and all the love of God in Christ Jesus." You cannot
   say that, but you will have to confess, some of you, in that Great Day,
   that you closed your ears to it all and would have none of it. The Lord
   prevent it, by His mercy!

   Well, the good news has been heard, dear Friends, and, by many of us,
   the good news has been believed. I believe with Jacob that there is
   corn in Egypt, that is to say, I believe that there is salvation in
   Christ Jesus, that it has, "pleased the Father that in Him should all
   fullness dwell." There are many here who believe that Truth of God with
   me. There are myriads, all over the world, who believe this and who
   have seen it for themselves--there is pardon for sin! There is renewal
   of nature! There is every blessing that is needed, stored up in Jesus
   Christ! The good news has been heard and the good news has been
   believed! If I were to ask you to stand up and give your testimony
   after the manner of the Salvation Army, very many here would do so,
   each one saying, "I believe it. It is even so. I have proved it to be
   true."

   Further, the good news conveyed to you is to the point. Suppose that
   Jacob had said to his sons, "I believe that there is gold in Egypt,"
   they might have asked him, "What has that to do with us?" Suppose he
   had said, "I believe that there is fine linen in Egypt." They did not
   need fine linen. Suppose he had said, "I believe that there are
   chariots in Egypt, and horses," for there were such in abundance.
   Solomon was known, in later days, to bring them out of Egypt. Yet
   Jacob's sons would have said, "Dear Father, we do not need horses. We
   do not want chariots. What we need is bread, for we are dying, or soon
   shall die, of hunger." Well now, my dear Hearers, there is, in Christ
   Jesus, exactly what you need! If you are guilty, there is pardon! If
   you are weak, there is strength! If you are foul, there is cleansing!
   If you are naked, there is clothing! If you are dead, there is life! In
   fact, there is, in Christ, all that you can possibly need! Christ is as
   much fitted for you as a glove is for a hand and He is exactly fitted
   for you, Mary, Thomas, or whoever you are--even as when I came to Him,
   I found Him to be exactly fitted for me! He is the very Savior for such
   a sinner as you!

   Well now, this is good news concerning an available blessing. Supposing
   Jacob had said, "Dear sons, there is plenty of corn in Egypt, but you
   cannot have any of it. If you go down there, they will not sell any
   corn to you." Now, we who believe in the Doctrine of Election are
   supposed to say to some men, "It is of no use for you to believe--you
   will not have the blessing." I never said--I never thought such a
   thing--nor did any other preacher of the Doctrine of Election! We have
   freely declared to every man that whoever believes in Christ Jesus has
   everlasting life! And though we believe that God knows who will have
   it, even as God knew who would go down into Egypt, yet that does not in
   the least affect the freeness of the preaching of the Gospel! Let those
   who hear us bear witness to the fact. There was never a man, or woman,
   or child, yet, who applied to God through Jesus Christ for mercy, who
   was refused. "Him that comes to Me," says Christ, "I will in no wise
   cast out." If you believe, you live. If you believe, you are saved. We
   have eternal life when we come and trust in Jesus. Believe and receive
   it at the hands of Christ. "He that believes on the Son has everlasting
   life." Let that bell ring round the Tabernacle! "He that believes on
   the Son has everlasting life." If you believe, eternal life is yours.
   So, this good news is concerning an available blessing.

   And, once more, this good news is in the present tense. Jacob did not
   say to his sons, "There was corn in Egypt," but, "I have heard that
   there is corn in Egypt." So say I to you--"There is salvation. There is
   forgiveness. There is acceptance, there is reconciliation--there is
   eternal life!" There is, in Christ Jesus, all that is necessary to lift
   a soul from the portals of Hell to the gates of Heaven! There is now,
   on this 15th day of the month of July, 1888--there is corn in Egypt,
   there is eternal life for all who trust in Jesus--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for you!"

   I do not know how to preach more plainly and simply to you. The last
   thing that crosses my mind is to try and make "a fine discourse." All I
   want to do is to talk right to your hearts about the way to Heaven--and
   not to let you go until you have come to Jesus and have trusted in Him.

   So I have set before you two things, first, that despair is useless,
   and, next, that there is a hope which is well grounded. There is
   nothing more certain in this world than that whoever believes in Christ
   shall be saved. I wish that you

   would all come and try, and see for yourselves, for we have not
   preached to you cunningly-devised fables, but the most sure Word of
   God, which we have tasted and handled for ourselves!

   III. So I shall close with my third division--ACTION IS REASONABLE.

   my dear despairing Hearer, I say again that I do not know who you may
   be, but I know that I am sent to you, tonight, with a message! I wish
   that I knew you, so that I could take you by the hand and have you here
   on this very platform, and look into your eyes with my eyes. But as I
   cannot do that, I will speak to you as if I were doing it.

   It was time that these men should go at once to Egypt, for they would
   die if they did not go. They could but die if they went to Egypt--if
   they were met by robbers on the road, and killed, they could but die.
   This is your case. Without Christ, you must eternally die--there is no
   hope for you. Remain as you are and you are damned. No, I soften not
   the word, for it is no light sentence which the word conveys. If you do
   not find Christ, you are lost forever! Say, then, as we have often
   sung--

   "I can but perish if I go; I am resolved to try! For if I stay away, I
   know I must forever die."

   1 will here bring up Giant Despair if I can, in the rear, that he may
   howl a little at you, and set your feet in motion. There is no hope for
   you unless you go to the Savior, even to Jesus Christ. You must die if
   you do not go to Him.

   It was very reasonable that Jacob's sons should go down to Egypt, for
   evidently others had gone there and had found corn. O man, would to God
   that you would repent and leave your sins, and come to Christ, for
   others have done so, and they have found eternal life! There never was,
   there never will be, there cannot be one who ever obeyed the Gospel
   call and yet was disappointed! I challenge the depths of Hades and the
   deep abyss of Hell, itself, to display a single soul that truly sought
   the Lord and was refused! No, if you come to Him by Jesus Christ, He
   must receive you. Therefore, you who feel your need of Christ, I
   beseech you to awaken yourselves and seek Him now!

   Further, these sons of Jacob got what they went for. They went to buy
   corn, and corn they bought, and plenty of it. And you may fare better
   than they did. It is not half such a task for you to go to Jesus as it
   was for them to go to Egypt. You can get to Christ in the twinkling of
   an eye! Behold, He comes flying to your relief. One look of faith and
   you are at His feet! Trust is the great railway that will bear you to
   the blessed terminal of salvation!

   The sons of Jacob found in Egypt what they went for and they found it
   on better terms than they supposed. Jacob said, "Buy for us there," but
   they had their money put back in the mouth of their sacks! Joseph did
   not want their money--he would not sell anything to his own brothers,
   he would give them whatever they needed! The Lord Jesus Christ does not
   need your money. He does not even need your repentance and your faith
   as the purchase-price of salvation. "The wages of sin is death, but the
   gift of God is eternal life." It is a free gift to you who are poor as
   beggary itself. Do but come and you shall find how free are the gifts
   of Sovereign Grace!

   And, in addition, Jacob's sons gained a great deal more than they
   bargained for, for while they brought corn home, they found that there
   was a great man in Egypt who was their brother--and they were invited
   to go and stay with him and they were made great men in that land! Oh,
   if you will but come to Christ, you will come for silver, but you will
   get gold! You will come for gold and He will give you diamonds! You
   will come for a rag and He will give you a royal robe! You will come to
   Him for life and He will give you everlasting glory! He gives
   infinitely more than any of us dare to ask, or even think--and happy is
   that man who does but come to Him! Oh, if you had any idea of what
   Christ will make of you, you would want wings to your heels to fly to
   Him with all your might! If that young woman did but know what joy the
   love of Christ would pour into her heart, she would not wait till
   tomorrow's sun had risen ere she had laid hold of Jesus Christ! When we
   come to Christ, there is a destiny before us which an angel's future
   does not rival! We become brothers of Christ, heirs of God, peers of
   the blood imperial, exalted to sit with Christ upon His heavenly Throne
   and to share in all His joys! Would God that you would come! If you did
   but know what is to be had by trusting in Jesus, how swiftly you would
   be drawn to Him!--

   "His worth, if all the nations knew for Sure, the whole world would
   love Him, too," and if they did but know what He gives, they would hold
   out both hands and take from Him, now, all that He delights to bestow
   upon those who trust Him!

   I have finished my discourse to the despairing when I have made just
   two or three concluding remarks.

   These sons of Jacob went down into Egypt and they did well. Right
   reasoning led them to go when they heard that there was corn there and
   knew that they needed it. But they were never invited to go there.
   Joseph did not send an invitation to Jacob, Reuben, Judah and Simeon,
   saying, "Come down into Egypt." Up to the moment when he revealed
   himself, they did not know that he was there. They were never invited
   and yet they went. Is there anybody here who says, "I do not think I am
   invited in the Bible to trust Christ"? Then come to Him whether you are
   invited or not! Do as these men did--they were not invited, but they
   went! The feasts of God are of this kind, "Whoever will, let him come."
   There are no tickets demanded at God's gate of mercy. If you come, you
   would not have come if He had not drawn you, for no man can come to
   Christ unless the Father, who sent His Son, draws him, and, "Him that
   comes to Me," says Christ, "I will in no wise cast out." You are the
   right man if you but come, for the wrong man never came, never can come
   and never thinks of coming! You are the man to be saved if you but
   trust Christ!

   But I must remind you that there are many of you who have been invited,
   pressed, urged, entreated with tears to come to Christ. I will not say
   anything about the many times that I have tried to press those things
   upon you, for I feel my feebleness, and, if you refuse me, I do not
   wonder. But still, if I knew how to put eternal things before you
   better than I do, how earnestly would I labor for the salvation of your
   souls! Sometimes, when I am at home, I say to myself, "That is it. I
   think I see, now, how to put the Truth of God to the people." But when
   I get here, I do not feel that I can speak as I desire. What more is a
   man to say than to tell you that you are in danger, that you will
   perish if you despair of hope, that there is good ground for hope and,
   that if you come to your God, trusting in Jesus as your Savior, He will
   never cast you away? Therefore, come, and come at once! Come even now,
   while sitting in those pews! What more can I say? Spirit of God, You
   say whatever more is needed and make what is said to go home to the
   hearts of the hearers!

   Now, note again, that you are in a better state than the sons of Jacob,
   for you are invited, and next, you have no journey to make. How far is
   it to Christ? Well, there is no distance! If you believe, He is there.
   Our railway people, as a rule, in making railways to a certain town, do
   not make the railway to the town, but within a half-mile, or a mile, or
   two miles, so that you must have an omnibus or a cab to get into the
   town. And there is far too much Gospel preaching that is like that. It
   is so far before you get to Christ and when you do get to Him, it needs
   another journey in your own omnibus to finish up the work!

   But I believe that the railway to Heaven for you starts just there, in
   that pew where you are sitting, and that it goes all the way, and that
   if you enter the glorious Free-Grace train, it will carry you to the
   terminal! And if you take a ticket, tonight, with a simple trust in the
   Lord Jesus, you will not need any new ticket, but it will take you all
   the way through! Oh, I would to God that by faith you would take that
   ticket right now! There is a journey to get to Heaven, but there is no
   journey to get to Christ, for He is here! You need a Mediator between
   your souls and God, but you do not need a Mediator between your souls
   and Christ! You must be prepared to see God in Heaven, but you need not
   be prepared to see Christ on earth! You may come to Him just as you
   are! Here He is, look at Him by faith and the great transaction is
   done!

   Last of all, you are informed, as these sons of Jacob were not
   informed, that no payment is required. Jacob said to his sons, "Take
   money in your hand," and when they went the next time, he said, "Take
   double money in your hand." That was very honest on his part, to send
   money to make up for what had been put back in the sacks, as well as
   the double price, for the wheat would have risen since the last time,
   and old Jacob also said, "Take of the best fruits of the land in your
   vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
   honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds." That is just what human
   nature says, "Take Christ a present. Carry something with you." Now, I
   would advise you to drop that present into the sea! Do not take
   anything with you to Christ except your emptiness. That is all He
   wants-- take your emptiness, and He will fill it! Take your sin, and He
   will wash it away!

   When persons advertise that they clean garments--(you see their notices
   everywhere, nowadays, a wonderful trade it must be)--do they expect
   that when you send a coat to be cleaned, you are to put a guinea in the
   pocket? Oh, dear no! You send the garment to be cleaned--you will have
   to pay for the work, one of these days, but you need not put sovereigns
   in the pocket! Just take your soul to Christ to be cleansed, with
   nothing but the spot, and the stain, and the filth-- and He will make
   it whiter than the driven snow!

   The Holy Spirit's message is, "Today, if you will hear His voice,
   harden not your hearts." Tarry not to cleanse or mend, but come to
   Christ just as you are and come at once! Sons of Jacob, starving for
   need of heavenly food, look no

   longer, one upon another, but up and away to the Christ who has a
   superabundance of everything you need! Freely He invites you--gladly go
   to Him! Spirit of God, compel them to do so, by Your sweet love, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   HYMNS FROM "OUR OWN HYMN BOOK"-- 531, 375, 435.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Isaiah 48.

   Verse 1. Hear you this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
   of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear
   by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not
   in truth, nor in righteousness. There were always false professors and,
   I suppose, there always will be till Christ comes. A Judas was among
   the 12 Apostles and we cannot wonder that we find such in every
   Church--but what a dreadful thing it is to wear the name of God and yet
   not really to serve Him--to be called Christians and yet not to be like
   Christ! It must be a very God-provoking thing to be called by His name
   and then insult it by not being true to it.

   2. For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon
   the God of Israel; The LORD of Hosts is His name. They profess to trust
   Him, but they do not love Him--"they call themselves of the holy city,"
   but they certainly are not holy citizens. Ah me, that God should have
   to speak to men upon such a matter as this! It is self-evidently
   wicked, but they will not see it.

   3. I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went
   forth out of My mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they
   came to pass. There is no better proof that God is God than that His
   prophecies have been fulfilled. Only the eternal can see into the
   future. He has done so and every Word of His has either been fulfilled,
   or will yet be fulfilled.

   4. 5. Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron
   sinew, and your brow brass; I have even from the beginning declared it
   to you: before it came to pass I showed it you: lest you should say, My
   idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image has
   commanded them. See the care of God towards the most obstinate of men!
   He knows that they will pervert things, so He prevents them as far as
   it is possible to do so! He tells them what is to happen, that they may
   not, afterwards, say that their idol gods have done it. Ah, dear
   Friends, God has taken great interest in many of us! He has, as it
   were, laid His plans to keep us out of sin and yet we have often broken
   out, and have gone over hedge and ditch in the ways of sin. We have
   seemed resolved to do evil--we have been desperately set on mischief--
   therefore He speaks of us as being "obstinate." "Your neck is an iron
   sinew, and your brow brass." Will God ever speak in mercy to such
   people as these? We shall see as we read on.

   6-8. You have heard, see all this; and will not you declare it? I have
   showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did
   not know them. They are created now, and not from the beginning, even
   before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I
   knew them. Yes, you heard not; yes, you knew not; yes, from that time
   that your ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very
   treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb. What a
   description! Treacherous, false, yes, very treacherous--beyond the
   usual degree of treachery! Transgressors from our very birth--born in
   sin. The very heart is wrong and all that comes out of us is,
   therefore, wrong. And now, what follows?

   9. For My name's sake will I defer My anger, and for My praise will I
   refrain for you, that I cut you not off. "I cannot spare you for your
   own sake; but I will spare you for My name's sake. I cannot spare you
   because of anything good in you; but I will spare you because of good
   in Myself." If God can glorify Himself by your salvation, He finds a
   blessed motive for saving you, and, since there is no good in you, He
   will fall back upon His own Glory and save you for His own name's sake!

   10. Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you
   in the furnace of affliction. You sinful one, yet one of His own
   children, He will refine you again and again, and He will glorify
   Himself by saving you.

   11. For My own sake, even for My own sake, will I do it: for how should
   My name be polluted? And I will not give My Glory unto another. This
   verse ought to ring like music in the ears of one who is seeking mercy
   and who cannot find out how mercy can come to him.

   12, 13. Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, My called; I am He; I am
   the First, I also am the Last. My hand also has laid the foundation of
   the earth, and My right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call unto
   them, they stand up together. What a great God is He whose right hand
   spanned the heavens, making the arch of the sky, as it were, with the
   span of His hand!

   14. All you, assemble yourselves, and hear, which among them has
   declared these things? He still dwells upon prophecy. God claims that
   He is God because He foretold all that happened, which the idol gods
   could not do.

   14-18. The LORD has loved him: He will do His pleasure on Babylon, and
   His arm shall be on the Chaldeans. I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have
   called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
   Come you near unto Me, hear you this, I have not spoken in secret from
   the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord
   God, and His Spirit, has sent me. Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,
   the Holy One of Israel. I am the Lord your God which teaches you to
   profit, which leads you by the way that you should go. O that you had
   listened to My Commandments! God again breaks out in lamentations over
   His wandering people! Not only is He ready to forgive them, but He
   grieves to think that they should have brought so much sorrow on
   themselves.

   18, 19. Then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as
   the waves of the sea: your seed also had been as the sand, and the
   offspring of your heart like the gravel thereof; his name should not
   have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me. All manner of possible
   good would have been yours had you not rebelled against God. And as you
   have lost it, God grieves that it should be so.

   20. Go you forth of Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans, with a voice
   of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the
   earth, say you, The LORD has redeemed His servant, Jacob. What a grand
   message for anyone to tell! Tell it, tell it, tell it everywhere, that
   Jehovah has redeemed His people!

   21. And they thirsted not when He led them through the deserts. Neither
   shall you thirst, O redeemed one, when you are in the desert!

   21. He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. Most
   unlikely places shall yield you succor.

   21. He split the rock, also, and the waters gushed out. And yet, to
   finish up the chapter, stands this remarkable sentence--

   22. There is no peace, says the LORD, unto the wicked. O God, have
   mercy upon us, and let us not be numbered with them!

Encouragements To Prayer

   (No. 2380)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY
   19, 1888.

   "I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt:
   open your mouth wide, and I will fill it." Psalm 81:10.

   The preceding verse bids us turn away from any strange God--"There
   shall no strange god be in you; neither shall you worship any strange
   god." Idolatry is the natural sin of man. It covers a very large
   surface of the realm of sin and it is always cropping up in some form
   or other. Idolatry is not merely the bowing before graven images--the
   essence of it lies in putting trust in any other than the great
   invisible God. We can easily make to ourselves gods of our experience,
   of our wealth, of our talents. We can make idols of our children, of
   our wives, of our husbands, of our friends. We can make a god of
   anything by valuing it more than we do our Savior, or by trusting in it
   beyond our God, or by refusing to trust in Him apart from it. You can
   make a god of the means of Grace--when you think more of the means of
   Grace than of God and the Grace of the means! You can make a god of
   your Bible when you think that the reading of it, apart from the
   illumination of the Holy Spirit, will be all that you require! So you
   see that it is very easy for man to fall into idolatry.

   The cure for this evil lies in our having a living God always before
   us. If you forget the living God, you will make to yourself an idol
   god. It is a necessity of your nature that you should have a god of
   some sort and, to prevent your having a strange god, you must trust,
   cling to and love Jehovah, the one only living and true God.

   The man who has Christ before him does not need a crucifix. The man who
   comes to God through Jesus Christ does not need the intercession of the
   Virgin Mary or of saints and angels. The man who has set the Lord
   always before him does not desire symbols of Jehovah's Presence--in
   fact, he remembers the words of Moses to the children of Israel-- "Take
   you therefore good heed unto yourselves; for you saw no manner of
   similitude on the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out of the
   midst of the fire: lest you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven
   image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
   the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any
   winged fowl that flies in the air, the likeness of anything that creeps
   on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath
   the earth: and lest you lift up your eyes unto Heaven, and when you see
   the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of Heaven,
   should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord, your
   God, has divided unto all nations under the whole Heaven."

   Such a man is afraid, sometimes, if there is anything like a similitude
   about his prayers, lest his mind should be taken away from worshipping
   God, who is a Spirit, in spirit and in truth. He, therefore, generally
   seeks after great simplicity of worship, for an ornate ritual is a
   stumbling block to him, although there are some who think that it is a
   help to them. It only hinders him and, therefore, he rejects it. Oh,
   that God might always keep us clear of all idolatry by His good Spirit
   enabling us to worship Him in spirit and in truth! Then would these
   words be fulfilled in our experience--"There shall no strange god be in
   you; neither shall you worship any strange god." He who has learned to
   trust the Creator will not want to trust the creature! He who has
   stayed himself upon the Rock of Ages will not be tempted to support
   himself upon the broken reed of human strength! Who will lean on a
   cloud when his defense may be the munitions of stupendous rocks? Who
   will wish to feed on the mist when he has eaten the true Bread which
   comes down from Heaven? God, the true God, casts out all strange gods!

   In our text we have God coming very near to His people, and coming near
   them to encourage them to come nearer to Him. We have the Lord speaking
   to them, that they may speak to Him. He opens His mouth to them, that
   they may open

   their mouths to Him. The text contains one encouragement and two
   arguments for it--they will be our two divisions. First, God
   encouraging His people. And, secondly, God using two great arguments.
   You see, the exhortation is sandwiched in between two arguments. The
   first is, "I am the Lord--I am Jehovah--your God, which brought you out
   of the land of Egypt." Then comes the exhortation, "Open your mouth
   wide." And that is followed by the other argument, "I will fill it."
   There is a good reason, indeed, for opening the mouth wide, when God
   has promised to fill it!

   I. To begin, then, the exhortation of the sermon will be that which we
   find in the text, in which we hear GOD ENCOURAGING HIS PEOPLE by
   saying, "Open your mouth wide."

   I suppose that the Lord means by this exhortation, first of all, to
   help us to get rid of the paralyzing influence of fear. A man, in the
   presence of one whom he dreads, cannot speak boldly. And if he has been
   guilty of some great crime and stands before one whom he regards as his
   judge, he is like the man in our Lord's parable--"speechless." A man on
   his knees, conscious of his sin, fearing the justice of God, would very
   naturally be unable to speak. And to encourage him, God says, "Open
   your mouth; be not afraid. Open your mouth wide; confess your sin;
   acknowledge your wanderings from your God; go into the particulars of
   your iniquity; ask for My mercy; plead My promises; set forth the
   arguments that can be drawn from the Cross of Christ. Open your mouth
   wide; be not afraid to speak."

   Am I addressing some child of God, or rather, one who hardly knows
   whether he is a child of God or not, but who wants to be one? Do you
   feel as if you cannot pray? God, here, encourages you to plead with
   Him! He says, "Open your mouth." Your eyes are filled with tears, or
   perhaps you are wishing that they might be. Your heart is swelling with
   grief, but you cannot find expressions for your feelings. You are
   afraid to come before the Lord. You dare not take hold of the horns of
   the altar. You think that it would be presumption on your part to look
   to Christ and hope for mercy, so, there you lie, dumb before God! But,
   bending over you in infinite compassion, the Great Father says, "Open
   your mouth! Speak, My child! My ears are waiting to hear your cry. I am
   ready to grant your request. Oh, be not silent before Me! Pour out your
   heart like water in My Presence--turn it upside down and, to the last
   dregs, let all flow out before Me. Reserve nothing! Spread your case
   before Me, now." I think that this exhortation means just that.

   Next, "Open your mouth wide." That is, speak freely in prayer to God,
   be not hampered in your pleading. I have known children of God who have
   felt a terrible awe in the Presence of the Lord--which is a most proper
   feeling up to a certain point--but they have had a fear which has
   brought them into bondage, and bondage is a sad evil. We need freedom
   and liberty of access to God when we come before the Mercy Seat. And
   the Lord, therefore, encourages His people to break loose from all
   their shackles when He says, "Open your mouth wide." There are many
   prayers that it would not be right to pray in public, but they are very
   dear to God's ears in private. I believe that there are prayers uttered
   by godly men--uneducated and illiterate Believers--that might provoke a
   smile from us, but they are accepted in the Beloved, and received as
   good, sound supplication before the Lord God of Sabaoth. "Open your
   mouth wide." If you cannot pray as you would, pray as you can, but make
   yourself free with your heavenly Father! Be bold with your Lord! Shake
   off all reserve and keep back nothing from Him!

   Bare your hearts before Him--you cannot conceal anything from Him--do
   not attempt to do so. Freely commune with the Lord as friend speaks to
   friend, or as a child addresses his father. You are not, now, before
   your judge. You are not before an enemy. You are not before one who
   will harshly criticize you and pull you to pieces--the Lord is all love
   and gentleness to those who seek His face. Then open your mouth wide!
   What is it that you have done? What is it that you need? What is it
   that your soul is craving for? What is it that drives you to despair?
   Open your mouth wide--let all come out--hide nothing from your God! Let
   your very heart come marching out at the open doors of your lips, for
   God is waiting to hear your petition.

   The exhortation of the text means, then, shake off all fear, and, also,
   exercise a holy boldness of familiarity and freedom in the Presence of
   the Most High.

   Do you not think, however, that it means something more than that? It
   must also mean, ask great things. "Open your mouth wide." Now note
   this. The greater the thing that you ask, the more sure you are to have
   it! With men it is, usually, the smaller the favor you crave, the more
   likely you are to obtain it. But with God it is the other way--the
   greater the gift for which you ask, the more sure you are to have it!
   There is nothing greater to ask for than Christ--and you may have
   Christ for the asking--for God has already given Him to all who
   believe. "God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son,
   that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." If you ask for

   wealth, you may not get it, for it is a small and paltry thing which
   the Lord may not care to give you. But if you ask for eternal life, you
   shall have it, for this is a great thing and God delights to give the
   greatest blessings to those who come to Him by Christ Jesus, so that,
   what might seem to hinder should now encourage! God can hear you if you
   cannot open your mouth, for He can hear the inward groans of your
   heart. But, oh, you can be sure that He will hear you if you can open
   your mouth wide!

   Is your sin great? Use that as an argument! Say with David, "For Your
   name's sake, O Lord, pardon my iniquity; for it is great." Are you in a
   very sad plight? Are you spiritually bankrupt? Then plead your
   poverty--there is no plea like it with God! Do you feel empty? Plead
   your emptiness! The more urgent your necessity, the more sure will
   mercy be to relieve you! The greater your need, the readier is God to
   come to you! If, in going through the town, I see a doctor's carriage
   hurrying along at a great speed, I do not think that the physician is
   driving to a person who has only a toothache! I should conceive that
   somebody, in dire extremity, had sent for him in hot haste to come and
   cure him, if possible, of a serious malady. And when God rides upon a
   cherub and flies, yes, does fly upon the wings of the wind, He is
   coming to relieve some great need of His people! To the man who has a
   great need, God says, "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it." Ask
   great things! God's people need to be taught to ask great things! That
   was a noble utterance of William Carey, "Attempt great things for God,
   expect great things from God." The less you expect from man, the
   better, but the more you expect from God, the more you are likely to
   receive. Look for great things from Him and come to Him with large
   requests--

   "You are coming to a King, Large petitions with you bring."

   Our text must mean that, must it not--ask great things?

   I think that it also means, in the fourth place, that we are to feel
   intense desires. "Open your mouth." It has been noticed that whenever a
   man speaks with very great earnestness, he opens his mouth wide. We
   read in the Gospels that when our Lord went up into a mountain and,
   "was set, his disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and
   taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit," and so on.
   Someone observed that it was quite unnecessary to say that He opened
   His mouth, for how could He preach without doing so? But another and a
   wiser person replied, "Oh, if you go into many a Church and Chapel, you
   can see the thing done!" When a man does not speak distinctly and
   clearly, he does not open his mouth--but when he is emphatic and
   earnest in his address, he must open his mouth wide!

   The Lord urges us to be in earnest when He says, "Open your mouth
   wide." Cold prayers, so-called, are not real prayers--they are rather
   entreaties to be denied--all their force works backwards! We must pray
   with fervency, importunity, reiteration, if we would prevail with God!
   We must say, "I will not let You go, except You bless me." The Lord
   loves that kind of pleading! There is no music in God's ear that is
   more sweet from His child than a loud earnest cry! God delights to hear
   the knocker of prayer hammering away at the door of mercy! If you have
   been denied six times, go for the seventh time and knock, and knock,
   and knock--each time with greater vehemence--if you would be heard.
   "Open your mouth wide."

   O dear Hearers, some of you have been seeking the Lord a little,
   lately, and you have not found Him! No, but He is not a little God, to
   be sought a little! And when your whole heart and soul go after Him.
   When you are deeply anxious and sorely exercised, and solemnly in
   earnest, then will this great God give you His great salvation! Oh,
   that you would open your mouth wide! Cry unto Him! I mean not with
   actual loudness of voice, but with the loudness of the heart's voice
   which shall be heard in Heaven. Sometimes, when it rains very hard, and
   the servant does not come to the door very quickly, you give such a
   pull at the bell that it rings all over the house--now give such a ring
   as that at the gate of Heaven! A storm is raging and you cannot endure
   waiting outside in the tempest. Pull the bell as if you would pull
   Heaven, itself, down! Give a ring that seems to say, "I must come in!
   Infinite Love, I must possess You! Sovereign Mercy, I must receive You!
   I die, I perish, I am lost forever unless You come to me, my God." Open
   your mouth wide and then He will be sure to fill it!

   Once more, I think that this exhortation means exercise a great
   expectancy. I inadvertently touched upon that point just now. The
   figure is, no doubt, taken from a bird's nest. Have you ever seen the
   little birds, inside a nest, when they expected their mother to come
   and feed them? If you have ever peeped in and they mistook you for
   their mother, what did they look like? Why, they looked like a mass of
   mouth! They opened their mouths as wide as they could and it is really

   surprising how very wide a little bird can open its mouth! The mother
   is about to bring a worm, or some other thing for it to feed upon--the
   wee birdie is famishing and it cannot receive food any other way but by
   opening its mouth! And its hunger makes it feel as if its mouth was not
   half wide enough and so it at least makes it as wide as it can when the
   parent bird comes to it--the father or mother which has been toiling
   and working all day long to satisfy its needs. They do work, poor
   little creatures, and how fast and how often they fly to and fro! They
   seem to say to their little ones, "We will fill you. Open your mouths
   wide and we will fill you."

   As for you, poor Souls, what a mouth you have, if you do but open it! I
   mean, what needs you have! I tell you that your needs are so great that
   if all the saints on earth, and all the angels in Heaven, were to put
   their stores together and say, "We will fill you," they would undertake
   a task utterly beyond their power! None but God, Himself, can fill the
   human heart! Only He can truly say, "Open your mouth wide and I will
   fill it." Christ will fill it, however great your sense of sin and your
   need of pardon. The Father will fill it, however great your grief for
   having left His house. The Holy Spirit will fill it, however long your
   death in sin, however great your alienation from God! None but the
   Trinity can fill the heart of man! It was one of Quarles' quaint
   sayings that the heart was a triangle and the world a globe and, he
   says, "a globe can never fill a triangle, and none but the Trinity can
   fill the heart of man." Quaint as the saying is, the Truth of God which
   it embodies is absolutely certain!

   "Open your mouth wide and I will fill it," says God. Expect just this,
   that God will give you, in answer to prayer, all that you need--"I will
   fill it." Somebody, misquoting this text, says, "I will fill it
   abundantly." Tush! What do you want with your, "abundantly"? God's Word
   is big enough without any of your adverbs! "I will fill it." If it is
   filled. it is filled, and God will fill you full! He will give you all
   that you require and all that you can ever require between this place
   and the gates of Heaven! "Open you your mouth wide, sensible of your
   urgent necessity, and I," says God, "will supply all your needs,
   according to My riches in Glory by Christ Jesus." "Open your mouth wide
   and I will fill it."

   Now, just two or three words, here, concerning arguments that I might
   use to induce children of God to come before His Presence asking great
   things.

   First, consider God's greatness. You may expect great things from Him
   who made the heavens and the earth! Look up at the stars, see how the
   Lord flung them about by handfuls, and remember that all the stars that
   are visible to you are only the sweepings of stardust by the door of
   God's great House! There is an infinite number of bright worlds which
   our telescopes have never seen. He who made all these things is great
   in power. Therefore, ask something great of Him when you come before
   Him in prayer. Remember, also, His goodness. God delights to give--you
   are not asking Him to do that which will vex Him. The Lord is no miser
   who miserably doles out His coppers under pressure. He is a God to whom
   it is as natural to give as it is for the sun to shine, or for a
   fountain to flow! Come, then, to Him with large petitions, since He is
   so greatly good!

   Remember, also, the channel by which mercies come to you. It is Christ
   Jesus your Lord. Are you coming to the Lord for pennyworths, in the
   name of Christ? Say, will you satisfy yourself by asking for pence and
   farthings through the Lord Jesus? Such a Mercy Seat as this was meant
   for something grand and glorious! Such a Sacrifice as Christ's was
   provided for the greatest needs of men! Open your mouths wide when you
   mention the name of Jesus Christ! It seems a poor thing to stint
   yourselves in your prayers when the name you plead is--

   "The name high over all

   In Hell, or earth, or sky!

   Angels and men before it fall--

   And devils fear and fly."

   Note, next, that the Holy Spirit is the Author of true prayer. He
   "helps our infirmities." and will you stutter and stammer when the Holy
   Spirit helps you? Will you say of such a thing, "This is too great for
   me to ask"? What? When the Holy Spirit prompts you to ask, does He not
   know what is fit for you to ask? Yield yourself to His gracious
   impulses! Be borne along the stream of supplication by the Spirit's
   influence and ask what you will! That is a pretty story that they tell
   of Alexander having given a man a present which seemed far too great.
   So he was afraid that it could not be his and then Alexander said, "It
   may be too much for you to receive, but it is not too much for me to
   give." So the mercy may seem too great for you to have, but it is by no
   means too great for Christ to grant you! Open your mouth wide, then,
   while you have such a Father, Son and Holy Spirit to go to in prayer!

   "Open your mouth wide," for your needs are very great. They are much
   greater than you know--do not, therefore, fall short in your petitions.
   I think that if I could have anything I asked for of any friend, I
   would be inclined to overleap my necessities a little, rather than to
   fall short of them. Certainly with God, who is not impoverished by
   giving, and not enriched by withholding, we may take vast liberties.
   "Open your mouth wide and I will fill it." Ask much in prayer because
   your needs are so great.

   And then think of the needs of others. Oh, when I think of what power
   prayer has, I would encourage Brothers and Sisters to pray great
   prayers for the conversion of London, for the establishment of Christ's
   Church in the land and for the conversion of China, Africa, India.
   "Open your mouth wide." There was one who seemed to have great power in
   prayer and I have often read his life, but I think the prayers he used
   to pray were for a pair of horses, or for a new suit of clothes, or
   something of that sort. He always obtained what he asked, but it seems
   a miserable business to pray like that! It is much nobler to pray, like
   Carey, "India for Christ!" or, "Lord, save China!" Now you have asked
   for something great this time! "Open your mouth wide," as you have such
   a great God to deal with about such great matters! You may ask for
   little things when you need them and you are encouraged to do so, but
   still, do not confine your requests to them. Come to great things and
   ask great mercies for others, if you are not under any great necessity
   yourself!

   Remember, once more, God's exceedingly great and precious promises. How
   can you be praying on a right scale if you are always praying
   straitened in yourselves? O dear Friends, the promises of God are not
   narrow! They are "exceedingly great and precious promises." You have
   never fully measured them! Come, then, with an open mouth, and ask
   great things of your Father who is in Heaven. Thus have I, at some
   length, handled the exhortation in the text, but I cannot do much with
   it--it is only the Holy Spirit who can effectually whisper into your
   ear and heart, "Open your mouth wide."

   II. Now, secondly, observe GOD USING TWO GREAT ARGUMENTS upon which I
   will only speak briefly. One is

   put before the exhortation and one is put afterwards, to keep it with
   an attendant on either side.

   The first reason why you should open your mouth wide is because of what
   God has done. He says, "I am the Lord your God, which brought you out
   of the land of Egypt." You remember where these words occur, do you
   not? They are recorded very solemnly in the 20th Chapter of Exodus, at
   the commencement of the Ten Commandments--"I am the Lord your God,
   which brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
   bondage. You shall have no other gods before Me." And now the same
   solemn words come before a promise, as if God made this precept to be
   as solemn as His Law and confirmed the promise with all the solemnities
   with which He established the Covenant. "Open your mouth wide," He
   says.

   Child of God, this text belongs peculiarly to you. "I am Jehovah, your
   God." The Lord has an election of Grace-- He has a peculiar people whom
   He has chosen unto Himself--and they shall show forth His praise. God
   is the God of His people. "I am Jehovah, your God," He says. If He is
   not the God of others, yet He is your God. He has revealed Himself to
   you. He has chosen you and you have chosen Him, Now, can you not open
   your mouth wide to your own God, to Jehovah, the great, "I AM," the
   boundless, the infinite, the almighty God--can you not speak freely to
   Him?

   And then it is added, "I am Jehovah, your God, which brought you out of
   the land of Egypt." Now, that is the greatest thing that God could do
   for His people and, if He has done that, will He not do the lesser
   things? Oh, what a wondrous deliverance that was, when, with a high
   hand and an outstretched arm, He brought forth His people, despite all
   the opposition of Pharaoh! With terrible plagues He broke the power of
   the proud monarch, but as for His people, He led them forth like sheep
   and brought them out into a glorious liberty--and crushed the chivalry
   of Egypt at the Red Sea so that they could never again pursue the
   Israelites--nor disturb them in their wilderness march towards the land
   which God had promised them.

   Well now, the Lord has done just that same kind of thing for all His
   people! He has brought us out of our spiritual bondage! We have eaten
   the Paschal Lamb. We have sprinkled the blood. We have escaped the
   destroying angel. We are no longer under the power of sin and
   Satan--the Lord has set us free! And, as for our sins, the depths have
   covered them! There is not one of them left--they sank to the bottom
   like a stone. Glory be to God for what He has done! If this does not
   lead us to open our mouths wide in prayer, what will?

   "Ah," sighs a poor soul, "He has never done that for me. I am still a
   bond slave." Listen! If He has done it for others, take hope from it
   that God will hear prayer and save you, seeing that He has saved
   others. Did you ever notice, in the old slave times, in the Southern
   States of America, how, when a slave escaped, others heard that he had
   followed the pole star

   and so gained liberty, and they all took hope? Well now, if the Lord
   has brought some of us out of bondage, take hope, you who are still in
   chains! God can deliver you! Ask Him to do so--open your mouth wide!
   When you get home, cry to God in your chamber. Better still, here in
   your pew, breathe a prayer for salvation and liberty--and if you need a
   word of advice and counsel, come on to this lower platform and there
   shall be some friend to speak with you, and pray with you about your
   soul. Only open your mouth! Do not be ashamed! God says to you that He
   has brought His people out of Egypt and He who has done that can do
   anything! Open your mouth wide and He will fill it.

   But the second argument, with which the text closes, is concerning what
   God will do. "Open your mouth wide and I will fill it." "I will fill
   it." The story goes--I know not how true it is, but I remember reading
   it very well--that the Shah of Persia, a strange man, altogether, on
   one occasion said to a person who had pleased him very greatly, "Open
   your mouth." And when he had opened his mouth, the Shah began to fill
   it up with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and all sorts of precious stones!
   I feel morally certain that the man opened his mouth wide! I do not
   know what your opinions may be, but I have the firm conviction that
   when he found that such treasure was being put into his mouth, he made
   it as large as it very well could be, whether it looked beautiful or
   not! Would not you do the same if you had such an opportunity? Suppose
   that your mouth was to be filled with sovereigns and you were in
   extreme poverty--would you not open your mouth? It would prompt a man
   to open his mouth wide if he heard the Shah say, "I will fill it." Now,
   the Lord says to each of His own people, whom He has so highly favored,
   "Open your mouth wide and I will fill it."

   Suppose you open your mouth wide in prayer. "I cannot," says one. Well,
   open your mouth and God will fill it with prayer and then, when you
   have prayed the prayer that He has given you, He will fill it with
   answers! God gives prayer as well as the answer to prayer! Only open
   your mouth and, as it were, make a vacuum for God to fill. God loves to
   look for emptiness where He may stow away His Grace!

   When you have done that, then open your mouth with praise! It is
   wonderful, when a man begins to praise God, how the praise keeps on
   coming. The praise of God is something like Mr. Bunyan's Pilgrim's
   Progress. He began to write, he says, and he does not know how he wrote
   so much, but he quaintly says, "As I pulled, it came." And you will
   find it is so with the praise of God. Praise Him and you will praise
   Him. If you do not praise Him, you never will praise Him. If you do not
   begin, you will never keep on--but once open the sluices of gratitude
   and the streams will flow more and more copiously every hour! "Open
   your mouth wide and I will fill it."

   So is it in comparing our testimony concerning God's goodness.
   Sometimes we who are preachers have to cry, "What shall we say to the
   people?" I see some dear Brothers, here, who, I dare say, get as I do,
   into a very poverty-stricken state. They say, "Where shall we get the
   next sermon from?" Well, go in God's name and say what He bids you, and
   He will tell you more! Open your mouth wide and He will fill it. Bear
   testimony to what the Lord has done for your soul, in your own small
   way, and He will be pleased to fill your mouth with His good Word, so
   that you shall abundantly utter the memory of His great goodness!

   Now, then, let us all come before God with open mouths. Whatever state
   of mind we may be in, if we cannot pray, let us come and open our mouth
   and pant, as David did when he said, "As the hart pants after the water
   brooks, so pants my soul after You, O God." So let us come before our
   God. You who feel as if you could not speak and could scarcely think,
   come with your mouth wide open and stand there before God! Or be like
   the little bird in its nest--open your mouth towards Heaven! Mark how
   the parched earth, in times of drought, cracks and opens its mouth for
   the rain. Let your parched heart begin to pray in the Presence of your
   God and thus ask for His Grace. May God give us mighty desires! We read
   of Daniel, in the margin of our Bible, instead of, "a man greatly
   Beloved," "a man of desires." He was a man of great desires! And if we
   are like he in this respect, we shall soon be greatly blessed, and God
   will be greatly glorified! May it be so, for His great name's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 81

   We have here an exhortation to praise God and this is always in season.
   Perhaps we need more stirring up to praise than to prayer, yet it ought
   to be as natural for us to praise God as it is for the birds to sing.
   Thus the Psalm begins--

   Verse 1. Sing aloud unto God our strength. Yes, the strength which the
   Lord gives you should be spent in praising Him. "Sing aloud." Throw
   your whole soul into it. If the Lord makes you strong, then give your
   strength back to Him in sacred song--"Sing aloud unto God our
   strength."

   1. Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Other gods, such as
   Moloch and Ashtaroth, are worshipped with mournful cries and sorrowful
   lamentations. But the God of Jacob, the God that hears prayer, the God
   of salvation, the God of the Covenant, is to be worshipped with joy! He
   is the happy God and He loves happy worshippers--"Make a joyful noise
   unto the God of Jacob." You do not need to be forced to praise Him--you
   will do it with alacrity and delight! The very sweetness of your song
   will consist in the cheerfulness of it! "Make a joyful noise unto the
   God of Jacob."

   2-4. Take a Psalm and bring here the timbrel, the pleasant harp with
   the Psaltery. Blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed,
   on our solemn feast day. For this was a statute for Israel, and a Law
   of the God of Jacob. It is "a statute" that we should praise God. It is
   "a Law" that we should make a joyful noise before Him. Happy Law and
   happy men who are under such a Law! Let us be quick to obey it and let
   not the King's statute be disregarded by any one of us.

   5. This He ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when He went out through
   the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not. God
   understands His people's language and, in very truth, He understands
   everything. But here He uses a Hebraism to show that He did not care
   for the speech of the Egyptians--"I heard a language that I understood
   not." This sentence is like that other expression, "I never knew you."
   Of course the Lord knows everyone as a matter of acquaintance, but not
   as a matter of affection. He cared not for the Egyptians--they were
   aliens to Him. He went out against the land of Egypt. It was for Joseph
   and for His own people who were under the leadership of Joseph in that
   heathen land, that He ordained this statute that they should praise the
   name of Jehovah.

   6. I removed his shoulder from the burden. Is not that true of many of
   you in a spiritual sense? Oh, what a burden of sin we used to carry!
   How have we got rid of it? Does not the Lord, here, remind us of how we
   lost that grievous load? "I removed his shoulder from the burden."

   6. His hands were delivered from the pots. We used to be busy enough
   with the slave's occupation of making bricks without straw. Hard was
   the task when we were under legal bondage--harder, still, the toil,
   when under the bondage of our own sin, slaves of ourselves! Who could
   ever have a more tyrant master than himself? But that is all over, now,
   and the Lord can say, "I removed his shoulder from the burden: his
   hands were delivered from the pots."

   7. You called in trouble and I delivered you. What a gracious Word is
   this! How it reminds us, in the most loving tones, of our obligations
   to the Lord! "You called in trouble and I delivered you."

   7. I answered you in the secret place of thunder: I proved you at the
   waters of Meribah. Selah. A very humbling sentence this! God has often
   proved us and He has often disproved us. When He has tried us, we have
   not endured the test as we ought to have done. We have murmured and
   complained and the waters which ought to have been waters of joy and of
   happy patience, have been waters of strife. "Selah." That is, "Pause."
   Tighten the harp strings, lift up the heart! Such a Psalm as this is to
   be read by installments, with little halts on the road for us to
   meditate and think upon the Truth of God brought before us. We may well
   pause, here, when we hear the Lord reminding us of our faults and of
   His great mercy to us--"I delivered you; I answered you; I proved you
   at the waters of Meribah. Selah."

   8. Hear, O My people, and I will testify unto you: O Israel, if you
   will hearken unto Me. What? Is there any question as to whether God's
   people will listen to Him or not? Alas, sometimes our ears grow very
   heavy--we are so occupied with the cares of the world, so sleepy while
   passing over the Enchanted Ground that we do not hear that dear voice
   to which we ought to give heed whenever it speaks--"Hear, O My people,
   O Israel, if you will hearken unto Me."

   9. There shall no strange god be in you; neither shall you worship any
   strange god. It is strange that we should ever wish to do so. Oh, that
   we might be wholly delivered from everything that looks like idolatry
   and be enabled to cleave to the worship of the one living and true God
   with the serenity and certainty of faith!

   10. 11. I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
   Egypt: open your mouth wide and I will fill it. But My people would not
   hearken to My voice; and Israel would none of Me. Oh, how plaintive is
   this lament! Is it not full of sorrow? "Israel would none of Me." Her
   own God, her own Friend, her own Benefactor, her own Husband has to
   cry, "Israel would none of Me--would not have My Law, My promise, My
   guidance, Myself--Israel would none of Me."

   12. So I gave them up--Dreadful word! If God gives us up, even for a
   moment, there is no telling into what sin we may plunge! And if He were
   to give us up altogether--ah, me, this is the most direful of
   sentences--"So I gave them up"--

   12. Unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
   O God, save us from this awful state! This, indeed, is Hell--to be
   given up of God! Pray, dear Brothers and Sisters, that such a terrible
   curse may never come upon you! Yet it is a most righteous punishment if
   a man will not have God--and will give God up--what can be a more
   righteous retribution than that God should give him up? He does so, at
   last, with ungodly men, yet He does it very reluctantly, and He says,
   "How shall I give you up?" May He never give up one of you!

   13. Oh that My people had listened to Me, and Israel had walked in My
   ways. And can we not echo that lament and say, "Oh, that we had
   listened to God, and that we had walked in His ways"? What a happy life
   would the Believer enjoy if he always had an ear for God's Commandments
   and a foot for His ways! "Oh that My people had listened to Me, and
   Israel had walked in My ways!"

   14. 15. I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand
   against their adversaries. The haters of the LORD should have submitted
   themselves unto Him; and their time should have endured forever. "Their
   time"--the time of His own people--"should have endured forever." They
   might have been always conquerors, always kings, always favored of God,
   always walking in the light, as God is in the light. So might it be
   with us if we would first, listen to God, and next, walk in His ways.
   The mark on the ear and the mark on the foot are two of the tokens of
   Christ's sheep--"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they
   follow Me." May we all have both the ear-mark and the foot-mark!

   16. He would have fed them, also, with the finest of the wheat. How
   sweet would Gospel doctrine be if Gospel precepts were observed! When
   you do not enjoy the preaching of the Word, is it not because you are
   out of health and your spiritual appetite is impaired? "He would have
   fed them, also, with the finest of the wheat." When the soul lives near
   to God, then the Word of the Lord is sweeter than honey and the
   honeycomb.

   16. And with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you. You
   know what this "honey out of the rock" is. You have tasted it and in
   days gone by you have feasted on it! Perhaps you have not had much of
   it of late. If so, remember why this is. God will give His children
   bread, but He will not give them honey unless they live very near to
   Him--you shall have the necessaries of life, but not luxuries. The high
   and heavenly joys of the Divine Life shall be denied you if you work at
   a distance from your God. But if you stay close to Him, you shall have
   the finest of the wheat, and you shall be satisfied with honey out of
   the rock.

   May the Lord bless the reading of His Word to us, and may He draw us
   nearer to Himself! Amen.

"I Would, But You Would Not"

   (No. 2381)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 7, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   22, 1888.

   "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the Prophets, and stone them
   which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children
   together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you
   were not willing!" Matthew 23:37.

   THIS is not and could not be the language of a mere man. It would be
   utterly absurd for any man to say that he would have gathered the
   inhabitants of a city together, "even as a hen gathers her chicks under
   her wings." Besides, the language implies that for many centuries, by
   the sending of the Prophets, and by many other warnings, God would
   often have gathered the children of Jerusalem together as a hen gathers
   her chicks under her wings. Now, Christ could not have said that
   throughout those ages He would have gathered those people, if He had
   been only a man. If His life began at Bethlehem, this would be an
   absurd statement, but, as the Son of God, always loving the sons of
   men, ever desirous the good of Israel, He could say that in sending the
   Prophets, even though they were stoned and killed, He had, again and
   again, shown His desire to bless His people till He could truly say,
   "How often would I have gathered your children together!" Some who have
   found difficulties in this lament have said that it was the language of
   Christ as Man. I beg to put in a very decided negative to that--it is,
   and it must be, the utterance of the Son of Man, the Son of God, the
   Christ in His complex Person as Human and Divine. I am not going into
   any of the difficulties just now, but you could not fully understand
   this passage, from any point of view, unless you believed it to be the
   language of One who was both God and Man.

   This verse shows, also, that the ruin of men lies with themselves.
   Christ puts it very plainly, "I would; but you were not willing." "How
   often would I have gathered your children together, and you were not
   willing!" That is a Truth of God, about which, I hope, we have never
   had any question. We hold tenaciously that salvation is all of Grace,
   but we also believe, with equal firmness, that the ruin of man is
   entirely the result of His own sin! It is the will of God that
   saves--it is the will of man that damns. Jerusalem stands and is
   preserved by the Grace and favor of the Most High. But Jerusalem is
   burnt and her stones are cast down through the transgression and
   iniquity of men who provoked the justice of God.

   There are great deeps about these two points, but I have not been
   accustomed to lead you into any deeps and I am not going to do so at
   this time. The practical part of theology is that which it is most
   important for us to understand. Any man may get himself into a terrible
   labyrinth who continually thinks only of the Sovereignty of God. And He
   may equally get into deeps that are likely to drown him if he meditates
   only on the free will of man. The best thing is to take what God
   reveals to you and to believe that. If God's Word leads me to the
   right, I go there. If it leads me to the left, I go there. If it makes
   me stand still, I stand still. If you so act, you will be safe. But if
   you try to be wise above that which is written and to understand that
   which even angels do not comprehend, you will certainly befog yourself.

   I desire to always bring before you practical rather than mysterious
   subjects--and our present theme is one that concerns us all. The great
   destroyer of man is the will of man. I do not believe that man's free
   will has ever saved a soul, but man's free will has been the ruin of
   multitudes. "You would not," is still the solemn accusation of Christ
   against guilty men. Did He not say, at another time, "You will not come
   unto Me, that you might have life"? The human will is desperately set
   against God and is the great devourer and destroyer of thousands of
   good intentions and emotions which never come to anything permanent
   because the will is acting in opposition to that which is right and
   true.

   That, I think, is the very marrow of the text, and I am going to handle
   it in this fashion.

   I. First, consider from the very condescending emblem used by our Lord,
   WHAT GOD IS TO THOSE WHO COME TO HIM. He gathers them, "as a hen
   gathers her chicks under her wings." Let us dwell upon that thought for
   a few minutes. It is a very marvelous thing that God should condescend
   to be compared to a hen, that the Christ, the Son of the Highest, the
   Savior of men, should stoop to so homely a piece of imagery as to liken
   Himself to a hen. There must be something very instructive in this
   metaphor, or our Lord would not have used it in such a connection.

   Those of you who have been gathered unto Christ know, first, that by
   this wonderful Gatherer, you have been gathered into happy association.
   The chicks, beneath the wings of the hen, look very happy all crowded
   together. What a sweet little family party they are! How they hide
   themselves away in great contentment and chirp their little note of
   joy! You, dear Friends, who have never been converted, find very noisy
   fellowship, I am afraid, in this world. You do not get much
   companionship that helps you, blesses you, gives you rest of mind. But
   if you had been gathered to the Lord's Christ, you would have found
   that there are many sweetnesses in this life in being beneath the wings
   of the Most High! He who comes to Christ finds father, mother, sister
   and brother--he finds many dear and kind friends who are, themselves,
   connected with Christ and who, therefore, love those who are joined to
   Him.

   Among the greatest happinesses of my life, certainly, I put down
   Christian fellowship, and I think that many who have come from the
   country to London have, for a long time, missed much of this fellowship
   till, at last, they have fallen in with Christian people and they have
   found themselves happy again. O lonely Sinner, you who come in and out
   of this place and say, "Nobody seems to care about me," if you will
   come to Christ and join with the Church which is gathered beneath His
   wings, you will soon find happy fellowship! I remember that in the
   times of persecution, one of the saints said that he had lost his
   father and his mother by being driven away from his native country, but
   he said, "I have found a hundred fathers, and a hundred mothers, for
   into whatever Christian house I have gone, I have been looked upon with
   so much kindness by those who have received me as an exile from my
   native land, that everyone has seemed to be a father and a mother to
   me." If you come to Christ, I feel persuaded that He will introduce you
   to many people who will give you happy fellowship!

   But that is merely the beginning. A hen is to her little chicks, next,
   a cover of safety. There is a hawk in the sky--the mother bird can see
   it, though the chicks cannot. She gives her peculiar cluck of warning
   and quickly they come and hide beneath her wings. The hawk will not
   hurt them now--beneath her wings they are secure. This is what God is
   to those who come to Him by Jesus Christ, He is the Giver of safety.
   "He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings shall you
   trust: His Truth shall be your shield and buckler." Even the attraction
   of your old sins, or the danger of future temptations--you shall be
   preserved from all these perils when you come to Christ and thus hide
   away under Him.

   The figure our Lord used is full of meaning, for, in the next place,
   the hen is to her chicks the source of comfort. It is a cold night and
   they would be frozen if they remained outside. But she calls them in
   and when they are under her wings, they derive warmth from their
   mother's breast. It is amazing, the care of a hen for her little ones!
   She will sit so carefully and keep her wings so widely spread, that
   they may all be housed. What a cabin, what a palace it is for the young
   chicks to get there under the mother's wings! The snow may fall, or the
   rain may come pelting down, but the wings of the hen protect the
   chicks. And you, dear Friend, if you come to Christ, shall not only
   have safety, but comfort. I speak what I have experienced! There is a
   deep, sweet comfort about hiding yourself away in God, for when
   troubles come, wave upon wave, blessed is the man who has a God to give
   him mercy upon mercy! When affliction comes, or bereavement comes, when
   loss of property comes, when sickness comes in your own body, there is
   nothing needed but your God! Ten thousand things, apart from Him,
   cannot satisfy you, or give you comfort. There, let them all go! But if
   God is yours and you hide away under His wings, you are as happy in Him
   as the chicks are beneath the hen.

   Then, the hen is also to her chicks, the fountain of love. She loves
   them. Did you ever see a hen fight for her chicks? She is a timid
   enough creature at any other time, but there is no timidity when her
   chicks are in danger! What an affection she has for them--not for all
   chicks, for I have known her kill the chicks of another brood--but for
   her own, what love she has! Her heart is all devoted to them. But, oh,
   if you want to know the true Fountain of Love, you must come to Christ!
   You will never have to say, "Nobody loves me. I am pining, with an
   aching heart, for a love that can fill and satisfy it." The love of
   Jesus fills the heart of man to overflowing and makes him well content
   under all circumstances. I would that God had gathered you all, my dear
   Hearers! I know that He has gathered many of you, blessed be His name,

   but still there are some here, chicks without a hen, sinners without a
   Savior, men, women and children who have never been reconciled to God.

   The hen is also to her chicks, the cherisher of growth. They would not
   develop if they were not taken care of--in their weakness they need to
   be cherished that they may come to the fullness of their perfection.
   And when the child of God lives near to Christ and hides beneath His
   wings, how fast he grows! There is no advancing from Grace to Grace,
   from feeble faith to strong faith, and from little fervency to great
   fervency, except by getting near to God!

   The emblem used by our Lord is a far more instructive figure than I
   have time to explain. When the Lord gathers sinners to Himself, then it
   is that they find in Him all that the chicks find in the hen, and
   infinitely more!

   II. Now notice, secondly, WHAT GOD DOES TO GATHER MEN. They are
   straying and wandering about, but He gathers them. According to the
   text, Jesus says, "How often would I have gathered your children
   together!" How did God gather those of us who have come to Him?

   He gathers us, first, by making Himself known to us. When we come to
   understand who He is and what He is, and know something of His love,
   tenderness and greatness, then we come to Him. Ignorance keeps us away
   from Him, but to know God and His Son, Jesus Christ, is eternal life!
   Therefore, I diligently urge you to study the Scriptures and to be, as
   often as you can, hearing a faithful preacher of the Gospel, that,
   knowing the Lord, you may, by that knowledge, be drawn towards Him.
   These are the cords of love with which the Spirit of God draws men to
   Christ. He makes Christ known to us. He shows us Christ in the grandeur
   of His Divine and Human Nature, Christ in the humiliation of His
   sufferings, Christ in the Glory of His Resurrection, Christ in the love
   of His heart, in the power of His arm, in the efficacy of His plea, in
   the virtue of His blood and, as we learn these sacred lessons, we say,
   "That is the Christ for me, that is the God for me"--and we are
   gathered unto Him.

   But God gathers many to Himself by the call of His servants. You see
   that of old, He sent His Prophets. Now, He sends His ministers. If God
   does not send us to you, we shall never gather you. If we come to you
   in our own name, we shall come in vain, but if the Lord has sent us,
   then He will bless us and our message will be made to you a means of
   gathering you to Christ. I would much rather cease to preach than be
   allowed to go on preaching but never to gather souls to God! I can
   truly say that I have no wish to say a pretty thing, or turn a period,
   or utter a nice figure of speech--I want to win your souls, to slay
   your sin, to do practical work for God with each man, each woman, each
   child who shall come into this Tabernacle--and I ask the prayers of
   God's people that it may be so! It is thus that God gathers men to
   Him-self--by the message which He gives to them through His servants.

   The Lord has, also, many other ways of calling men to Himself. You saw,
   this morning, [Sermon #2034, Volume 34--

   Peter's Restoration.] that Peter was called to repentance by the
   crowing of a cock,

   and the Lord can use a great many means of bringing sinners to Himself!
   Omnipotence has servants everywhere! And God can use every kind of
   agent, even though it appears most unsuitable, to gather together His
   own chosen ones. He has called some of you--He has called some of you
   who have not yet come to Him. The text says, "How often!" It does not
   tell us how often, but it puts it as a matter of wonder, "How often!"
   with a note of exclamation.

   Let me ask you how often has God called some of you? Conscience has
   whispered its message to the most of you. When you come to see men
   dying, if you talk seriously with them, they will sometimes tell you
   that they are unprepared, but that they have often trembled and been
   suspicions. They have long suffered from unrest and, sometimes, they
   have been, "almost persuaded." I should not think that there is a
   person in this place who has not been made, sometimes, to shake and
   tremble at the thought of the world to come! How often has it been so
   with you? "How often," says God, "would I have gathered you!"

   The Lord sometimes speaks to us, not so much by conscience, as by
   Providence. That death in the family, what a voice it was to us! When
   your mother died, when your poor father passed away, what a gathering
   time it seemed to be! You soon forgot all about it, but you did feel it
   then. Ah, my dear woman, when your babe was taken from your bosom, and
   the little coffin left the house, you remember how you felt? And you,
   father, when your prattling boy sang the Sunday school hymn to you on
   his dying bed and well-near broke your heart, then was the Lord going
   forth in His Providence to gather you! You were being gathered, but you
   were not willing to come. According to our text, you, "would

   not."

   It has not always been by death that the Lord has spoken to you, for
   you have had other calls. When you have been brought low, or have been
   out of employment. When, sometimes, a Christian friend has spoken to
   you. When you have read something in a tract, or paper which has
   compelled you to pull up and made you stand aghast for a while--has not
   all that had a reference to this text, "How often, how often, how often
   would I have gathered you?" God knocks many times at some men's doors.
   I know that there is a call of His which is effectual--oh, that you
   might hear it! But there are many other calls which come to men, of
   whom Christ says, "Many are called, but few are chosen." How often has
   He called you? I wish you would try and reckon up how often the
   Almighty God has come to you and spread out His warm wide wings--and
   yet this has been true--"I would have gathered you, but you were not
   willing."

   One more way in which God gathers men is by continuing to have patience
   with them and sending the same message to them. I am always afraid that
   you who hear me constantly will get to feel, "We have heard him so long
   and so often that he cannot say anything fresh." Why, did I not use to
   shake you, when first you heard me, and compel you to shed many tears
   in the early days of your coming to this house? And now--well, you can
   hear it all without a tremor--you are like the blacksmith's dog that
   goes to sleep while the sparks are flying from the anvil! Down in
   Southwark, at the place where they make the big boilers, a man has to
   get inside to hold the hammer while they are riveting. There is an
   awful noise-- the first time that a man goes in, he feels that he
   cannot stand it and that he will die! He loses his hearing, it is such
   a terrible din. But they tell me that after a while some have been
   known, even, to go to sleep while the men have been hammering!

   So it is in hearing the Gospel--men grow hardened and that which was,
   at one time, a very powerful call--seems to be, at the last, no call at
   all. Yet, here you are and your hair is getting gray! Here you are, you
   have long passed the prime of life! Here you are, you were in a
   shipwreck, once, or you had an accident, or you caught the fever, but
   you did not die, and here you are! God still speaks to you, not saying,
   "Go," but, "Come, come!" Christ has not yet said to you, "Depart, you
   cursed," but He still cries, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest." This is how God calls and how
   He gathers men by the pertinacity of His infinite compassion, in still
   inviting them to come unto Him that they may obtain eternal life!

   III. Well, now, a third point, and a very important one is this--WHAT
   MEN NEED TO MAKE THEM COME TO GOD. According to the text, God gathers
   men--but what is needed on their part? Our Savior said of those that
   rejected him, "You would not."

   What is needed is, first, the real will to come to God. You have heard
   a great deal, I dare say, about the wonderful faculty of free will. I
   have already told you my opinion of free will, but it also happens that
   that is the very thing that is needed--a will towards that which is
   good. There is where the sinner fails! What he needs is a real will.
   "Oh, yes!" men say, "we are willing, we are willing." But you are not
   willing! If we can get the real Truth of God, you are not willing.
   There is no true willingness in your hearts, for a true willingness is
   a practical willingness. The man who is willing to come to Christ says,
   "I must do away with my sins, I must do away with my self-righteousness
   and I must seek Him who, alone, can save me."

   Men talk about being willing to be saved and dispute about free will,
   but when it comes to actual practice, they are not willing. They have
   no heart to repent. They will to keep on with their sin. They will to
   continue in their self-righteousness, but they do not will, with any
   practical resolve, to come to Christ! There is need of an immediate
   will. Every unconverted person here is willing to come to Christ before
   he dies--I have never met a person, yet, who was not! But are you
   willing to come to Christ now? That is the point. "Today, if you will
   hear His voice, harden not your hearts." But you answer, "Our hearts
   are not hardened! We only ask for a little more time." A little more
   time for what? A little more time in which to go on rebelling against
   God? A little more time in which to run the awful risk of eternal
   destruction?

   So, you see, it is a real will and an immediate will that is needed.

   With some, it is a settled will that is needed. Oh, yes, they are
   ready! They feel as soon as the preacher begins to speak. They are
   impressed during the singing of the first hymn. There is a revival
   service and after the meeting they begin telling you what they have
   felt. Look at those people on Wednesday. They have got over Monday and
   Tuesday with some little "rumblings of heart"--but what about
   Wednesday? They are as cold as a cucumber! Every feeling that they had
   on Sunday is gone from them! They have no memory of it, whatever! Their
   goodness is as the morning cloud and, as the early

   dew, it passes away. How some people deceive us with their good
   resolves, in which there is nothing at all, for there is no settled
   will!

   With others, what is lacking is a submissive will. Yes, they are
   willing to be saved, but then they do not want to be saved by Grace.
   They are not willing to give themselves up, altogether, to the Savior.
   They will not renounce their own righteousness and submit themselves to
   the righteousness of Christ. Well, that practically means that there is
   not any willingness at all, for unless you accept God's way of
   salvation, it is no use for you to talk about your will! Here is the
   great evil that is destroying you and that will destroy you before
   long, and land you in Hell--"You would not, you were not willing." Oh,
   that God's Grace might come upon you, subduing and renewing your will,
   and making you willing in the day of His power!

   IV. My last point is a very solemn one. I shall not weary you with it.
   WHAT WILL BECOME OF MEN WHO ARE NOT GATHERED TO CHRIST? What will
   become of men of whom it continues to be said, "You would not?"

   The text suggests to us two ways of answering the question. What
   becomes of chicks that do not come to the shelter of the hen's wings?
   What becomes of chicks that are not gathered to the hen? Well, the hawk
   devours some and the cold nips others--they miss the warmth and comfort
   that they might have had. That is something. If there were no
   hereafter, I should like to be a Christian. If I had to die like a dog,
   the joy I find in Christ would make me wish to be His follower. You are
   losers in this world if you love not God! You are losers of peace,
   comfort, strength and hope, even now! But what will be your loss,
   hereafter, with no wings to cover you when the Destroying Angel is
   abroad, no feathers beneath which you may hide when the dread
   thunderbolts of Justice shall be launched, one after another, from
   God's right hand? You have no shelter and, consequently, no safety--

   "He that has made his refuge God, Shall find a most secure abode," but
   he who has not that refuge shall be among the great multitude who will
   call to the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them, to hide them
   from the face of Him that sits upon the Throne, and from the wrath of
   the Lamb! O Sirs, I pray you, run not the awful risk of attempting to
   live without the shelter of God in Christ Jesus!

   But the text suggests a second question, What became of Jerusalem in
   the end? "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered your
   children together, but you were not willing!" Well, what happened to
   Jerusalem, after all? I invite you who are without God, and without
   Christ, to read Josephus, with the hope that he may be of service to
   you. What became of the inhabitants of that guilty city of Jerusalem?
   Well, they crucified the Lord of Glory and they hunted out His
   disciples, and yet they said to themselves, "We live in the City of
   God, no harm can come to us! We have the Temple within our walls and
   God will guard His own Holy Place." But very soon they tried to throw
   off the Roman yoke and there were different sets of zealots who
   determined to fight against the Romans. But they murmured and
   complained and began to fight among themselves.

   Before the Romans attacked Jerusalem, the inhabitants had begun to kill
   one another! The city was divided by the various factions. Three
   parties took possession of different portions of the place and they
   fought against one another, night and day. This is what happens to
   ungodly men--manhood breaks loose against itself. And when there are
   inward contentions--one part of man's soul fighting against another
   part--there is an internal war of the most horrible kind! What is the
   poor wretch to do, who is at enmity with himself, one part of his
   nature saying, "Go," another part crying, "Go back," and yet a third
   part shouting, "Stop where you are"? Are there not many of you who are
   just like battlefields trampled with the hoofs of horses, torn up with
   the ruts made by the cannon wheels and stained with blood? Many a man's
   heart is just like that. "Rest?" he says, "that has gone from me long
   ago."

   Look at him in the morning after a drinking bout. Look at him after he
   has been quarrelling with everybody. Look at the man who has been
   unfaithful to his wife, or that other man who has been dishonest to his
   employer, or that other who is gambling away all that he has. Why, how
   does he sleep, poor wretch? He does not rest. He dreams, he starts, he
   is always in terror. I would not change places with him, no, not for
   five minutes! The depths of poverty and an honest conscience are
   immeasurably superior to the greatest luxury in the midst of sin! The
   man who is evidently without God begins to quarrel with himself.

   By-and-by, one morning, they who looked over the battlements of
   Jerusalem cried, "The Romans are coming, in very deed they are marching
   up towards the city!" Vespasian came with an army of 60,000 men and,
   after a while, Titus

   had thrown up mounds round about the city so that no one could come in
   or go out of it! He had surrounded it so completely that they were all
   shut in. It was, as you remember, at the time of the Passover, when the
   people had come from every part of the land--a million and more of
   them--and he shut them all up in that little city. So, a time comes,
   with guilty men, when they are shut up. This sometimes happens before
   they die. They are shut up, they cannot have any pleasure in sin as
   they used to have--and they have no hope. They seem altogether cooped
   up. They have not been gathered by God's love, but now, at last, they
   are gathered by an avenging conscience--they are shut up in God's
   Justice.

   I shall never forget being sent for, in my early days, to see a man who
   was dying. As I entered the room, he greeted me with an oath. I was
   only a youth, a pastor about seventeen and a half years of age, and he
   somewhat staggered me. He would not lie down on his bed. He defied God.
   He said he would not die. "Shall I pray for you? "I asked. I knelt down
   and I had not uttered many sentences before he cursed me in such
   dreadful language that I jumped to my feet. And then, again, he cried
   and begged me to pray with him again, though it was not any good. He
   said, "It is no use. Your prayer will never be heard for me, I am
   already damned!" And the poor wretch spoke as though he really were so,
   and were realizing it in his own soul. I tried to persuade him to lie
   down upon his bed. It was of no use. He tramped up and down the room as
   fast as he could go. He knew that he would die, but he could not die
   while he could keep on walking, and so he kept on.

   Then again I must pray with him and then would come another awful burst
   of blasphemy because it was not possible that the prayer would be
   heard. It does not often happen that one sees a person quite as bad as
   that, but there is a condition of heart that is not so visible, but
   which is quite as sad, and which comes to men dying without Christ.
   They are shut up. The Roman soldiers are, as it were, marching all
   round the city, and there is no escape--and they begin to feel it and
   so they die in despair.

   But then, when the Roman soldiers did come, the woes of Jerusalem did
   not end. There was a famine in the city, a famine so dreadful that what
   Moses said was fulfilled, and the tender and delicate women ate the
   fruit of her own body. They came to search the houses because they
   thought there was food, there, and a woman brought out half of her own
   babe, and said, "Well, eat that, if you can," and throughout the city,
   they fed upon one another and oh, when there is no God in the heart,
   what a famine it makes in a man's soul! How he longs for a something
   which he cannot find and that all the world cannot give him--even a
   mouthful to stay the ravenousness of his spirit's hunger!

   And this doom will be still worse in the next world! You know that
   Jerusalem was utterly destroyed--not one stone was left upon
   another--and this is what is to happen to you if you refuse your
   Savior! You will be destroyed. You will be an eternal ruin. No Temple
   of God, but an everlasting ruin. Destroyed--that is the punishment for
   you. Destroyed from the Presence of the Lord and the Glory of His power
   and so, living forever with no indwelling God, no hope, no comfort! How
   terrible will be your doom unless you repent!--

   "You sinners, seek His Grace Whose wrath you cannot bear! Fly to the
   shelter of His Cross, And find salvation there!"

   I pray you do so, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW23229-39; 24:1-21.

   Matthew 23:29-31. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
   Because you build the tombs of the Prophets and garnish the sepulchers
   of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers,
   we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
   Prophets. Therefore you are witnesses unto yourselves, that you are the
   children of them which killed the Prophets. They talk in the same
   conceited manner and they claim self-righteousness, as their fathers
   did! And if their ancestors killed the Prophets, these men garnish
   their sepulchers, and so are sharers in their forefathers' deeds. How
   often it happens that men say they would not have done such crimes as
   others have committed--but they do not know the vileness of their own
   hearts! If they were under the same conditions as others, they would
   act in the same way. It would have been a better sign if the scribes
   and Pharisees had lamented before God that they, themselves, were not
   treating His Prophets as they ought to be treated. How very faithful
   was our Master! He was very tender in spirit, but still, He

   spoke very severely. The old proverb says that, "a good surgeon often
   cuts deeply," and so it was with the Lord Jesus Christ. He did not film
   the evil matter over! He lanced the wound. He is not the most loving
   who speaks the smoothest words. True love often compels an honest man
   to say that which pains him far more than it affects his callous
   hearers.

   32, 33. Fill you up, then, the measure of your fathers. You serpents,
   you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of Hell?
   This is Christ's utterance, let me remind you. Our modern preachers
   would not talk like this, even to scribes and Pharisees who were
   crucifying Christ afresh and putting Him to an open flame! They would
   search the dictionary through to find very smooth and pretty words to
   say to Christ's enemies! We are not of their way of thinking and
   speaking, nor shall we be while we desire to follow in the footsteps of
   our Lord!

   34. Therefore, behold, I send unto you Prophets, and wise men, and
   scribes: and some ofthem you shall kill and crucify; and some of them
   shall you scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to
   city. Which they did--the servants of Christ were thus worried and
   harried all over the land.

   35, 36. That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
   earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias,
   son of Barachias, whom you slew between the Temple and the altar.
   Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
   generation. So they did. The destruction of Jerusalem was more terrible
   than anything that the world had ever witnessed, either before or
   since. There must have been nearly a million and a quarter of people
   killed during that terrible siege and even Titus, when he saw the awful
   carnage, said, "What must be the folly of this people that they drive
   me to such work as this? Surely, the hand of an avenging God must be in
   it." Truly, the blood of the martyrs slain in Jerusalem was amply
   avenged when the whole city became a veritable Aceldama, or field of
   blood.

   37, 38. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You that kill the Prophets, and stone
   them which are sent unto you, how often would I have gathered your
   children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
   and you were not willing! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
   What a picture of pity and disappointed love the King's face must have
   presented when, with flowing tears, He spoke these words! It was the
   utterance of the righteous Judge, choked with emotion. Jerusalem was
   too far gone to be rescued from its self-sought doom and its guilt was
   about to culminate in the death of the Son of God!

   39. For I say unto you, You shall not see Me henceforth, till you shall
   say, Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord.

   Matthew 24:1. And Jesus went out and departed from the Temple: and His
   disciples came to Him for to show Him the buildings of the Temple. Ah,
   me, the rejected King took but slight interest in the Temple of which
   His disciples thought so much. To them the appearance was glorious, but
   to their Lord it was a sad sight. His Father's House, which ought to
   have been a House of Prayer for all nations, had become a den of
   thieves and soon would be utterly destroyed.

   2. And Jesus said unto them, See you not all these things? Verily I say
   unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that
   shall not be thrown down. And it was so. Josephus tells us that Titus,
   at first, tried to save the Temple, even after it was set on fire, but
   his efforts were of no use and, at last, he gave orders that the whole
   city and Temple should be leveled, except a small portion reserved for
   the garrison. Yet the stones of the Temple were such as men very seldom
   see, so exceedingly great. They looked as if, once in their place, they
   would stand there throughout eternity--but all are gone, according to
   our Lord's prophecy.

   2. And as He sat upon the mount of Olives. The little procession
   continued ascending the Mount of Olives until Jesus reached a resting
   place from which He could see the Temple.

   3. The disciples came unto Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall
   these things be? And what shall be the sign of Your coming, and of the
   end of the world? There are, here, two distinct questions, perhaps
   three. The disciples enquired, first, about the time of the destruction
   of the Temple, and then about the sign of Christ's coming and of "the
   consummation of the age," as it is in the margin of the Revised
   Version. The answers of Jesus contained much that was mysterious and
   that could only be fully understood as that which He foretold actually
   occurred. He told His disciples some things which related to the siege
   of Jerusalem, some which concerned His Second Advent and some which
   would immediately precede "the end of the world." When we have clearer
   light, we may possibly perceive that all our Savior's predictions on
   this memorable occasion had some connection with all three of these
   great events.

   4. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive
   you. Jesus was always practical. The most important thing for His
   disciples was not that they might know when, "these things," would be,
   but that they might be preserved from the peculiar evils of the time.

   5. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
   deceive many. And they did. A large number of impostors came forward
   before the destruction of Jerusalem, proclaiming that they were
   Messiahs.

   6. And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. And they did. The
   armies of Rome were soon, after this, on their way to the doomed city.

   6-8. See that you are not troubled: for all these things must come to
   pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and
   kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences,
   and earthquake, in divers places. All these are the beginning of
   sorrows. One would think that there was sorrow enough in famines,
   pestilences and earthquakes in divers places--but our Lord said that
   all these were only, "the beginning of sorrows"--the first birth-pangs
   of the travail that must precede His coming, either to Jerusalem or to
   the whole world.

   9-14. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
   you: and you shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake. And then
   shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate
   one another. And many false Prophets shall rise and shall deceive many.
   And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But
   he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this
   Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness
   unto all nations; and then shall the end come. But as for this
   destruction of Jerusalem, the Savior gave them clear warning.

   15,16. When you, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation,
   spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, stand in the Holy Place, (whoso reads,
   let him understand), then let them which are in Judeaflee into the
   mountains. As soon as Christ's disciples saw "the abomination of
   desolation," that is, the Roman ensigns with their idolatrous emblems,
   stand in the Holy Place, they knew that the time for them to escape had
   arrived and they did "flee into the mountains." You will say to me,
   perhaps, "but there were Romans there, before." Yes, the Romans were in
   possession, but the eagles and other idolatrous symbols were never
   exhibited in Jerusalem. The Romans were often very lenient to the
   different people whom they subdued and these symbols were kept out of
   sight until the last war came. But, wherever the Jews and Christians
   looked and they could see those various images of Caesar and of the
   Roman state which were worshipped by the soldiers--then were the
   faithful to flee to the mountains. It is a remarkable fact that no
   Christians perished in the siege of Jerusalem--the followers of Christ
   fled away to the mountain city of Pella, in Perea, where they were
   preserved from the general destruction which overthrew the unbelieving
   Jews!

   17, 18. Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything
   out of his house: neither let him which is in the field return back to
   take his clothes. They were to flee in all haste, the moment they saw
   the Roman standards,

   19-21. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
   suck in those days! But pray you that your plight be not in the winter,
   neither on the Sabbath Day: for then shall be great tribulation, such
   at was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever
   shall be. You and I would have believed that all this came true without
   any confirmation from outside history, but it was very remarkable that
   God should raise up the Jew, Josephus, and put it into his mind to
   write a record of the siege of Jerusalem--which curdles the blood of
   everyone who reads it--and bears out exactly the statement of the
   Master that there was to be "great tribulation, such as was not since
   the beginning of the world, no, nor ever shall be."

The Holy Spirit's Chief Office

   (No. 2382)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 14, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY
   26, 1888.

   "He shall glorify Me: for He shall take of Mine, and shall show it to
   you. All things that the Father has are Mine: therefore said I, that He
   shall take of Mine and shall show it to you." John 16:14,15.

   IT is the chief office of the Holy Spirit to glorify Christ. He does
   many things, but this is what He aims at in all of them--to glorify
   Christ. Brothers and Sisters, what the Holy Spirit does must be right
   for us to imitate! Therefore, let us endeavor to glorify Christ. To
   what higher ends can we devote ourselves, than to something to which
   God the Holy Spirit devotes Himself? Be this, then, your continual
   prayer, "Blessed Spirit, help me to always glorify the Lord Jesus
   Christ!"

   Observe that the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ by showing to us the
   things of Christ. It is a great marvel that there should be any Glory
   given to Christ by showing Him to such poor creatures as we are! What?
   To make us see Christ-- does that glorify Him? For our weak eyes to
   behold Him, for our trembling hearts to know Him and to love Him--does
   this glorify Him? It is even so, for the Holy Spirit chooses this as
   His principal way of glorifying the Lord Jesus. He takes of the things
   of Christ, not to show them to angels, not to write them in letters of
   fire across the brow of night, but to show them to us! Within the
   little temple of a sanctified heart, Christ is praised, not so much by
   what we do, or think, as by what we see. This puts great value upon
   meditation, upon the study of God's Word, and upon silent thought under
   the teaching of the Holy Spirit, for Jesus says, "He shall glorify Me:
   for He shall take of Mine, and shall show it to you."

   Here is a Gospel word at the very outset of our sermon! Poor sinner,
   conscious of your sin, it is possible for Christ to be glorified by His
   being shown to you! If you look to Him, if you see Him to be a suitable
   Savior, an all-sufficient Savior. If your mind's eye takes Him in. If
   He is effectually shown to you by the Holy Spirit, He is thereby
   glorified! Sinner as you are, unworthy, apparently, to become the arena
   of Christ's Glory, yet shall you be a temple in which the King's Glory
   shall be revealed and your poor heart, like a mirror, shall reflect His
   Grace--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, With all Your quickening powers" and
   show Christ to the sinner, that Christ may be glorified in the sinner's
   salvation!

   If that great work of Grace is really done at the beginning of the
   sermon, I shall not mind, even, if I never finish it! God the Holy
   Spirit will have worked more without me than I could possibly have
   worked myself, and to the Triune Jehovah shall be all the praise! Oh,
   that the name of Christ may be glorified in every one of you! Has the
   Holy Spirit shown you Christ, the Sin-Bearer, the one Sacrifice for
   sin, exalted on high, to give repentance and remission? If so, then the
   Holy Spirit has glorified Christ, even in you!

   Now, proceeding to examine the text a little in detail, my first
   observation upon it is this--the Holy Spirit is our Lord's Glorifier.
   "He shall glorify Me." Secondly, Christ's own things are His best
   Glory. "He shall glorify Me: for He shall take of Mine, and shall show
   it to you." And, thirdly, Christ's Glory is His Father's Glory. "All
   things that the Father has are Mine: therefore said I, that He shall
   take of Mine, and shall show it to you."

   I. To begin, then, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS OUR LORD'S GLORIFIER. I want you
   to keep this Truth of God in your mind and never to forget it--that
   which does not glorify Christ is not of the Holy Spirit, and that which
   is of the Holy Spirit invariably glorifies our Lord Jesus Christ!

   First, then, have an eye to this Truth in all comforts. If a comfort
   which you think you need and which appears to you to be very sweet,
   does not glorify Christ, look very suspiciously upon it. If, in
   conversing with an apparently religious man, he prates about truth
   which he says is comforting, but which does not honor Christ, do not
   have anything to do with it! It is a poisonous sweet--it may charm you
   for a moment, but it will ruin your soul forever if you partake of it.
   But blessed are those comforts which smell of Christ, those
   consolations in which there is a fragrance of myrrh, aloes and cassia,
   out of the King's palace--the comfort drawn from His Person, from His
   work, from His blood, from the Resurrection, from His Glory--the
   comfort directly fetched from that sacred spot where He trod the
   winepress alone! This is wine of which you may drink, forget your
   misery and be unhappy no more!

   But always look with great suspicion upon any comfort offered to you,
   either as a sinner or a saint, which does not come distinctly from
   Christ. Say, "I will not be comforted till Jesus comforts me. I will
   refuse to lay aside my despondency until He removes my sin. I will not
   go to Mr. Civility, or Mr. Legality, for the unloading of my burden. No
   hands shall ever lift the load of conscious sin from off my heart but
   those that were nailed to the Cross, when Jesus, Himself, bore my sins
   in His own body on the tree." Please carry this Truth of God with you
   wherever you go as a kind of spiritual litmus paper by which you may
   test everything that is presented to you as a cordial or comfort. If it
   does not glorify Christ, let it not console or please you!

   In the next place, have an eye to this Truth of God in all ministries.
   There are many ministries in the world and they are very diverse from
   one another, but this Truth will enable you to judge which is right out
   of them all. That ministry which makes much of Christ, is of the Holy
   Spirit, but that ministry which decries Him, ignores Him, or puts Him
   in the background in any degree, is not of the Spirit of God! Any
   doctrine which magnifies man, but not man's Redeemer. Any doctrine
   which denies the depth of the Fall and, consequently, derogates from
   the greatness of salvation. Any doctrine which makes sin less and,
   therefore, makes Christ's work less--away with it, away with it! This
   shall be your infallible test as to whether it is of the Holy Spirit or
   not, for Jesus says, "He shall glorify Me." It were better to speak
   five words to the Glory of Christ, than to be the greatest orator who
   ever lived and to neglect or dishonor the Lord Jesus Christ!

   We, my Brothers, who are preachers of the Word, have but a short time
   to live. Let us dedicate all that time to the glorious work of
   magnifying Christ! Longfellow says, in his Psalm of Life, that, "Art is
   long," but longer, still, is the great art of lifting up the Crucified
   before the eyes of the sin-bitten sons of men. Let us keep to that one
   employment! If we have but this one string upon which we can play, we
   may discourse such music on it as would ravish angels and will save
   men! Therefore, again I say, let us keep to that alone! Cornet, flute,
   harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer and all kinds of music are for
   Nebuchadnezzar's golden image, but as for our God, our one harp is
   Christ Jesus! We will touch every string of that wondrous instrument,
   even though it is with trembling fingers--and marvelous shall be the
   music we shall evoke from it!

   All ministries, therefore, must be subjected to this test--if they do
   not glorify Christ, they are not of the Holy Spirit.

   We should also have an eye to this Truth in all religious movements and
   judge them by this standard. If they are of the Holy Spirit, they
   glorify Christ. There are great movements in the world, every now and
   then, and we are inclined to look upon them hopefully, for any stir is
   better than stagnation. But, by-and-by, we begin to fear, with a holy
   jealousy, what their effects will be. How shall we judge them? To what
   test shall we put them? Always to this test--does this movement glorify
   Christ? Is Christ preached? Then, therein, I rejoice, yes, and will
   rejoice! Are men pointed to Christ? Then this is the ministry of
   salvation! Is He preached as First and Last? Are men bid to be
   justified by faith in Him and then to follow Him, and copy His Divine
   example? It is well! I do not believe that any man ever lifted up the
   Cross of Christ in a hurtful way. If it is but the Cross that is seen,
   it is the sight of the Cross, not of the hands that lift it, that will
   bring salvation. Some modern movements are heralded with great noise
   and some come quietly, but if they glorify Christ, it is well.

   But, dear Friends, if it is some new theory that is propounded. If it
   is some old error revived. If it is something very glittering and
   fascinating and, for a while it bears the multitudes away, think
   nothing of it. Unless it glorifies Christ, it is not for you and me.
   "Aliquid Christi," as one of the old fathers said, "Anything of
   Christ," and I love it! But nothing of Christ, or something against
   Christ--and it may be very fine and flowery, and it may be very
   fascinating and charming, highly poetical, and in consonance with the
   spirit of the age--but we say of it, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity
   where there is no Christ!" Where He is lifted up there is all that is
   needed for the salvation of a guilty race! Judge every move-

   ment, then, not by those who adhere to it, nor by those who admire and
   praise it, but by this Word of our Lord, "He shall glorify Me." The
   Spirit of God is not in it if it does not glorify Christ!

   Once again, Brothers, I pray you, eye this Truth of God when you are
   under a sense of great weakness--physical, mental, or spiritual. You
   have finished preaching a sermon, you have completed a round with your
   tracts, or you have ended your Sunday school work for another Sabbath.
   You say to yourself, "I fear that I have done very poorly." You groan
   as you go to your bed because you think that you have not glorified
   Christ. It is as well that you should groan if that is the case. I will
   not forbid it, but I will relieve the bitterness of your distress by
   reminding you that it is the Holy Spirit who is to glorify Christ--"He
   shall glorify Me." If I preach and the Holy Spirit is with me, Christ
   will be glorified! But if I were able to speak with the tongues of men
   and of angels, but without the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ would
   not be glorified. Sometimes our weakness may even help to make way for
   the greater display of the might of God. If so, we may glory in
   infirmity, that the power of Christ may rest upon us! It is not merely
   we, who speak, but the Spirit of the Lord who speaks by us.

   There is a sound of abundance of rain outside the Tabernacle--would God
   that there were also the sound of abundance of rain within our hearts!
   May the Holy Spirit come at this moment and come at all times whenever
   His servants are trying to glorify Christ--and do, Himself, what must
   always be His own work! How can you and I glorify anybody, much less
   glorify Him who is infinitely glorious? But the Holy Spirit, being,
   Himself, the glorious God, can glorify the glorious Christ! It is a
   work worthy of God and it shows us, when we think of it, the absolute
   need of our crying to the Holy Spirit that He would take us in His
   hands and use us as a workman uses his hammer. What can a hammer do
   without the hand that grasps it? And what can we do without the Spirit
   of God?

   I will make only one more observation upon this first point. If the
   Holy Spirit is to glorify Christ, I beg you to have an eye to the Truth
   of God amid all oppositions, controversies and contentions. If we,
   alone, had the task of glorifying Christ, we might be beaten. But as
   the Holy Spirit is the Glorifier of Christ, His Glory is in very safe
   hands. "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?"
   The Holy Spirit is still to the front! The eternal purpose of God to
   set His King upon the Throne and to make Jesus Christ reign forever and
   ever must be fulfilled, for the Holy Spirit has undertaken to see it
   accomplished! Amidst the surging tumults of the battle, the result of
   the conflict is never in doubt for a moment! It may seem as though the
   fate of Christ's cause hung in a balance and that the scales were in
   equilibrium, but it is not so. The glory of Christ never wanes--it must
   increase from day to day as it is made known in the hearts of men by
   the Holy Spirit! And the day shall come when Christ's praise shall go
   up from all human tongues. To Him every knee shall bow and every tongue
   shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the
   Father! Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and confirm the
   feeble knees. If you have failed to glorify Christ by your speech as
   you should, there is Another who has done it and who will still do it,
   according to Christ's words, "He shall glorify Me." My text seems to be
   a silver bell, ringing sweet comfort into the dispirited worker's ears,
   "He shall glorify Me."

   That is the first point--the Holy Spirit is our Lord's Glorifier. Keep
   that Truth of God before your mind's eye under all circumstances.

   II. Now, secondly, CHRIST'S OWN THINGS ARE HIS BEST GLORY. When the
   Holy Spirit wants to glorify Christ, what does He do? He does not go
   abroad for anything--He comes to Christ, Himself, for that which will
   be for Christ's own Glory--"He shall glorify Me: for He shall take of
   Mine, and shall show it to you." There can be no Glory added to Christ!
   It must be His own Glory which He has, already, which is made more
   apparent to the hearts of God's chosen by the Holy Spirit!

   First of all, Christ needs no new inventions to glorify Him. "We have
   struck out a new line of things," says one. Have you? "We have
   discovered something very wonderful." I dare say you have, but Christ,
   the same yesterday, today and forever, needs none of your inventions,
   or discoveries, or additions to His Truth. A plain Christ is always the
   loveliest Christ. Dress Him up and you have deformed Him and defamed
   Him. Bring Him out just as He is--the Christ of God, nothing else but
   Christ, unless you bring in His Cross--for we preach Christ Crucified!
   Indeed, you cannot have the Christ without the Cross, but preach Christ
   Crucified and you have given Him all the Glory that He wants. The Holy
   Spirit does not reveal in these last times any fresh ordinances, or any
   novel doctrines, or any new evolutions--He simply brings to mind the
   things which Christ, Himself, spoke, He brings Christ's own things to
   us and, in that was, glorifies

   Him!

   Think for a minute of Christ's Person as revealed to us by the Holy
   Spirit. What can more glorify Him than for us to see His Person, very
   God of very God, and yet as truly Man? What a wondrous Being, as Human
   as ourselves, but as Divine as God! Was there ever another like He?
   Never!

   Think of His Incarnation, His birth at Bethlehem. There was greater
   Glory among the oxen in the stall than ever was seen where those born
   in marble halls were swathed in purple and fine linen! Was there ever
   another Baby like Christ? Never! I wonder not that the wise men fell
   down to worship Him!

   Look at His life, the standing wonder of all ages! Men who have not
   worshipped Him, have admired Him. His life is incomparable,
   unique--there is nothing like it in all the history of mankind!
   Imagination has never been able to invent anything approximating to the
   perfect beauty of the life of Jesus Christ!

   Think of His death. There have been many heroic and martyr deaths, but
   there is not one that can be set side by side with Christ's death. He
   did not pay the debt of nature as others do, and yet He paid our
   nature's debt. He did not die because He must--He died because He
   would. The only "must" that came upon Him was a necessity of
   all-conquering love. The Cross of Christ is the greatest wonder of fact
   or of fiction! Fiction invents many marvelous things, but nothing that
   can be looked at for a moment in comparison with the Cross of Christ!

   Think of our Lord's Resurrection. If this is one of the things that are
   taken and shown to you by the Holy Spirit, it will fill you with holy
   delight! I am sure that I could go into that sepulcher, where John and
   Peter went, and spend a lifetime in reverencing Him who broke down the
   barriers of the tomb and made it a passageway to Heaven. Instead of
   being a dungeon and a cul-de-sac into which all men seemed to go, but
   none could ever come out, Christ has, by His Resurrection, made a
   tunnel right through the grave! Jesus, by dying, has killed death for
   all Believers!

   Then think of His Ascension. But why need I take you over all these
   scenes with which you are blessedly familiar? What a wondrous fact that
   when the cloud received Him out of the disciples' sight, the angels
   came to convoy Him to His heavenly Home!--

   "They brought His chariot from above To bear Him to His Throne! Clapped
   their triumphant wings and cried, 'The glorious work is done.'"

   Think of Him, now, at His Father's right hand, adored of all the
   heavenly host, and then let your mind fly forward to the glory of His
   Second Advent, the final judgment with its terrible terrors, the
   millennium with its indescribable bliss and the Heaven of heavens, with
   its endless and unparalleled splendor! If these things are shown to you
   by the Holy Spirit, the beatific visions will, indeed, glorify Christ,
   and you will sit down and sing with the blessed Virgin, "My soul does
   magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God, my Savior."

   Thus you see that the things which glorify Christ are all in
   Christ--the Holy Spirit fetches nothing from abroad, but He takes of
   the things of Christ and shows them to us. The glory of kings lies in
   their silver and their gold, their silk and their gems, but the Glory
   of Christ lies in Himself! If we want to glorify a man, we bring him
   presents. If we wish to glorify Christ, we must accept presents from
   Him. Thus we take the cup of salvation, calling upon the name of the
   Lord, and in so doing we glorify Christ!

   Notice, next, that these things of Christ are too bright for us to see
   till the Spirit shows them to us. We cannot see them because of their
   excessive Glory, until the Holy Spirit tenderly reveals them to us,
   until He takes of the things of Christ and shows them to us.

   What does this mean? Does it not mean, first, that He enlightens our
   understandings? It is wonderful how the Holy Spirit can take a fool and
   make him know the wonders of Christ's dying love. And He does make him
   know it very quickly when He begins to teach him. Some of us have been
   very slow learners, yet the Holy Spirit has been able to teach
   something, even, to us! He opens the Scriptures and He also opens our
   minds--and when there are these two openings, together, what a
   wonderful opening it is! It becomes like a new revelation--the first is
   the revelation of the letter, which we have in the Book--the second is
   the revelation of the Spirit, which we get in our own spirit. O my dear
   Friend, if the Holy Spirit has ever enlightened your understanding, you
   know what it is for Him to show the things of Christ to you!

   But next, He does this by a work upon the whole soul. I mean this. When
   the Holy Spirit convinces us of sin, we become fitted to see Christ and
   so the blessed Spirit shows Christ to us. When we are conscious of our
   feebleness, then we see

   Christ's strength, and thus the Holy Spirit shows Him to us. Often, the
   operations of the Spirit of God may seem not to be directly the showing
   of Christ to us, but as they prepare us for seeing Him, they are a part
   of the work.

   The Holy Spirit sometimes shows Christ to us by His power of vivifying
   the Truth of God. I do not know whether I can quite tell you what I
   mean, but I have, sometimes, seen a Truth of God differently from what
   I have ever seen it before. I knew it long ago, I acknowledged it as
   part of the Divine Revelation, but now I realize it, grip it, grasp it,
   or, what is better, it seems to get a grip of me and hold me in its
   mighty hands! Have you not, sometimes, been overjoyed with a promise
   which never seemed anything to you before? Or a doctrine which you
   believed, but never fully appreciated, has suddenly become to you a gem
   of the first water, a very Kohinoor, or, "Fountain of Light"?

   The Holy Spirit has a way of focusing the Light of God and, when it
   falls in this special way upon a certain point, then the Truth is
   revealed to us. He shall take of the things of Christ and show them to
   you. Have you ever felt ready to jump for joy, ready to jump from your
   seat, ready to sit up in your bed at night and sing praises to God
   through the overpowering influence of some grand old Truth which has
   seemed to be, at once, quite new to you? The Holy Spirit also shows to
   us the things of Christ in our experience. As we journey on in life, we
   pass up hill and down dale, through bright sunlight and through dark
   shadows--and in each of these conditions we learn a little more of
   Christ, a little more of His Grace, a little more of His Glory, a
   little more of His sin-bearing, a little more of His glorious
   righteousness! Blessed is the life which is just one long lesson upon
   the Glory of Christ! And I think that is what every Christian life
   should be. "Every dark and bending line" in our experience should meet
   in the center of Christ's Glory and should lead us nearer and nearer to
   the power of enjoying the bliss at His right hand forever and ever.
   Thus the Holy Spirit takes of the things of Christ and shows them to
   us, and so glorifies Christ.

   Beloved, the practical lesson for us to learn is this--let us try to
   live under the influence of the Holy Spirit. To that end, let us think
   very reverently of Him. Some never think of Him at all. How many
   sermons there are without even an allusion to Him! Shame on the
   preachers of such discourses! If any hearers come without praying for
   the Holy Spirit, shame on such hearers! We know and we confess that He
   is everything to our spiritual life--then why do we not remember Him
   with greater love, worship Him with greater honor and think of Him
   continually with greater reverence? Beware of committing the sin
   against the Holy Spirit! If any of you feel any gentle touches of His
   power when you are hearing a sermon, beware lest you harden your heart
   against it! Whenever the sacred fire comes as but a spark, quench not
   the Holy Spirit, but pray that the spark may become a flame.

   And you, Christian people, cry to Him that you may not read your Bibles
   without His light. Do not pray without being helped by the Spirit.
   Above all, may you never preach without the Holy Spirit! It seems a
   pity when a man asks to be guided of the Spirit in His preaching--and
   then pulls out a manuscript and reads it! The Holy Spirit may bless
   what he reads, but He cannot very well guide him when he has tied
   himself down to what he has written! And it will be the same with the
   speaker if he only repeats what he has learned and leaves no room for
   the Spirit to give him a new thought, a fresh Revelation of Christ! How
   can he hope for the Divine blessing under such circumstances? Oh, it
   were better for us to sit still until some of us were moved by the
   Spirit to get up and speak, than for us to prescribe the methods by
   which He should speak to us and even to write down the very words we
   mean to utter! What room is there for the Spirit's operations then--

   "Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove," I cannot help breaking out into
   that prayer, "Blessed Spirit, abide with us! Take of the things of
   Christ and show them to us that Christ may be glorified."

   III. I am only going to speak a minute or two on the last point. It is
   a very deep one, much too deep for me. I am unable to take you into the
   depths of my text, I will not pretend to do so. I believe that there
   are meanings here which probably we shall never understand till we get
   to Heaven. "What you know not now, you shall know hereafter." But this

   is the point--CHRIST'S GLORY IS HIS FATHER'S GLORY--"All things that
   the Father has are Mine: therefore

   said I, that He shall take of Mine, and shall show it to you."

   First, Christ has all that the Father has. Think of that! No mere man
   dares to say, "All things that the Father has are mine." All the
   Godhead is in Christ--not only all the attributes of it, but the
   essence of it. The Nicene Creed well puts it and it is not too strong
   in the expression: "Light of Light, very God of very God," for Christ
   has all that the Father has. When we come to Christ, we come to
   Omnipotent, Omnipresent Omniscience--we come to Almighty
   Immutability--we

   come, in fact, to the eternal Godhead! The Father has all things and
   all power is given to Christ in Heaven and on earth, so that He has all
   that the Father has!

   And, further, the Father is glorified in Christ's Glory. Never let us
   fall into the false notion that if we magnify Christ, we are
   depreciating the Father. If any lips have ever spoken concerning the
   Christ of God so as to depreciate the God of Christ, let those lips be
   covered with shame! We never preached Christ as merciful and the Father
   as only just, or Christ as moving the Father to be gracious. That is a
   slander which has been cast upon us, but there is not an atom of truth
   in it! We have known and believed what Christ, Himself, said, "I and My
   Father are One." The more glorious Christ is, the more glorious the
   Father is--and when men, professedly Christians, begin to cast off
   Christ, they cast off God the Father to a large extent. Irreverence to
   the Son of God soon becomes irreverence to God the Father, Himself!
   But, dear Friends, we delight to honor Christ, and we will continue to
   do so. Even when we stand in the Heaven of heavens, before the burning
   Throne of the Infinite Jehovah, we will sing praises unto Him and unto
   the Lamb, putting the two evermore in that Divine conjunction in which
   they are always to be found!

   Thus, you see, Christ has all that the Father has, and when He is
   glorified, the Father, also, is glorified.

   Next, the Holy Spirit must lead us to see this, and I am sure that He
   will. If we give ourselves up to His teaching, we shall fall into no
   errors. It will be a great mystery, but we shall know enough so that it
   will never trouble us. If you sit down and try to study the mystery of
   the Eternal--well, I believe that the longer you look, the more you
   will be like persons who look into the sea from a great height, until
   they grow dizzy, and are ready to fall and to be drowned. Believe what
   the Spirit teaches you and adore your Divine Teacher--then shall His
   instruction become easy to you. I believe that as we grow older, we
   come to worship God as Abraham did, as Jehovah, the great I AM. Jesus
   does not fade into the background, but the glorious Godhead seems to
   become more and more apparent to us. Our Lord's Word to His disciples,
   "You believe in God, believe also in Me," as we grow older, seems to
   turn into this, "You believe in Me, believe also in God." And as we
   come to a full confidence in the glorious Lord, the God of Nature, and
   of Providence, and of Redemption, and of Heaven, the Holy Spirit gives
   us to know more of the glories of Christ!

   I have talked with you as well as I could upon this sublime theme and
   if I did not know that the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ, I would go
   home miserable, for I have not been able to glorify my Lord as I would.
   But I know that the Holy Spirit can take what I have said out of my
   very heart and can put it into your hearts--and He can add to it
   whatever I have omitted. Go, you who love the Lord, and glorify Him!
   Try to do it by your lips and by your lives. Go and preach Him, preach
   more of Him, and preach Him up higher, and higher, and higher!

   An old lady, of whom I have heard, made a mistake in what she said, yet
   there was a Truth behind her blunder. She had been to a little Baptist
   Chapel where a high Calvinist preached and, on coming away she said
   that she liked "High Calvary" preachers best. So do I! Give me a "High
   Calvary" preacher--one who will make Calvary the highest of all the
   mountains! I suppose it was not a hill at all, but only a mound. Still,
   let us lift it higher and higher, and say to all other hills, "Why leap
   you, you high hills? This is the hill which God desires to dwell in!
   Yes, the Lord will dwell in it forever." The Crucified Christ is wiser
   than all the wisdom of the world! The Cross of Christ has more novelty
   in it than all the fresh things of the earth! O Believers and preachers
   of the Gospel, glorify Christ! May the Holy Spirit help you to do so!

   And you, poor Sinners, who think that you cannot glorify Christ at all,
   come and trust Him--

   "Come naked, come filthy come just as you are," and believe that He
   will receive you, for that will glorify Him! Believe, even now, O
   Sinner at death's door, that Christ can make you live, and your faith
   will glorify Him! Look up out of the awful depths of Hell into which
   conscience has cast you and believe that He can pluck you out of the
   horrible pit, and out of the miry clay and set your feet upon a rock,
   and your trust will glorify Him! It is in the power of the sinner to
   give Christ the greatest Glory, if the Holy Spirit enables him to
   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. You may come, you who are more
   leprous, more diseased, more corrupt than any other! And if you look to
   Him and He saves you, oh, then you will praise Him!

   You will be of the mind of the one I have spoken of many times, who
   said to me, "Sir, you say that Christ can save me? Well, if He does, He
   shall never hear the last of it." No, and He never will hear the last
   of it! Blessed Jesus--

   "I will love You in life, I will love You in death And praise You as
   long as You lend me breath; And say when the death-dew lies cold on my
   brow, If ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now!

   In mansions of glory and endless delight,

   I'll ever adore You in Heaven so bright.

   I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,

   If ever I loved You, my Jesus, 'tis now." We will do nothing else but
   praise Christ and glorify Him, if He will but save us from sin! God
   grant that it may be so with all of us, for the Lord Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 16:1-16.

   Verse 1. These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be
   offended. Or, "made to stumble." Christ would not have you who are His
   people caused to stumble by anything that happens to you. He wants you
   to walk without tripping. His angels bear you up in their hands lest at
   any time you should dash your foot against a stone. He, Himself, as
   your Guardian, comes and speaks beforehand to let you know what is to
   occur to you, that you may not be caused to stumble by any fresh trial
   that may assail you.

   2. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that
   whoever kills you will think that he does God service. Christ's
   disciples were to expect opposition of the most cruel kind. They were
   to be put away from those with whom they had long worshipped. They were
   even to run the risk of losing their lives, but Jesus foretold what
   would happen to them, that they might not be stumbled at it. Such was
   their Lord's love to them that He would not have them attacked
   unawares. By His Grace they would hold on and hold out--they would
   persevere to the end, but there would have to be a struggle--and to
   help them in the fight, Jesus tells them all about it before it begins.
   We say, "Forewarned, forearmed." So the disciples were, and so are you.
   Your Lord tells you that you will not get to Heaven without trials--"In
   the world you shall have tribulation." And He tells you this that it
   may not surprise you when it comes--that it may not act upon you like a
   sudden gust of wind that would upset a little ship--but that you may
   just keep everything in trim looking for the storm to come. "These
   things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be caused to
   stumble."

   3. And these things will they do unto you because they have not known
   the Father, nor Me. The persecuting Jews professed to be worshippers of
   Jehovah, but they did not know the Christ, whom He sent and, therefore,
   in very truth they did not know the Father, either. How can you expect
   that those who do not know the Father will know the Son, or any of the
   other children of the Divine family? As they rejected the Elder
   Brother, will they not, also, reject the younger ones? Is the disciple
   to be above his Master, or the servant to be treated better than his
   Lord? Think not so and, therefore, expect that you will not be known,
   even as the Father and the Son were not known--

   "'Tis no surprising thing

   That we should be unknown!

   The Jewish world knew not their King,

   God's everlasting Son."

   4. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you
   may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto
   you at the beginning, because I was with you. Our Lord did tell His
   disciples something about, "these things." He warned them to expect
   opposition, but He did not dwell upon that theme. He did not expatiate
   upon it. He did not, at first, give that prominence to it which He was
   about to do, and He explains to His disciples why He had not talked
   much upon that topic--"because I was with you." It did not matter how
   they were opposed so long as He was with them. His society more than
   made up for anything they might have to suffer and, dear child of God,
   if you now enjoy the Presence of Christ, and the power of His Spirit,
   you need not mind what happens to you!

   5. 6. But now I go My way to Him that sent Me, and none of you asks Me,
   Where are You going? But because I have said these things unto you,
   sorrow has filled your heart. They were cast down because He was going
   away from them. Love awoke fear. It was a hard thing for them to have
   to miss Him--they could not tell what might happen to them when their
   Leader was gone from their midst. Do you wonder that they were filled
   with sorrow? Yet there was no real cause for grief--there was, rather,
   reason for rejoicing when they understood the true lesson of Christ's
   departure! There is no real cause for your sorrow, dear Friends. If you
   knew all things, you would rejoice exceedingly in that very thing that
   now most troubles you.

   7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go
   away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if
   I depart, I will send Him to you. And the Comforter is better for us
   than the personal Presence of Christ! We do not always think so, but it
   is true. It is better for the Church to have the Holy Spirit in the
   midst of her than for Christ to be here in His bodily Presence on the
   earth.

   8. And when He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of
   righteousness, and of judgement. The world is not as yet convinced, but
   it is convicted--though it does not acknowledge its guilt--there is
   more than sufficient evidence to prove it guilty in the sight of God.

   9. Of sin, because they believe not on Me. What must be the depth of
   human wickedness that sinners will not accept a Divine Savior? This is
   the crowning, crushing proof of human guilt--"They believe not on Me."

   10. Of righteousness, because I go to My Father, and you see Me no
   more. Christ was righteous, the Righteous One, whom men rejected, for
   He has gone up to the Father's side, where He could not have been if He
   had not perfected righteousness. The very going back of Christ to the
   Father's Throne proves that righteousness does exist and convicts men
   of sinning against it!

   11. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. The Gospel
   judges him and dethrones him and, as there has been a judgment of the
   world's king, so there will be a judgment of the world, itself.

   12. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
   Some teachers overload their hearers with the Truth of God till, I
   might truly say, that they pile on the agony. Truth which cannot be
   received is often most irksome and burdensome to the hearer. When the
   mind is not in a fit condition to bear any more instruction, it is
   cruel work to impose it. Our Lord Jesus did not so overburden His
   disciples--"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear
   them now."

   13. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you
   into all Truth: for He shall not speak of Himself. This is a very
   wonderful expression--"He shall not speak of Himself." We have plenty
   of men, nowadays, who boast that they do speak of or from
   themselves--that is to say, they profess to borrow from no one, not
   even from God! They are original thinkers, inventors! They bring forth
   fresh things out of the depth of their wonderful minds. But even the
   Holy Spirit is, here, said not to "speak of Himself."

   13. But whatever He shall hear, that shall He speak. That is just our
   business--to hear God's message and then to speak it--and if the Holy
   Spirit does this and if Jesus did it, we may also be glad to do the
   same! We are no inventors of great novelties--we are simply the bearers
   of the message of the Most High, the declarers of the old Truths of God
   which God has revealed to us.

   13-16. And He will show you things to come. He shall glorify Me: for He
   shall take of Mine, and shall show it to you. All things that the
   Father has are Mine: therefore said I, that He shall take of Mine, and
   shall show it to you. A little while, and you shall not see Me: and
   again, a little while, and you shall see Me, because I go to the
   Father. How wonderful this is! We are to see Jesus because He has gone
   to the Father! It looks as if that were a reason why we should not see
   Him, but we see Him better, by faith, now that He has gone to the
   Father, than we could have seen Him while He was here below covered
   with the veil of His humiliation! Yet it is hardly surprising that the
   disciples were puzzled by their Lord's words-- "A little while, and you
   shall not see Me: and again, a little while, and you shall see Me."
   And, "Because I go to the Father."

Seeing and Testifying

   (No. 2383)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 21,1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   29, 1888.

   "And we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the
   Savior of the world." 1 John 4:14.

   THERE are two things joined together in the text which must never be
   parted--"We have seen and testify." In the first place, never let any
   man testify what he has not seen. If you are not personally aware of
   it, do not tell it--it is the personality of the testimony that is the
   power of the testimony. That Truth of God which you have never
   experienced, you had better leave to somebody else to preach. This is
   the cause of the failure of a great many ministers--there is no
   personal conversion at the back of their ministry and, consequently, no
   Christian life within them. Their preaching is the testimony of a man
   who says that he heard such and such a thing and you know how a judge
   will stop a witness when he begins to say what others have told him.
   "No, no," he says, "what did you see, yourself, my good man? What do
   you know about this business on your own account? I do not want to know
   what others said to you about it." So is it with the message delivered
   from the pulpit--what is needed is that the preacher should bear
   testimony of what he has seen, tasted, felt and handled. When you try
   to bring others to Christ, you must do it by bearing witness of what
   Christ has done for you. If He has never done anything for
   you--personally for you--you cannot testify for Him and must not
   pretend to do so.

   In the next place, what you have seen you should testify. If you have
   seen those things for yourself, do what Mary did when she had seen the
   risen Christ--she ran to bring His disciples the news! What right have
   you to see for yourself, alone? No, no, tell the glad tidings! The
   Light of God is not put to your candle for the candle's sake, alone--it
   is that men may be enlightened by its beams. If you have received Light
   from God, let your Light so shine before men that they may see it and
   glorify God for it! I am afraid that this observation ought to trouble
   a great many professing Christians. They say that they have seen the
   Lord. I have no reason to doubt the truth of what they say, but, having
   seen, why do they not testify? In our text, it is written, "We have
   seen and testify," but in many cases, nowadays, it might be written,
   "We have seen and do not testify," for some who profess to have seen
   Christ by faith do not even come forward to confess Him in Baptism,
   according to His Word--and many do not unite with the visible Church
   and do not occupy themselves in the Sunday school, or in any form of
   Christian usefulness! What will become of you who, having a talent,
   never put it out to interest? O slothful ones, who have wrapped your
   talent in a napkin, how will you answer for it in the day when the
   Master calls your servants to give in their reckoning? If we are what
   we ought to be, we shall first make sure of the seeing and then we
   shall make equally sure of the testifying! What God has joined
   together, let no man put asunder. "We have seen and testify." There can
   be no divorce in this case, no breaking of the marriage bond--"We have
   seen and testify."

   I am going to dwell upon these two topics, seeing and testifying, and
   first, I shall speak to you about Apostolic seeing, for doubtless John
   may be understood as referring to himself and his brother-Apostles when
   he says, "We have seen and testify." That will be our first
   theme--Apostolic seeing. And then, secondly, our seeing, or, how far
   Christian men and women can say, "We have seen." And then, thirdly,
   Apostolic testifying and our testifying, for they ought to be alike in
   a great many particulars.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, let me speak a little about APOSTLIC
   SEEING. John and his fellow-Apostles say, "We have seen and testify
   that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world."

   Note that this saying was, in their case, eminently clear. Let me read
   to you the beginning of this Epistle-- "That which was from the
   beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which
   we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the Word of Life;
   that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you." These men, who
   were chosen to dwell with Christ, to see His miracles, and to hear His
   teaching, come forward with a very clear witness. They tell us that
   which they had seen, that which they had heard, that which they had
   looked upon and that which their hands had handled.

   In the first place, they had heard Christ. This was a high privilege,
   for, "Never man spoke like this Man." Never was there such hearing as
   when Christ preached! The Apostles had heard their Master's voice in
   private as well as in public, when He expounded to them Truths of God
   which He did not fully explain to the multitude. What marvelous
   sweetness there must have been in the voice of Jesus! I have no doubt
   that the melody of it would ring out in the Apostles' ears as long as
   they lived. They knew, from what they heard from His lips, that the Son
   of God, even the Lord Jesus Christ, was really before them, for they
   heard Him say things which no mere man could have uttered. They heard
   Him declare wonderful Truths such as never fell from the lips of anyone
   but the long-promised Messiah, the Divine Messenger, who was sent of
   God. They had heard from Him that which made them know that He was sent
   by the Father to save men!

   John also says that the Apostles had seen Christ. For more than three
   years, they had seen Him daily, constantly. They had also looked upon
   Him, the Apostle adds, apparently meaning that sometimes they had gazed
   upon Him with fixed attention. You know what it is to merely see a
   person, but it is a different thing to look earnestly at him, to feel
   so struck by his appearance that you cannot help looking him up and
   down from head to foot. You are fascinated by him, your eyes are held
   captive by him, they seem to drink him in and to photograph him on your
   soul! Now, John says that the Apostles did that with their Lord. They
   saw Him and their eyes looked upon Him. They could not be mistaken
   about their Lord. John had seen Him on the Mount of Transfiguration and
   He had also seen Him on the Cross. He says, in his Gospel, when writing
   of the soldier piercing Christ's side, "He that saw it bares record,
   and his record is true: and he knows that he says true."

   The Apostles, therefore, were hearers of Christ and seers of Christ.
   Besides that, they had handled Him. One of them had laid his head on
   his Lord's bosom. After He had risen from the dead, Jesus said to them,
   "Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I, Myself: handle Me, and see;
   for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see I have." They were not
   in any doubt that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among them! They
   could not doubt it--all their senses testified to the real Incarnation
   of the Son of God. They knew that He was a real Person, clothed in real
   flesh and blood. Thus, they had heard, seen and handled the Christ of
   God!

   Well now, perhaps some of you will say, "We wish we had their evidence.
   If we had been alive, then, we could speak, now, with much greater
   confidence." Listen to me--the mere hearing of Christ would not
   convince anybody! There were thousands and tens of thousands who heard
   Him, yet they heard nothing remarkable in His teaching and even turned
   away loathing and hating Him because of the Truth of God which they
   could not bear! There was not much advantage in merely seeing Him. Did
   not myriads see Him? Yet they saw not His Glory and did not understand
   that He was the Redeemer of men! Even when He hung on the Cross, many
   who saw Him only jeered, sneered, turned their backs and went their
   way. As to handling Him, did not the soldiers handle Him when they
   scourged Him? Did they not handle Him when they laid the Cross upon Him
   and when they laid Him upon the Cross? Oh, yes, there was more than
   enough of handling, and rough handling, too, but they were convinced of
   nothing even by touching the precious body of Jesus.

   The fact is, Brothers and Sisters, genuine faith comes not merely by
   the ear, or the eye, or the hand, but it is flashed into the
   soul--perhaps, through the ear--but always directly by the Spirit of
   God operating upon the heart--and if these Apostles had not had another
   sense, a spiritual sense, they would have remained unbelievers! So,
   after all, they had no great advantage over you. And you, Beloved, who
   know the Lord spiritually, may also be able to truly say, "We have seen
   and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the
   world."

   But mark you, next, granting that the Apostles were spiritually
   enlightened, their seeing was eminently conclusive as to the mission of
   Christ. What they saw was not only Christ, but, "that the Father sent
   the Son." Now, Beloved, this was seen in Christ's miracles. It is
   specially recorded of our Lord's first miracle, when He turned the
   water into wine, "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of
   Galilee, and manifested forth His Glory; and His disciples believed on
   Him." It was rather a simple miracle, the turning of water into wine,
   but Jesus did it in such a marvelous manner that the thought

   flashed upon the Apostles as He did it, "This is the Son of God! This
   is the Messiah!" A greater miracle which followed further on, is said
   to have had the same effect upon those who witnessed it. When our Lord
   Jesus came to the grave of Lazarus, before He raised him, you remember
   that He said to Martha, "Said I not unto you that if you would believe,
   you should see the Glory of God?" And when He had called Lazarus back
   from the dead, those who were round about saw the Glory of God beaming
   out in that miracle, and we read, "Many of the Jews which came to Mary,
   and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him." If any of
   you had been with Christ during His earthly life and had been
   spiritually enlightened, you would have seen, in His walking the waves,
   or in His opening the eyes of the blind, or in His healing all manner
   of sick folk who were brought to Him, something of His Glory, and you
   would have felt that the evidence as to His mission was very
   conclusive.

   But, Beloved, the Apostles, also, had conclusive evidence as to the
   Savior's mission in His life. What a life that was! I can admire the
   life of Elijah without wishing to imitate it. I can admire all the
   lives of the saints of the Old Testament and of the New, as I find them
   recorded, and I can even forget their failings. But there is not one,
   even of the purest and best lives that we have ever read in the sacred
   page, that leaves upon us the impression that the life of Jesus does!
   It is not only perfect--it is Divine! Singularly enough, it is more
   worthy of imitation than any other life and yet it cannot be imitated!
   It is the most human of all lives, but it is superhuman to a very high
   degree--and yet in no one respect superhuman in the sense that it
   cannot be copied by our humanity. It was, indeed, an extraordinary
   life! One who could have seen it in its different phases and learned,
   by the Spirit's teaching, what it all meant, must have been convinced
   that none but the Son of God could have lived like this. What the
   Centurion said about His death, the enlightened observer would have
   said about His life, "Truly this was the Son of God."

   I cannot stay to go into all the other proofs of this point, but I am
   sure of this, that those gracious men, with the Spirit of God
   instructing them, must have felt that Jesus Christ was sent of God when
   they saw His miracles and when they saw His life, which was a greater
   marvel than all His miracles!

   Still, I have not quite hit the nail on the head until I say that what
   they saw was eminently conclusive as to His being sent to save men--"We
   have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of
   the world." There was nothing about Christ's life that was contrary to
   that declaration. He cursed no man. He called no fire from Heaven upon
   any man. Even when wicked men had nailed Him to the tree, He breathed a
   prayer for them! In every way, He was not a destroyer, but a Savior.
   These men were, themselves, saved--saved from known sin, saved from
   groveling occupations, saved from themselves--and they knew it. They
   knew that the Father must have sent the Son to be the Savior of the
   world, for He had saved them!

   They had also seen Him heal the sick. What a sight it must have been to
   see Him going through the crowd, as He often did, when the people were
   laid on their beds in the streets and others came thronging about Him!
   When they saw Him laying a hand on one, here, and healing another,
   there, and another, there, and yet others, yonder, as though He marched
   through a regiment of devils and cleared a pathway for Himself, not
   with sword and spear, but with His own gentle glance and with a touch
   of His loving, yet mighty hands, what a wonder! He came not to destroy
   men's lives, but to save them--and those innumerable cures, which He so
   freely dispensed, were clear proofs to the Apostles that the Father had
   sent His Son to be the Savior of the world!

   But they knew it still better after they had seen Him die, after they
   had beheld His empty sepulcher, after they had felt the descending
   Spirit on the day of Pentecost. Then, when the tongues of fire were
   given them and they went out to speak in His name and 3,000 felt the
   mighty touch of Grace, they knew that the Father had sent the Son to be
   the Savior of the world! And when the bonds were broken which held them
   in as preachers to the Jews and they went throughout all Asia and
   boldly crossed to Europe, going everywhere preaching the Word--and
   Parthians, Medes and Elamites heard the Gospel, and Greeks and Romans
   bowed in penitence, and Philippians and Colossians flocked to
   Christ--then the Apostles understood that the Father had sent the Son
   to be the Savior of the world! All along their lives there was this
   clear line of evidence of which they were quite certain--and they came
   forth to testify that it was so!

   Thus I have brought before you the first point, that is, Apostolic
   seeing.

   II. The second thing is OUR SEEING. Let me put a few matters very
   plainly and personally, and let each person ascertain how far he can
   follow me.

   Brothers and Sisters, some of us have seen that Jesus is sent of God to
   be the Savior of the world. HOW have we seen it? Well, first, by the
   power of His Word. You have noticed, I daresay, that singular incident
   concerning the woman of Samaria. The woman told the men of Sychar that
   she had met a Man who had told her all that she ever did, and she
   believed that He was the Messiah. They listened to her words and then
   they went out to hear the Savior, Himself. He preached to them and what
   was the result? The Samaritans said to the woman, "Now we believe, not
   because of your saying, for we have heard Him, ourselves, and know that
   this is, indeed, the Christ, the Savior of the world." Do you not think
   that when John was writing this Epistle, the record of what the woman
   of Samaria said was in his mind and that he unconsciously repeated the
   words, "The Savior of the world," using the very same phrase as the men
   of Sychar had done? They were convinced of Christ's Messiahship simply
   by the power of His Word!

   Brothers and Sisters, there are many of us who have the same evidence
   as these Samaritans had! We have experienced the power of Christ's
   Word! I do not mean that we have felt the force of human eloquence, or
   that we have known the weight of human argument, but we have proved the
   might of the Word of the Lord. There is a certain something which goes
   with the Word of God which is altogether independent of the mannerisms
   of the preacher. It is the Truth of God, itself, which thrills us,
   conquers us, holds us in chains, leads us captive, sets us free, puts a
   new song into our mouths and makes us dance with holy joy! You know
   that experience, do you not? I believe that often, in this House of
   Prayer, my Brothers and Sisters, you have felt a power far beyond any
   force that human lips can possess--you know it has been so! You have
   gone home saying, "God has spoken to my soul, today, and I know that
   the Gospel is true, and that the Christ is Divine. The Father has sent
   the Son to be the Savior of the world, for I have felt the matchless
   power of His Holy

   Word."

   Then there are three evidences, mentioned by John in the latter part of
   this Epistle, each of which is a present power to us. He says, in the
   8th verse of the last chapter, "There are three that bear witness in
   earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree
   in one." Have you not felt the influence of the Holy Spirit as well as
   the power of the Word? Did not the Spirit come and wither your
   righteousness, as the Sirocco of the desert destroys the flowers of the
   field? Did not the Spirit of God come and put life into you when you
   lay like the dead? Did He not come and point you to the Savior--even
   giving you eyes with which to look to Him? Has not the Spirit of God
   often illuminated you, quickened you, comforted you, guided you? Has He
   not been to you as the fire, the dew and the wind? Then, if you know
   the operations of the Spirit of God and, you do, unless your profession
   is a lie, you, also, have seen that the Father has sent His Son to be
   the Savior of the world!

   The next witness is concerning the purging by the water. Now, has not
   the water, which flowed from Christ's riven side, operated upon you? If
   you are what you profess to be, my dear Brother, you are a clean man.
   Once you were foul enough, but you have been washed and now you are a
   different man. The things you then loved are now horrible to you, and
   you hate them, for a great change has come over you. You have been
   washed from your love of filthiness and your delight in sin! Yes, and
   the washing process goes on every day--you are daily helped to leave
   off one sin and another-- you are made not only to see the evil within
   you, but to conquer it. Is it not so, dear Brothers and Sisters? You
   know that if the Grace of God has not sanctified you, you are without
   one great evidence of its power--but if it has changed your character,
   then depend upon it, you have an evidence that it came from God. Thus,
   we also, "have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the
   Savior of the world," because He has cleansed us and made us to love
   holy things, and to hate everything which God hates.

   The third witness tells of the cleansing by the blood. Do you know
   anything about cleansing by the blood of Jesus, the blood that speaks
   to a conscience all in a tempest through sin? The blood that gives
   access to God to sinners far off from Him by wicked works? The blood
   which we plead in prayer? The blood which has become the foundation of
   all our hope? I can truly say that when I first learned the Doctrine of
   the Substitution of Christ, His dying in my place, and understood that
   I had nothing to do but to look to Him and live, it was with me as when
   the sun shines in Lapland after months of midnight! Oh, what a blessed
   dawning was that to my soul! Now, if you know the power of the blood of
   Jesus upon your conscience and your heart, then you, also, can say, "We
   have seen." And I hope you may truly be able to add, "and testify that
   the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world!"

   Besides all this--the power of the Word, the influence of the Holy
   Spirit, the purging by the water and the cleansing by the blood of
   Jesus--we have other evidence, namely, the aspirations of our souls.
   Are there not, within you, longings

   and desires for which you never can account if there were not a Savior
   for men? When God gave to humanity the appetite of hunger, you might
   have inferred from it that He meant to provide food to satisfy it. When
   He gave to us the capacity for thirst, we might be sure that,
   somewhere, there would be rippling rills from which that thirst might
   be slaked. When the Lord gave to us, as He has given, a sighing after
   holiness, a longing after nearness to Himself, a devout hope that we
   shall be caught up to be with Him where He is, these Heaven-given
   longings are proofs that they will be gratified--but they cannot be
   unless there is a Savior of men! Thank God there is such a Savior who
   will give us all that for which we are sighing! "It does not yet appear
   what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be
   like He, for we shall see Him as He is."

   But I need not talk of mere aspirations. As far as I am concerned, I
   can speak about matters offact which prove to me the power of my Lord
   and Master, for I have seen the triumphs of Christ. I saw some of them
   last Tuesday. I am always seeing them and, God willing, I shall see
   some more of them next Tuesday! I have seen men who used to live in sin
   and drunkenness, made honest and sober! And I have seen fallen women
   brought to Jesus' feet as penitents! All along what is growing to be a
   long ministry, the chariot of the Gospel, in which I have ridden, has
   had captives to grace Christ's triumphs! All along, multitudes have
   decided to quit the ways of sin and have turned to the living God! And
   I must believe in the power of Divine Grace, I cannot doubt it! The
   proof of what the tree is, surely, is found in the fruit, and the fruit
   is most abundant. Ask the missionaries what Christ has done in the
   Southern Seas and they will tell you of islands, once inhabited by
   naked cannibals, where now men are clothed and in their right mind,
   sitting at the feet of Jesus! The whole world teems with trophies of
   Christ and shall yet more fully teem with them. "We have seen and
   testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world,"
   and we preach with the full conviction that "the earth shall be full of
   the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."

   III. So now I come to my last point and that is a practical one.
   Thirdly, let me speak about APOSTOLIC TESTIFYING AND OURS.

   I trust that many of you can join in what the Apostle John said, "We
   have seen that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world."
   Now let us bear our testimony concerning it as the Apostles did and,
   first, we should do it in the same manner. What was the Apostolic
   manner of testifying? Well, I would say that it was very fervent and
   ardent. Those first preachers of the Gospel never preached cold
   sermons. Why, some sermons hang like icicles upon the lips of the
   speaker, but the Apostles preached as if they were all on fire! Their
   lips were like the mouth of Mount Aetna when it vomits lava--every word
   burnt its way into the hearts and consciences of men! Never talk coldly
   of Christ who was on fire with love to you--preach the Gospel ardently!

   The Apostles also proclaimed their message very simply. I do not
   believe there ever was an Apostolic sermon in which the preacher tried
   to show himself off. There is no record of any display of oratorical
   fireworks, no grand closing peroration. I always tell my students that
   this is the 12th Commandment, "You shall not perorate." [Speak at great
   length, in a grand manner.] Yet many preachers will do it--there must
   be something very splendid at the end of the discourse to impress
   people with the idea of how wondrously they can do it! Do not do it,
   Brothers, do not do it! Tell the people the way to Heaven and point it
   out to them as plainly as you can--and if there are two or three little
   words of plain Saxon that will do it, use them, and fling the long
   Latin words on the dunghill where they ought to rot! They are no good,
   whatever, in the pulpit, for we need speech that can be easily
   understood by the people--the plain speech of the common folk of our
   day. So the Apostles spoke and so should we.

   But they also spoke very boldly. You never meet with any timidity in
   them. We read in the Acts of the Apostles, "Now when they saw the
   boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and
   ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they
   had been with Jesus." Do not some preachers appear to apologize for
   what they are about to say? They trust that they will be excused for
   venturing to intrude their opinion. I would ask your pardon if I
   intruded my opinion, but in proclaiming the Gospel of Christ I have not
   any opinion of my own! I preach God's Word to you, and at your peril do
   you reject it! You are bound to receive it as it comes from Him and no
   apology is to be made by the man whom God sends. So the Apostles spoke
   boldly in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and Jesus Christ of
   Nazareth backed up their words. If God has not sent you, my Brother, go
   home! But if He has, in God's name, do not apologize for His message!
   There is an honor put upon you by your Lord who sent you, and you must
   put honor upon your Master by being faithful to Him.

   Thus, like the Apostles, we have to bear testimony for Christ, and we
   should do it in the same power. What was the power with which the
   Apostles testified? Was it the power of their superior education? They
   had not any, with, perhaps, the exception of Paul. They could manage a
   boat better than most of us can, but that was their principal
   attainment. Did they speak in the power of being (--what is the word,
   now?) "en rapport with the spirit of the age"? I may as well use a fine
   expression sometimes! Did they speak as men "keeping themselves abreast
   of the times"? Not a bit of it! They hated "the spirit of the age" in
   which they lived and struggled against it with all their might! What
   was the source of their power? Their only power was the Holy Spirit
   and, Brothers, we, also, must come to see that there can be no power in
   us to win a soul for Christ but the supernatural energy of God the Holy
   Spirit! If we have that, the work will be done. If we are without it,
   we shall be as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.

   Then, again, if we are to testify as the Apostles did, we should do it
   with the same message. What was that message? "The Father sent the Son
   to be the Savior of the world." Then, the world is lost. We must not
   stammer in saying that! And every man in the world is lost by nature
   and by practice, lost, with a great loss, a loss from which he cannot
   recover himself, a loss from which only God can save him! We must bear
   our testimony to that Truth of God. Then we must dwell upon the Sender
   of the Savior--"The Father sent the Son." That great Father against
   whom we have rebelled, who will bring His wandering children home,
   again, "The Father sent the Son." We must also testify much about the
   Sent One. "the Father sent the Son," not an angel, not a man prepared
   by education or training, but He sent the Son out of His own bosom, the
   Son out of the glories of Heaven! The Eternal Son of God, commissioned
   by the Father, came to earth!

   And with what design did Jesus come? He came to save, to save by making
   such a propitiation for sin that God could be justified, and also the
   Justifier of him that believes. He came to save by delivering us from
   the dominion of sin, that henceforth we should not serve sin, but
   should be lifted above it, right away from the power of everything that
   held us as slaves to Satan. And what was the scope of Christ's work?
   "The Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world." He did not
   come to condemn the world, but to save it, that the world, through Him,
   might be saved. His one mission here was to be the Savior. He will come
   a second time to be the Judge of all--but in His first coming, He came
   to be a Savior, and only a Savior. He has gone up into Heaven, but He
   is still the Savior, able to save to the uttermost them that come to
   God by Him--and He is the only Savior.

   In a certain district there may be many who pretend to cure the sick,
   but only one who is qualified to act as surgeon. And there are many who
   pretend to save, but there is only one qualified Savior beneath the
   cope of Heaven, and He is the Lord Jesus Christ, who is here styled,
   "the Savior of the world," because He is the only Savior in the world.
   As a man may be said to be the doctor of a district because he is the
   only doctor in the district, so is Christ the Savior of the world
   because He is the only Savior who ever was or ever will be in this
   world!

   He is "the Savior of the world," that is to say, of all ranks, classes
   and conditions of man. No difference of color, no difference of race,
   no difference of wealth, no difference of talent, no difference of
   standing and rank, no difference of education and attainment makes any
   difference to Him. Jesus Christ has come to be the Savior, not of the
   rich, nor of the poor. He has come to be the Savior, not of the
   learned, nor of the ignorant, but, "of the world." He comes to save men
   as sinners. "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," not
   merely great sinners or little sinners, open sinners or secret sinners,
   but plain "sinners." This is the sort of people for whom He laid down
   His life. He has come to seek and to save that which was lost, not that
   which was lost in one particular way or in another special way, but
   that which was lost any way--lost to itself, lost to God, lost to
   goodness, lost to hope, lost to Heaven--yes, if lost to morality, Jesus
   Christ has come to seek and to save that which was lost!

   He was sent to be the Savior of the world because no man, believing in
   Him, is excluded from the merit of His death. "God so loved the world,
   that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish, but have everlasting life." He will ultimately, as a matter
   of fact, save none but His elect. This will be the end of all His
   coming, and living, and dying--but that does not conflict, for a single
   moment, with the universal invitation that is to be given to you and to
   every creature under Heaven-- "Whoever will, let Him take the water of
   life freely." Whoever believes in Jesus has everlasting life. "Come
   unto Me," says Christ, "all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast
   out." "Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord: though your
   sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are
   red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

   What I am saying is the result of what I have seen and of what many
   here have seen. "We have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son
   to be the Savior of the world." Will you, dear Hearers--I speak to some
   who have never heard me before--will you accept our testimony? If you
   judge us to be false, you will not receive it, but if you have judged
   us to be honest and true men, accept what we declare to you!

   I pray you, receive our message, for to what end do we bear our
   testimony? I should like John to say a final word to you and then I
   will have done. This is why we bear our testimony, we do it with the
   same design that led John to write concerning the life of Christ, "and
   many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples,
   which are not written in this Book: but these are written that you
   might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that
   believing you might have life through His name." There is salvation!
   There is Christ ready to save! Look to Him, blind eyes! Look to Him,
   dead souls! Look to Him! Say not that you cannot--He in whose power I
   speak will work a miracle while yet you hear the command and blind eyes
   shall look, and dead hearts shall spring into eternal life by His
   Spirit's effectual working! God grant that it may be so, for His dear
   name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 John 4.

   Verse 1. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
   they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the
   world. It was so in John's day. It is so in these days. If there were
   only one false prophet, we should have need to be on our guard, but,
   "many false prophets are gone out into the world." If false prophets
   were all shut up in a cage, and we had to go to seek them, there might
   be some danger to be apprehended from them, but there is so much more
   danger, now that we can truly read, "Many false prophets are gone out
   into the world."

   2. Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that
   Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. Where the Godhead and the
   Manhood of Christ are truly and properly confessed, so far, at any
   rate, the confession is of God.

   3. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the
   flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, of which
   you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the
   world. So that there were deadly errors very early in the history of
   the Christian Church! The loving Apostle John did not handle them with
   gloved hands, but he dealt with them honestly and sought to destroy
   them. We must not wonder if, in our days, the Church has many heresies
   in it--but they are not to be tolerated, but to be cut up--root and
   branch!

   4. You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
   greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world. The people
   of God are few, feeble, and weak, but there is a Spirit in them
   mightier than the spirit of the world! And, as the ultimate victory
   will depend upon the strength of the indwelling Spirit, the Church of
   God will yet overcome the world that lies in the Wicked One.

   5. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
   world hears them. These false prophets teach doctrines that suit carnal
   men--"They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world." They
   take their cue from "the spirit of the age." They speak according to
   the fashion of the world and, therefore, it is no wonder that the world
   hears them.

   6. We are of God: He that knows God hears us; he that is not of God
   hears not us. Here is an Inspired answer to those who say that they
   attach no importance to the Apostles. They profess to be the followers
   of Christ, but they say that they do not agree with Paul and with John.
   Very well, John speaks in the name of all the Apostles when He says,
   "He that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us."

   6. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. If you
   reject any part of the Word of God, the spirit of error is within you.
   Truth is one, and the Revelation of God is one--let us not rend it, let
   us hold fast by it all--and so prove that the Spirit of truth is in us.

   7. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone
   that loves is born of God, and knows God. The spirit of love, kindness,
   self-sacrifice, holy charity--this is of God. This is the
   distinguishing mark of the Christian dispensation, the distinguishing
   mark of the Christian--that he abounds in love, not in malice, anger,
   revenge, bitterness. "Let us love one another: for love is of God."

   8. He that loves not knows not God; for God is Love. I have known men,
   professing to be Christians, at enmity with their brothers. I have
   heard of a father and a son who have not spoken to one another for
   months. Did I hear of a mother and a daughter who would not speak to
   each other, and of sisters who had fallen out? This will not do! You
   must either give up your Christian profession or give up your hatred!
   The very attempt to combine enmity and Christianity is a sin against
   God--"He that loves not knows not God; for God is Love."

   9-10. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
   God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
   through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved
   us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Sometimes
   people say, "How can we love a person who is not lovable, one who will
   not love us in return?" Yet God did so--He loved us when we loved Him
   not! He loved us when there was nothing lovable in us and we ought to
   take God as our Pattern in all things.

   11-12. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought, also, to love one
   another. No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
   dwells in us, and His love is perfected in us. Though we cannot see
   God, yet if we love one another, that is a proof that we have Him
   dwelling within us.

   13-16. Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He
   has given us of His Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the
   Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever shall
   confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in Him, and he in God.
   And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. The two
   things go together, knowing and believing.

   16-18. God is Love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God and God in
   him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
   Day of Judgment: because as He is, so are we in this world. There is no
   fear in love; but perfect love casts off fear. There is no slavish
   dread, no spirit of bondage--perfect love casts it all out. May we all
   have that love and get rid of all fear!

   18-20. Because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in
   love. We love Him because He first loved us. If a man says I love God,
   and hates his brother, he is a liar. That is very plain language! John
   does not mince matters. He is all love, but he is also all truth. Some
   people think that if you love, you will never use strong language, but
   that is not the case. Sometimes, because a surgeon loves the patient,
   he cuts the more deeply.

   20, 21. For he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he
   love God whom he has not seen? And this commandment have we from Him,
   That he who loves God, loves his brother, also. Now I do not know to
   whom this message may specially apply in all this great congregation,
   but there is the Word of God as plain as a pike-staff! If you do not
   live in love, you do not live in God! and if any of you are harboring
   any animosities, ill-feelings and unkindnesses, get rid of them, get
   rid of them at once! The sun has well near gone down--remember the
   Apostle Paul's injunction, "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,"
   but, as God has forgiven you, forgive all others for Christ's sake, and
   dwell in a loving-hearted Christ-like spirit toward all mankind.

"Forget You, I Will Not"

   (No. 2384)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, OCTOBER 28, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 12, 1888.

   "You are My servant: O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of Me."
   Isaiah 44:21.

   The idols said nothing to their worshippers. They had mouths, but they
   spoke not. You might go on worshipping an image for 20 years, but you
   would never get a reply to anything you said to it. It could not see
   you, it could not hear you, it could not answer you. That is a poor
   kind of worship! I do not think that I would care to go on worshipping
   a Madonna even if she winked--one cannot make much out of a wink--we
   need something more than that from the object of our adoration.

   But God has spoken to His people! We have a Revelation from the one
   living and true God. Jehovah has broken the eternal silences. He has
   torn the veil behind which He was hidden and He has revealed Himself. I
   believe this Book to be Inspired of God. I accept every word and every
   jot and tittle of it as God's voice to me. He has spoken and the record
   of what He has said is before me and I can rejoice in it. This was a
   blessed speech when God said to His ancient people, "You are My
   servant: O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of me."

   I cannot, at this time, stop to make any preface, but I must speak to
   you, first of all, upon the title which the Lord gives to His
   people--"My servant." Secondly, I will remind you of the promise which
   He makes to them--"You shall not be forgotten of Me." And then,
   thirdly, I will give you some reasons which assure us that His promise
   must and will be kept.

   I. First then, dear Friends, here is THE TITLE WHICH THE LORD GIVES TO
   HIS PEOPLE--"My servant."

   Notice what a practical title it is--"My servant." It has to do with
   action and service. It has to do with the heart, but also with the
   hands, with the inner and with the outer life. There is no true
   Christian but the practical Christian. The merely doctrinal professor
   has only the dead logs of wood--there is no fire of devotion, there is
   no warmth of fervor, there is nothing that is really worth having. The
   man who talks about his experience as a Christian, who never does
   anything for Christ, is, I am afraid, only an idle dreamer! There must
   be practical obedience to God from those who claim to be His servants.
   A servant is not always at work, but a servant is always a servant and
   always ready for work. I have known some servants who were very
   particular about what work they did. If there was a little given them
   to do that they thought was outside their special duty, they went about
   it in a very grumbling humor. I do not call such a person as that a
   servant! But the Lord's servants belong entirely to Him, they are His
   property, their time and talents are wholly at His disposal, their
   whole mind and heart and soul are subservient to His will. Let Him say,
   "Do this," and they do it. Let Him say, "Go there," and there they go.

   I want you, dear Hearers, to ask yourselves, "Are we servants of God?"
   Are not some of you servants of sin? Are not others of you servants of
   self, servants of the world, servants of the devil? Well, there is
   nothing comforting in the text for you! There is nothing comforting in
   the whole Bible for you while you remain as you are! You must quit that
   evil service. You must, by Divine Grace, become servants of God! But I
   know that I am speaking to some who are the servants of the Lord and
   who wish that their service was more perfect than it is. The will is
   present with you--with hearty goodwill you wear the golden yoke of
   Christ and you desire that every member of your body, and every faculty
   of your soul, may be yielded up to Him--for that is your reasonable
   service.

   That is the first point, then, this is a practical title, "My servant."

   Notice, also, that in the text it is a personal title. The Lord says,
   "Fou are My servant." There were a great many who were not God's
   servants. Multitudes of people were the servants of those idol gods of
   theirs, which they had made with their compass and their rule, their
   line and their plane. Poor things--the servants of a piece of wood! It
   must be beggarly service to serve that which you, yourself, have made!
   But God says to each one of His people, "You are My servant." Would the
   Lord Jesus go round this Tabernacle, and stop in front of each of you,
   and say, "You are My servant. Do not judge your fellow-worshippers, nor
   try to find out whether this man or that may is My servant. You,
   yourself, are my servant"? Oh, would not some of us, if our Master
   would do this, just leap to our feet, take hold of His hand, and say,
   "Lord, it is so. Brand us as your slaves, for we would gladly bear in
   our body the marks of the Lord Jesus. We would let all men know that,
   indeed, we are Your servants"? Will you just turn your thoughts away
   from this great crowd? I am trying to do so, that I may take to myself
   the personal title, "You are My servant." Will you, each one
   individually, either allot to yourself these words of the Lord, "You
   are My servant," or else honestly put them on one side as not belonging
   to you?

   Next, notice that, as the title is a practical and personal one, so it
   is an exclusive title. "You are My servant. These other people are
   servants of Baal or Ashtaroth; but you are My servant." When a man has
   a servant, he expects him to serve him, and not to be in the employ of
   other people. God's servants must serve God--not idols, not the world,
   not self, not sin, not Satan. "You are My servant." When you get up
   tomorrow morning and begin to light the fire, and prepare the
   breakfast, it is true that you will be your earthly master's servant,
   but, as you commune with your God, hear Him saying to you, "You are My
   servant." When you take down the shutters, to begin the business of the
   day, hear a voice saying to you, across the counter, "You are My
   servant." You will live better, you will serve better, it will put a
   glory about your actions if you can know and feel that you are truly
   serving God!

   "You are My servant." I can tell you that this passage has very greatly
   comforted me. One has said, "You are altogether wrong." Another has
   said, "You are very bigoted," and so on. "Yes," I have answered, "but I
   am not your servant. I am not responsible to you. And if my Master is
   satisfied with me, I am satisfied with His satisfaction." Certainly I
   am not going to be the servant of men, to put my neck under their feet
   and do their bidding! Send your own slaves on your business! I shall
   attend to my Lord's work, for I have only one Master to serve. I want
   you tonight, and all the week, when the devil says, "Now here is a fine
   chance for you to get rich very quickly, you can make a lot of money,"
   just say to Him, "I am not your servant, and I cannot take your wages.
   I can do nothing wrong in order to get gain, for I am the servant of
   God."

   And if, young man, there should come in your way, during the week, a
   pleasurable vice which may seek to win you, flee from it! Say, "How can
   I do this great wickedness and sin against God, for I am God's
   servant?" "You are My servant, not the servant of anybody else." Hold
   your heads up! Be not ashamed! He is a free man whom God has made to be
   His servant. "You have loosed my bonds," said David, after he had said,
   "I am Your servant." "I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid.
   You have loosed my bonds. By the very fact of taking me into Your
   service, You have made me a free man."

   Note, next, that as this is an exclusive title, so it is an honorable
   title. I will not dwell upon that fact, but it must be so, for God uses
   the title in this verse twice over. He says, "You are My servant: I
   have formed you; you are My servant." It is a greater honor to be the
   Lord's servant than to be an earl or a duke, a prince or a king! To
   serve God is truly to reign. My dear Friends, is this high dignity
   yours? Never mind about earthly stars and garters--this is the highest
   degree that you can take--the highest honor that you can win in earth
   or Heaven--to be the servant of the ever-blessed

   God!

   Once more, this is a title of acceptance. As God says, twice over, "You
   are My servant," He means by this, "I accept you as My servant; I
   acknowledge you as such." What a grand thing it will be if, at the Last
   Great Day, God is able to acknowledge us as His servants! He will do so
   if He can accept us now. Do you not, sometimes, have a servant in your
   employment to whom you say, "Really, I cannot keep you any longer. The
   sooner that you are gone, the better"? One does not care to have some
   people for servants. Now and then a man pleads that he cannot get any
   work and begs you to employ him. You give him a broom and set him to
   sweep a path, and he sweeps it in such a way that he makes your flesh
   creep, and you pretty soon sweep him out. You would be ashamed to have
   anybody know that he was a servant of yours. But when God says, "You
   are My servant: you are My servant," it means that He is not ashamed of
   us!

   Brothers and Sisters, we are often ashamed of ourselves when God is not
   ashamed of us. He overlooks a thousand imperfections and it is well for
   us that He does, for who among us can serve God perfectly? I have
   sometimes known Christian people, who were doing a good work for God,
   get quite down-hearted because they found somebody else doing a larger
   work. Oh, do not envy your brethren who have more service than you
   have! I daresay that they almost envy you, and think how nicely they
   could do the work that you have to do. One said to me, the other day,
   when I had preached, and preached in what I thought to be a very poor
   way, too, "I feel as if, after hearing you, I cannot preach again." "Oh
   dear," I said, "if you knew what I thought of the sermon, you would
   feel very differently! You would think that anybody could preach better
   than that."

   I often think that anybody can preach better than I can till I sit and
   hear them, and then I say to myself, "Well, after that, I will try
   again." But, dear Friends, whether we think we fail, or others think we
   fail, how little does it matter if the Lord says, "You are My servant:
   you are My servant. It was a poor sermon, dear One, but you are My
   servant. That work was very poorly done when you visited the sick, but
   you did it with all your heart. You are My servant. You are not a very
   brilliant teacher for that class of yours, but you love your scholars,
   and you love your God. You are My servant"? He does, as it were, pat
   you on the back, and say, "You are My servant. Go on with your work for
   Me. I will acknowledge you, I intend to bless you. You are My servant."

   One reason why we are God's servants is that He has forgiven us our
   trespasses. Shall I read to you, again, the next verse to my text? "You
   are My servant. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your
   transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins." Is not that a reason why we
   should serve Him? Forgiven sins should bind us to His service with
   bands stronger than steel! We can never run away from Him who has
   pardoned such grave faults as we have committed! Then He adds, "I have
   redeemed you," and in the 24th verse He goes on to say, "The Lord has
   redeemed Jacob." Oh, we must serve Him who has redeemed us! If He has
   bought us, we are not our own--we belong to Him--and we must spend and
   be spent in His service. And then the Lord says, "Jehovah has redeemed
   Jacob and glorified Himself in Israel." Well, if He has been able to
   get any Glory out of us, we will keep on serving Him! What a marvelous
   God He must be to glorify Himself in such poor wretches as we are! But
   as He does so, we will continue in so Divine a service while life shall
   last and then we will serve Him forever above!

   Thus have I spoken upon the title which the Lord gives to His
   people--"My servant."

   II. Now, secondly, comes a sweet part of the subject, THE PROMISE WHICH
   HE MAKES TO US--"You shall not be forgotten of Me."

   Men forget us, do they not? And they turn against us. Those for whom
   you do the most are often those who will be most unkind and most bitter
   against you. I will not speak as I might, but I know and I have felt,
   and I daresay that you know, and that you have felt, in your measure,
   too, that, "cursed is he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm."
   The whole of mankind put together in the scales are lighter than
   vanity--there is no use in trusting in them at all! But God says, "You
   shall not be forgotten of Me." Remember those comforting words that we
   sang just now--

   "Forget you I will not, I cannot. Your name Engraved on My heart does
   forever remain! The palms of My hands while I look on, I see The wounds
   I received when suffering for thee."

   What does this promise mean? It means, first, that God will never cease
   to love His servants. If you are His servants, He loved you before the
   world began! He still loves you and He will love you, world without
   end. "You shall not be forgotten of Me." Do not dream that God can cast
   away His people! We are members of the body of Christ--do you think
   that Christ will ever lose any of the members of His body? I should not
   like to lose my little finger and Christ will not lose one of the
   members of His body. You would think, according to the teaching of
   some, that Christ's members keep dropping off, something like the limbs
   of lobsters, and that new ones were constantly growing! There is
   nothing in Scripture to warrant such a notion as that!

   Do you remember Mr. Bunyan's parable of a child, who is in a room, and
   a stranger comes in and says, "Come here, child, I will cut off your
   finger." "No," says the child. "Yes, but I will. I will take off your
   little finger. Here is a knife, I will cut off your little finger."
   "No," says the child again, and he begins to cry. "Oh but," says the
   stranger, "that is a poor little finger that you have! I will take it
   off and I will buy you a gold finger, such a brave gold finger, and I
   will put it on your hand instead of your little finger." "Oh," says the
   child, "but it would not be my finger! I cannot lose my own

   finger." Whereupon Mr. Bunyan says, "If Christ could have better people
   than those He has, He would not make the change, 'For,' says He, 'they
   are not My people; they are not a part of My own living Self."' So, the
   Lord Jesus would not change you for a golden saint, for one much better
   than you are! That new finger would not be what the Father gave Him,
   nor what He bought with His precious blood. "You shall not be forgotten
   of Me," means that God will never cease to love His servants.

   Next, it means that the Lord will never cease to think of His servants.
   The thoughts of God are wonderful! He can think of every individual
   saint as much as if there were no other saint in the universe! He never
   leaves off thinking of each one of His people. The Divine mind is
   distinctly set on you, Brother, on you, Sister, and it is never taken
   off from you. If God were to cease to think of us for five minutes, in
   that five minutes we might be ruined--but He never forgets us and,
   consequently, there shall be no part of our body without its armor, and
   no portion of our time without a sentinel set to watch over us every
   single moment of it! Listen to the Lord's promise about His vine--"I
   the Lord keep it. I will water it every moment, lest any hurt it. I
   will keep it night and day." God will never leave off thinking of you
   as well as loving you!

   Next, the Lord will never cease to befriend His servants. God's
   thoughts are always practical. The gifts of His hands go with the
   thoughts of His mind. Our text means, "You shall not be forgotten of Me
   in the distribution of My benefits." The Lord will not cease to give
   you bread, water and garments. His Providence shall always take care of
   you. Remember the passage we read at this morning's service, "The Lord
   is my Shepherd; I shall not want"? He will never cease to bestow upon
   you the blessings of His Grace. He will go on to pardon you, to guide
   you, to teach you, to strengthen you, to lead you until you shall be in
   His glorious Presence without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing! "I,
   Jehovah, will not forget you. You shall not be forgotten of Me."

   I think I hear some dear child of God crying, "I was afraid that the
   Lord had forgotten me the other day." It is you who had forgotten Him!
   "Oh, but I thought surely that He had cast me off!" What right had you
   to think anything of the kind? Will the Lord cast off His people? Will
   He be faithful no more? Shame on you that you should think He could or
   would act in such a fashion! "But, oh, I am so little and so feeble!"
   Are there any of His saints that are not just the same? "Oh, but I am
   so unworthy!" And pray, what child of God does not have to make the
   same confession? The Lord says, "You shall not be forgotten of Me," and
   He will stand to it! Depend upon it and you shall share with the rest
   of His people in the high privileges of the Covenant of His Grace. He
   will not cease to love you, nor cease to think of you, nor cease to
   befriend and benefit you. With John Newton, you may sing--

   "His love in time past forbids me to think He'll leave me at last in
   trouble to sink. Each sweetEbenezerI ha ve in review Confirms His good
   pleasure to help me quite through."

   Once more, the Lord will not cease to commune with His people. Whenever
   you desire to commune with Him, He is ready to meet you. Knock at His
   door--the servant will not say that He is not at home, for He waits to
   be gracious. Have you been slipping away from your God of late? Come
   back to Him, come back at once. The Lord Jesus Christ has rebuked you
   for your Laodicean lukewarmness, but, after having said some hard words
   about you, how does He finish? "Behold, I stand at the door and knock:
   if any man hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him,
   and will sup with him, and he with Me." He will take supper with you,
   tonight, if you are willing. O dear child of God, this is the cure for
   your lukewarmness, for the Lord to come to you and have high fellowship
   with you--and He is waiting for that communion! "You shall not be
   forgotten of Me."

   I do not feel that I need say any more upon this promise; but I should
   like everyone who is a Christian to take it home. "Fou shall not be
   forgotten of Me." Perhaps, in a few days, you will be lying upon the
   bed of pain. The Lord bids me say to you in preparation for that
   affliction, "You shall not be forgotten of Me." Or, possibly, during
   this week, you will have a very serious loss in business that will
   occasion you a great staggering unless, as you read this promise to
   yourself, you say, "But the Lord has said, You shall not be forgotten
   of Me." Dear children of God, you never know what trouble or alarm is
   coming, only you have often proved the truth of Mr. Bunyan's quaint
   ditty--

   "A Christian man is never long at ease

   When one fright's gone, another does him seize."

   Therefore, be ready for anything, be ready for everything! You will be
   prepared for whatever may come if you remember this promise, "You are
   My servant: you shall not be forgotten of Me." The Lord will help you,
   He will help you right through, He will help you even to the end. Fall
   back upon this precious promise, "You shall not be forgotten of Me." I
   wish that I could put this passage, like a wafer made of honey, under
   every tongue where the mouth is full of bitterness, so that you might
   suck at it and get the sweetness out of it, and so say to yourself, "I
   shall be happy, yet, and happy, come what may, for the Lord will not
   forget me!"

   III. My last work at this time is to mention SOME REASONS WHICH ASSURE
   US THAT GOD WILL NOT FORGET THOSE WHO ARE TRULY HIS SERVANTS.

   I should say, first of all, that the very best reason is that He says
   He will not forget us. As He says, "You shall not be forgotten of Me,"
   then, He cannot forget us! He is God who cannot lie and His every Word
   of Grace is worthy of our utmost confidence. You remember what a boy
   said about his mother? "How do you know it is true, Jack?" asked one.
   "Mother said so," answered the lad. "Well, but that is no reason at
   all." "Yes," he said, "it is. It is the best reason of all, for if
   Mother says so, it is so if it is not so." That is the way for a boy to
   trust in his mother's word--what she said must be true, her son would
   not believe that it could be otherwise! We have just to trust in God
   like that--it is so for He says it! "You shall not be forgotten of Me."
   We cannot tolerate a doubt as to the Truth of what the Lord says.

   But the next reason is this, God cannot forget us since He has made us.
   The former part of the verse says, "You are My servant: I have formed
   you." The Lord has fashioned us--not merely in the common way in which
   others of His creatures have been formed, but upon the wheel of Grace
   He has made us revolve like the clay in the potter's hand! With His own
   fingers He has made us into vessels of mercy so He cannot forget us. I
   think I have heard that before the siege of Paris, Gustave Dore had
   nearly finished one of his greatest paintings, one of the finest
   pictures which has ever been produced. Having to flee from the city,
   all of a sudden, as the Germans were coming up, he hid his picture in a
   cellar, down under a heap of rubbish.

   When the siege was over, Dore came back to Paris and, of course, when
   he returned he had forgotten all about his picture, had he not? Not he!
   He had taken too much trouble with it to forget it. He knew the value
   of it and he remembered where he had put it. He did not have to go up
   and down the house and say to the people, "Do you know where my picture
   is?" No, he never forgot where he had, himself, put it, so he found it
   where he had hidden it, brought it out to the light of day and finished
   it! Now, in a far higher sense than that, God will have respect unto
   the work of His own hands. The very bodies of the saints, though they
   are hidden away for a while in the rubbish of the earth, He will fetch
   out and He will complete the work of Grace which He has begun upon each
   one of them! The Lord having formed us to be His servants, we shall not
   be forgotten of Him!

   A further reason is that He has blessed us. He has blessed us so much,
   already, that He cannot, now, forget us. If you needed persons to love
   you, perhaps you would set to work to do them a kindness. Very good and
   very proper. But you may be beaten over that plan. As a matter of
   selfish prudence I would suggest to you that you had better let them do
   you a kindness, and then they will be bound to you forever! A boy
   forgets his mother's love--alas--it is often so, but the mother never
   forgets the kindness she has shown to her son, because she has done so
   much for him. The persons you love best are not those who have done
   most for you, but those for whom you have done the most. If I should
   bind God to me by anything I can do for Him, I should feel that the
   ties would be very feeble ones, but when God binds Himself to me by His
   blessings and mercies, it is another thing, for then the ties are
   Divinely strong! I say, then, that God has blessed us, and He has done
   so much for us that He cannot leave off loving us. "You shall not be
   forgotten of Me."

   Again, the Lord will not forget us, because He has loved too long
   already. I was talking with an old saint this week-- once a renowned
   preacher of the Gospel--who is now some 84 years of age. He shook my
   hands and he said, "I am with you, my Brother, I am with you, my
   Brother. I know what the contention is and I am on your side, heart and
   soul." Then he added, "You and I have known the Lord too long to run
   after this new trumpery." And it is so--you get so bound to the old
   Truths of God that you cannot give them up! You grow to love the Gospel
   so fervently that you cannot renounce it! Well, now, the effect that
   such love has upon us is still more clearly seen in God. He has loved
   us so long that He cannot forget us. How long has He loved you? "Oh,"
   you say, "it is about 10 years since I was converted." Well, but did
   not the Lord love you before that? Did not our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ die for you before you were converted?

   "Oh, I see!" you say, "then He has loved me more than 1,800 years." But
   did He not purpose and plan that Christ should die for you before the
   world began? Was there ever a time when the redeemed of the Lord were
   not written on the heart of Christ? He loved you before the first star
   began to dart its golden arrows through the darkness of space! Rest
   secure, then! Love so ancient will never die out!

   Further, the Lord must continue to love us. He cannot forget us, for we
   have cost Him so much. Oh, how much we have cost our Lord! "By Your
   agony and bloody sweat," by the scourging and the spitting, by the
   false accusations and the ridicule, by the nails, the vinegar, the
   spear, that bitter cry, "Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani," by Your sorrow,
   even unto death--by all this, Lord Jesus, You have bought us! These are
   the travail pangs of our spiritual birth and He, by whom all those
   agonies were borne, can never forget us! In us He sees of the travail
   of His soul and He is satisfied. Look at His hands, look at His side,
   look at His feet--there are the records of the costly price that He
   paid down for our re-demption--and they are the pledge that He cannot
   let us be forgotten!

   Besides, Beloved, if we had no other reason for thinking that we should
   not be forgotten of God, if we are His servants, we know that He is too
   good a Lord to cast us out. He is a wretch of a man who casts off an
   old servant simply because he is old. Yet many, when they grow old and
   feeble, find that their masters want to get rid of them. A young fellow
   has given all his life, ever since he was 15, to a firm in the city,
   and when he gets over 60, the employers think to themselves, "A nice
   brisk young man will be better in the place of old Jones," and they
   pick some little hole in him and off he goes--to the workhouse, for all
   they care, as a general rule. "Ah, but," says the Lord, "you shall not
   be forgotten of Me." He does not turn His old servants adrift--for He
   says, "Even to your old age, I am He; and even to hoar hairs will I
   carry you."

   In olden times, and I am afraid it is still so, masters have been known
   to get rid of their servants when they have been ill. What did the
   Amalekite do with the young Egyptian? David found him left behind in
   the field and he said that his master was an Amalekite, and left him
   because he fell sick. Ugh! So they still say of their sick servants,
   "We must get rid of them! They are not strong enough to do their work."
   But our Lord never forgets His servants when they are ill. Then He is
   more near, more dear, more tender, more considerate than ever! "You
   shall not be forgotten of Me, O My servant!" Sick and sad, yes, and
   sinful, and worn out, yet still we shall not be forgotten of our Lord!
   Young man, enter the service of this blessed Master! You will never rue
   it. I love my Master and I would like to see you in His blessed
   employment. It is always a sign that a man has a good master when He
   would like to see his own boys in the same service, and I can truly say
   that nothing gives me so much joy as to think that both my sons are in
   the same service as I am in!

   Sons of godly parents, may God put you in the same service as your
   fathers are in! Daughters of holy mothers, I do pray that your mother's
   God may be your God! There is no service like our Master's. If the Lord
   were a hard master, tyrannical, changeable, unkind, ungenerous,
   austere--if He discharged His servants right and left, for this fault
   and for that, or because they grew feeble and faulty--well then, I
   think I would stand here and tell you the truth about Him, and urge you
   not to think of entering His employment! But oh, He is a blessed
   Master, therefore I can plead with you to be His servant and I can
   assure you that you shall never be forgotten of Him!

   This morning [Sermon #2039, Volume 34--Crossing the Jordan] I spoke
   about being on the verge of Jordan. When you are about going into
   Heaven, passing over that last stream, dear child of God, you shall not
   be forgotten! The Lord will be very near you, then--He will especially
   help you in your dying moments.

   I cannot at all make out how you who are without a God get on,
   especially you poor people. With no comfort in this world, with nothing
   worth living for, here, how can you exist without a good hope for the
   hereafter, without a Savior to trust in, without a God to run to for
   protection, as the chicks run to the hen? And you rich people, how can
   you do without a God? What is to become of you? You will have to lose
   all that you have and over you it will be said, "Ashes to ashes, and
   dust to dust." Members of parliament, or whoever you may be, you will
   have to go down to the worms, like other people. What a horrible thing
   for you, Dives, to be dragged down with all your scarlet and fine linen
   on, and cast into Hell! You who have fared sumptuously every
   day--denied even a drop of water to cool your burning tongue! What a
   change for you! If the poor need a Savior, so do you, just as much! May
   the Lord make both--rich and poor--to be His servants and then whisper
   in the ear of each one of you, as you go down the Tabernacle steps
   tonight, "You are My servant: you shall not be forgotten of me"!

   God bless you all, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Isaiah 44:1-22.

   Verses 1-2. Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant; and Israel, whom I have
   chosen: thus says the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb,
   which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, My servant; and you, Jeshurun,
   whom I have chosen. God cannot bear His people to be sad, He delights
   to drive away fear, trembling and mistrust. He loves faith, for faith
   brings confidence, hope, rest. So He says to us, "Fear not, fear not,
   be not afraid." It is God Himself who made us, and who chose us, who
   says to us, "Do not fear." Come, dear Hearts, lay aside your
   disquietude. If God bids you cast away fear, will you not do it?
   Nothing hushes a babe to sleep like its mother's voice. Let God's voice
   hush you into sweet and blessed calm whenever you are troubled and full
   of fear.

   3. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the
   dry ground. God will never do anything by halves. He will not only send
   rain, but the waters shall pour down from the sky. He will not merely
   moisten the surface of the dry ground, He will send floods to saturate
   it. God is great in giving His Grace. When once you reach the region of
   Grace, you have entered the region of plenty, even the riches of God's
   unspeakable Grace. If, dear Friends, you have at this time no spiritual
   power, unction, favor and love, you may have it, for here is the Lord's
   own promise--"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
   upon the dry ground."

   3. I will pour My Spirit upon your seed, and My blessing upon your
   offspring. Is that your great burden--trouble about your boy? Does your
   dear girl grieve you? Well, He who blesses the father and the mother
   will bless the children-- the God of Abraham is the God of Isaac! Pray
   that this promise may be fulfilled to you, that your seed may get a
   share of that Spirit of Grace which has been given to you.

   4. And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water
   courses. You can track a stream by the willows. Standing on a hill and
   looking down the valley, you can tell where the little brook winds, for
   there are the willows. So shall it be with your children--they shall
   spring up by the waters of Grace, and be a joy and a blessing.

   5. One shall say, I am the Lord's. That is the brave son who comes out
   boldly and avows his faith. "One shall say, I am the Lord's."

   5. And another shall call himself by the name of Jacob. That is the one
   who goes and joins the Church and does not say much about it, but he
   has united himself with the Lord's people. "And another shall call
   himself by the name of

   Jacob."

   5. And another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname
   himself by the name of Israel. He cannot speak much, but he can write.
   He is not so bold as the others, perhaps, but he is quite as true.
   "Another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord." It does not so
   much matter how our children are converted so long as they really are
   con-verted--and as to the particular way in which they join the
   Church--we have only to bid them seek the guidance of God's Word and
   His Spirit and follow wherever They lead! Pray earnestly, dear Friends,
   that the Lord will bless your children. I thank God that most of the
   members of the Church known to me, have their children saved. There are
   many families that are altogether in the Church. There are others which
   have not that privilege, yet, but, dear Friends, you may have it! Ask
   believingly, act faithfully, watch hopefully and you shall see it
   joyfully before long.

   6, 7. Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord
   of Hosts, I am the First, and I am the Last, and beside Me there is no
   God. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
   order for Me, since I appointed the ancient peoples and the things that
   are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them. Jehovah challenges
   the idol gods to utter a prophecy! Let them tell the future if they
   can, but they cannot. Prophecy is always the mark of the one living and
   true God!

   8-11. Fear you not, neither be afraid: have not I told you from that
   time, and have declared it? You are even My witnesses. Is there a God
   beside Me? Yes, there is no god; I know not any. They that make a
   graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things shall
   not profit, and they are their own witnesses, they see not, nor know;
   that they may be ashamed. Who has formed a god, or molten a graven
   image that is profitable for nothing? Behold, all his fellows shall be

   ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered
   together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be
   ashamed together. Well they may. Men who pretend to make a god ought to
   be ashamed.

   12. The smith with the tongs both works in the coals, and fashion it
   with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms. What irony!
   Making god with hammers and bellows!

   12. Yes, he is hungry, This god-maker is hungry!

   12. And his strength fails: he drinks no water, and is faint. The
   god-maker is getting faint. There is a sarcasm about this description
   which ought to convince the most blind devotees of an idol!

   13. The carpenter stretches out his rule, he marks it out with a line;
   he fits it with planes, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes
   it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it
   may remain in the house. A god in the house! A god shut up in a room! A
   god that has been made with compasses and planes! How ridiculous it
   seems!

   14. He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which
   he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest: he plants an
   ash, and the rain does nourish it. The raw material for a god is an
   ash, a watery tree--"The rain does nourish it."

   15-17. Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take, thereof,
   and warm himself; yes, he kindles it, and bakes bread. Yes, he makes a
   god, and worships it, he makes it a graven image, and falls down
   thereto. He burns part thereof in the fire; with part thereofhe eats
   flesh; he roasts roast, and is satisfied: yes, he warms himself, and
   says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: and the residue thereof he
   makes a god. Oh, the folly of idolatry! Perhaps you do not see your own
   folly, you who are worshipping yourselves! A man who worships his belly
   is a worse idolater than the one who worships a god of wood! A man who
   worships gold and silver, if that gold and silver should take the shape
   of sovereigns and shillings, is not a bit more justified in his
   idolatry than if he had made it into the shape of a calf and had bowed
   before it in idolatrous homage and reverence!

   17-20. Even his graven image: he falls down unto it, and worships it,
   andprays unto it, and says, Deliver me; for you are my god. They have
   not known nor understood: for He has shut their eyes, that they cannot
   see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand. And none considers
   in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I
   have burned part of it in the fire; yes, also I have baked bread upon
   the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make
   the residue thereof an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a
   tree? He feeds on ashes. Mad people have been known to do even that,
   they have thrust cinders into their mouths--and this is what everybody
   does who is not trusting in the living God. "He feeds on ashes."

   20, 21. A deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver
   his oath, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? Remember these,
   O Jacob and Israel. Think of these false gods and be ashamed of them!

   21, 22. For you are My servant: I have formed you; you are My servant:
   O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of Me. I have blotted out, as a
   thick cloud, your transgressions and, as a cloud, your sin: return unto
   Me; for I have redeemed you. These wooden gods have done nothing of the
   sort. Come back to the true God and worship Him--/and be happy in His
   love.

Another Lesson From Manasseh's Life

   (No. 2385)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 19, 1888.

   "And the Lord spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not
   listen. Therefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host
   of the king of Assyria; which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound
   him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon." 2 Chronicles 33:10,11.

   THE proper way for a sinner to be brought to God is for God to speak to
   him and for him to hear. Manasseh would not come that way--"The Lord
   spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not listen."
   Therefore, as God determined to save the rebellious king, He fetched
   him back by a rougher road--He sent the captains of the host of the
   king of Assyria, who took him among the thorns.

   I am going to talk to you a little about the plain and proper road by
   which you should come to God. And then I shall deal with those who have
   gone among the thorns. There may be some such characters here, tonight.
   Let me say that if I should happen to describe anyone very correctly, I
   hope he will not do as a friend did the other Monday. He had come up to
   London and I gave such an accurate description of him on the Sunday
   that he came in very indignantly to see me the next day, to know
   whether his wife had not written to me. He looked as if his wife and
   myself might, both of us, have rather hard times with him. When I
   assured him that I did not know his name and had never seen him or his
   wife, or heard a word about him, he grew a little more calm--but the
   portrayal of him appeared to be so accurate that I could not help
   saying to him, "Surely God has spoken to you. Take the message home to
   yourself. Do not blame me or your wife, but blame yourself to think
   that such a description should apply to you."

   Now, first, as I have already told you, the proper way for a sinner to
   be brought to God is for God to speak to him and for him to hear. In
   Holy Scripture, God warns men. He tells them that sin is an evil thing
   and that if it is persisted in, it will bring endless ruin to them.
   Now, the proper thing for the man who hears that warning is to take
   heed to it, to run to the helm of his vessel and steer the ship in
   another direction. God grant that you and I may not be as the horse and
   as the mule, that need bit and bridle, but may we listen at once to the
   warning so kindly given and turn from every evil way!

   Sometimes God speaks by way of invitation. "Come to Me," He says.
   "Return to Me. I am ready to forgive. I delight in mercy." Now, the
   proper way for one who hears this invitation is not to wait and linger,
   but to accept it at once. "When You said, Seek you My face; my heart
   said unto You, Your face, Lord, will I seek." The Lord invites you to
   come to the ark to escape the flood, to come to the banquet to satisfy
   your hunger, to come to the sacred bath, that you may wash and be
   clean, as he of old did who washed his leprosy away in the Jordan.
   Whenever God speaks to us in any way, let us listen and, listening, let
   us obey--especially when He sets before us Jesus, Crucified, and says
   to us, "Trust in Him and you shall be forgiven. Accept the Great
   Sacrifice! Believe that your sin was laid on Him and you shall be
   forever clear of it." Oh, that you would accept Him at once! We do not
   need to go round about, over hedge and ditch, to find the Savior--there
   is the Cross, look to it and live!

   I was asking a friend, just now, concerning a sermon he had heard, and
   he said, "It was a very clever sermon, but if anybody had followed its
   teaching, he would not have been within 6,000 miles of the Cross of
   Christ." Well now, that is not what I want to do with you, to lead you
   thousands of miles away from Christ! But, as God has set forth Christ
   to be a propitiation for sin, I pray that you may accept Him and live
   by Him. "Look unto Me," He says, "and be you saved."--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One."

   May the Holy Spirit, whose word is, "Today, today, today," speak with
   power to your hearts that you may hear because God speaks!

   You understand the way sinners are saved, do you not? "Faith comes by
   hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." We hear the Gospel, we
   believe it, we live by it--there is the whole machinery of salvation!
   We preach a Crucified Savior, and whoever believes in Him shall not
   perish, but have everlasting life. Yet we cannot beat it into men's
   heads that salvation is as simple as this! I remember how Martin Luther
   said that it was so difficult to get the Doctrine of Justification by
   Faith into the minds of the Wittenbergers that he had half a mind to
   take the Bible and beat them over the head with it! I am afraid that he
   would not have gotten the Truth of God into their heads that way.
   "Look," he said, "if these sectaries come to you with a new doctrine,
   you stare at it like a cow at a new gate! But when I bring you the
   Gospel, you will not even look at it, much less will you receive it!"
   Oh, that the Spirit of God would deliver us from such folly, that we
   may accept Christ, trust Him, and live!

   This is the happy way of salvation, to hear, believe, and live. Men go
   about to try and invent a salvation that makes its followers
   miserable--you must have so many wretched feelings, so much despair, so
   many gloomy thoughts. No, no! The Gospel message is, "Believe and
   live." Why should men need to make their case worse than it is? It is
   already as bad as it can be! Why struggle to find an impossible
   addition to your present danger? Why try to import foreign and
   extraneous griefs into your already unbearable misery? I was trying,
   once, to explain the Gospel to a young woman, so as to make it very
   simple to her, but she said, "Why, dear Sir, I thought I was to feel a
   great deal! My father, before he found Christ, was so bad that he had
   to be put away in a lunatic asylum, and I thought I must be like he
   was." That is the rough way that many people think they have to travel.
   But the proper way, the Scriptural way is, "Come to Jesus, put your
   trust in Him. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved." This, then, is the happy way!

   It is also an accessible way. If I preached to you that you must have
   so much despair, so much of terrible agony of soul, you might say, "I
   cannot go along that road. I am a young man full of spirit. I am a
   young woman with ruddy cheeks and happy heart. Must I be miserable in
   order to find Christ?" Ah, my dear Friend, it is not so put! You will
   have, you must have, sorrow for sin. That, the Lord will give you--you
   have not to make it yourself--the Holy Spirit will work it in your
   heart if you yield yourself wholly to Him. How often have I told you
   that if you cannot come to Christ with a broken heart, come to Christ
   for a broken heart! If you have not a proper sense of sin, I do not
   expect that you ever will have it until the Holy Spirit gives it to
   you! Come to Him and trust Him to work it in you. Remember that
   repentance does not come before faith--it is a kind of Siamese twin
   with faith! Which comes first, I cannot tell, until you tell me which
   spoke in a wheel moves first when the whole wheel moves!

   Repentance is the lovely sister of Faith, if it is not Faith's
   first-born child. So you are not to repent, first, and then to come to
   Christ. Bring nothing to the Savior except your nothingness! Come to
   Him empty, just as you are. In a short time, some of the fruits in our
   gardens will be ripening. Suppose we have a fine apple tree, or pear
   tree, with fruit on it, quite ripe. As you stand under it, you can
   imagine that you hear it talk. Trees have a language--shall I interpret
   what that tree is saying? It says, "Baskets, bring baskets." What for?
   Here is a basket, but I dare not bring it. "Why not?" asks the tree.
   Because it is empty. If the basket were full, I would bring it. But the
   tree will say to you, "I need empty baskets, that I may fill them with
   fruit." So Jesus needs nothing of you but your emptiness--and you may
   come to Him just as you are. In fact, this is the only way to come to
   Him aright. If you live in the country, where you have an old-fashioned
   well, do you ever say to yourself, "I dare not let this bucket down
   till I fill it"? Everybody would laugh at you if you talked like that!
   You let it down empty that it may be filled! So let your empty soul
   down into the deep well of Christ's infinite merit, that it may be
   filled to the brim!

   Thus, you see, this is a happy way, and it is an accessible way. You
   can come to Christ, can you not, in such a way as

   this?

   It is, next, a way which has frequently been taken. Talking, some time
   ago, about the difficulties I had when coming to Christ, I said to some
   Brothers and Sisters present, "They were self-made difficulties. They
   were not necessary, except it was that I might know the rough road in
   order that I might the better help others." And I remember that our
   beloved and honored Brother, William Olney, said, "I never had such
   difficulties at all. I know nothing whatever about them. As a boy, I
   trusted in Christ and I found peace with God at once." I believe that
   there are hundreds and thousands of earnest Christians who simply come
   to Jesus without any particular pang of conscience, or grief of
   heart--and they are as truly

   in Christ as any of us--and their lives prove it! This is a way that
   has been frequently taken--all men are not fools-- some do take the
   straight and narrow road, by God's Grace, that leads to everlasting
   life. I pray you, therefore, my dear unconverted Hearer, especially you
   young men, and you young women, to enter the King's highway which leads
   to everlasting Glory! Hear while God speaks, believe what God says, and
   live forever!

   Is not this the Gospel way? "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." Is
   it not the right way? Where else should we look but to our Savior? What
   can we do but look, for we have nothing of our own to bring? Let us
   even now look out of ourselves to Christ and live forever! Would it not
   be a blessed circumstance if, without any further question about the
   matter, every unconverted man and woman here tonight would close in
   with Christ, crying, "I will perish, if I do perish, at the foot of the
   Cross! I will trust you, Emmanuel, the unique Savior, the one and only
   Interposer, the one Mediator who can lay His hand on God by virtue of
   His own Godhead, and on man by reason of His Manhood, and join us both
   together in a blessed league of endless amity"? May that be done for
   each one of you! Let the prayer go up from you who know the Lord, you
   who can pray--"Lord, save the whole congregation!" What a congregation
   it is! Every Sabbath, morning and night, these masses gather here!
   Lord, why do they come if You do not intend to bless them? Shall they
   come up like waves of the sea and then go rolling back, again, and
   leave not a trace behind? No, rather may some precious pearls be washed
   up on the shores of salvation, tonight, that shall adorn the crown of
   Christ forever and ever!

   But now I come to the tug of war in the other side of my subject. When
   men reject this simple and easy way of trusting Christ, then and there
   the Lord might leave them. And if He did leave them, woe would be unto
   them! There is no greater curse than that solemn sentence, "Let him
   alone." But, instead thereof, the Lord begins to take men along a rough
   road. Let me read the text again--"The Lord spoke to Manasseh, and to
   his people: but they would not listen. Therefore the Lord brought upon
   them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took
   Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him
   to Babylon." Perhaps He will do the same with you. It may be that He is
   dealing thus with some of you and here is the point where I thought it
   was likely that I might describe somebody's case very particularly.

   I. First, THE LORD OFTEN ALLOWS TEMPORAL TRIALS TO TAKE MEN CAPTIVE. It
   often happens that

   God, with a view to the salvation of men, sends them temporal trials to
   capture them, as Manasseh was taken "among the thorns." Is it so, my
   Friend, that after hearing the Gospel for years, you are still
   unconverted, and that God is now beginning no longer to speak to you
   with words, but to deal with you by blows?

   I have known persons in this case to find everything going wrong with
   them in business. It has seemed as if the current which had flowed
   toward them had suddenly dried up, or flowed backward! Do what they
   may, nothing prospers. There is a blight and a mildew on all their
   crops. They are disappointed where they had the highest hopes. Their
   speculations all turn out failures. Everything goes wrong. This is one
   of the black dogs with which the Good Shepherd fetches home His stray
   sheep--perhaps He is thus going to fetch you home. I pray that He may!

   In the case of another, the man finds himself out of work. He has
   always been able to bring in enough for the wife and the family, but
   now he is out of a job and cannot get employment. He has tramped the
   streets of London till he has worn out his boots but he cannot find
   anything to do. The table had a very scanty meal upon it, today, and
   this Sabbath has been a very sorrowful day in that home. We read of
   one, the other day, who destroyed himself because he could not bear to
   be so long without work. Do not so act, I pray you! Oh, do not think of
   such an evil course as that! Rather say to yourself, "Here is another
   of the Lord's black dogs come after me. I would not go when the
   Shepherd called me, but He means to have me, and so I am being tried in
   this way."

   If, like Jonah's gourd, your hope withers and you feel ready to faint,
   do not faint, but be of good courage--some of these rough waves may
   wash you on the Rock. I am sure I pray that they may. Come and flee
   away, flee away, flee away, now, to the God who smites you in love!
   Kiss the rod and yield yourself to Him who holds it, for these
   troublous ways are often the very ones by which the Lord brings His
   exiled children home to His heart!

   Sometimes God permits men to fall into very extraordinary troubles.
   Some of you have read the life of Mr. John Newton. As a young man you
   know how boldly wicked he was. What a shameful thing it was for him,
   the son of parents who were able to support him in comfort, to be found
   on the Gold Coast, literally a slave, with scarcely a rag to cover his
   nakedness! Yet this severe discipline was necessary. He would never
   have been the Lord's free man if he had not been man's

   slave. If he had not been brought as low as that, he might never have
   looked up to God! I have known some people get into very strange
   circumstances, so remarkable that if they were to describe them, they
   would hardly be believed--and I may be speaking to some such just now.
   Horror has taken hold upon you! Your condition has become
   indescribable, yet, perhaps, this is the only point of view from which
   your eyes will begin to see your Savior! It is strange that men should
   need to be flogged to Christ, but they do. If you will not come by the
   easy way, you shall come by the rough road. And if a call is not
   enough, you shall be made to smart--but, by His Grace, you shall come,
   for the Lord means to save you! Yield to Him, I pray you! You have the
   hook in your jaws, now, and the more you pull, the more that hook will
   tear and the more you will be made to bleed! But the great Fisherman
   will never lose you. I have come with the landing net, to see what can
   be done to get you safely on the bank. Oh, for almighty Grace to make
   your sharpest trials the surest way of saving your soul!

   Very frequently does it happen that persons are dealt with by bodily
   affliction. One said that he would never have seen Christ if he had not
   been blinded. It was only when his eyesight failed that, by faith, he
   looked to his Savior. Another, who had lost both his legs, declared
   that it was the best thing that ever happened to him, for he could no
   longer go with his evil companions in the ways of amusement and folly.
   He was brought to the House of God and there the Lord met with him! So
   the doctor tells you that your lungs are affected and, he says, he
   hardly thinks that you will recover. God is speaking to you somewhat
   roughly by that dread disease, but listen to its voice! Let the
   consumption warn you that your sin should be consumed! Many and many a
   time, headache and heartache have brought sufferers to their knees and
   made them turn to God. If I am addressing any who are in the
   condition--most pitiable and sad--of being likely to end their days in
   the hospital, let me interpret to them the voice of God in this trying
   dispensation--"Turn you, turn you to Him that smites you; turn at once
   unto the Lord, and live."

   Another very likely means by which God takes men among the thorns and
   brings them to Himself, is the loss of dear friends. A dying mother, in
   her death, has been mother in a spiritual sense to those whom she
   brought forth naturally. How often has a wife beckoned her husband to
   Heaven! And the dear children of London who die so numerously, are
   among the ablest missionaries of the Cross! How they speak to the
   father's heart! How the mother is moved as she remembers little Jane
   and the hymn she sang when she came home from Sunday school. And what
   little Harry said about meeting mother with Jesus in Heaven! God often
   brings men and women to Himself by taking their children from them.
   There was a sheep that would not follow the shepherd, so He stooped
   down and took the lamb up in His bosom, and walked away with it--and
   then the mother followed bleating after him. May it be so with all of
   you who have lost dear children! May you follow that gentle Jesus who
   has gathered your lambs into His bosom in Heaven! But you do not want
   to lose your children, do you? No, and you do not want to lose your
   wife or your mother. Then follow Jesus without needing such trials.

   In brief, all I have been saying amounts to this--take the old road by
   the Cross of Christ and do not need to have your path strewn with
   thorns! Come to Jesus just as you are, and come now! Spirit of God,
   draw them! I feel that my words are so feeble when I talk to you about
   this great salvation. What can I do? If you are to be saved, the arm of
   God must be revealed--and then the work will be done!

   II. I am going, now, a step farther. Manasseh was not only taken "among
   the thorns," but he was "bound with fetters." So The LORD SOMETIMES
   PERMITS MEN TO BE BOUND BY MENTAL TRIALS.

   All other trials put together can never be compared with mental trials.
   I mean such as these. For instance, when sin ceases to afford pleasure.
   The man used to be a very jovial companion. He could sing a comic song
   and he was fine company, but, all of a sudden, he lost all that
   pleasure and he could enjoy it no longer. If he is taken to the
   theater, it seems all hollow to him. He went only a few nights, ago,
   and when he came back, he said, "Pooh! Call that amusement? It is worse
   than hard work." The very things that once made him all aglow with
   delight do not affect him, now, nor cast a single ray of light on his
   path! He has lost all zeal for that which he once loved in the way of
   sinning!

   Beside that, his daily avocation has become distasteful. He used to
   take an interest in his business, but he has no pleasure in it now--it
   seems a mechanical drudgery. His life has turned into a treadmill, all
   hard work without an atom of joy. Friend, if this is your case, God is
   dealing with you! He knows how to pull your proud spirit down. He can
   bring your gaiety into the very dust and you, who danced and reveled,
   the other day, will mourn in sackcloth and ashes when He begins to
   visit you.

   Worse, even, than this, your old sins come out of their hiding places.
   You buried them long ago. You forgot all about them. You never thought
   of seeing any more of them, but now they haunt you, those ghosts of
   your former sins! You are like a man on one of the Russian plains when
   the snow has fallen deeply. The wolves, your old sins, are after
   you--you have tried to drive hard and you have given up one habit after
   another to the wolves, but here they come! You can hear their howl
   behind you! You will have to give up something more and on you speed,
   lashing the coursers of your resolution, yet you cannot escape from the
   cruel pack! They are upon you, they will tear you in pieces! Even when
   you are asleep, you hear them in your dreams. When you wake in the
   morning, you can still hear them. I remember when, at night, I used to
   dream of Hell. And when I woke in the morning, and all day long, I had
   a horrible remembrance of my past iniquities which I could not put
   away. Are you getting fettered like this? If so, I cannot say that I
   regret it, for, so long as you are saved, I shall not mind the
   roughness of the road if you will not come by a smoother one!

   It may be that you have great inability in prayer. I heard you say
   "Why, I can pray when I like!" Can you? "Oh, we have only to say, 'God
   have mercy upon us!' and all will be right." Yes, but you do not find
   it so now, do you? You have been praying, but you have not been heard.
   You have cried to God, but you find no peace. You have gone on
   pleading, but you have found no rest. This is where you are now, with
   an iron Heaven above that reverberates with your cry. Ah, poor Soul,
   yours is a sorrowful condition, but this is the way they must go who
   will not take the easier road to Heaven! If God means to save you, He
   will save you even thus, as you will not hear His voice and live.

   I daresay, too, that now you feel a great need ofpower to grasp the
   promises. If, in preaching, I say anything dreadful, you will believe
   it and take it home to yourself. If there is a threat, you will cry,
   "Ah, that is true! That is true to me!" But when I utter a sweet word
   of encouragement, you say, "Oh, I dare not take that! It would be too
   presumptuous." And when a glorious promise is set before you, you say,
   "I wish that I could appropriate that, but it is too good to be true to
   me." I am only telling you what I have gone through, myself, therefore
   I can speak, I was going to say, as one who knows every inch of the
   ground. Oh, what a fool I was that I did not believe in Christ the
   straight way, but that I must need to go round this road of learning my
   own nothingness and powerlessness--and learning it by a painful and
   bitter experience!

   And, dear Friend, if I understand your position, you have a fear of
   death and a dread of judgment upon you. "Oh," you say within yourself,
   "the wrath to come, the wrath to come!" It is no use for anybody to
   preach to you the new and false doctrine, you know very well that--

   "There is a dreadful Hell,"

   for you have the premonition of it in your own conscience, and you
   cannot rest because of it! Well, well, this is the way by which the
   Lord will drive you to Himself! The captains of the host of the king of
   Assyria have taken you among the thorns, bound you with fetters and
   brought you down to Babylon. You seem to be under the cruel dominion of
   Satan-- you hear about Zion, but you are carried away to Babylon--you
   are an exile in a strange land!

   There is one thing I want to say to you, and then I will turn away from
   this point. If you are in the power of the enemy, but you are not
   willingly there, you will get away from it. You remember Mr. Bunyan's
   description of Giant Slay-Good? He would go up and down the heavenly
   road leading to the Celestial City and lay hold of the pilgrims, one by
   one, to take them into his den and pick their bones. But Mr.
   Feeble-Mind said that if they did not come there willingly, and if they
   needed to escape, they would escape. Now I want you to gather comfort
   out of that Truth of God. You do not want to be a slave to Satan. You
   do not wish to remain in doubt and fear, do you? "Want to remain as I
   am?" you say, "I would give my right hand to get out of this cruel
   bondage! I would yield both my eyes with cheerfulness if the Light of
   God might, thereby, come into my soul." You need not give up your hands
   or your eyes! And you shall not perish--you shall not die, but live!
   The Lord speaks comfort to you from this story of Manasseh in Babylon.

   Listen to two or three observations and then I will close. In order to
   your comfort and peace, first, know that the Lord is God. You did not
   know it. You refused to know it, but know it now. When the Lord comes
   to try conclusions with a man, and puts out His almighty power, it is
   not long before that man will know that Jehovah is God, indeed! If we
   learn it quickly, as Manasseh did--"Then Manasseh knew that the Lord,
   He was God"--it will be for our salvation. But if we are very slow in
   learning it, like Pharaoh was, we shall have to learn it all the same,
   but it will be to our destruction! "Who is the Lord? Who is the Lord?"
   asked Pharaoh. The Lord soon gave him an answer, for the water was
   turned into blood and the frogs were even in his majesty's bed-chamber!

   "Who is the Lord?" Listen to the thunder! Hear the rattling of the
   hail! Sit still in the darkness, the darkness that might be felt!
   Pharaoh began to make a shrewd guess as to who Jehovah was and he
   pulled in his horns a good deal, and promised to yield this, and yield
   that. But by the time Jehovah's 10TH bolt had been launched against
   him, and his firstborn son was dead, then he knew who God was! Remember
   the result of that great battle and see who it is against Whom you are
   contending. Throw down your weapons! Put an end to such a mad warfare!
   Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth, but let not a
   man contend with his Maker!

   That done, humble yourself before the Lord as Manasseh did. The lower
   you lie before God, the better. Stretch yourself flat down upon His
   promise. Have no pleas, make no excuses. Down, Sir, down! You cannot
   lie too low. Off with those feathers of pride! Remember how God said to
   the children of Israel, "Put off your ornaments from you, that I may
   know what to do to you." Fling away all thoughts of pride and human
   merit, and put a rope around your neck! Come before God like a
   condemned criminal who only owes his present absence out of Hell to
   infinite, unspeakable mercy! Now you are getting where God can bless
   you! It is impossible to pardon a man unless he is guilty. I insult him
   if I offer to forgive him for an offense he never committed. But you
   are guilty before God! Then confess your iniquity and transgression,
   and come before the Lord with penitent acknowledgments of all your
   wanderings out of the way of holiness.

   What next? Well, do as Manasseh did, begin to pray. Cry mightily unto
   the Lord, but do, also, this thing, as I have twice bid you,
   tonight--"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." I
   do not wonder that the Church of Rome puts up the cross everywhere. It
   becomes idolatry to worship a symbol; but if the symbol did no more
   than remind us of a Crucified Savior, that might be a different matter,
   for it is a Crucified Savior that we need always to remember. Christ
   died for sinners. Christ died, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to
   God. "In due time, Christ died for the ungodly."

   Now, look this way, look to Jesus. Do not look 20 ways, look only this
   one way. The Son of God, the Son of Man, bore sin in His own body on
   the tree. I have often seen, upon crosses in Italy, these words, "Spes
   unica," the unique hope, the only hope of a sinner. Salvation is all in
   Christ! It is not what you are, nor what you ever will be--your hope
   lies in Jesus Christ--dead, buried, risen again, pleading at the right
   hand of God, coming again in Glory! Rest there, my beloved Hearer! Rest
   there, now, whether you have come by the old original right way, or
   have come over hedge and ditch as I did, through the thorns and through
   the sea! So long as you get to Christ, I care very little how you come.
   "What is the right way of coming to Christ?" asked one. Well, if you
   get to Him at all, any way is the right way and, after all, there is no
   long journey to take to get to Christ! Where you are, tonight. Where
   you sit in that pew or those aisles, look to Jesus by faith and the
   great transaction is done--and you are saved!

   What do I mean by your being saved--that you will thereby escape Hell?
   You will do that, but I am not talking about Hell just now. You will
   escape from the power of sin--that is something far more to be thought
   of. You will escape from the love of sin and from a life of sin.
   Holiness will be worked in you. You will be born a child of God. May
   the Lord grant it to every one of you! If the Savior were to say to me,
   tonight, "I will give you every soul but one in the Tabernacle, and you
   are to pick out the one that is to be lost," I would not pick one of
   those little girls over yonder and, as I look round this gallery, I
   would not select any of you old gentlemen, nor the young ones, either.
   Where would I find the soul that would be lost? I thank God that I am
   not condemned to make such a terrible choice as that! But, I pray you,
   do not make it yourself! Do not make it yourself! May God in mercy lead
   you to say, "If there is only one soul that will look to Christ,
   tonight, I will be that one." While I stop a minute, look, look, LOOK.
   Look to Jesus, look and live! And to His dear name shall be the praise
   forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 38.

   A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. Remember, although this is a
   very sorrowful Psalm, it was written by a man of God. It will show you
   what a terrible thing sin must be, for even a child of God feels the
   smart of it very grievously. This is not the language of an unforgiven
   sinner--it is the cry of a saint who, for a while, has sinned and is
   feeling the bitterness of his transgression.

   Verse 1. O Lord, rebuke me not in Your wrath. "If You do rebuke me, O
   Lord, do it gently! Be not angry with me, for I cannot bear it, I shall
   die under it. O Lord, rebuke me not in Your wrath."

   1. Neither chasten me in Your hot displeasure. "Chasten me, it will do
   me good; it is necessary; it is profitable; but not in Your
   displeasure, certainly not in Your hot displeasure." The man of God is
   more afraid of God's anger than he is of suffering. He does not object
   to affliction--what he does fear is any degree of the wrath of God in
   the chastisement.

   2. For Your arrows stick fast in me. Does God shoot at His own
   children? Yes, but only that He may kill the sin in them. And He knows
   how to make His arrows stick, and stick fast, too, in His own dear
   children. The Lord hates sin with a perfect hatred. Even when sin was
   laid on Christ, even though it was none of His, yet the Father forsook
   Him. He will not endure sin anywhere, but He hates it most in those
   whom He loves most--"Your arrows stick fast in me."

   2. And Your hand presses me sorely. As if God's hand pressed heavily
   upon the soul of David. I remind you again that this was a man of God
   who thus cried out. If any of you, who are not the children of God, are
   feeling the heavy hand of the Lord on account of your sin, do not
   wonder at it. If His own children do not escape the rod, He is not
   likely to spare you! See into what a terrible condition David came, as
   he tells us in the third verse.

   3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger. He felt as
   if his very flesh was decaying, rotting, dissolving, and that there was
   no soundness in it. When God deals with men in a way of anger, they
   cannot stand against Him any more than the wax can resist the heat of
   the furnace. Beware, I pray you, that you provoke not God's eternal
   wrath in Hell, for even here it is not to be borne! What will it be
   when mercy's gate is closed? "There is no soundness in my flesh because
   of Your anger."

   3. Neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. His very
   bones suffered through his sin. He could not rest, he turned over and
   over in his bed, but he could not find a place soft enough to lie upon
   in peace. Sin will make any man's bones ache when once his conscience
   is really quickened and, with David, he will cry, "There is no rest in
   my bones because of my sin."

   4. For my iniquities are gone over my head. David was like a man who
   has sunk seven fathoms deep! Big waves of iniquity rolled over him and
   he saw no light, no hope, no way of escape.

   4. As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. It is a great mercy
   when sin is a burden, for, when it becomes too heavy for us to bear,
   Christ will bear it! A man is in an evil case when he finds no burden
   in sin, when he thinks he is quite able to bear it himself! But he to
   whom sin is an insupportable, intolerable load, is already on the road
   to mercy. See how the Psalmist goes on to show that his case is still
   worse.

   5. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. He got to
   be so bad that he could not bear himself! His sorrow on account of his
   folly had made him feel as if he were a corrupt being, like one
   suffering with a foul cancer, unfitted for the company of his
   friends--"My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness."
   As I read that verse, it brings up memories of my own state of mind
   before I found the Savior. Look at the title of the Psalm--"To bring to
   remembrance." That is just what it has done with me. Perhaps it is
   doing the same with some of you.

   6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
   long. I again remind you that this is a child of God, a man who had
   enjoyed the Light of God's Countenance, and yet he was in this sad
   state. Do not utterly condemn yourselves. Do not say that you are not
   the people of God because you are troubled in heart. But if you really
   are not God's people as yet, but only seekers after Him, do not wonder
   if sin greatly grieves and vexes you.

   7-9. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no
   soundness in my flesh. I am feeble and sorely broken: I have roared by
   reason of the disquietness of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before
   You The first beam of comfort comes in here. "Lord, I am almost at
   death's door, yet You know my desire; I do not love sin, I wish to be a
   true Believer, I desire to be holy. Lord, all my desire is before You.
   You can read it as if it were written in a book. I need not speak, for
   I would only spoil my case with my words; but all my desire is before
   You."

   9. And my groaning is not hid from You. "I can hide my groaning in a
   measure from my fellow creatures. I try to suppress my moans when
   anybody is near, but my groaning is not hid from You." Thank God there
   is not a tear in any eye but God sees it, nor a groan in any heart but
   God hears it! Make much of this Truth of God and find sweet consolation
   in it.

   10. My heart pants. That is the best sort of prayer in all the world,
   when there are no words, but in silence there is a panting and longing
   after God! We cannot explain what this panting is, but if you have ever
   seen a hunted stag panting for breath, you have some idea what David
   meant when he said, "My heart pants."

   10. My strength fails me. That is good prayer, too. "When I am weak,
   then am I strong." When I cannot pray, I do pray. When my strength
   fails me, then God's strength comes in to help me.

   10, 11. As for the sight of my eyes, it also is gone from me. My lovers
   and my friends stand alooffrom my sores and my kinsmen stand afar off.
   If you have ever had much trouble, you will find that your friends are
   rather scarce at such times. Friends are very much like swallows--they
   twitter about us in the summer and they build their nests under our
   eaves-- but where are they in the winter? Ah, where are they? You may
   ask the question, but who can answer it? Sorrow is not a thing which
   attracts company. Men naturally hide themselves from grieving
   companions. So David says, "My lovers and my friends stand aloof from
   my sores and my kinsmen stand afar off."

   12,13. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
   that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the
   day long. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
   opens not his mouth. It is a fine thing, when you are slandered, not to
   hear it. And it is a better thing to never reply to it. I have always
   tried to possess one deaf ear and one blind eye--and I believe that the
   deaf ear is the better ear, and the blind eye by far the more useful of
   the two! Do not remember the injury that is done to you, try to forget
   it and pass it over. Do not go about the world determined to grasp
   every red-hot iron that any fool holds out before you. Let it alone! It
   will be for your own good and for God's Glory to be very patient under
   the slander of the wicked.

   14, 15. Thus I was as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth are no
   reproofs. For in You, O LORD, do I hope: You will hear, O Lord my God.
   So the Psalmist, by his example, encourages you to take your troubles
   to God, and not to handle them yourselves. Spread them before Him and
   trust in Him to deliver you in His own time and way.

   16-21. For I said, hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
   when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me. For I am ready
   to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. For I will declare my
   iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. But my enemies are lively, and
   they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. They
   also that render evil for good are my adversaries; because I follow the
   thing that is good. Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from
   me. The persecuted Psalmist resorts to his God. Let us do the same when
   we, also, are persecuted for righteousness' sake.

   22. Make haste to help me, O lord my Salvation. David's case is urgent
   and his plea is earnest. If we are in a like case, let us also cry,
   "Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation."

The Drawings Of Divine Love

   (No. 2386)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 26, 1888.

   "No man can come to Me, except the Father who sent Me draws him and I
   will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets, 'And
   they shall all be taught by God.' Therefore, everyone who has heard,
   and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me." John 6:44,45.

   THERE is something here which troubles many seeking souls. They hear
   the Gospel preached in this manner, "Look and live," or, "Believe on
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." This comforts them and
   they say to themselves, "This is a way in which we can run. We delight
   to be told of salvation by faith in Christ." By-and-by, they hear a
   discourse upon our Savior's Words, "You must be born again," or they
   listen to descriptions of the inward experience of a child of God. They
   are taught that there must be a brokenness of heart before there can be
   a true binding up. There must be a stripping before there can be a
   clothing. There must be death before there can be resurrection and then
   they say to themselves, "This, we fear, is true. But how different it
   is from the message we heard the other day! Are there two things
   equally true--salvation by simple faith in Christ--and yet the
   necessity of a new heart and a right spirit?"

   They are equally true, and they ought to be preached with equal
   clearness, and equal earnestness! But I would say to every seeker, "You
   will find it very injurious to get worrying yourself with such
   difficulties as these. As a rule, you had better leave those questions
   for another day." Suppose that you were puzzled concerning specific
   gravity, the weight of a body in water? if you were a drowning man, I
   would recommend you to waive the consideration of such a subject till
   you were safely on shore! It is hardly the time, I think, to enter into
   difficult disquisitions while you are in grave peril. And, in like
   manner, you may leave many theological questions until, by faith in
   Christ, you are saved. Then, going into His school, you may ask Him to
   teach you these other more advanced lessons.

   Now, for your help, I desire to say that these two doctrines of
   Salvation by Faith and the Inward Drawing of the Spirit of God are
   equally true and, unless they are proclaimed in due proportion,
   mischief may come from the preaching of either the one, or the other. I
   think that when the preacher only says, "Believe, believe, believe,
   believe, believe, believe," mischief may come of that imperfect
   declaration, for it is a one-sided form of the Truth of God, and other
   important Truths of God may be forgotten, and men may get into a
   superficial habit of imagining that they believe when they hardly know
   what it is that they believe--and their faith is not the living faith
   of God's elect which works by love, purifies the soul and sanctifies
   the life!

   On the other hand, I am quite sure that you may preach the need of
   inward experience and preach it very thoroughly and continually. But if
   this other matter of faith is left out, you may preach some of your
   hearers into despair, many of them into indifference and others of them
   into a kind of self-righteousness of feelings! I have met with persons
   who were certainly trusting in their feelings and who went so far as to
   condemn others because they had not endured the same amount of misery
   and passed through the same conviction of sin, or indulged in the same
   agony of despair. Truths of God are preached, we shall not stop to
   reconcile them--there is no need to do so, especially if they reconcile
   themselves to you while we preach! If the two doctrines are preached,
   they will act as a balance, the one to the other, and while men hear
   our Savior say, "He that believes on Me has everlasting life," they
   will not misunderstand what He says if they also hear as the deep bass
   note of that musical scale the equally Divine utterance, "You must be
   born again."

   The text gives us good help upon this subject. I do not believe that
   there are any practical difficulties in the matter at all. I say,
   practical difficulties, for there are philosophical difficulties. Is
   there any subject about which there are not phi-

   losophical difficulties? Can you not, if you think of anything--be it
   the most commonplace fact in natural history, very soon surround it
   with a cloud of obscurity which nobody can remove? A fool can set a
   stool where a wise man will tumble over it and you can soon raise a
   difficulty if you want to. Here is one. There is a bullock in the
   meadow and there is also a sheep in the same pasture. They will both
   eat grass and on the bullock that grass will turn to hair, and on the
   sheep it will turn to wool. How come? Can you tell me? No, and I do not
   want to know. It may be a very interesting point for discussion, but,
   practically there is no difficulty about it. Those who tan the leather,
   or those who dye the wool are not hindered in the least degree in their
   handicraft by the philosophical difficulty I have mentioned! So, there
   are philosophical difficulties about this matter of simple faith and
   salvation by it, and of the Spirit's work and the necessity for it,
   but, practically, there is no difficulty at all, for the man who
   believes in Christ Jesus is born again! And every man who is born again
   believes in the Lord Jesus Christ! The two things come together, live
   together and are perfected together!

   However, for the help of some sincere seekers after Christ who may be
   in perplexity, I will speak about this matter that troubles them. Let
   me read the text again--"No man can come to Me, except the Father who
   sent Me draws him: and I will raise him up at the last day. It is
   written in the Prophets, 'And they shall all be taught by God.'
   Therefore, everyone who has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes
   unto Me."

   I. Our first observation upon this text is that THE ALL-IMPORTANT
   MATTER OF FAITH IS A VERY SIMPLE BUSINESS. Twice is it mentioned here,
   and the only definition of it that is given is coming to Christ--"No
   man can come to Me." And, again, in the 45th verse, "Comes unto Me."

   Faith in Christ is simply and truly described as coming to Him. It is
   not an acrobatic feat--it is simply a coming to Christ. It is not an
   exercise of profound mental faculties--it is coming to Christ. A child
   comes to his mother. A blind man comes to his home. Even an animal
   comes to his master. Coming is a very simple action, indeed. It seems
   to have only two things about it. One is, to come away from something,
   and the other is, to come to something.

   In coming to Christ Jesus as our Savior, we first come away from all
   other trusts. We leave all other confidences right behind us and come
   away from them altogether. My own works? I must come away from all
   trust in them, to Christ! My own feelings? I must come away from all
   reliance upon them, to Christ! Ceremonies, forms, rites, yes, even such
   as God has given, I must come away from all confidence in them and I
   must come to Jesus, quitting and leaving them all! You cannot come to
   Jesus and yet hold on to your old trusts. You cannot come to Jesus and
   yet cling to your old sins. You must come away from righteous self as
   well as from sinful self. To go to a place, I must go from a place. If
   you would come to Christ, you must bid, "good-bye," to your old sins
   and say, "farewell," to your old confidences. Are you ready to sue for
   a divorce between your soul and sin, between your soul and
   self-confidence? That is the first essential thing in coming to
   Christ--leaving all other trusts.

   Then the other part of coming is drawing near to Christ to obtain
   everything we need. When we truly come to Christ, we draw near to Him.
   We do not any longer neglect Him, we do not look away from Him--on the
   contrary, we begin to think much of Him, our hopes center in Him and,
   having thought of Him, and so having come mentally to Him, we trust in
   Him. We come to Him for what He is. Is He a Savior? We come to Him that
   He may save us! Does He wash away sin? We come to Him that He may wash
   away our sin! Does He heal spiritual diseases? We come to Him that He
   may heal us of our diseases! You know what is meant by coming to such
   and such a physician. You must, in that same sense, come to Jesus
   Christ, the Divine Physician, for sin-sick souls.

   This expression, coming to Christ, is so simple that I do not know how
   to make it any plainer. I am afraid that if I were to try to explain
   it, I might be like Thomas Scott when he wrote his notes to Bunyan's
   Pilgrim's Progress. Going round his parish, he found a woman who had
   The Pilgrim's Progress with his notes. "My good woman," he asked, "do
   you understand The Pilgrim's Progress?" "Yes, Scott, I understand The
   Pilgrim's Progress very well and I hope that, one day, I may be able to
   understand your explanation of it." I will not attempt to explain any
   further what coming to Christ is, lest I should not succeed any better
   than Mr. Scott did! It ought to be clear to everybody that coming from
   something, and coming to something, or someone, constitute the act of
   coming. Quit, then, both sin and self by determined resolve, and come
   to Jesus--rest in Him, take Him to be everything to you--and then
   believe that you have everlasting life, according to His declaration,
   "He that believes on Me has everlasting life."

   Yet our Savior does, in close connection with this text, give us
   another illustration of what faith is. Faith is coming to Christ. It is
   also eating or receiving Christ. A man has a piece of bread in his
   hand. He does not know where the wheat

   grew, nor in what mill it was ground, nor in what oven the bread was
   baked, but he knows that it is bread and that he is hungry. Nature,
   especially living nature, abhors a vacuum, so the man determines to
   fill the vacuum within with that piece of bread! What does he do, but
   eat it? You do not have to teach children how to eat. I said to a
   little boy this afternoon, "Why don't you put your bread and butter in
   your ear?" Of course, he knew better than to act like that, so all he
   did was to laugh at me! And you never yet met with a child who took to
   putting the bread and butter in his ear--he puts it in his mouth and
   eats it. So, there really is, if you would but use it, sense enough
   within you to understand what faith in Christ is. If you were not so
   ready to confound and confuse yourself, my dear Friend, you might know
   what faith is!

   You tell me that it puzzles you. I think that it is you that puzzles
   yourself, not faith that puzzles you. When you get bread, you put it
   into your mouth, you eat it and let it go down into yourself. You may
   not know much about the processes that are going on within you and you
   need not want to know. If you do not understand anything about them,
   the bread will feed you just as well. Now, in that way take the Lord
   Jesus Christ into you, spiritually, and feed upon Him. Say from your
   heart, "Lord, I live upon You. I believe You to be God. I believe that
   You did take our nature. I trust You as the Incarnate God. I believe
   that You did suffer in the place of guilty men. I believe that You have
   put away the sin of all those who trust You, and put it away forever so
   that they can never be condemned. I trust You to be my Savior,
   altogether and solely my Savior." If you really do that, you are saved.

   "How do I know it?" says one. Because Christ says it--is not that
   enough? "He that believes on Me has everlasting life." "But I have not
   felt any strange sensations! I have had no wonderful dreams." What? Are
   you asking for such signs as those? Is not Christ's Word, "He that
   believes on Me has everlasting life," enough for you? Lord, I believe
   on You. Therefore, I have everlasting life. Your Word is enough for me!

   That is my first point, faith is a very simple matter.

   II. But, secondly, TO THIS FAITH MEN ARE GREATLY DISINCLINED. He who
   knew most about men says of them, "No man can come to Me, except the
   Father who sent Me draws him."

   Men are grievously disinclined to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Their unwillingness is so great that it amounts to an inability of this
   sort, that, as there are none so deaf as those that will not hear, and
   none so blind as those that will not see, so there are none so unable
   as those who are unwilling! And the Savior thus puts it, "No man can
   come to Me, except the Father who sent me draws him."

   But why are men so unwilling to believe in the Lord Jesus? In Christ's
   lifetime on earth, their unwillingness arose partly because He was of
   such lowly origin. They said, "We know Joseph, and Mary, and the
   brethren of Jesus. How can we believe in Him as the Messiah?" He was so
   poor, so obscure, He came of a family that was not notable in Israel as
   far as they knew. Besides, He came out of Nazareth and they asked, "Can
   any good thing come out of Nazareth?" He was a Galilean and they could
   not look up to one who came from that despised region.

   In addition to that, all His teaching was opposed to their proud
   notions. If He had come as an earthly king, to overthrow the Roman
   power, they might have believed in Him, but, as He was, they regarded
   Him as a root out of a dry ground. They could see nothing illustrious
   about the Man of Sorrows, so they would not believe in Him. And numbers
   of people, to this day, do not receive Christ because faith in Him is
   not fashionable. True godliness is not held in high repute in the upper
   circles of society. O simpletons, to lose your souls for the sake of a
   little worldly grandeur! God save us all from such insanity as that!

   The more common reason why men are not saved by faith in Christ is
   because they do not see any need of a Savior. I know you very well, my
   dear Mr. Good-Enough, and my dear Friend, Mr. Too-Good! You do not
   believe that you need saving--you think that you have as much as you
   ought to have of everything that is good, and even some to give away!
   Oh, yes, you hope to enter Heaven with all sails up. What will you do
   when you get there? The redeemed ones are all singing that they have
   washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. But
   you will have to go up in a corner, by yourself, and hold your tongue,
   because you had not anything that needed to be washed and you were,
   yourself, perfectly clean! You would not be happy in Heaven, for the
   very Glory of that blissful place is the Lamb of God and His precious
   blood is the theme of continual thanksgiving! I pray God to bring you
   out of your miserable delusion, for it is no better than that. You are
   not the good man that you think you are--you are stained with sin from
   head to foot--and unless you are washed in the Divinely-provided bath,
   even in the atoning blood of Jesus, you will perish in your sin!

   But many do not come to Christ and trust Him because they will not
   receive the doctrine of Substitution. Christ's dying in the sinners'
   place, the Just for the unjust, to bring them to God, they will not
   have--they kick at it! I assure you that you will never have rest and
   peace till you accept that blessed soul-saving doctrine, for other
   foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, even Jesus Christ
   the Righteous, and there is no Jesus Christ to trust in except the
   glorious Substitute who bore our sins in His own body on the tree! Oh,
   that men would not be so foolish as to reject God's plan of salvation
   by the vicarious Atonement once offered on Calvary!

   Many also refuse the Savior because they are occupied with other
   things. They cannot come to Christ because their farm, their
   merchandise, their newly-married wife, or something or other, keeps
   them back. Oh, how long some of you have been waiting--some of you who
   have attended the Tabernacle, too, all the time! If anybody had said,
   20 years ago, that you would be sitting in your pew an unconverted man,
   tonight, you were not willing to have believed it! You will probably be
   sitting in that pew, an unconverted man, in 20 more years' time, I
   fear--you will either be saved, or you will have gone the way of all
   flesh! Oh, that the day would come when there shall be no more
   hesitation, no more postponement, but when you would, from your heart,
   say, "I must have Christ. I will trust Him!" Say even now what we have
   often sung--

   "I do believe, I will believe, That Jesus died for me! That on the
   Cross He shed His blood, From sin to set me free."

   There are many more who do not exercise simple faith in Christ because
   they do not like the consequences of it. "Why," says one, "if I become
   a Believer in Christ, I shall have to give up my old ways." You will.
   "If I become a follower of the Lamb, I cannot go where I now go." Quite
   right! I am glad you see that. I hope that you are not such a hypocrite
   as to imagine that you can trust Christ to put away your past sin and
   then go on living in sin as you have done. That will never do! Christ
   has opened a hospital for the sick, but it is that He may heal them! He
   receives sinners, but not that they may remain sinners--it is that He
   may make saints of them and deliver them from sin! You will never come
   to Christ as long as you are in love with sin. And you are so much in
   love with sin that you never will come at all except Omnipotent Grace
   shall draw you! And so says our Lord Jesus Christ, "No man can come to
   Me, except the Father who sent Me draws

   him."

   There are many others who cannot trust in Christ and cannot come to Him
   because they wish for certain feelings or emotions. You want to
   experience amazing changes that you may know that God is at work in
   your soul, do you? Well, I do not wonder at that desire, but please
   notice what is said in the 46th verse, "Not that any man has seen the
   Father." The work of God in the heart is not seen by the soul until,
   first of all, the soul sees Jesus Christ! You must not think that you
   can deal with an absolute God. Apart from Christ, you cannot approach
   God, and God operating upon your heart, without faith in Christ, will
   not be the ground of any comfort to you. Whatever God may be doing in
   you, or may not be doing in you, is not the thing that you are to look
   to as the foundation of your hope! Your trust is to be in Christ's work
   on the Cross, and in nothing else! You shall see plenty of evidences,
   miracles and signs, by-and-by, but, to begin with, the

   Gospel for you is, "Believe, believe, believe." "I could believe if_."
   Oh, yes! I see, the ground of your confidence is

   that, "if," not God's Word. "Oh, Sir, but I could trust God's Word if
   I_." Ah, that is the same thing, over again!

   You see, it is not God's Word that you trust--it is that rotten, "if,"
   to which you cling! Now, away with it, away with it, I pray you! Either
   call God a liar, or else believe Him. It must be one of the two! But do
   not pretend that you would believe Him under certain conditions that
   you would like to impose. If a man said to me that he would believe me
   under certain conditions, I would understand at once that he did not
   really believe me at all. That, in fact, he could not believe me, but
   he would believe somebody else, and perhaps trust me under cover of
   that other person. That would not be faith in me at all and, I pray
   you, deal not with the Lord in such a fashion!

   So, you see, dear Friends, my text plainly teaches us that men are
   greatly disinclined to come to Jesus.

   III. Therefore, THE OPERATIONS OF GOD ON THE SOUL ALL RUN IN THE WAY OF
   LEADING MEN TO

   COME TO JESUS. That is clear if you read the text, "No man can come to
   Me, except the Father who sent Me draws

   him."

   You see, first, the Father inclines us to come to Christ. "It is
   written in the Prophets, 'And they shall all be taught by God.'" What
   are they taught? "Therefore, everyone who has heard, and has learned of
   the Father, comes unto Me." It is

   clear that the drift of the Divine operations in the heart of man is
   towards Christ. The Lord draws us, but all His drawings are towards
   Christ. If you think that you have experienced the work of the Holy
   Spirit in your heart, and yet it does not draw you towards Christ, you
   have made a mistake. The Spirit always draws away from self and away
   from sin, to Jesus Christ, alone! If you are drawn that way, it is the
   Lord who draws you, for all His drawings are in that direction.

   Then, next, the drift of all God's teachings is this way. Whatever the
   Spirit of God teaches a man, the end and objective of that teaching is
   to get him away from self and draw him to Christ. All the teachings of
   affliction are intended to make us sick of self and fond of Christ. All
   the true teachings of the Christian ministry aim at putting down self
   and exalting Christ!

   All the drawings and all the teachings, then, that come from God, are
   towards Christ. By this test you may try everything that professes to
   be a Divine operation. If any man says, "I am the subject of the work
   of the Spirit of God," and he does not exalt Christ, tell him that he
   is not the subject of the Spirit's work at all. If he comes to you with
   some fine idea about himself, making out that he is some great one, say
   to yourself, "It is no part of the work of the Spirit to set up any man
   as a great one. His work is to take of the things of Christ and show
   them to us." The Holy Spirit addicts Himself to the glorifying of
   Christ, so He withers our false hopes and gives us true hopes! He does
   this in order that Christ may be lifted up and that we may be drawn to
   Him.

   I believe that this is the test of all kinds of preaching. Does a man
   come with a Divine message to my soul? I will try him by this test.
   Does he lift up Christ? Does he draw me to trust in Christ? Does he
   draw me to love Christ? Does he draw me to be like Christ? Well and
   good! I will hear some more of what that man says, but if, Sunday after
   Sunday, I have to say, "They have taken away my Lord and I know not
   where they have laid Him," I say, "Good-bye, Sir, other people may
   listen to you, but you are not the man that I want to hear." I must
   have Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ first, last, Alpha, Omega,
   beginning, middle, end and all through, or else I cannot believe that
   the teaching is of God, for the Father draws to Christ and teaches
   concerning Christ.

   Further, He makes us to hear and to learn that we may come to Christ.
   Come, then, my dear Hearers! I think that I have now brought you a
   little into the Light of God. You say that you must be the subject of a
   Divine operation. Are you looking to Christ? Then you have had that
   Divine operation performed upon you, for it makes you look to Christ,
   alone! "Is believing an easy thing?" asks one. It is the easiest thing
   in the world! It is as easy as coming, or as eating. "Well, but why is
   it so difficult for me?" Probably it is difficult because it is so
   easy. I believe that faith is a hard thing to many because it is not a
   hard thing. It is just like Naaman's washing in the Jordan--if the
   Prophet had bid him do some great thing, some difficult thing, he would
   have done it. But when he said nothing but, "Wash, and be clean,"
   Naaman felt that he was too great to go to the River Jordan and too
   clean to go and wash. He is a nobleman and a gentleman--is he to go and
   wash like any pig?

   Yes, he is, and only so can he be cleansed, for his leprosy makes him
   as foul as any swine could be and he must, therefore, wash if he would
   be clean! You, though you are the queen of morality, must trust in
   Christ just as a harlot must trust in Christ! And you, young man,
   though you are, in all things, noble and excellent, you must come and
   believe in Christ just as a thief must do, or else you can never come
   where that dying thief, is, who passed with Christ into Paradise! There
   is but one door--will you bow your head and enter? There is only one
   way of salvation--will you run along it? If not, if you will put your
   goodness before Christ, it shall become as bad as a crime or infamy,
   itself! God grant that the operations of the Holy Spirit may lead you
   up to simple faith in Jesus!

   IV. So, then, I finish with this fourth point. IF WE HAVE COME TO
   JESUS, WE NEED NOT QUESTION OUR

   SAFETY. Christ says, "He that believes on Me has everlasting life." He
   who has come to Jesus is saved! You need not question your safety, for
   you could not have come to Christ without having been drawn to Him. "No
   man can come to Me, except the Father who sent Me draws him." You could
   not have come if you had not been drawn! Well, then, if you have come,
   you have been drawn, and if the Father has drawn you, you have come the
   right way! It all lies in a nutshell. If I have come to Jesus and have
   put my trust in Him--my nature is, in itself, so averse to this way of
   salvation that, if I have really and from my heart accepted it--there
   must have been upon my heart an operation from God to bring me into
   this condition! That operation could not have been badly performed, for
   God never works amiss or ineffectually. I am, therefore, in the very
   fact of being brought to Christ, assured that God has been at work with
   me!

   "Oh!" I have sometimes heard poor souls say, "I came to Christ, but I
   am afraid that I have come the wrong way." You cannot come the wrong
   way. "Oh, but I heard of one who came to Christ so quickly!" Yes, and I
   have heard of one who came to Him very slowly. But as he came, it did
   not so much matter how he came! When the whole world was drowned, a
   pair of greyhounds found shelter in the ark. I do not suppose they
   started very early. But there was a pair of snails that went in with
   them--I wonder how soon they started? They certainly must have started
   a long while before the ark door was opened or the ark prepared. Come
   along, then, you poor crawling snails, come along! If some of you have
   the greyhound's speed, come along, bound and leap to Christ--the
   quicker the better! But if you are a man of slow action, remember that
   the snails in the ark were not drowned. Though they were slow in coming
   in, there they were, as safely preserved as the rest of the living
   creatures that were with Noah. "Well" says one, "I feel as if I could
   only creep to Christ with broken legs and an aching back." Then creep
   to Christ, only come to Him! Come anyway--leaping or limping. If you
   shall come, He has said, "Him that comes to Me , I will in no wise cast
   out," and that includes any coming in all the world if it is but a
   coming to Him. If you trust Him, you are saved! That Truth of God
   ought, I think, to give some consolation to any who are troubled about
   their faith and about the inner life of the soul.

   Yet again, remember that all teaching that is absolutely necessary to
   salvation concerns Christ. "Therefore, everyone who has heard, and has
   learned of the Father, comes unto Me." If there were any right
   teachings that would lead you beyond Christ--I do not know any, but if
   there were such--you can do without them. The only teachings that you
   need are those that lead you to Christ. Let this comfort anyone who
   says, "I understand no theology. I am only a beginner in the study of
   the Word. I could not even explain the plan of salvation to another
   person, but I am trusting in Christ." Well, rest satisfied with that
   glorious fact!

   To close, the best sentence in the whole text, to my mind, is that with
   which the 44TH verse finishes, "I will raise him up at the last day."
   Is not that glorious? The Savior does not merely say that he that
   believes is drawn to Him by the Father and that he is now saved, but He
   says, "I will raise him up at the last day." It is as good as saying,
   "I will take that man's case into My own hands." He does not mention
   all the intervening circumstance, but He finishes up with the last
   victory, "I will raise him up at the last day." "This man is a sinner,
   Lord." "I will forgive him." "He has a black heart." "I will change
   it." "He will be very fickle." "I will keep him." "He will be much
   tempted." "I will pray for him." "He will have many afflictions." "I
   will sustain him." "But Lord, he will die." "I will be with him." "But
   he will be buried, Lord, and laid among the worms, dust to dust." "I
   will raise him up at the last day."

   It is as good as saying, "I will go through with the business for the
   whole of the man," for if He takes care of the poor body, and raises it
   up, depend upon it that He will take care of the soul that shall be
   forever with Him! If this rag of a robe that I wear is yet so dear to
   Him that He will not leave it in the grave, then the man within the
   robe will be all right! Christ will take care of him, depend upon that!
   He who will preserve the casket will not lose the jewel. "I will raise
   him up at the last day."

   The Lord bring every one of you to trust in this mighty Savior, for His
   great name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 6:41-71.

   We shall read, tonight, part of that blessed sixth chapter of John's
   Gospel, beginning at the 41st verse.

   Verses 41, 42. The Jews then murmured at Him because He said, I am the
   bread which came down from Heaven. And they said, Is not this Jesus,
   the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that
   He says, I came down from Heaven? Familiarity breeds contempt. Because
   the Jews knew Jesus and His kindred after the flesh, therefore they
   would not believe that He came down from Heaven. Let us beware of
   foolish prejudices and let us not judge after the flesh. Why should
   Jesus not have come down from Heaven even though these men knew His
   reputed father and mother?

   43. Jesus, therefore, answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
   yourselves. It was a murmuring that was scarcely audible, but Jesus
   heard it and He checked it. The Lord cannot take any delight in
   murmuring. "Murmur not among yourselves."

   44. No man can come to Me, except the Father who sent Me draws him: and
   I will raise him up at the last day. You did not expect the Savior to
   say just that, did you? He always speaks the Truth of God, even though
   He has to lay the axe at

   the root of the tree of self-confidence. He does not seem to be
   encouraging His hearers, but rather to be repelling them. He was trying
   to show them the state in which they really were. They had not been
   drawn to Himself. They were alienated from Him and they would continue
   to be at a distance from Him unless God should interpose and draw them
   to

   Him.

   45. It is written in the Prophets, 'And they shall be all taught by
   God.' Therefore, everyone who has heard, and has learned of the Father,
   comes unto Me. This was as much as to say, "The Father has never taught
   you. You have learned nothing from Him, or you would come to Me. And in
   your rejection of Me, you prove that you are strangers to the Grace

   of God."

   46. Not that any man has seen the Father, save He which is of God, He
   has seen the Father. Christ is "of God" in a very peculiar sense. He is
   not God's creature, but God's Son. He is of the very essence of God
   and, therefore, He knows what God is as we never can know.

   47. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believes on Me has
   everlasting life. This is a grand saying! Can you not catch the Truth
   of God it reveals? Whatever deficiencies there may be in you, if you
   believe on Christ, you have everlasting life--not a life which you can
   lose, or which will die out, but everlasting life! And we are not among
   those who clip the wings of that great word, "everlasting." We take
   this verse to mean just what it says--that is, if you believe on
   Christ, you have within you a life which will last forever and ever!

   48-50. I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the
   wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which comes down from
   Heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die. Christ is the Bread for
   the soul, the Bread of immortality, the Bread which will fit a man for
   Heaven and sustain him till he arrives there. Oh, that we may all eat
   of this Bread of Life, and so live forever!

   51-54. I am the living bread which came down from Heaven: if any man
   eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will
   give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The Jews
   therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this Man give us His
   flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood,
   you have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh, and drinks My blood has
   eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. How necessary it
   is to have a spiritual understanding of the Scriptures! These metaphors
   have a sort of cannibal meaning about them to a man who goes no further
   than the letter. But the spiritual man knows that the soul feeds upon
   the doctrine of Christ's Incarnation and drinks in the truth of
   Christ's Atonement. This is feeding, this is drinking--this is being
   nourished upon Christ's flesh and Christ's blood!

   55. For My flesh is meat, indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed. Meat
   and wine are, after all, only shadows--they feed the shadow-life of the
   flesh. Christ and His precious blood are the great realities--they
   nourish the true life of the spirit. Blessed are they who know what it
   is in spirit to feed upon these spiritual things!

   56-58. He that eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, dwells in Me, and I
   in him. As the living Father has sent Me, and I live by the Father: so
   he that eats Me, even he shall live by Me. This is that bread which
   came down from Heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead:
   He that eats of this bread shall live forever. The Savior goes over the
   same ground several times. There is a variety in His utterances, but in
   essence, the meaning is the same. He wants to get it into our minds
   that we are to live upon Him--that He, not self, He, not works, He, not
   our feelings--is the real food of the soul, by which that soul acquires
   and retains immortal life.

   59, 60. These things said He in the synagogue, as He taught in
   Capernaum. Many therefore of His disciples, when they had heard this,
   said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? Preachers must not be
   astonished if they stagger their hearers when they proclaim the Truth
   of God! They must not retract what they have said, nor tone it down
   because so-and-so is offended by it! Truth is hard, especially to hard
   hearts. Every great Truth is hard to a beginner in the school of
   Christ-- but it is, none the less, to be taught, for that which is
   difficult, today, may become delightful, tomorrow, or whenever we are
   better educated in the things of God!

   61, 62. When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at it,
   He said unto them, Does this offend you? What and if you shall see the
   Son of Man ascend up where He was before? He that is offended at any
   Gospel Truth may expect to be still more offended, for there are higher
   and deeper doctrines than Jesus had then uttered. If you stagger under
   the elementary lessons, what will you do when you get into the grammar
   school of Divinity, and begin to learn the loftier

   lessons of the Truths of God? Oh, for a faith that never staggers when
   Christ speaks, and that believes whatever He reveals!

   63. It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing: the
   words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. Do not
   look at them as dead words! Regard them as full of life and understand
   them in their living spiritual sense.

   64. But there are some of you that believe not. Some of Christ's own
   disciples, some who had kept Him company-- believed not! This was a
   very sad statement for Jesus to be obliged to make, but it must be made
   today about many professed Christians--"There are some of you that
   believe not."

   64. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not,
   and who should betray Him. He is not deceived by hypocrites. If we have
   crept into the Church unworthily, He knows all about us. He knows us
   better than we know ourselves! Oh, that we might be very careful,
   watchful, jealous! May we abhor hypocrisy of every sort! It is
   impossible to continue in it without being detected, but if it were
   possible, we ought not to practice it, but with such an eye as that
   which is in the Head of the Church, even Christ, we cannot
   deceive--therefore, let us not attempt it.

   65, 66. And He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
   unto Me, except it were given unto him of My Father. From that time
   many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him. It often
   happens, in the ministry of a faithful preacher, that he has to say
   unpleasant things. And there are some who withdraw because of his
   preaching of the Truth of God. Should he break his heart when they do
   so? Certainly not! They did the same with his Master. They acted the
   same with the Apostle Paul. It will be so to the end of the chapter
   and, indeed, it is part of our work to separate between the precious
   and the vile. Truth is like the fan which drives away the chaff and
   leaves the wheat the more pure. Yet it is sad to read that many of the
   disciples of Christ went back and walked no more with Him because they
   could not endure the faithful Words He spoke to them.

   67, 68. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will you, also, go away? Then
   Simon Peter--Who was always to the front, ever ready to speak, "Simon
   Peter"--

   68-70. Answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of
   eternal life. And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the
   Son of the living God. Jesus answered them, have not I chosen you
   twelve, and one of you is a devil? Our Lord often surprises us by the
   way in which He speaks. He does not say what we would have expected to
   hear from Him, but He says something that is very startling and even
   discouraging! It is the way of our Master, because He sees further than
   we do--and He often replies, not to the question as it lies in the
   words addressed to Him--but to a belief in the heart at the back of the
   words. He did so here. Peter may have thought that "the twelve" were
   all steadfast and sincere, so Christ says to him, "Have not I chosen
   you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"

   71. He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that
   should betray Him, being one of the twelve.

Good Advice For Troublous Times

   (No. 2387)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 9, 1888.

   "Come, My people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you:
   hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment, until the indignation
   is past." Isaiah 26:20.

   THE Lord has a very peculiar care for His own people. He is their
   Shepherd and He feeds them like a flock. He is their Father and He
   guards them as His own dear children. Whenever times of great trouble
   come, He thinks especially of them. He drowned the antediluvian world,
   but not till Noah was safely in the ark. He burned Sodom and Gomorrah,
   but not till Lot had escaped to the little city called Zoar. In all His
   judgments He remembers His mercy towards His believing people--He does
   not suffer them to be destroyed even in the day of the destruction of
   the ungodly. Child of God, your Father's eyes are lovingly fixed upon
   you. His heart cares for you every moment. Unhappy are the men and
   women of whom we cannot say this! Unhappy are you who have never
   trusted and never loved your God, your Maker, and your best Friend! But
   thrice happy is the poorest and most tried among us who knows that the
   Lord is his refuge, his castle and high tower, his Defender and
   Provider, his God and his All!

   Whenever there is any evil to come upon the land, God knows all about
   it, for He knows everything. He foresees all that is going to happen.
   He sometimes gives foresight to men, as in the case of His Prophets
   and, I do not doubt that even now, believing men, when they live very
   near to God, see farther into the future than others can. There were
   several occasions, in the life of John Linox, when he expressly
   foretold the deaths of certain men, and similar power has been given to
   other eminent saints who have walked on the hilltop with God. They have
   looked much farther than the dwellers in the plain, who forget God,
   have ever seen! But, whether we can see into the future, or not, is of
   little consequence, for the Lord can see! If the father of the family
   knows what is to occur, his children will not be without due warning
   and, therefore, God, when He foresees that His judgments will be abroad
   in the earth, takes care to forewarn His children. and when any great
   calamity is coming, He provides a shelter for them in the time of
   storm. Let us thank God for this.

   you who have no God to go to, the future must often look very dark to
   some of you, especially that blackest spot of all, where rolls the
   chilly stream of the river of death! When you come there, you will have
   to take a plunge in the dark! But the heir of Heaven knows that
   whatever lies before him, all is ordained and fixed, arranged and
   settled, by the Infinite Wisdom and Love of God, and he can trust
   himself without fear to the Lord's preserving mercy! Without wishing to
   pry into the future, he leaves himself entirely in the hands of God.

   1 began by saying that Believers are the objects of God's special care
   and, next, that God has a foresight which He exercises on their behalf.
   Now, further, the advice which our careful and foreseeing God gives us
   is sure to be wise. We should, all of us, be wise if we could do before
   an event what we would wish to do after it. Unfortunately, we are often
   wise when it is too late. I do not know a better definition of a fool
   than that he is a man who is wise too late. But God will make us wise
   in time if we are willing to take His advice. If we will do what He
   bids us, we shall do the right thing. Listen, then, to the advice that
   God here gives us when times of trouble come--and they will come--and
   before times of trouble come, when we foresee them. The proper and wise
   course for us is plainly marked out in our text--"Come, My people,
   enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you: hide yourself, as
   it were, for a little moment, until the indignation is past."

   I. My first observation upon these words shall be that BEFORE OR IN
   TIMES OF TROUBLE, IT IS WELL TO DRAW NEAR TO GOD.

   Is not that a sweet call from God, "Come, My people. Come, My people"?
   As the hen gives her peculiar "cluck" when the hawk is in the air, to
   bid her chicks come and hide under her wings, so does God, here, give a
   gentle loving note of alarm and a gracious call of invitation, as He
   says, "Come, My people." "No, do not go, My people, scattered here and
   there by the approach of danger, but, come, My people. Be not driven
   from Me by affliction, but be driven to Me by adversity. Come, My
   people." How sweet the words sound to me! If I had the voice of an
   angel, I should hardly be able to bring out all their sweetness--"Come,
   My people. Come, My people. The clouds are in the sky; the first flash
   of lightning has seemed to split the ebon darkness of Nature. Come, My
   people, hasten home, be quick about it, come, My people. No, linger
   not. Halt not through fear, be not paralyzed with apprehension! Come,
   My people; come to Me, come to your God, come to your Father, come to
   your Friend."

   For what purpose should we come to the Lord? I think that in times of
   trouble, or when we are apprehending trial, we should come to spread
   our case before God. You fear that you are going to be very ill, or
   that your dear wife is likely to die. You are afraid that your property
   will be taken from you, or that something else that is dreadful will
   happen. Then come, and--

   "Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint."

   Remember how Hezekiah acted when he received that abominable letter
   from Rabshakeh? He took it and spread it before the Lord. Now, do the
   same with any trouble of yours, present or impending, come and tell it
   all to Jesus! You were just going across the road to consult a
   neighbor, were you? I do not forbid you to do that, by-and-by, but
   first listen to this electric bell--"Come, My people! Come, My people!"
   It calls you to your God, first! Go and tell Him all about it. He will
   patiently hear your story, He will listen without weariness and He will
   efficiently help you! Therefore spread the case before Him.

   The next thing you should do in coming to God is to consider His mind
   about such a case. Have you ever done that? When we consult a counsel,
   it is because we need to have his judgment upon some difficult point of
   law. We expect that he has had to decide something like it before. He
   knows the precedents that bear upon the case and we, therefore, ask his
   judgment. I love to see a man turning to his Bible, when a trouble is
   coming, to see what God has to say about such a case as his. If I am
   going to be bereaved, or if I am already bereaved, I wish to know how
   Jesus comforted those who lost their loved ones. If I am ill, I ask,
   "What do the Scriptures say to the sick?" If I am going down in the
   world, I want to learn what is God's direction to the man who is
   falling into poverty. Let me come and hear what God has to say about
   the matter! I believe that if we acted in that fashion, we should be
   much more calm than we are under surprising sadnesses, for we should
   say to ourselves, "My main question is not, 'How can I get out of this
   trouble?' But, 'How should I behave myself in it? What ought a man of
   God to do under the trying circumstances which have now come upon me?'"
   Does not God bid you, first of all, to consider what will be for His
   Glory, and afterwards to consult your own comfort? "Seek you first the
   Kingdom of God and His righteousness," and so the lesson of your
   trouble shall be shown to you. "Come, My people, then, tell me your
   anxiety, and ask what My will is about it."

   "Come, My people," means, next, come to your God, in times of trouble,
   to make sure of the greatest matters. You are going to lose your little
   money, are you? Well, well, that is bad enough, but you have some
   jewels which you are not going to lose. You remember Little-Faith being
   robbed down Dead-Man's Lane? Bunyan says that when the three sturdy
   rogues, Faint-Heart, Mistrust, and Guilt, fell upon him, they robbed
   him of most of his spending money, but he had certain jewels that they
   never found and of which, therefore, they could not rob him. So, the
   world may come and take away many of our external and temporary
   comforts, but we have a treasure that it never gave us and cannot take
   away from us!

   No, my Brother, you did not gain that treasure by keeping shop, and you
   will not lose it by keeping shop. If you have true religion, you did
   not buy it and you shall never sell it! It is yours forever, an
   inheritance that never can be alienated from you! Now that you have
   lost so much and suffered so much, I want you to come to God and just
   think of what you still have--God as your Father, Jesus as your
   Brother, the Holy Spirit as your Comforter--you still have all the
   resources of Providence, all the riches of the promises, all the
   superabundance of the Covenant of Grace! Well then, you have not lost
   much, after all, have you?

   I think I have told you before of a friend of mine who went to the Bank
   of England and came away to his business with a couple of hundred
   pounds in his pocket. As he passed down the Borough, he was robbed. His
   wife looked very white when he said that he had been robbed. "Yes," he
   said, "my Dear, I have been robbed of my pocket-handkerchief." Then the
   good man smiled--what did he care about his pocket-handkerchief so long
   as the hundreds of pounds were safe? So, if you only have to say, "My
   Lord, I have lost this little, and that little," so long as your soul
   is safe, your eternal welfare is safe, your Heaven is safe, why,
   surely, you will thus be helped to bear without murmuring those ills
   which are common to men!

   Once more, "Come, My people," means that having made sure of the great
   things, you may leave all the little things with God. I was thinking,
   the other day, suppose any one of us had power over the weather, to
   make it rain or make it shine, just as we pleased, and I thought I
   should not like to be that individual because I should have people at
   me from morning to night, tearing me to pieces, one wanting rain, and
   another wanting sunshine! I would rather not have any such power! But
   if God gave me the control over winds and waves, and clouds and rain,
   if I had it tonight, the first thing I would do when I reached home
   would be to go upstairs and say, "Lord, You have given me power over
   the wind and the rain, but I know that I shall make all manner of
   mistakes with it. I have not the wit to manage these matters. O Lord,
   graciously tell me what to do." If you do like that, is it not much the
   same thing as if you had not any power and left it to God altogether?
   You may have just as much rest as that and even more, for, to be
   without the power is to be without the responsibility! So, Beloved,
   when you go to God in times of trouble, say, "Do what You will, Lord. I
   desire to leave the care and burden of all this trial to You. I am too
   foolish and too weak to deal with it, therefore, undertake for me and
   henceforth, having left it entirely in Your hands, I will be quiet,
   even as a weaned child, and say, 'Whatever happens, it is the Lord; let
   Him do what seems good to Him.'"

   I will just ring that little silver bell and then leave this point.
   "Come, My people. Come, My people. Come and tell Me your trouble. Come
   and study My mind about your trouble. Come and make sure of the
   greatest matters. Come and leave your little matters with Me. Come My
   people, draw near to Me in times of trouble."

   This is the first division of my subject.

   II. The second is that IT IS WISE TO ENTER INTO THE CHAMBERS OF
   SECURITY WHICH GOD HAS PROVIDED FOR US. "Come, My people, enter your
   chambers." My business, in this second part of my discourse, is to
   bring a candle and to show you the way along the passages leading to
   the rooms provided for you--"Enter your chambers." It is a time of
   trouble with you--"Enter your chambers." "What chambers?" you ask. I am
   going to show you. Here is the candle to light your way, take it and
   follow me--"Come into your chambers."

   One of the rooms into which a man should enter in times of trouble is
   the storeroom of Divine Power. God is able to bear you through every
   trial. God is able to bring good out of all evil. God is able to
   comfort you. God is able either to prevent the trouble, or to make you
   strong enough to bear it! Nothing can happen to you which will be
   beyond the power of God and, according to His mighty power, He will
   certainly deliver you. He will show Himself strong on your behalf, if
   you do but trust Him, and you shall be able to sing, "The Lord is my
   Shepherd and my Shield." "Come, My people," get into this chamber, this
   well-guarded room of the Lord. Of what are you afraid? Afraid of the
   devil? God is stronger than Satan! Afraid of death? God is stronger
   than death! Afraid of poverty? Christ is stronger than poverty! Afraid
   of sickness? The power of God will sustain you while suffering from the
   most terrible disease that can possibly come to your mortal frame!
   "Come, My people." Hide away in this chamber of the Divine Omnipotence.
   You will never be afraid, surely, after that invitation, for the
   almighty God shall be your defense!

   May I take you into another chamber, which will, perhaps, suit you
   better? That shall be the council chamber of Divine Wisdom. So you are
   in trouble, now, and you are a great deal perplexed--but God is not
   perplexed or troubled. He sees the end from the beginning! He has all
   means at His disposal--there are no entanglements and knots to Him, He
   has the clue to every labyrinth--and He can guide you into the center
   of joy. Be not afraid, though you are, yourself, utterly undone, though
   you see no way of escape--the Lord can see where you cannot! There are
   no such things as darkness and night to the eyes of Him who perceives
   all things. Oh, I delight to know that God is infinitely wise! I, a
   poor fool, have done this and that, and nothing comes of it, so it
   seems. I have tried to do right, but apparently without success. What
   then? There is a higher wisdom than any man's, and that Divine Wisdom
   is at work on behalf of the heirs of Heaven! "Come, My people," enter
   into this bright room and take a delightful rest in this council
   chamber of Divine Wisdom.

   Let me show you into another chamber. Possibly some of you will feel
   more at home there, for it is the drawing-room of Divine Love. This is
   the state chamber of the palace--"Come, My people," and enter into it.
   Think of this wondrous Truth of God, that God loves you. Whether He
   strikes you or strokes you, the Lord loves you! Whether He chastens you
   or caresses you, He loves you! He loved you from before the foundation
   of the world and He will love you when the world's foundations shall be
   overthrown! He loves you without beginning, without measure, without
   change, without end! He has betrothed you to Himself in bonds of
   everlasting love. Come into this chamber with its golden hangings! Come
   to this couch that is softer than down and rest here! Let earth be all
   in arms abroad, there is perfect peace for the man who enters into this
   chamber of Divine Love!

   But if these three chambers are not enough for your protection and
   comfort, may I take you to the room of Divine Faithfulness? This is a
   wonderful chamber! God is true. God is faithful. God keeps His
   promises. My dear Friends, do you study the promises recorded in the
   Bible? If you do not, I am sorry for you. The promises of God should be
   the constant subject of study by the child of God, because, when you
   get a hold of a promise from God, it is as good as the thing itself!
   God's promise to pay is always at par with those who trust Him--they
   need no discount on a Divine Promise--it is as good as the thing,
   itself, to their believing hearts! Oh, what an innumerable company of
   promises there is in this blessed Book! We need never be downhearted if
   we would but study this wonderful Book of God which has a promise to
   meet every trial and sorrow! And all the promises of God in Christ
   Jesus "are yes and Amen, unto the Glory of God by us." You are going
   into trouble--did you say that you are suffering from cancer? Oh, come
   into this chamber of the faithful promises! You have need to come. Did
   you say that your trouble is a bankruptcy caused entirely through
   misfortune? Come, then, into this chamber! Look at the motto hanging on
   the walls, "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure."
   Believe it! You shall have bread and water as long as there is any
   beneath the cope of Heaven! God will never fail you, therefore trust
   Him! Be not dismayed. "Come, My people, enter your chambers."

   There is one chamber into which I am very fond of entering, that is,
   the strong room of Divine Immutability. This is the one into which God
   took His servant Moses before He sent him down to Egypt. Moses asked
   the Lord what His name was, and He answered, "I AM THAT I AM." The
   children of Israel were not able to comprehend that glorious name of
   Jehovah, so the Lord gave them a shorter one, instead, "I AM." But to
   the full-grown child of God, this is the name in which he delights, "I
   AM THAT I AM," the same Immutable Jehovah, never altering, with "no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning." Oh, how my soul delights in
   the Lord's Immutability! We change like the weather glass. We never are
   at "Set Fair," or, if ever we do get to "Set Fair," it is sure to rain,
   as I notice that it generally does when the weather glass is at that
   point. But, dear Friends, God is always the same! We wax and wane, like
   the moon. God is the sun, without parallax or tropic! Blessed is the
   Immutability of God! What a chamber to get into! When I enter it, I
   feel like a man in the strong room of the Bank of England. I hear a
   voice saying, "I am the Lord, I change not, therefore you sons of Jacob
   are not consumed."

   There is only one more room which I will mention at this time, though I
   could have described many more, and that is, the best chamber of Divine
   Salvation. Look at the scarlet curtains dyed in the precious blood of
   Jesus! What a chamber this is for a man to dwell in, where his pardon
   was bought for him by the death of his Lord, where the new life is
   given to him by the life of his Lord, and where a throne and crown in
   Heaven are promised to him through the victories of his Lord!
   "Salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks." What a restful
   chamber does this salvation make! "Come, My people. Come, My people.
   Come, My people. Enter into your chambers."

   I have rung the silver bell. I have given you your candles. Now go and
   enter into your chambers and rest in Divine Power, Wisdom, Love,
   Faithfulness, Immutability and Salvation!

   III. But now comes one thing more. God gives us, in the third place,
   further good advice. WHEN WE ENTER

   THOSE CHAMBERS, IT IS NECESSARY TO SHUT THE DOOR. Listen--"Enter your
   chambers, and shut your

   doors behind you." If you go into a room and leave the door open, you
   have not hidden yourself, much, and you have not gained any protection
   by entering the chamber. I earnestly invite the people of God to enter
   the chambers I have pointed out--but I would also persuade them to shut
   the doors of those rooms. What for?

   First, to shut out all doubt. You have entered the chamber of Divine
   Power. Now, do not doubt your God. "Is anything too hard for the Lord?"
   Shut the door. Shut the door! You have come into the chamber of Divine
   Wisdom. Do not doubt your God. Do not say, "This is a mistake. Surely I
   have been led in the wrong way. Providence has erred." Shut

   that door. Shut that door! We cannot let any drafts come in to blow
   upon our trust in the Infinite Wisdom of God! And if you have entered
   into the chamber of Divine Love, how blessed it is to feel, "He has
   loved me from before the foundation of the world." Does there come in
   an, "if? Shut that door! There is no rest or comfort till we shut out
   all doubt! We must know for certain that the Lord loved us or we cannot
   have any enjoyment in His love.

   And suppose that it is the chamber of Divine Faithfulness into which we
   have entered? We must have no doubt about that--we must not say to
   ourselves, "God may forget His promise. Perhaps He will break His
   Word." Oh, shut that door, and lock it, and bolt and bar it! Say, "That
   door can never be opened any more! We cannot have any doubt about God's
   faithfulness--He cannot lie! Is He the Lord and shall His love grow
   feeble to His saints? Is He God and shall He turn aside from His Word
   and break His Covenant and oath?" Shut that door! Let not anything come
   in that way to disturb our peace! And as to the Divine Immutability, we
   cannot allow the door to be open to let even the supposition of change
   come in! "Oh, God loved me," says one, "twenty years ago!" And do you
   think that He does not love you now? "Oh, but He helped me so
   graciously then!" Will He not help you now? What? Has He changed? You
   are blaspheming God by the very thought of such a thing!--

   "Whom once He loves, He never leaves, But loves them to the end."

   Do you believe this? Whenever there comes a doubt that He has cast you
   away, shut that door and drive a nail through it, that it may never be
   opened again, for the Lord cannot change! If He is God, He must forever
   be the same! "Come, My people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors
   behind you." I think that we must first shut the doors to shut out all
   doubts.

   But we must also shut the doors to shut ourselves in, to shut ourselves
   in with God. Now, my Lord, a great storm is coming, but I am shut in
   with You. I trust Your power; I trust Your wisdom; I trust Your love; I
   trust Your faithfulness; I trust Your immutability; I trust Your
   salvation. I trust nothing else, but I repose wholly in You. You must
   often have noticed what our Savior did in the storm on the Sea of
   Galilee. He knew that a great tempest was coming on and He looked about
   Him--for what? For a pillow! What? For a pillow? Why, if you and I had
   been there, we would have looked round for a hencoop or a spar! But
   Jesus looked round for a pillow--not for a life-belt, but for a
   pillow--and when He found the pillow, what did He do? He went to the
   stern of the ship, stretched Himself out, and went to sleep! Why did He
   so act? Because He felt that He was perfectly safe in His Father's
   hands!

   And there were His poor disciples wide awake, fretting and worrying!
   Did they stop the wind by fuming? Did they calm the waves by
   complaining? No, no. They tramped up and down the little vessel, but
   the sea did not take any notice of them. At last they went to wake
   their Master. He was so soundly sleeping that they could not get Him
   awake as soon as they wished, so they cried, "Master, cares You not
   that we perish?" O faithless disciples, your Master was doing the
   grandest thing that He could do! He was leaving the vessel in the hands
   of God and He, Himself, going to sleep! Brothers and Sisters,
   sometimes, when you get into a great deal of trouble, may I be allowed
   to be your solicitor and give you a piece of advice? Go to bed and go
   to sleep! "Oh, but I need to be doing something^" Yes, I know you do.
   And you will make a mess of it! Go to bed. Look for a pillow and go to
   sleep. Nine times out of ten, when we worry and fret, we undo what we
   try to do! To sit still would be a far wiser thing. Come, my people,
   hurry not into the market! Worry not in the shop! "Come, My people,
   enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you." Rest in God and
   wait patiently for Him, for He can do all things, and winds and waves
   shall be quiet at His bidding!

   I wish that I could talk like this to you all, but I must not. Some of
   you have no chambers to go to--you who are out of Christ have no place
   to rest. Oh, that you had! God grant that you may have before
   tomorrow's sun has risen! May you believe in Jesus this very night!
   Then you shall have God for your Friend forever and ever, and all these
   chambers that I have mentioned shall be at your disposal.

   IV. I finish up with this last remark, borrowed from the text. IT IS
   DELIGHTFUL TO THINK THAT THE TROUBLE WILL NOT LAST LONG. Let me read
   the text again. "Come, My people, enter your chambers, and shut your
   doors behind you: hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment, until
   the indignation is past."

   Is not that a wonderful expression--"a little moment"? A moment is but
   the tick of the clock, but here it is, "a little moment"--a little
   moment. Ah, me, we do not think so when the trouble comes! Perhaps it
   is some disease. Possibly it is incipient consumption. You have been
   coughing a great deal. Ah, my dear Friend, come and tell your God about
   it! It

   will only last a little moment and then you will be where you shall
   cough no more--but you shall sing God's praises, world without end!
   "But it is the commencement of a cancer." I know, and that is an awful
   thing. But, my dear Sister, go to God, get into these blessed chambers
   of Divine Power, Wisdom, Love and so on, and you will hear Him say, "It
   is only for a little moment." "Ah," says one, "but I am hopelessly
   poor, and have been so for a long time, and I expect that I shall be so
   till I die." Well, if so, it will be but for a little moment, and then
   you will be rich forever!

   I am not an old man, yet, though I am not young, but I am obliged to
   tell you that years are much shorter to me than they used to be 20
   years ago. And weeks--why, they seem to fly! I never get to Sunday
   night without seeming to have another Sunday morning close on my heels.
   Do you not find it so? When Jacob said that his days were few, why did
   he so speak? Because he was an old man! If he had been a man of 25, he
   would not have said that! He would have thought that he had lived a
   good long while, but when he got to be over a 100, then his days seemed
   very few. After all, what is the longest life? Suppose that you should
   live to be 70 or eighty? We who are over 50 feel that it hardly needs
   an effort of mind to project ourselves through the next 25 years and
   find ourselves old and gray-headed, and ready to depart--and we shall
   depart in due season. It is only for a little moment that we are to be
   here. The cup is very bitter, but then there is not much in it! Let us
   take it all down at a draught. These pills are too small for us to make
   two bites at them. Besides, to chew them is to get their bitterness--to
   swallow them is to know nothing about it. So, do the same with the
   troubles of this life! Take them as they come, cheerfully and
   contentedly, thankfully praising God that there is good in the evil and
   sweetness in the bitter. Take it all. It will not last long--

   "A scrip on my back, and a staff in my hand,

   I march on in haste through an enemy's land.

   The road may be rough, but it cannot be long,

   And I'll smooth it with hope, and cheer it with song." Get into the
   chambers that the Lord has prepared for you and hide yourselves "for a
   little moment, until the indignation is past."

   Here I stand, on this 9th of September, in the year of Grace, 1888,
   still preaching to you. But there will come a time when there will be
   no voice of mine from this pulpit, and no glance of your eyes towards
   the minister here. We shall be in the world to come and then, in a
   short time, we shall all appear before the Judgement Seat of Christ. If
   we have never hidden in these chambers. If we have never fled to
   Christ, ah, then will come the time of woe, a darksome time, indeed!
   Sorrows without a shore, griefs without a terminus, a bitterness that
   must be everlasting! God help us to drink ten thousand cups of
   bitterness, here, rather than have to drink that cup of wormwood and
   gall forever! Come, fly to Christ tonight! The Lord help you to do so!
   Believe in Him, trust in Him, that you may never know His indignation,
   but, having hidden, for a small moment from the present trouble, you
   shall wake up to endless joy at God's right hand, forever and ever.
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 73.

   The Psalmist here works out the problem of the prosperity of the
   wicked. He was troubled in his own mind about it. He knew that he
   feared God, but he also knew that he was greatly tried, whereas he saw
   many who had no fear of God before their eyes, who seemed to be always
   prospering. Their flourishing condition was a puzzle to him, but he
   examined the problem and unraveled the mystery. I think I have told you
   before, as a little exercise for your memory, that the 73rd Psalm and
   the 37th Psalm are both on the same subject. You can easily remember
   this, as the same figures are used in each instance, only they are
   turned the two ways, 73 and 37.

   Verse 1. Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
   heart. The Psalmist knows that it must be so. He cannot doubt it. He
   lays it down as a proposition not to be disputed. Assuredly, "Truly,
   God is good to Israel."

   2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-near
   slipped. "I was almost seduced to sin. I seemed as if I must fall into
   iniquity."

   3. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
   wicked. It really looked as if the big rogues did prosper, as if the
   great infidels were happy, as if, after all, religion brought trouble
   and irreligion brought pleasure!

   4. For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
   Some of them so stifle conscience that they even die stupefied, with no
   sense of the dreadful wrath that is coming upon them--"There are no
   bands in their death."

   5. They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like
   other men. They do not seem to have the afflictions of God's people,
   and certainly they are not plagued with soul-conflict such as
   Christians have--they seem to make themselves very merry at all times.

   6. Therefore pride accompanies them about as a chain. They wear it as
   my Lord Mayor wears his collar, for a badge of honor!

   6. Violence covers them as a garment. They are not a bit ashamed of it!
   They put it on as if it were their workday dress.

   7, 8. Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
   could wish. They are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
   they speak loftily. What big words they utter! How they boast! How they
   despise the poor! How they sneer at religion! It is dreadful to hear
   them and, for a child of God, who is conscious of doing right, and of
   suffering for it, it is a hard task to hear them talk thus.

   9. They set their mouth against the heavens. As if this earth did not
   contain room enough for their malice, "They set their mouth against the
   heavens."

   9. And their tongue walks through the earth. Leaving nobody alone,
   having a hard word for everybody except their own chosen group.

   10, 11. Therefore his people return here: and waters of a full cup are
   wrung out to them. And they say, "How does God know? And is there
   knowledge in the Most High?" They pretend that God is, as it were, only
   like King Log, taking no account of what is done by the sons of men.
   "He does not notice our feasts, or listen to our blasphemies." So they
   say.

   12. Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
   increase in riches. And yet why do we wonder at this? The bullock that
   is intended to be killed is the first to be fatted and he that is
   doomed to destruction will often be allowed to prosper! Would you not
   let them have as much pleasure as they can have in this life, for they
   will have none in the next? Oh, envy them not their short-lived joys!
   Yet the Psalmist did so when he was down in the dumps and in an evil
   humor. He said, "Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the
   world; they increase in riches."

   13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
   innocence. "Surely," he said "my holy life, my desire to be right with
   God and man, is a good-for-nothing thing! I do not prosper. I do not
   increase in riches, but it is the very reverse with me."

   14. For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
   morning. Cannot you imagine a son of very wise parents, and very loving
   parents, saying, "Why, look at that boy in the street! He has no father
   to flog him, no mother to scold him, he can do just as he likes! But,
   as for me, if I do a little wrong, I am whipped for it"? Ah, my lad!
   The day will come when you will not envy the street-boy and you will be
   thankful, then, that you were not in his position! The child of God, if
   he sins, will have to smart for it--but there is nothing more dreadful
   than to be allowed to sin without being made to suffer! God save us
   from being given up to such a state as that!

   15. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
   generation of Your children. Do not always speak what you think. "But
   if you think it, you may as well say it," says one. Oh, no! There may
   be an evil spirit in yonder bottle, but nobody will get drunk upon it
   if you keep the cork in! So there may be evil thoughts in your hearts,
   but they will not injure other people if you do not, as it were, draw
   the cork by uttering them! It is always well to think twice before you
   speak once. "So," said the Psalmist, "I cannot speak thus, because such
   talk would grieve God's people."

   16. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me. It was too
   painful for the Psalmist to think of it, too painful to speak of
   it--and yet too painful for him to hold his tongue!

   17. Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
   end. When he came near to his God, when he went into the Holy Place,
   and communed with the Lord, then he saw what would be the end of the
   wicked. Ah, what a difference it makes when we look at the ungodly from
   the right standpoint! "Then understood I their end."

   18. Surely you did set them in slippery places. Up there ever so high.

   18. You cast them down into destruction. When the time comes, down they
   are hurled from those slippery heights into the awful depths below!

   19. Now are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are
   utterly consumed with terrors. When the ungodly reach the next world,
   where are their riches, where are their feasts, where are their merry
   jokes, where are their lofty words? Listen--"How are they brought into
   desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors."

   20. As a dream when one awakens, so, O Lord, when You awake, You shall
   despise their image. When a man wakes, his dream is over and gone. When
   God awakes to judgment and comes to deal with ungodly men, then all
   those who prospered in wickedness shall melt away, like the baseless
   fabric of a dream.

   21. 22. Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. So
   foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before You. For the beast
   only measures by the day and the hour, as far as its eyes can see. Give
   it a meadow deep with grass and it is perfectly happy, but when good
   men get measuring by the day and by the hour, and by the lifetime here
   below, they are foolish--and like brute beasts.

   23. Nevertheless I am continually with You. Oh, what a mercy this is
   for Believers! If we are ever so poor, we are continually with God!
   What if we are chastened every morning? It is clear that we must be
   with God, then, for a chastening God must be near!

   23. You have held me by my right hand. "Even when You did whip me.
   Everywhere You have a grip of me. You hold me with Your right hand."
   The Psalmist does not envy the wicked, now--he has risen a stage higher
   than he was a little while ago!

   24, 25. You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me
   to Glory. Whom have I in Heaven but You, and there is none upon earth
   that I desire beside You. Now he finds in God his riches, his joy, his
   prosperity, his portion!

   26, 27. My flesh and my heart fails: but God is the strength of my
   heart, and my portion forever. For, lo, they that are far from You
   shall perish: You have destroyed all them that go a whoring from You.
   To love the world, to love riches, to love sin, to love self--this is
   to be unfaithful to our Marriage Covenant with God--let such conduct
   never be ours.

   28. But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in
   the Lord God, that I may declare all Your works. Thus, you see, the
   Psalmist went down to the depths, but he came up, again, all right, and
   his heart was made glad in the Lord, his God! So may it be with any of
   us who, like he, has been envious of the foolish, when we have seen the
   prosperity of the wicked.

Once Dead, Now Alive

   (No. 2388)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 30, 1888.

   "And you has He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins."
   Ephesians 2:1.

   I PREACHED to you, this morning, [Sermon #2046, Volume 34--Consolation
   from Resurrection] the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Dead and its
   various bearings. But unless you have experienced spiritual
   resurrection, you do not understand that doctrine and you cannot grasp
   its meaning. Spiritual resurrection may be understood in theory, but it
   cannot be really comprehended until we, ourselves, have been raised out
   of spiritual death. Always remember that in the things of God,
   knowledge is only to be gained by personal experience. If you would
   understand regeneration, you must be born again. If you would
   understand faith, simple as it is, you must, yourselves, believe.

   Tonight I want to give you another exposition of spiritual quickening
   as it is described in my text--"And you has He quickened, who were dead
   in trespasses and sins." There are three things about which I am going
   to speak to you. First, you were dead. Secondly, some of you have been
   quickened. And, thirdly, of those of you who have been quickened, it
   can be truly said that you are now alive.

   I. First, then, YOU WERE DEAD.

   I think that I must, in imagination, take you into that death chamber.
   The blinds are all drawn, there is a great hush about the room. Here is
   a coffin covered with a white cloth--turn it back, gently, and stand
   with me--and look at the person who lies sleeping there. He is dead.
   Alas, there is woe in the family, for the brother is dead. Here is the
   terribly true picture of what we were by nature--I mean, what we all
   were--and what many still are. God grant that they may be delivered
   from this sad condition!

   To find out what spiritual death means, I shall ask you to remember
   that this dead body, here, is characterized by an absence of sense. Be
   not afraid, it is your brother man. Come close to him and speak. He
   does not hear you. Speak more loudly. He does not answer you, he gives
   no sign of recognition. Shout at the very top of your voice--stoop down
   and speak into his ear. Alas, it is the clay-cold ear of death upon
   which no effect whatever is produced! I remember when I was spiritually
   just like that. I could not hear, even, the voice of Jesus, though it
   was very soft and tender. He said, "Come unto Me," but I did not
   respond to His call. There were others near me who did, but I was dead
   and took no notice. Then there came a louder sound, a voice of
   threatening, a message of condemnation! God spoke from the top of Sinai
   and hurled at me the ten great thunderbolts of His Law. But I still did
   not hear. I had broken all those commands and I must bear the penalty
   of disobedience--the Law told me so, but I did not hear. Friends led
   me, sometimes, dead as I was, where both the Law and the Gospel were
   fully preached, but I did not hear. I could not hear. Sounds went past
   the drums of my ears and my body heard, but the ear of my heart was not
   reached. I could not hear, for I was dead.

   Let us see if our friend in the coffin can see. Here, lift up the
   coffin lid, wave a lighted candle before his eyes. Pull up that blind,
   let in the sunlight. He does not see and he cannot see. There are none
   so blind as the dead. And there was a time with me--and I use myself
   sorrowfully as an example--when I could not see. I could not see my
   Lord, I could not see His love, I could not see His bleeding heart, I
   could not see His thorn-crowned head. I saw no beauty in the Altogether
   Lovely One. I was wrapped up in my own worldly pleasure and in
   myself--and I was not alive unto God. Ah, me, this is, indeed,
   death--to be unable to hear or to see!

   Can this dead body perceive anything by smelling? Here, bring that
   smelling bottle and place it close to the man's nostrils. It contains
   the strongest volatile salts that would make the tears come to some of
   our eyes--but it does not affect him. Burn the rarest incense, fill the
   chamber with the smoke, yet he recognizes nothing as to what sweet
   perfume is in the room. And well do I remember when my mother told me
   that there had been much unction about the sermon and my father said
   that the Lord was there, and that it was as when one breaks a box of
   ointment and the house is filled with the sweetest odors--but I declare
   to you that I discerned nothing of its fragrance! There was, to me, no
   spiritual sweetness, no subtle delight about the doctrines of the
   Gospel, for I was dead!

   Perhaps this man may have lost the power of sight, hearing and
   smelling, but yet he may be alive. Let us see if he has any sense of
   taste. Bring here the most nauseous drug, or give me gall and wormwood,
   and I will put a few drops on his lips. These things are not loathsome
   to him! Now let us try sugar and honey and all things that are luscious
   and sweet. Evidently you might as well lay these things upon a slab of
   marble, for the dead man has no taste for them! It was just so with me
   spiritually. I knew not, in those days, the sweetness of the Gospel of
   Christ, nor even the bitterness of sin. I had no taste, for I was
   dead--and that is what you all were, my Brothers and Sisters! That is
   what some are who are sitting at your side in the pew--dead--having no
   taste for heavenly joys.

   But, perhaps, after all, these senses may be gone and yet life may
   remain. Let me see if the man can feel. Let me press his hand very
   gently. No, he does not press mine in return. I will stoop down and
   kiss the face of this, my brother, but there is no smile upon his
   countenance, though he would have smiled in other days. He is dead. He
   can feel nothing of pain or joy. It is a dreadful thing to be sitting
   in God's House as, perhaps, some of you are, feeling nothing whatever!
   I would give my eyes, no, I would give even my life to save this
   company if I knew how to speak so as to reach men's hearts! But there
   is no mode of human language that can make a dead heart live, or make a
   stony heart to beat with the pulsations of life. This comes from
   another and a higher Power than mine. But, apart from the operations of
   the Spirit of God, all are, by nature, dead, and this is what some of
   you are even now, spiritually dead and, therefore, devoid of holy
   senses.

   There is another test that we may apply to see if there is an absence
   of desire. I will speak to this dead man and say, "Friend, you lie here
   dead--do you know it? You who cannot feel, or hear, or see--do you wish
   to live? Do you desire to live? There is no answer to my question. But
   I can tell you that because he is dead, he does not even desire to
   live--and this, too, is the state of many spiritually. They have not
   any wish after heavenly things. You are quite content if you have money
   enough to pay your way, or if you have enough to enjoy yourself at the
   theater, or in some worldly gaiety. But as for God, Christ and
   Heaven--these may all go as far as you are concerned. You have no
   desire for them, you are dead-- dead to the very things for which men
   were made to live, and by which, alone, men do live! You are dead and
   you have no desire after life.

   Shall I speak to the corpse, again? It is no use, for the man has no
   senses and no desire. Beside that, there is an absence of power. Has
   not this man the power to get life, the power to do something good? I
   lift his hand--it drops down powerless. I try the other hand--it is no
   sooner up than it falls down, again. It is evidently useless to attempt
   to force him to any action, for he is without power. We, also, were
   "without strength." Oh, how can this dead man live if he can do nothing
   towards making himself alive? I will tell you that, by-and-by, but,
   meanwhile, this is an essential part of death--that the man is "without
   strength."

   Further, in those who are naturally or spiritually dead there is an
   absence of fellowship with the living. If this man cannot do anything
   for himself, let us get him up and dress him! Come here, good woman,
   you who washed him, come, and put on his best clothes and make him sit
   up. It was not long ago that we saw the picture of a dead emperor lying
   dressed in his warrior's garments. So dress this man up in his Sunday
   suit and let him sit at the table with his wife and children! You
   shudder at the suggestion and tell me that it is impossible. Yet the
   Egyptians set a skeleton at their feasts, so as to remind themselves of
   death--and it was not altogether unwise. But if I had my choice of a
   place at the table, I would not elect to have our bony friend next to
   me! And I think that if the dead were seated at our festivals, we would
   all naturally shrink from that part of the table.

   Thus you can see what death does spiritually--it shuts you out of
   fellowship with the living people of God. You were in a room, the other
   night, where there were half-a-dozen Christian people and you said to
   yourself, "This is about the dullest evening I have ever spent." You
   went to a service, the other day, where there was much prayer, and you
   made fun

   of it when you came away, it was so dreary to you. Yes, of course it
   was, and if you were condemned to go to Heaven-- no, I have not made a
   mistake, I mean what I say--if you were condemned to go to Heaven, it
   would be a Hell to you! You would not be able to endure that constant
   praise of God, that perpetual adoration of Him which is the occupation
   of the blessed! You would have no heart for that. "Let me out," you
   would say, "I had rather go to my own place than stay here." Thus, you
   see, you are dead. And the dead are shut out from fellowship with the
   living.

   Then, once more, there are tokens of decay. We will not take this man
   from the coffin--we will let him lie there. Look at him. It is now four
   days since he was pronounced dead. I noticed, when I came into the room
   just after his death, that his face looked, perhaps, more sweet than it
   did during his lifetime. It often happens that when the time of the
   extreme pain which brought on death has come altogether to an end, the
   face seems to regain its former sweetness which was obliterated by the
   pain, and the man looks more beautiful than before. And often the
   countenance appears restful, though the heart, before death, was full
   of anguish. Yes, but that was a little while after death when I noticed
   this sweet expression of face. How is it with the corpse four days,
   five days, say, six days after death? Ah, me, come, Undertaker, nail
   this coffin lid down--it is not meet that any other eyes should look at
   this ghastliness, or that anyone else should see these tokens of decay!

   It is just so spiritually. The young man who is dead in sin, may, under
   his mother's care at home, look very beautiful. There may be no trace
   of spiritual death about him. You might think him--and he may think
   himself--better than a great many Christians! Have I not heard him say
   that it is so? But give him time to show what he really is! Bring him
   to London--place him in a large warehouse. Let him go out in the
   evening and let there be nobody to meet him but the strange woman. Ah,
   within how short a time the destructiveness of horrible sin may be seen
   in his character! Could that fond mother, who sent him from her
   fireside comparatively pure, see what he has become, she might almost
   say, "Bury him out of my sight!" This is the way we were all going to
   decay till our Lord Jesus appeared to us and stopped the corruption by
   dethroning Death and putting spiritual life into us through faith in
   Himself!

   I think, perhaps, I have said enough on this part of my subject, so I
   will not take you back to the death chamber.

   II. Now, in the second place, dear Friends, to all who have believed in
   Christ it can be truly said, "YOU HAVE BEEN QUICKENED." So the text
   says, "You has He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins."

   Do you remember how that happened? I can only speak about myself in
   such a matter as this, because one man cannot enter into another's
   experience, but I think that what I see in myself, you have seen in
   yourselves, you who are alive unto God. There came a time when I began
   to live! I remember it well--I not only remember when the new life
   first came into my soul, but I can distinctly recall the first effect
   of it. I am told that when a man has been drowning and he begins to
   return to consciousness, when they rub him back to conscious life, the
   first sensation is that of exquisite pain as the blood begins to flow,
   again, in the channels in which it had been latent.

   When the life-blood began to flow in my heart spiritually, it gave me
   nothing but pain. I was lost and I felt that it was so. I was not dead,
   was I, if I felt? Then I heard the Gospel, and I did hear it, too, with
   awful distinctness! I remember to have had, on one occasion, a slight
   deafness, and when the surgeon had attended to my ears and I went into
   the street, I wished myself deaf again, for all the noises were so
   dreadful to my ears, so intense was every little sound! We ought to
   thank God that we do not hear more than we do--if we heard more, we
   would not hear anything at all--we would hear so much that the
   different sounds would not convey any meaning to our mind! So was it
   with me, I heard too much. The thunder of the Law of God deafened me
   and when I heard the voice of the Savior, it seemed to say, "You have
   rejected Me and I have left you to perish! The door of mercy is now
   shut and will not be opened to you." I began to feel what sin really
   was and to realize that I could not escape from it--and that a just God
   must punish me! Yet I consented to the punishment, dreadful as it was,
   and confessed that I did not wish the Lord to be unjust even to save
   me. This was the tremendous terror of my state--that I had received a
   living consciousness of what was right, and sided with the right--yet
   all the while felt that the righteous Judge condemned me!

   What happened after that? Being quickened and having felt this pain,
   after a while I woke up as out of an awful sleep and I seemed to say to
   myself, "Where am I?" I had been born into a new world! Some of you
   know the egg-shell of this poor sinful world, but you do not know the
   real life of it. A man may go dreaming on through this world, seeing
   the sun, moon, stars and all things that are visible, but he may never
   have discovered the true life which is invisible. So it was with me.
   If, all of a sudden, this lamp, here, could be made into a living
   thing, it would be a strange change for it to find itself

   alive in the midst of this crowd of people, where it has stood so long
   a poor, dead, metallic thing! There was some such change as that worked
   in me--I thought that if the world was not new, I was! Something
   wonderful had happened to me! I can tell you that I had a sort of twist
   that day and I have never got over it--and I have no wish to get over
   it!

   Everything seemed different to me. I looked at all things through new
   eyes and heard with new ears and, somehow, I discovered what I had
   never dreamed of, for I talked to God! Christ was near me! His Spirit
   was within me! I saw living men and women in this new world and I began
   to wish to get among them and would have been glad to have washed the
   feet of any of them so long as they would but permit me to be in their
   company! I remember that experience. Do you? We must all have felt
   something like that if we have really been born from above!

   And then, being thus alive, we had to learn everything. You see, a
   person just born into the world and knowing nothing is like a newborn
   infant. I suppose that when an infant first sees, it cannot measure
   distances. It does not know whether a thing is close to it, or far
   away. All that the eyes can bring to it seems flat at the first.
   Mothers do not always reflect how little their children know--and how
   all the things that we know as a matter of course were really learned
   by experience. Once we did not understand much, just like babies that
   do not, at first, comprehend what is said to them, and could not reply
   even if they understood. There are a few simple words, or syllables, by
   which they speak to mother and father--and you are very pleased when
   they are able to say them--and you talk of it to one another as a great
   achievement when baby has uttered a whole sentence!

   I have heard you and I remember doing the same thing, myself. It is so
   natural for us to like to hear the first words of our children. That is
   just how it was with God and ourselves spiritually--we had everything
   to learn. We were alive, but we did not know much. We were rather
   puzzled by some of our big Brothers and Sisters, but our heavenly
   Father accepted our broken utterances and our oft-mistaken words. We
   did see, though we did not know much about the laws of perspective. We
   did hear, though we did not understand music and harmony. We did
   feel--and that was a proof that we were alive. Oh, what a mercy that
   was!

   Very soon, we began to have new needs. Do you remember that experience?
   We felt a new hunger--we had never had that while we were dead. We
   needed to feed on the Truth of God! Do you remember when you went to
   hear a certain popular preacher deliver one of his wonderful sermons
   and everybody else spoke of it as, "splendid," but you said to
   yourself, "I do not know what there was in it, but certainly I did not
   get any food for my soul"? Another time, you were taken to hear a
   plain, simple minister who talked about Jesus and His love, and others
   exclaimed, "He is a poor preacher, with no name, and no fame," but you
   said, "I do not know how it is, but I am satisfied with the feast I
   have had, I feel as if I had been sitting at the King's banqueting
   table." Ah, God's people know the difference between flowers and fruit!
   They know the difference between meat and mere plate, spoon and
   fork--and they are not to be deceived! You remember when you began to
   hunger and to thirst, and oh, when you drank your first draught of the
   Living Water, you could not make out what it was! You see, you had been
   dead, and all these things were new to you. What was hunger? What was
   thirst? How did you come to have such sensations? You never hungered
   after Christ, you never thirsted after the Gospel while you were dead
   in sin! But now you have many things that are quite new to you--new
   fears, new cares, new doubts, new aspirations.

   Let me remind you that you also had new joys. Your heart began to dance
   at the sound of Christ's name! You never danced at the sound of that
   name while you were dead, but when you had received spiritual life,
   that dear name had all the music of Heaven in it when it rang in your
   ears, and your heart responded, "Jesus, precious Jesus--

   "'No music's like Your charming name, Nor half so sweet can be.'"

   Oh, what rapture you had in those early days! You went forth with joy
   and were led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills broke forth
   before you into singing and all the trees of the field clapped their
   hands! That delight has not gone from you now, has it? You are still
   happy in the Lord, you can sing as joyously as ever--

   "Oh happy day, that fixed my choice

   On You, my Savior, and my God!

   Well may this glowing heart rejoice

   And tell its raptures all abroad!" You see how it is with you now--life
   has brought you, as a new creature, into a new world--old things have
   passed away, behold, all things have become new! So far, I hope that
   many have been able to follow me.

   II. Now comes the closing point and I must say only a few words upon
   it, for I should like you to sing a verse of "Happy Day," before we
   separate. The third division is YOU ARE NOW ALIVE. Yes, as many as have
   believed in the Lord Jesus Christ are spiritually alive! Does not He
   say, "He that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live"?

   You are spiritually alive. Very well, then, do not go back to the
   grave. It was a madman's taste to go and live in a cemetery. The
   demoniac from the country of the Gadarenes had his habitation among the
   tombs and, surely, nobody in his right mind would think of having such
   an abode as that! If you are alive, do not go and live in the grave.
   Sometimes a person says to me, "Tell me, Sir, may I go to such and such
   a place of amusement?" When I hear the name of it, I say, "Well, if you
   want to go, go. If you are dead, go and be buried with the dead--we do
   not need any dead souls among the living in Zion. If that sort of thing
   is to your taste, go and enjoy it. But if you are a child of God, it
   will not be your taste. If you are alive from the dead, you will not
   want to go and live in a morgue." I once was in a place where there
   were said to be at least ten thousand skulls heaped up, one above
   another, from floor to ceiling. I should think that there must have
   been quite that number, and as I walked along through those rows of
   skulls, every one of them seeming to be grinning at me, I did not ask
   to be allowed to stay there all night! So, he that is spiritually alive
   does not wish to dwell with sinners in ungodliness! Their merriment
   would be his misery. That which is their delight would cause him the
   most exquisite pain. "Let me get out of this," he would say, "this is
   no place for me." To chain a living man to a skeleton would be a
   horrible torment--do not, I pray you, be chained to a dead man, or a
   dead woman, either--and do not seek your company among the dead. You
   are alive! Therefore, do not go back to the tomb.

   Next, you are alive, therefore, do not be carried on a bier. I have
   seen living men carried about on biers. Here is a man who has long
   heard the good old-fashioned Gospel, but, the other day he met with a
   believer in evolution, one of the monkey-worshippers of whom I told you
   last Thursday night, [Sermon #2056, Volume 34--Idols Found Wanting, But
   Jehovah Found Faithful.] whose father is not in Heaven, but up a tree!
   "Oh!" said the foolish man, as he listened to the heresymonger, "this
   evolution theory is a very wonderful thing!" And so three or four of
   them bore him off on a bier, carried him away from the Truth of God as
   it is in Christ. Of course, if the man is dead, the proper place for
   him is on a bier! But you are alive--therefore you know what the dead
   do not and, I pray that you may know it from the sole of your feet to
   the crown of your head, and stand up for the Truth of God, defend it
   valiantly, and not be driven to and fro with every wind of doctrine,
   just as if you were only a stray straw in the street! Know what God has
   taught you and be prepared to live by it, and to die for it, if need
   be! You are alive, therefore, be alive for the Truth of God and be not
   carried away on a bier.

   Further, you are alive, therefore, do not be wrapped up in grave
   clothes. Have you any on now? I should not wonder if you have. There is
   a piece of red stuff that many living persons still wear--it is called,
   "bad temper." Oh, get rid of that fragment of grave clothes, I entreat
   you! It smells of the tomb! The Lord help you to be sweet, gentle and
   meek! Do not wear your old grave clothes, now that you are alive from
   the dead! Were you covetous? Were you lustful? Were you false? Get rid
   of all these grave clothes. Oh, that God the Holy Spirit may sanctify
   you--spirit, soul and body--till you are clean delivered from these
   cerements of the sepulcher! Lazarus came out of the tomb with his grave
   clothes on, but the Savior said, "Loosen him and let him go," and they
   took the napkin from his head, the winding sheets from about his body
   and the man was free. Do not go about in a winding sheet! Put off the
   old man, with his deeds, and put on the new man. The Lord help you so
   to do!

   You are alive--then another exhortation is, get up and work. You are
   alive unto God. Are you so alive that you mean to sit down and take it
   quietly? Are you going to Heaven in an easy chair? You have climbed up
   the Gospel coach, sat down on the box seat and you say that you mean to
   sit there as long as you live? Oh, you good-for-nothing wretch! Do not
   talk about being saved! Why, you are not yet saved from selfishness!
   When we are really saved, we begin to love other people as well as to
   love God and we desire with all our might to spend and to be spent in
   the Lord's service. You do not suppose that the Lord Jesus Christ came
   here to be a lackey to the lazy, do you? We are not saved by works, but
   if we have not works, we are not saved! We are saved by Grace, but
   Grace makes us a people zealous for good works! God grant that this
   purpose of mercy may be fulfilled in each one of us who was dead, but
   is now alive!

   You are alive, now, therefore glorify Him who quickened you. If I had
   lived in the days of our Lord, I would have liked, if it had been
   possible, to have had a cup of tea with Lazarus. I think that I would
   have asked him down to my house and would have said to him, "Lazarus,
   tell me all about your resurrection. You were dead and your sisters
   buried

   you, and Martha said to the Lord Jesus, 'By this time he stinks: for he
   has been dead four days.' Tell me, did you really hear that voice that
   said, 'Lazarus, come forth,' and did you know the sweet tones of the
   dear Master's call? Were you dead and did that sound bring life with
   it? How did you feel when you found yourself lying on that cold stone
   shelf in the sepulcher, and when the light came streaming in where
   there had been a stone, before, to shut it out? Do you remember how you
   felt when you shuffled out and came from the sepulcher all wrapped up
   in the grave clothes?" "Oh!" Lazarus would say, "my dear Brother, I
   cannot tell you much about these things, but I remember that the first
   thing I saw, when they took the napkin off my eyes, was that blessed
   Man, my Lord and my God! And I knew that He had raised me from the
   dead, and I felt that I could lie at His feet and die again of
   overwhelming love! I loved Him so--for He had raised me from the dead!
   Do not talk about me, speak about Him! Go forth and preach about Him to
   others, wherever you have an opportunity! Say that He raised me from
   the dead, that He can raise others from the dead, and He can make death
   yield up all his spoils, through the power of His resurrection life!"

   That is what I want all you, who are spiritually alive, to do--go forth
   and tell what Jesus has done in raising the dead to life!

   I have finished when I have said just this word to the unsaved. Trust
   Jesus. Trust Him now! Come to Him, now, even by one gracious stride of
   faith, for He is able to save to the uttermost all them that come unto
   God by Him!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Ephesians 4.

   Verse 1. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you. Paul puts
   force into the argument by his manner of speaking. You can hear in his
   words the rattle of his chains! Here is a man who, for Christ's sake,
   has lost his liberty and who, for that reason, pleads with his fellow
   Christians. "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you"--

   1. That you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. "Do
   not dishonor the good cause. Let not your lives bring disgrace upon
   Christ--if you are called Christians--be Christians."

   2. With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one
   another in love. This is the very spirit of Chris-tianity--to be able
   to bear and forbear, to be gentle--not to be selfish or self-seeking,
   or angry and passionate, but full of lowliness and meekness. Brothers
   and Sisters, do not seek the highest place! If you do, you will at
   least have a contested election, for many want that position. But if
   you choose the lowest place, you shall have it, and nobody will try to
   run in opposition to you. There is always plenty of room in the lowly
   places and there is peace there! Let me whisper to you-- they are
   really the highest places in the Church of God! If we will go down, we
   shall ascend! But if we are striving to be great--to be masterful--we
   shall not gain the ends we are seeking and we shall not honor our
   Master.

   3. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond ofpeace.
   That is a living ligature which binds the members of the body together.
   Try to keep in one spirit, united by "the bond of peace."

   4. There is one body. Christ never had two.

   4. And one Spirit. There never were two Holy Spirits. The one Spirit
   that quickened the whole Church of Christ is by Himself, alone.

   4. Even as you are called in one hope of your calling. You have only
   one ground of confidence and you have only one Heaven in which you hope
   to meet all your fellow Believers.

   5. One Lord, one faith, one baptism. There is only one Lord in the
   Christian Church! And there is only one faith. There may be many forms
   of faith, but there is only one true faith. "One baptism." There may be
   many baptisms, so-called, but there can be only one that is the true
   baptism.

   6. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in
   you all. So that if we are one in all these things, we ought to be one
   in a hearty affection towards one another!

   7. But unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of
   the gift of Christ. That is, to every one of us who are members of His
   mystical body. The living members of the living body receive according
   to each one's function and place in the body a measure of Grace for the
   benefit of the whole.

   8-10. Therefore He says, When He ascended on high, He led captivity
   captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now this, "He ascended," what is it
   but that He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He
   who descended is the same, also,

   who ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things).
   When He received gifts for men, and gave them to men, what did He give?

   11. And he gave some, Apostles; and some, Prophets; and some,
   evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers. Different gifts to
   different races.

   12. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for
   the edifying of the body of Christ. The early Church could not have
   been without Apostles and we cannot do without Evangelists. May the
   Lord send many faithful men who will range over the whole country
   preaching the Word! Neither can we do without pastors and teachers and
   it is idle to attempt to do so. Would God we had many more of the sort
   that Jesus gives! Those whom men make are worth nothing, but those whom
   Jesus gives are worth everything!

   13. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
   the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
   the fullness of Christ. When all Christian people shall be well
   developed, mature, then the whole body of Christ will come unto the
   stature of a perfect man. When will that be? There are some who are
   always looking for the perfect Church of Christ, but they have not seen
   it, yet. When Eve was in the making, Adam did not see her--it was only
   when she was complete that she became visible--and today the real
   Church of Christ is only in the making! When she has been fashioned out
   of the side of Christ, then she will be presented to Him without spot,
   or wrinkle, or any such thing. All the various agencies which God has
   appointed are working together for the fashioning of this perfect body
   of the Church.

   Meanwhile, it is equally true that all Believers are intended to grow
   "unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Some of
   them are, in spiritual things, only like children of a span long.
   Others are but as boys and girls in the streets of Jerusalem, while
   some are half-developed men and women! Oh, that we could all come "unto
   the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ!" You know how the
   sergeants stand the recruits against a wall and then measure them to
   see whether they are up to the army standard. Now stand upright and see
   whether you have come "unto the measure of the stature of the fullness
   of Christ." Alas! How very short we are! Oh, that we could grow! Spirit
   of God, make us more like Christ!

   14. That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
   carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and
   cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. There are
   plenty of so-called Christians of that sort, nowadays, who are too weak
   to know anything for themselves. They are not settled and grounded--the
   last person who comes near them and pulls their ear a little hard,
   turns their head his way. The next person who will pull their ear a
   little harder, will turn their head another way! Be no longer children,
   I beseech you, Brothers and Sisters, but be men and women--know what
   you know--hold it with the tenacious grip of a Divinely-implanted faith
   and God help you to escape from those who lie in wait to deceive!

   15. 16. But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into Him in all
   things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly
   joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies,
   according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes
   increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. Every part of
   the body supplies something that is essential to the whole. There are
   certain sacs and vessels, the use of which we cannot tell. Even the
   best anatomist does not know what are their uses, but he does know that
   if they are not there, health cannot be maintained and, in some
   instances, life, itself, would expire if some vessel, quite
   insignificant, should be taken away! Let us believe that all God's
   people are essential to the completion of the body of Christ and that
   all the workers and all the sufferers, too, are needed to make up the
   Church of which Christ is the Head.

   17-19. This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you
   henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their
   mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life
   of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness
   of their heart: who being past feeling--That is a dreadful condition
   for anyone to reach! Let us pray to God to save us from that terrible
   state of heart!

   19. Have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all
   uncleanness with greediness. Oh, dear Friends, we must come away from
   everything that is impure and unclean! May we never, by any conduct of
   ours, give countenance to un-chastity and impurity! Christian people
   must be clear of these things!

   20-25. But you have not so learned Christ; if so be that you have heard
   Him, and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: that you
   put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,

   and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that you put on the new
   man, which, after God, is created in righteousness and true holiness.
   Therefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor:
   for we are members, one of another. They who lie in jest will find out
   that God puts it down as sinning in earnest. Let us never attempt to
   deceive. In the East, in olden times, and I might say as much of the
   present day, it was not usually reckoned a great sin to lie--the great
   evil was when the liars were discovered. Oh, but the Christian man must
   be true in every word that he speaks. He must faithfully keep his
   promises and be known to be a trustworthy, reliable man. If you are not
   true, Christ will not acknowledge you as belonging to Him.

   26. Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath.
   If ever angry, be only angry with evil and never retain anger in your
   heart. It must not last more than a day. They say that a wasp's sting
   dies at night, so, let every resentful thought die away as the sun
   sets.

   27. Neither give place to the devil. He will knock at your door and try
   to get in, but do not offer him a chair. If he forces his company upon
   you, let him know he is not welcome!

   28. Let him who stole steal no more. If he has only been a petty
   pilferer, "Let him who stole steal no more." He that steals a pin will
   one day steal an ox if he can.

   28. But rather let him labor. If he must have something that he does
   not at present possess, this is the way to get it-- not by stealing
   it--but by laboring for it.

   28. Working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to
   give to him that needs. Observe that our trade must be a right one, not
   one that injures others--"Working with his hands the thing which is
   good." But what a remarkable verse this is! A man has been a thief and
   he is to go and get to work! What for? To supply his own necessities?
   Yes, but he is to rise to something higher than that! He is to work
   "that he may have, to give to him that needs." What changes the Grace
   of God makes in a man! He who once took from other people is taught to
   work that he may give to other people! This is, indeed, a turning of
   things the right side uppermost.

   29. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth. Do not
   utter a dirty or corrupt word, no, though it has a merry jest appended
   to it, do not speak it! "He pares his apple who would cleanly feed," is
   a good proverb. Take away all that is corrupt about the story.

   29. But that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister
   Grace unto the hearers. What sweet talking there would be if we all
   spoke in this way--to "minister Grace unto the hearers!" Ah, then, my
   dear Friends, it would not matter how much we talked, if every word
   were salted with salt.

   30. But grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto
   the day of redemption. The Holy Spirit's being in you is your seal that
   you are the child of God--and the power by which you will be preserved
   till the resurrection! Therefore, do not grieve that blessed Spirit.

   31. 32. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil
   speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be you kind, one
   to another. "Kind" is a good old Saxon word! It means kinned. Be you
   kind, like men who are akin to one another--look on all men as your
   brothers!

   32. Tenderhearted, forgiving one another. You will have something that
   will need to be forgiven, and your brother will have something which
   you will need to forgive.

   32. Even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you. The Lord write
   all these words upon our hearts, for Christ's sake! Amen.

Guidance To Grace and Glory

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 2, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   4, 1888.

   "You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to
   Glory." Psalm 73:24.

   The Psalmist, here, evidently perceives that his Lord is near. He does
   not so much speak of God as to Him--"You shall guide me with Your
   counsel." You know what the French call, tutoyage--you-ing and
   you-ing--there is something of that kind of language in the text, a
   speaking in tones of hallowed familiarity with God. As if the Lord were
   close by, the Psalmist says to Him, "You shall guide me with Your
   counsel, and afterward receive me to Glory"--not in the way of prayer
   asking God to do so, but in childlike confidence expressing the
   conviction that it shall be so and rejoicing in the blessed assurance
   of it. "You shall"--I know You will, I am sure of it, I have firm
   reliance on it, and I bless You for it--"You shall guide me with Your
   counsel, and afterward receive me to Glory." It is not every man who
   can talk like that and it is not every believing man who has yet
   attained confidence enough to dare to speak so. It is well if you can
   only pray that this may be the case with you, but the sweetness lies in
   grasping this Truth of God with a childlike delight and, with
   unfaltering faith believing it to be yours. "You shall guide me with
   Your counsel, and afterward receive me to

   Glory."

   The Psalmist had been, to some extent, finding fault with the
   Providence of God. There had been, in his mind, a quarrel with God's
   proceedings. He saw the wicked in great power, having all their wishes
   and desires gratified in every way, while he, himself, was sorely
   plagued and chastened, and he could not quite understand it. But now,
   even though he does not comprehend it, he yields to God's superior
   judgment, he lays aside his own logic and arguments and he says, "No,
   Lord, I will no longer be a debater, but You shall guide me. I will no
   longer look for present joy, I will look to that which is to come
   afterward. You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward shall
   come my brilliant days, my times ofjoy--afterward You will receive me
   to Glory." You see that after drifting about for a while, the Psalmist
   has come to a good anchorage. He has found a resting place, as the
   birds do, when, after wandering away, they fly back to their nest and
   he sings, "Return unto your rest, O my Soul, for the Lord has dealt
   bountifully with you." Sitting down once more at the feet of his Lord,
   he looks up into those dear, tender, loving, watchful eyes and he says,
   "You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to
   Glory. My discussions are all over now. My questions are at an end. I
   will rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him, and my soul shall be
   content with His will, whatever it is." I pray that what the Holy
   Spirit may lead me to say upon my text may have an effect something
   like that upon any tempest-tossed spirits here. May they also be
   brought to rest in the Lord!

   First, dear Friends, I will speak concerning the conviction which led
   the Psalmist to take a guide. Secondly, I will say a little upon the
   confidence which led him to take God for his Guide. Thirdly, I will
   talk to you about the delightful commerce between the Psalmist and his
   God which began when God had become his Guide, and continued throughout
   his life. And then, the fourth point, which shall be our finis, shall
   be, the sure result of this guidance. "You shall afterward receive me
   to Glory."

   I. First, then, concerning THE CONVICTION WHICH LED THE PSALMIST TO
   TAKE A GUIDE. Happily for him, that conviction came very early. If I am
   to have a guide on my journey, I should like to have one at the
   beginning, for it is the starting that has so much to do with all the
   rest of the way. If I start due south when I ought to have gone north,
   I shall have to retrace many a weary step! Dear young Friends, if you
   can have God to be your Guide, now, in the morning of life, how happy
   you will be! It will influence for good the whole of your future
   existence, depend upon it! As

   the river is colored by the glacier from which it flows and never, even
   when larger and deeper, quite loses the whiteness of its mountain
   source, so, if you begin with God at the fountainhead and spring of
   life, there will be a peculiar charm around your pathway as long as you
   live! Permit me to say that I have found it so myself. I can say to my
   Lord and do often say it, "O God, You have taught me from my youth, and
   until now have I declared Your wondrous works! Now, when I am old and
   gray-headed, O God, forsake me not." There is a sweet plea when years
   multiply upon you, if you can say to the Lord--

   "In early years You were my Guide, And of my youth the Friend."

   David began to experience Divine guidance while he was a shepherd boy
   and it was well for him that it was so. But why did he ever feel that
   he needed a guide? I suppose it was because of a work of Grace upon his
   heart, for, naturally, we do not like being guided. The mother's apron
   strings grow irksome to the young man when he finds the down coming
   upon his cheek--he will have his own way--is it not manly to be one's
   own master? Allow me to say that there is no worse master! You had
   better serve the greatest tyrant than be your own master! But it is
   often thus with the young--at first they call it liberty to have their
   own way. And it is only when the Grace of God softens and sobers them,
   when He gives the young men wisdom, knowledge and discretion, that they
   begin to dream that they need a guide.

   I heard a good old man speak, the other day. He was a doctor of
   divinity and I introduced him to the children, in a somewhat merry
   manner, by telling them that he was a doctor of divinity and that
   doctors of divinity knew everything, and a few things beside. But when
   he began to speak, he said, "My dear Children, I do not know
   everything, but I will tell you one thing that I do know, I know that I
   do not know much. I have been a long time learning it, but I have, at
   last, learned that I do not know much." And when he had expatiated upon
   that, he said, "and, dear Children, I have learned another thing--I
   know that I am not fit to take care of myself. I wonder," he added,
   "whether all the boys and girls here have yet come to that conviction,
   that they are not fit to take care of themselves, and that they need
   somebody to lead them all the way through life."

   It is a fine piece of knowledge when you have learned as much as that!
   I pray that all who are young may learn it soon and that others who, by
   painful experience, begin to see that they are not quite as wise as
   they thought they were, will come to the conclusion that they are not
   fit to manage themselves, after all--and that they need a higher power,
   a wiser eye, a keener mind, a mightier hand, a more supreme will to
   govern them than any that they have of their own.

   I suppose that the Psalmist said to the Lord, "You shall guide me,"
   because he had been convinced of his own folly and, therefore, felt
   that it was well to commit himself into wiser hands. And also, perhaps,
   that he had obtained some knowledge of the difficulties of the way. The
   way of life is a trying one to most people. To many it is very
   difficult. To those who find it easy, it is probably less so than to
   those who find it difficult. It is a very unfriendly world to live in
   if you have to fight with poverty, or if you have to work hard to
   provide for the day's needs. But I question whether it is not a worse
   world to the man who has not to work and who has all that heart can
   wish. The most perilous position for a young man to be placed in is,
   very early in life, to have a large income with nobody to check him in
   spending it, and to be permitted to do just whatever he likes.

   Oh, those very smooth ways--how many slip therein who might have stood,
   perhaps, had the road been rougher! But to no one of us is the path of
   life an easy one if we desire to be pure, clean, upright and accepted
   with God. He is, indeed, a fool who attempts to walk in that way
   without a guide! Look at yourself, full of folly. Look at the way, full
   of pitfalls and dangers of every kind. You may well stop and say, "I
   must have a guide, I dare not go alone a step further on such a
   perilous path." No doubt the Psalmist had seen others set out without a
   guide and he had heard of their falls, and of their ruin. You have not
   lived long, young man, but you have been in the world long enough to
   have seen or to have heard of many who seemed likely to be great and
   good who, nevertheless, have come to an evil end. That will be your
   portion, too, as well as theirs, if you venture to walk in this
   difficult way without a guide.

   The Psalmist's desire to have a guide also showed his great anxiety to
   be right. I wish that all men began life with an earnest desire to act
   rightly and that each one would say, "I shall never live this life,
   again. I should like to make it a good one as far as I can." Since you
   cannot come back to mend it, but, as it is, it will have to be
   presented before the great Judge of All, seek to do that which is right
   each day and to obey your God every hour you live. If this were the
   intense

   desire of everyone of us, we would be driven at once to this
   conclusion--"I must have a guide. I want to live a glorious life and if
   I am to do so, I must be helped in it, for I am incompetent for the
   task by myself."

   I am merely giving you the outline of a sermon. I have not time to fill
   it up, so now I leave this first point, the conviction which led the
   Psalmist to take a guide.

   II. Secondly, let us think of THE CONFIDENCE WHICH LED HIM TO TAKE GOD
   AS HIS GUIDE. If we were but in our right senses, we would all do so!

   A man, looking about wisely for a guide, will prefer to have the very
   best--and is not God, who is infinitely wise, the best Guide that we
   can have? Who questions it? Is not the Lord, also, the most loving, the
   most tender, the most considerate, the most fatherly of all beings who
   can be chosen as a guide? Wisdom, when attended with discourtesy and
   unfeeling roughness, may be shunned by us, but Divine Wisdom, dressed
   in robes of love and tenderness, invites us to run into her arms!
   Choose God, I pray you, because He so well knows the way and because He
   has such a tender love for poor trembling humanity.

   Choose Him, also, because of His constant, unceasing, Infallible care.
   If I choose a guide who may die on the road, I am likely to be unhappy,
   but God will never die. If I choose a guide who, being my friend at the
   start, will not care for me when I have advanced half way on my
   journey, I am unwise in my choice. But God cannot change, He will
   always be the same! If I had to ascend the Alps and I selected a guide
   who could help me over the easy portions of the road, but would be
   unable to aid me in the more difficult parts of it, I should again be
   unhappy. The Lord is a Guide who will never fail, never alter and never
   die. Oh, you are wise, indeed, if you will say to Him, "My God, You
   shall guide me with Your counsel!"

   But will God guide us? Well, it were in vain to choose Him if He would
   not! But of all beings, God is most easy of access. You know how it is
   with some of us who are very, very, very busy and who scarcely ever
   have a moment's rest at all from the rising of the sun till far into
   the night. There is a knock at the door. There is another knock at the
   door. There is another and, at last, if we are to be prepared for our
   public duties, we are obliged to say that we cannot be seen--we must
   have a little time to ourselves. But there is never an hour when God
   cannot be seen, never a moment when His door will not open to any who
   come to ask advice of Him! And God is everywhere, so that, wherever you
   are, you can find Him--not only in the place where you bow the knee in
   private prayer, but out on the exchange, amid the throng of men, or in
   the streets, or on the omnibus, or in the ship at sea, or in the
   train--anywhere and everywhere! A breath, an aspiration will find Him,
   or--

   "The upward glancing of an eye," a sigh, an unexpressed desire and you
   have come to Him at once! And He has servants everywhere to do the
   bidding of His love when we have sought His help.

   The Psalmist was truly wise in saying to the Lord, "You shall guide me
   with Your counsel." Dear Friends, are you equally wise in that way? I
   see young men and women here in considerable numbers--will not each of
   you say, "Yes, Lord, it is even so. From this 4th day of October, my
   heart says to You, 'You shall guide me with Your counsel'"?

   III. Now I must pass on to my third point, only skimming the surface of
   the subject. Think of THE HEAVENLY COMMERCE WHICH NOW BEGINS BETWEEN
   THE SOUL AND ITS GUIDE.

   How does God guide men? Here, let me warn you against the superstitions
   which some persons use with the idea that God will guide them in that
   way. Above all, avoid the superstition which some practice by opening
   the Bible at random in the hope of being guided by the text which comes
   first to sight! You will often be misled if you act thus. The heathen
   acted so with Virgil and I think the heathen were, in that respect,
   better than Christians, because when they played the fool, they did it
   with Virgil--not with God's Book. Do not so, I pray you. One of these
   days you may open at this text, "He went and hanged himself," and if
   you are not satisfied with that passage, you may open the Bible at
   another place, and find it written, "Go, and do you likewise," but that
   will not excuse you if you commit suicide! Nothing can be more wicked
   and absurd than such a practice as that.

   How, then, does God guide us? First, by the general directions of His
   Word. You need to know what God would have you to do. Nine times out of
   ten, look to the Ten Commandments and you will, at least, know what you
   must not do-- and knowing what you must not do, you will be able to
   conclude what you may do. There are some wonderfully plain directions
   in God's Word as to all manner of circumstances and conditions. You may
   often imitate the saints of old and

   you may always imitate their Master! And, in imitating Christ, you will
   know what to do. This is the question that will guide you as to your
   course of action--What would Jesus Christ have done if He had been in
   my circumstances? Apart from His Godhead, in which you cannot copy Him,
   what would the Man, Christ Jesus, have done? Do that--for it is sure to
   be the wisest thing! So, first, be guided by the general directions
   given in God's Word.

   The next way of guidance is that there are great principles infused in
   every man who takes God for his Guide. Among the rest, there are
   principles like this--avoid everything that is evil. That one direction
   post will often stop you and show you which way you ought not to go,
   because, if there is anything wrong about the road, however profitable
   it may seem to be, however easy and pleasant it is and, above all,
   however customary it is for others to go that way, you must not travel
   along it! There are many in the broad road, but you must not make one
   more. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto life,
   and few there are that find it." You keep to the narrow way and you
   will be in the right road.

   The next general principle of our holy religion is that we ought to
   live for the Glory of God, alone. You could not have a much better
   guide than such questions as these--"What action would reflect most
   honor upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? Which course would be
   most creditable to my religious profession? Which would be likely to do
   most good?" Follow that rule--it is almost equal to the Urim and
   Thummim of the High Priest if you have these questions to guide you!

   You are bid, also, to show love to your fellow men. If you are in a
   difficulty about two courses of action, do the more loving of the
   two--that by which you can most deny yourself and most benefit your
   fellow creatures--especially with reference to their salvation. Thus,
   by infusing principles of self-denial, principles of faith in God,
   principles of humility and contentment, the Word of God and the Spirit
   of God supply us with directions on the road we are to travel.

   Next to this, God guides His people on the way of life by giving a
   certain balance of the faculties. When we come to God in
   penitence--when we are born again of the Spirit and live by faith in
   Christ--then, first of all, fear is banished and faith takes its place.
   We are then better able to judge which is the right road. "There were
   they in great fear, where no fear was." Many a man has done wrong
   because he had not the courage to do right, but you who have been born
   again have not the spirit of fear, but the spirit of love, courage and
   faith! And you have a sound mind, so that thus you are guided aright.
   By your faculties being left undisturbed by fear, your mental balance
   is maintained!

   Obstinacy is a shocking thing as a guide in life. Young men have
   resolved that they will do so and so if they die for it. Yes, but the
   Grace of God dethrones obstinacy and gives us, in its place,
   acquiescence in the Divine will. Bowing with submission to the will of
   God--by that very fact we are furnished with unerring guidance!

   Haste, too, is the author of a great deal of mischief in human life.
   Men are in such a hurry that they make all manner of mistakes, but the
   habit of praying about everything is, in itself, a great guide. You
   have to stop a while and the very stopping lets you see more than you
   would have seen in your hurry. The habit of praying before you leap
   leads to the habit of looking before you leap--and then, when you
   perceive that you cannot leap--prayer gives you enough of prudence to
   resolve that you will go round some other way. Thus you are wisely
   guided in life.

   Above all, the Grace of God guides us very much by the dethroning of
   self as the traitorous lord of our being and makes us loyal to Christ.
   When a man acts out of loyalty to Christ, he is pretty sure to act very
   wisely and rightly. On this point, alone, I would have liked to have
   had an hour's talk with you, but I must draw my remarks to a close.

   I believe that, over and above this infusion of right principles, and
   balancing of the faculties, there is a special illumination of mind
   which comes from dwelling near God. Everybody knows how near akin sin
   is to insanity. Well, now, remember that holiness is as near akin to
   perfect wisdom as sin is to insanity! When you yield yourself to the
   holy influences of God's Presence, you shall have given to you what men
   call "shrewd commonsense," but what is really an illumination of mind
   which comes from dwelling near God and being made like He!

   And, lastly, I believe that at the very worst times, when all these
   things will fail you as a guide,you may expect mysterious impulses, for
   which you can never account, which will come to you and guide you
   aright. There are many stories, which I should like to have told,
   relating to instances in which men of God have been directed, by some
   strange impulse on their minds, to do things which they had never
   thought of doing. And what they have done has turned out to be for the
   saving of life, or for deliverance from great evils. Oh, yes, if you
   live near God, He will say things to you that He will not tell anybody
   else! There are monitions of the Spirit which come to men who deal
   intimately with the Invisible that do

   not come to everybody--only let not every fool who gets a silly notion
   into his head run away with the idea that it came from God!

   Only this week, a young man said to me, "You believe the Bible, Sir?"
   "Yes, I believe the Bible, certainly." "Do you believe what God says?"
   "Certainly I do." "Well," he said, "I had a revelation, the other night
   and a voice said to me, 'Behold, I have set before you an open door,
   and no man can shut it."' "All right," I said. And he then said to me,
   "That door leads into your College and you are to take me in." I
   replied, "So I will when I get a revelation that I am to do so, but,
   you see, the revelation, whatever it is worth, has only come to you and
   I shall not let you in till I have one to the same effect." I have a
   notion that I shall never have that revelation, and that he received
   it, not from God's Word, but through a slight aperture in his cracked
   brain! There are many persons who get revelations of that kind, to
   which we pay no sort of attention. The mysterious impulses that I mean
   come only to those who are really serving God and who, in closely
   waiting upon Him, find that "the secret of the Lord is with them that
   fear Him; and He will show them His Covenant."

   IV. But I must finish my discourse. The finis was to be, THE SURE
   RESULT OF THIS GUIDANCE. "You shall

   guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to Glory."

   On earth there is no real glory for us unless we are guided by God's
   counsel. There is no true glory for any man who takes his own course.
   Glory is for those of you who put your hand into the hand of the great
   Father and pray Him to forgive all your iniquities for Christ's sake
   and lead you in the way everlasting. Afterward, He will receive you to
   Glory.

   This is a delightful thought, but I can now only answer this one
   question. When we die, who will receive us into Glory? Well, I do not
   doubt that the angels will. John Bunyan's description of the shining
   ones who come down to the brink of the river to help the pilgrims up on
   the other side of the cold stream--I doubt not is all true, but the
   text tells us of Somebody better than the angels who will come and
   receive us! Our dying prayer to our Lord will be, "Into Your hands I
   commend my spirit," and His answer will be, "I receive you to Glory."
   Our heavenly Father stands watching for the moment when our redeemed
   spirit shall pass into His hands that He may receive it! Our Savior,
   who bought us with His precious blood, stands waiting to receive the
   jewel for which He paid so dear a price! The Spirit of God, who dwells
   in us, is also waiting to perfect the work which He has carried on so
   long--and to lift us up into the blessedness of the Eternal

   City.

   Oh, how I wish that every person here who has not yet yielded himself
   or herself to Christ, would do so now! Breathe silently these words
   before you leave the pew. I will give you a second or two in which to
   do it--"You shall guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me
   to Glory." Bow your heads and let that prayer be offered.

   Lord, You shall guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to
   Glory! For Jesus' sake, accept this resolve! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm 39.

   To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

   Jeduthun was one of those who led the sacred song in the House of God
   in David's day and, long afterwards, we find the son of Jeduthun still
   engaged in this holy service! What a blessing it is to be succeeded in
   the work of God by your children from generation to generation! May
   that be your privilege, my dear Brothers and Sisters! May your families
   never lack a man to stand before the Lord God of Israel to sing His
   praises! This is called, "A Psalm of David." His life was a very
   checkered one. Sometimes he was very joyous and then he wrote bright
   and happy Psalms. But he was a man of strong passions and deep
   feelings, so at times he was very sad. And then he touched the mournful
   string. This is a very sorrowful Psalm, but it is full of teaching. How
   grateful we ought to be that such a man as David ever lived and that he
   had such wonderful experiences! It may be said of him that he was--

   "A man so various, that he seemed to be Not one, but all mankind's
   epitome."

   Well was he made the type of Christ in whose great heart the joys and
   sorrows of humanity met to the fullest! Thus the Psalmist sings--

   Verse 1. I said, I will take heed to my ways. It is not everybody who
   would like to remember what he has uttered, but David could remember
   and dwell upon what he had formerly said--"I said, I will take heed to
   my ways." That is a good thing to do. He that does not take heed to his
   ways had need do so. Heedless and careless and heedless and graceless
   are much the same thing. He that does not take heed of what he does
   will be sure to do wrong.

   1. That I sin not with my tongue. He that does not sin with his tongue
   usually has his whole nature under government. The tongue is the rudder
   of the vessel and if that is managed well, the ship will be rightly
   steered. "I said, I resolved, I determined and I uttered my
   determination--I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
   tongue." Just then David was sinning in his heart, for it was in a
   great state of ferment, but he said, "I will not sin with my tongue."
   It was with him as it sometimes is with the captain of a vessel--if
   someone on board is suffering from the yellow fever, the ship master
   will not send a boat to shore for fear of spreading infection. His
   vessel will be in quarantine till all danger is past. It was thus with
   David--while all within him was seething and boiling in feverish
   impatience, he said, "I shall not speak for the present, I will take
   heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue."

   1. I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
   The marginal reading is, "with a muzzle for my mouth." David would not
   speak at all and herein he was not right. If he had said, "I will keep
   my mouth with a bridle," as our translation has it, that would have
   been perfectly proper. We ought never to leave off bridling our tongue,
   but David muzzled his. He would not speak at all while the wicked were
   before him. He knew that they would misconstrue his words, that they
   would make mischief of whatever he said, so he muzzled himself when in
   their company.

   2. I was dumb with silence. "I did not speak, I could not speak--'I was
   dumb with silence.'"

   2. I held my peace, even from good. David's conduct proves that even
   when we are doing something which is right, we are apt to overdo it,
   and so we stray into a vice while pursuing a virtue! You can run so
   close to the heels of a virtue that they may knock out your teeth--you
   may be so ardent for one good thing that you may miss another--"I held
   my peace, even from good."

   2. And my sorrow was stirred. Not giving it vent, it boiled and
   seethed. "My sorrow was stirred." Sometimes a little talk is a great
   easement to a troubled spirit, but, as David was dumb, his sorrow was
   not still.

   3. My heart was hot within me, while I was musing, the fire burned.
   There was an inward friction, his griefs kept revolving till his heart
   grew hot. This heat generated fire which burned so vehemently that, at
   last, the Psalmist could not help himself, and he was obliged to speak.

   3. Then spoke I with my tongue. Whether rightly or wrongly, he must say
   something! He could not hold himself in any longer--"Then spoke I with
   my tongue."

   4. LORD. If you must speak, address your words to the Lord! So David
   does. He does not speak to the wicked, but he prays to God most holy.

   4. Make me to know my end. Did he wish to die? Perhaps so. You remember
   that one of the two men who never died once prayed that he might die.
   Elijah did so. And David does so, here, I think, if I put a hard
   construction on his speech--"Lord, make me to know my end." But if I
   read it more tenderly, I may make it to mean, "Lord, help me to
   recollect that my sorrows will not last forever!" That thought will
   tone them down and keep them in check--"Make me to know my end."

   4-5. And the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail
   I am. Behold, You have made my days as an handbreadth. That is, the
   breadth of your four fingers--all the length of life is to be measured
   by a span.

   5. And my age is as nothing before You. All that exists is as nothing
   before God. What are even the elder-born of angels but the infants of
   an hour in contrast with the ages of eternity? The world, itself, is
   only like a bubble blown yesterday! The sun is as a spark struck from
   the anvil of Omnipotence but a few days ago! And as for man, compared
   with the eternal God, he is "as nothing."

   5. Verily, every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah. Or,
   as the Hebrew has it, every Adam is all Abel. Was not Abel the child of
   Adam, and was he not soon cut off? Every man, even at his best state,
   is altogether vanity! What poor creatures we are! Our breath is not
   more airy than we, ourselves, are! Our lives are but as a mist that is
   blown away

   by the wind. "Selah." When the Psalmist had come so far, he stopped a
   while, to tighten up the strings of his harp--such pressure as he had
   given it had taken away its melodious tones and it needed to be
   brought, again, up to concert pitch.

   6. Surely every man walks in a vain show. Like players, or actors, all
   of us are walking in a phantom show which is not really anything, but
   only seems to be.

   6. Surely they are disquieted in vain. They make a dreadful noise in
   the tumult of the battle, the din of the exchange, the hum of the
   streets, the fret and worry of the counting house, but it is all in
   vain.

   6. He heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them. If a man
   does succeed in amassing wealth, it is a poor success. The muckrake
   gathers and then comes the fork that scatters. One man hoards it up and
   another takes as much delight in squandering it! They think that they
   have entailed their estate and that their name and house will continue
   as long as the sun, but it all comes to nothing. "Vanity of vanities,"
   said the son of David, "all is vanity," and his father had said so
   before him!

   7. And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in You. There is no
   vanity in that declaration! Now we are on the Rock, now we have come to
   something real. When a man trusts in the unchanging God and hopes in
   the ever-blessed Savior, he has come out of his state of vanity--"My
   hope is in You."

   8. Deliver me from all my transgressions. We had not expected David to
   offer that prayer. We might have thought that he would say, "Deliver me
   from all my troubles and from my many vexing thoughts." But no, he lays
   the axe at the root of the evil--"Deliver me from all my
   transgressions." There is only One who can do that, even the glorious
   Son of God, who lived and died to save His people from their sins!

   8. Make me not the reproach of the foolish. "The wicked will be ready
   enough to catch me up and pour scorn upon me. Lord, keep me so right
   with You and so near to Yourself that they may never be able to
   reproach me!"

   9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because You did it. This verse
   should read, "I will be dumb, I will not open my mouth because You have
   done it." That is a better silence than the first, for the Psalmist is
   getting into a right state. This is the proper silence--the other was
   brazen--this is golden! God help us to know how and when to practice
   it! Never speak against God whatever He does--open not your mouth when
   He chastens because whatever He does must be right!

   10. Remove Your stroke away from me. Having come to complete
   submission, he ventures to pray for deliverance from his sorrow. You
   may pray very boldly and very freely when you can truly say, "Your will
   be done." David had said that he would not open his mouth against his
   God--and now he begins to plead, "Remove Your stroke away from me."

   10. I am consumed by the blow of Your hand. When God strikes it is no
   playing matter--a blow of His hand consumes us!

   11. When You with rebukes correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty
   to consume away like a moth. As a moth eats up the fur or the cloth and
   spoils it, so, when God's corrections come upon us, our beauty is soon
   gone. Poor beauty it must be that can so soon go! Lord, let Your beauty
   be upon us, for no moth can ever eat into that!

   11. Surely every man is vanity. Selah. In the fifth verse, you see that
   when the Psalmist reached that point, he stopped, and said, "Selah,"
   and he does so, again, here. Striking his music with a heavy hand--he
   has put it out of tune, again, so he pauses and begins to tighten the
   strings up once more. You and I often need to be tightened up like the
   strings of a harp, to put us in right order before we go on to praise
   or to pray.

   12. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry. See how David's
   "prayer" grows into a "cry"? It deepens in intensity--there is more
   power in a cry than in an ordinary prayer--it shows more earnestness
   and implies greater urgency! "Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto
   my cry."

   12. Hold not Your peace at my tears. That is a still more powerful mode
   of pleading. Tears are the irresistible weapons of weakness. Women,
   children, beggars and sinners can all conquer by tears--when they can
   win by nothing else! If they will take to these pearly drops and
   especially if they can look through them to the crimson drops of a
   Savior's blood, they can win what they will of God--"Hold not Your
   peace at my tears."

   12. For I am a stranger with You. The Believer is a stranger in this
   world, just as God is! The Lord made the world, but the world does not
   know its Maker and it does not know His people--

   "'Tis no surprising thing,

   That we should be unknown!

   The Jewish world knew not their King,

   God's everlasting Son."

   "I am a stranger," not to You, but, "with You, a stranger even as You
   are." There is another very beautiful meaning to this expression. You
   know how the Orientals exercise hospitality to strangers? When they
   once take them into their tent, they supply them liberally and treat
   them honorably. "I am a stranger with You." I am a poor alien who has
   come into God's House, to tarry for a while with Him, I have eaten of
   His salt, I have cast myself upon His protection, so He will certainly
   take care of me--"I am a stranger with You."

   12. And a sojourner, as all my fathers were. "They did not remain here.
   My fathers used this world merely as an inn, at which they stayed for a
   night. In the morning, they hurried on to the City that has
   foundations, on the other side of Jordan--

   "To the islands of the Blessed, To the land of the Hereafter," where
   the saints dwell forever with their Lord!

   13. O spare me--"Deal gently with me! Do not break me in pieces! If You
   must smite me, yet do not altogether crush me. O spare me"--

   13. That I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
   "Let me be able to take a little nourishment and to gather my faculties
   together, yet again, that I may sing to You some sweeter hymn before I
   cease to be in the land of the living, and go out of this world." So,
   you see, this is a sweet Psalm, after all! It is a bitter sweet--a
   sweet bitter--a Psalm that tends towards our spiritual health. Many of
   us understand what David meant by it. May others, who as yet do not,
   soon be taught its gracious lessons! Amen.

A Royal Funeral

   (No. 2390)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 9, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 7, 1888.

   "And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but
   secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away
   the body of Jesus: and Pilate ga ve him leave. He came, therefore, and
   took the body of Jesus. And there came, also, Nicodemus, which at the
   first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
   about an hundred pounds weight. Then took they the body of Jesus and
   wound it in linen strips with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is
   to bury. Nowin theplace where He was crucified there was a garden; and
   in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid. There
   laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews'preparation day; for
   the sepulcher was near at hand." John 19:38-42.

   LET US go to this grave, but not to weep there--no, not to shed so much
   as a single tear! The stone is rolled away, our Lord's precious body is
   not there, for Christ has risen from the dead! It may be that, like
   Mary at the sepulcher, we shall see a vision of angels, but if not, we
   may behold a company of comforting Truths of God which still linger
   about the empty tomb of our ascended Lord!

   We are expressly told, in Holy Scripture, that our Lord was buried. It
   was evidently not sufficient for us merely to be told that He died--we
   must also know that He was buried. Why was this? Was it not, first,
   that we might have a certificate of His death? We do not bury living
   men and the Lord Jesus would not have been buried if the Centurion had
   not certified that He was certainly dead. The Roman officer had
   probably seen Christ's heart pierced by the soldier's spear, when blood
   and water flowed forth from His side. At any rate, when his men went to
   execute the coup de grace, which finished the lives of the other two,
   by the breaking of their legs, they were so certain that He who hung in
   the middle was really dead that they broke not His legs. Christ's being
   given up for burial was Pilate's certificate that He had not merely
   pretended to die, but that it was a real death and that His body had no
   life remaining in it. This is an essential point, for if Jesus did not
   die, He has made no Atonement for sin. If He died not, then He rose
   not--and if He rose not, then your faith is vain, you are yet in your
   sins! The sepulcher, therefore, occupies a very important place in the
   story of the death of Jesus.

   Again, was He not buried to fulfill a type which He had, Himself,
   chosen? Like as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of
   the fish, in the heart of the sea, even so was the Son of Man to lie
   for that time in the heart of the earth. The casting of the runaway
   Prophet into the sea quieted the angry waves--the tempest fell asleep
   when he was given up as a victim--and Christ's being cast into the sea
   of death has quieted the storm of almighty wrath! We sail, today, as on
   a sea of glass because Christ was buried in those awful billows. He
   must fulfill the type of Jonah, or else He spoke not aright concerning
   Himself when He said, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a
   sign and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the
   Prophet Jonah."

   Further, was not our Lord buried to make His battle with death and His
   triumph over it more complete? He has conquered death, but He has also
   burst open the castle of death, that is the grave. He has bearded the
   lion in his den, the Douglas in his hall. In this matchless duel, He
   has set Himself to fight not only with death, but with death and the
   grave combined--and hence the paean of victory is not merely, "O death,
   where is your sting?" but it is also, "O grave, where is your victory?"
   Christ's victory is altogether complete. He has led captivity captive,
   because He became a captive. He has vanquished all death's allies, as
   well as death, itself, by going down into the grave and rending its
   bars asunder.

   Beside all this, did not our Lord die and condescend to be buried, to
   sweeten the grave for His people? Rightly did we sing just now
   concerning the tomb--

   "There the dear flesh of Jesus lay, And left a long perfume."

   Unless the Lord should speedily come, as He may--God grant that He
   may!--we shall fall asleep and these bodies of ours will be committed
   to the silence of the grave. We must not dare to dread the
   sepulcher--where Christ has been, we may safely and honorably go. As I
   told you, the other day, He left the fine linen to be the furniture of
   our last bed. He left the napkin rolled up by itself, that weeping
   friends might dry their tears thereon. He also left the myrrh and
   aloes, about one hundred pounds' weight, which Nicodemus brought. I
   never heard that they were taken away from the tomb--Jesus left them
   there and they still shed their sweet fragrance throughout the graves
   of all His saints! We are not going to a noisome vault, but to a
   perfumed chamber hung with the fine linen sheets that encompassed the
   Christ, and odorous with the spices that shed their sweetness upon Him!
   To die is now our gain--to sleep in Jesus is to be blest, indeed!

   I may add, also, that I think our Lord was buried so that, from His
   tomb, He might leap to His Throne. He goes to the lowest depths that
   from there He may rise to the loftiest heights! You, too, Believer, may
   go as low as the grave, but you can never go any lower--and when you
   are at your lowest, you are then on your way to your highest! Your Lord
   stooped to conquer, so must you. You will have won the victory over
   death when you lie, stark and cold, upon your last bed. The adversary
   may think that he has defeated you--

   "When silent is your pleading tongue And blind that piercing eye,"

   and inactive that once diligent hand, but it is not so--you shall then
   have broken loose from everything that hinders you from entering upon
   your highest service for your Lord--and you shall have entered that
   Holy Place where you shall see His face and serve Him day and night in
   His glorious Temple!

   I like to think of Jesus as going down into the lowest parts of the
   earth when I remember that He that descended is the same who also
   ascended. This should encourage us to feel that, sink as we may, lower
   and yet still lower, we shall rise all the higher because of that
   sinking--and shall enter still more completely into fellowship with
   Christ both in His sufferings and in His Glory! It was necessary, then,
   my Brothers and Sisters, that there should be a new tomb in the garden
   close by Golgotha and that our Lord should lie there. It is a very
   wonderful thing that He, whose face is the light of Heaven, whose hands
   are sceptered with the government of the universe and whose very feet
   are sandaled with the stars, should yet bear the image of death upon
   His pale Countenance and should lie there lifeless, to be handled by
   others, and to be wrapped as any other dead man might be, in fine linen
   and sweet spices.

   But my subject at this time is concerning the wonderful working of God
   with regard to the burial of Jesus. The Providence of God began with
   the body of Christ from the very first, even from His Conception, and
   it followed Him right to the last, even to His burial. You see the Holy
   Child in the manger and you notice how all things round about minister
   strangely to Him. Throughout His life all things worked together for
   His good--not to screen Him from suffering, but to cause Him to
   suffer--and to make Him triumphant through those sufferings! And when
   He came to die, I see the finger of God displayed at every part of that
   dread tragedy. But now that He is dead, will that kind Providence
   forsake Him? Ah, no!

   I want to stop here and say to you who anxiously ask, "What will become
   of me when I die? I am so very poor and needy"--never think about that
   matter--you have enough to do to trust God till you die! As to what is
   to become of your body when you are dead, never fret about that! It is
   wonderful how God takes care of the very dust and ashes of His chosen,
   how, sometimes, they receive in death respect and honor which they
   never thought would have come to them, and after they have passed away,
   their children and their household are blessed of God for their sake.
   The God of the living forsakes not His saints in dying, or after death!
   As Ruth would cleave to Naomi and said, "Where you die, I will die, and
   there will I be buried," so, with greater faithfulness, does God cleave
   to His people! He will see them buried and take care of their children
   after they are gone. This is His comforting promise, "Leave your
   fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows
   trust in Me."

   Now let me remind you how God took care of the First-Born among many
   brethren. Jesus is dead and in the hands of wicked men. The
   executioners have Him in their charge, those same executioners who just
   now broke the legs of the two thieves, have hold of Christ! But that
   precious body must be preserved, not a bone of Him must be broken, no
   disrespect

   must be paid to that Immaculate Being. Death and Hell would have
   reveled in insulting Christ's body if they could. As Achilles dragged
   Hector by the heels round the walls of Troy, so would Satan have liked
   that men should have mauled the dead body of Christ. He would have cast
   Him to the dogs or to the vultures if he could have had his way, but so
   it must not be! Many a man who has been a prince has been buried with
   the burial of an ass, but this great Savior, whom men despised, must
   have a royal funeral! How is He to have it? That is the point I wish to
   bring to your notice and, before I have finished my discourse, I hope I
   shall be able to prove to you that everything required for Christ's
   burial was supplied.

   I. The first requisite was SOMEONE TO OBTAIN THE BODY.

   The law has executed Jesus, though wrongfully, and His body, therefore,
   belongs to the executioner, or, at any rate, to the law. Who is to
   rescue that precious body from the clutches of the law? Ah, you may
   look your eyes out, but you cannot see the man who can accomplish this
   task--yet God knows where He is! There is one Joseph, who has an estate
   at Arimathea, a wealthy man, a member of the Sanhedrim, "an honorable
   counselor." He appears upon the scene and he is the right man to do
   what is required, for he is a secret disciple. He has great respect for
   that dead body, for he had great regard for Jesus while He was alive.
   As we look Joseph up and down, we say, "Yes, if he will do his best, he
   is the very man for this emergency." He is under great arrears of
   obligation to his Lord, whom he scarcely acknowledged in His
   lifetime--yet he is a real disciple. Joseph, if you can do anything in
   this matter, we give you this solemn charge--go and get the body of
   Christ.

   He was, besides, an official and influential. Therefore he could gain
   an entrance where a private person could not. And, what was still more
   to the point with such a man as Pilate, he was a rich man, for in those
   days, in the courts, everything went by favor. The poor man's cause
   might be just, yet he could not secure a hearing. But the gold in a
   rich man's hand would speak more loudly than the most convincing
   arguments upon a poor man's tongue. So this secret disciple is the one
   to beg the body of Jesus because he is an honorable counselor and also
   because he is rich. If he is willing to undertake the task, he is the
   man to accomplish it.

   But my heart misgives me, for Joseph has been secretly a disciple and,
   therefore, I conclude that he must be very timid. During the last two
   years or so, he has really been a follower of Christ, and yet he has
   stayed in the council. He has been a member of the Sanhedrim, yet he
   has not spoken out against its evil deeds! Ah, me, I am afraid that he
   will not be able to go and speak to Pilate. But note, Brothers and
   Sisters, what Mark tells us about him--"Joseph of Arimathea went in
   boldly unto Pilate and craved the body of Jesus." God can make a coward
   bold as a lion in the day when He needs him! And this good man, full of
   honor and abounding in wealth, said, "I will go to Pilate." Why, this
   cruel vacillating governor will put a man to death if he aggravates
   him! Who knows how this interview may end?

   But Joseph says, "I will go to Pilate." He obtains admittance and he
   asks for the body of Jesus. Pilate exclaims, "Why, He is not dead yet!"
   "Yes, He is," answers Joseph, "I have seen Him die." When the Centurion
   comes, he certifies that He is dead. Pilate cannot imagine what Joseph
   can want with a dead man's bones, but he says, "You may have His body.
   Take Him down, you may have Him." So Joseph comes back to the Cross. He
   has proven that he was the very man for this work. We would never have
   thought of him, but God had him in reserve for the hour of need and
   brought him to the front at the right moment!

   Now you see Joseph hurrying away from Pilate's Hall to the hill of
   Calvary, where the crosses are still standing. He has, in his hand, the
   order signed by the governor. He shows it to the officer in charge and
   he is a man of such prominence, so well known as an honorable
   counselor, an official gentleman and a person of wealth, that everybody
   is ready to help him. He, himself, is probably first and foremost in
   raising the ladder, helping to pull out the great nails, and to let
   down the blessed body. He is the man for this work, for he is
   objectionable to nobody. He has been a counselor, so that those on the
   side of the Sanhedrim do not object to him. The holy women stand
   watching him, but they have no fears as to his action--they know him,
   for he has probably done them many a kindness privately in days gone
   by--and they know that he has been a secret disciple of the Lord. He
   has brought with him fine white linen which he was well able to buy. He
   reverently takes the body of Jesus down from the Cross and tenderly
   wraps it round with the costly winding-sheets which he has
   purchased--and so this trying business is finished without interference
   from anyone.

   I hope that these details do not seem trivial to you, for nothing is
   trivial that concerns our Lord and His cause. In the Tabernacle and the
   Temple, even the nails had to be duly prepared, and I think that, in
   this matter of providing a suit-

   able person to go and get the body of Jesus out of the hand of the
   legal custodian, we ought to admire the wonderful goodness of God!
   Depend upon it, if, at any other time, there should be some great and
   terrible task to be accomplished, God will find the man to do it! If
   one shall be needed, by-and-by, at peril of his life to bear witness
   for Christ, the right person will be found! And until this chapter of
   Divine Providence shall come to an end in our Lord's eternal Glory,
   there shall never be a crisis, however crucial, but the man shall be
   found whom God wants, or the woman who is to occupy the place which the
   Lord has for her to fill!

   Thus, Joseph has obtained the body of Jesus from the hands of Pilate
   and he may do what he will with it--that is the first point.

   II. The next requisite is SOMEONE TO BURY THE BODY.

   We do not want one man to carry away that body and lay it in the grave,
   for such a person as Jesus should have an honorable funeral. Now see
   what happens! There is another man, also a counselor, "a ruler of the
   Jews," "a master of Israel," yet another secret disciple who had come
   to Jesus by night--he appears at just this very moment! "There came,
   also, Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night." Now we
   have two mourners for our Master's funeral. James and John--where are
   you? They cannot hear my question! Peter and Bartholomew, where are
   you? They are too far away--they cannot hear me. Who will follow the
   body of Jesus to the grave? Who will be chief mourner? There are some
   gracious women, brave enough to stand afar off, and willing enough, if
   beckoned, to come and join the sad cortege that attends the corpse to
   the tomb. But how honorable to Christ was it that the first two and the
   chief mourners on that sorrowful occasion should be two members of the
   Sanhedrim--Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus--two men of note, two
   reputable individuals who were held in honor even among the Jews who
   crucified Christ!

   First, let me say of these two men who attended the burial of our Lord,
   that they did Him honor. Thus was fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy, "He made
   His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; because He
   had done no violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth." All the
   while until Christ had paid the dreadful price of our redemption, He
   was despised and rejected of men, but as soon as He could say, "It is
   finished," and the debt was fully paid, He must not be despised and
   rejected any more! Now, rich men must come and do Him homage and,
   accordingly, Joseph and Nicodemus came. It may seem only a little
   thing, but it indicates the turn of the tide, just as the floating of a
   straw may do. Jesus is no longer derided, nor even attended only by the
   poorest and most obscure of Galileans, but Joseph from Arimathea, and
   Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, attend the funeral of the great Lord
   and Savior of men--and so pay such honor as they can to His dead body!

   While they thus did Him honor, they received from Him much more honor.
   Ah, my Brothers and Sisters, it was a great privilege that was accorded
   to these two men! I stand and wonder how it was that this position was
   allotted to two who had kept so long behind the scenes. They had
   lost--they had lost--I cannot tell you how much they had lost, two,
   perhaps three years of constant fellowship with Christ and of
   instruction from His own dear lips! They had lost incalculably! They
   were in the rear of all Christ's disciples--Mary Magdalene was in front
   of them, the woman that was a sinner was far ahead of them--they were
   right in the rear rank. Yet their Master, in the splendor of His Grace,
   gives them this privilege even while He, Himself, lies dead! To them is
   accorded the high honor of handling His blessed flesh and laying Him in
   the tomb.

   I am afraid that some of you secret Christians who never come out
   boldly for Christ will not have such an honor as this. If the Lord ever
   uses you at all, it will be in some sad business such as a funeral--but
   even that will be an honor to you, if you are permitted to attend Him
   in His death though you have not shared the glory of His life. You
   lose--oh, you lose incalculable gifts by not acknowledging your
   discipleship! Yet I pray that there may come a time and that it may
   come at once, when even you will come out and do what you can for your
   Lord, saying to yourself, "Now is the hour when even I, timid as I am,
   must acknowledge Him." When soul murder is in your streets, when heresy
   is in your pulpits, when apostasy is in your churches, you are
   unfaithful to the last grain of your spiritual manhood if you who love
   Christ do not come out boldly on His side and declare that you belong
   to Him! If you never have confessed Him before men and you neglect this
   opportunity, wherein there is the greatest and most urgent of need, I
   fear that you will never acknowledge Him at all.

   Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were both needed for this sad task
   and though we should never have thought of inviting them to perform it,
   yet they were the only two men connected with Christ who were exactly
   fitted for the office.

   And, as I have said, they thus honored Christ and He thus honored them.
   I should also say, Brothers and Sisters, that among all the disciples,
   there were no more sincere mourners for Christ then these two men. I
   think that I hear Joseph fetch a deep sigh and say, "Ah, Nicodemus, how
   wicked I have been, for I have not been with Christ as I ought to have
   been! I ought to have gone with Him to prison and to death. Instead of
   that, I have been among the ungodly, rich and honored." "Ah," says
   Nicodemus, "and I went to Him by night and He talked so sweetly to me,
   but I have been hiding away ever since. I feel ashamed to touch this
   blessed blood-stained hand. I realize that it is a high honor to be
   allowed to handle these dear feet and to wrap the linen all about them,
   but I do not deserve such an honor, I am sure." And they would stop and
   weep, and sigh again, to think of how they had ill-treated their Lord,
   by what they may have thought was modesty, but which conscience now
   tells them was nothing else than shameful cowardice!

   And I do not think that out of all Christ's followers, there were any
   who would be more tender with that blessed body, for they were
   gentlemen. They were not countrymen or fishermen, used to handling and
   being handled roughly--they were of a more tender mold, and when they
   looked on that dear form, how gently would they treat it! Being also
   men of property, they would have many servants able to help them in all
   sorts of ways. In His wonderful interment, our Lord Jesus could not
   have been better attended, nor have been buried by men who would have
   performed the mournful duty with more solemn feelings, more hushed
   reverence. They loved Him, yet felt that they had acted in an unloving
   manner towards Him and, now, they also felt that the best they could
   possibly do was all too little for the Blessed One who had sealed the
   forgiveness of their cowardice by permitting Himself to be entrusted to
   their hands.

   I can see great love about this dead Christ, and great pity, and great
   kindness, that even His lifeless body would be giving life to the faith
   and hope of Joseph and Nicodemus and should be firing them with fresh
   ardor! While they looked upon His corpse, they must have been compelled
   to resolve that never more would they be ashamed of Him whom they had
   helped to lay in the grave.

   So far we have, in imagination, brought our Lord Jesus Christ into the
   hands of two most suitable persons to bury

   Him.

   III. The next requisite is THE MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE BURIAL.

   The manner of the Jews is to bury the body wrapped in strips of fine
   white linen--where is that? I do not believe that Peter has a yard of
   it anywhere. I hardly think that James and John have anything much
   finer than fishermen's coats and so forth. Fine linen--let it be the
   best that can be bought! Let it be white as snow for wrapping around
   this perfect body! But where is it to be obtained? Joseph has it! He is
   a man of wealth, who can get anything that is needed, and he has
   brought with him the best winding sheets in which to wrap the Savior's
   body.

   But we must also have mixed spices in abundance, fifty pounds' weight
   at the least. "Oh," says Nicodemus, "I have brought one hundred pounds'
   weight with me, and if I could have found a conveyance, and more spices
   had not been superfluous, I would have brought many hundred pounds
   weight of myrrh and aloes, well mingled according to the art of
   apothecary, with which to surround that blessed form."

   See, my Brothers, Christ needed for nothing when He was dead--do you
   think that He will need anything while He is alive? "Ah, but our little
   Church, our poor cause, is needing money badly and we are going to get
   up a bazaar." What? And you have not thought about going to your Lord
   for what you lack? The fact is, the Church of God has been looking to
   the devil to find funds for the Lord's work instead of seeking aid from
   the Lord, Himself! It is a pity that we cannot come back to Him who,
   even when He was dead, had a hundred pounds' weight of myrrh and aloes
   brought to Him! Cannot we trust Him for all that is required for His
   service? It will be a better and a brighter day for the Church when she
   believes that if Christ needs myrrh and aloes, He can get them! Does
   not the Lord say, "The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine...Every
   beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills...If
   I were hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is Mine, and the
   fullness thereof"? Let us go forth to fight the Lord's battles without
   any doubts concerning the commissariat of His army! He can provide and
   He will provide--only let us trust Him and not go down to Egypt for
   help, nor lean upon an arm of flesh.

   As Nicodemus gave so freely to the dead Christ, how generously ought
   you and I to give to our living Lord! If we have anything in the world,
   let us give it all to Christ. Even if we have nothing left but a grave,
   which we have provided for our own funeral, yet let us surrender that,
   as Joseph did when he gave up his new tomb that his Lord and Master
   might lie therein.

   Thus, you see, that all that is needed for Christ's burial is there
   already! So I leave that part of our subject and go on to the next.

   IV. Another requisite is A PLACE WHEREIN TO BURY THE BODY. We have the
   body, Pilate has given us that. We have the spices and the fine linen
   and we have the two men ready to bury the body. Now we need a tomb.

   It would be very convenient and also very important, if we could get a
   sepulcher near at hand because, you see, if the body of Christ had to
   be carried a long way to be buried, the Jews would say, "Ah, they
   switched it on the road! They took it a mile or two out of the city and
   the Christ who rose from the dead is not the Christ that was buried."
   But here, just at the bottom of this rocky hill which is called
   Golgotha, there is a garden, and in that garden there is a tomb. Hark
   the Providence of God in this matter, for that tomb belongs to Joseph,
   and there the Savior's body is lovingly laid! He did not and He could
   not lack a tomb when it was required! When the time came for Him to be
   buried, the sepulcher was there already prepared, hewn out of the rock!

   It would also be a great advantage if it could be a new tomb, wherein
   never was anybody buried, for if they buried Him in an old tomb, the
   Jews would say that He had touched the bones of some Prophet or other
   holy man and so came to life. Ah, well, Joseph's is a new tomb--there
   are no bones there, for nobody has ever been buried there before!

   It would seem, too, to be the proper thing for our Lord to have a tomb
   in a rock. You cannot fitly put Him in sand who is, Himself, the Rock
   of Ages. No, let our Lord Jesus, with that grand Immutable Love and
   eternal faithfulness of His, let Him lie in the solid rock! There it
   is, all ready for Him, just the very kind of tomb that is needed for
   Him who is the Rock of our salvation!

   If it should also be a tomb in a garden, there would be a touch of
   familiar beauty about that arrangement. One likes that the very
   surroundings of Christ's grave should be instructive. I cannot stop to
   tell you about all the beauty and the instruction which cluster around
   a garden--the gardens of Scripture, especially, are most fruitful
   subjects, and our Lord's garden-tomb might suggest to us a most
   profitable theme for meditation.

   Thus, Christ's tomb is the very thing we would wish for Him. In no
   secondhand grave, in no town ditch, in no pauper's grave dug out of the
   earth, but in a rich man's sepulcher, worthy of a king--it is there
   that the Christ must lie! See how God provides for His Son and learn
   how He will provide for you. If He provides for His Son when dead, He
   will provide for you while living--therefore be comforted whatever your
   condition may be!

   V. There is one more difficulty and, perhaps, it is the worst of all,
   for it concerns THE TIME FOR THE BURIAL. You see, it is very late in
   the afternoon and, besides, it is the "preparation" for a very
   important Sabbath, and these good people cannot do any work on the
   Sabbath--their consciences will not permit them to do so, for they are
   strict Jews. But it so happened that they obtained the body just in
   time to wrap it round about with the spices and with the linen, and
   then we are told, "There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the
   Jews' preparation day; for the sepulcher was near at hand." To me, it
   is a very pretty thought that when there was so little time, the place
   of burial was so near. It would have taken all the lingering twilight
   to have carried Jesus far, but the right place was near! Providence
   knew all about the difficulty and provided for it!

   Next, they could not take much time with the body and the ceremony was
   the more fitting for Christ's rising. Beloved, whenever you cannot do
   anything for your Lord as you would like to do, do the best you can and
   you may depend upon it, that you have done just what ought to be done!
   "Oh, no!" they say, "Oh, no! We would have liked to have wrapped Him up
   much more leisurely and more delicately--we would have made a finished
   work of embalming that precious body." Listen! Nothing more was needed.
   Jesus was not going to be in the sepulcher long. God's Holy One could
   not see corruption! He did not need to be embalmed, for He was to be up
   again so soon and, therefore, a hurried burial was quite sufficient.

   Listen again--there is another thing worth mentioning. The
   incompleteness brought them early to the sepulcher. If they do not
   finish their task of love on the evening of the Crucifixion, they will
   be there early in the morning, when the Sabbath is over, to complete
   it! That was precisely what was needed, that, as soon as the Master was
   risen, on that first day of the week, they should be there to see
   Him--but they would not have been there to see Him, perhaps, if they
   had not come, as the holy women did, with more spices to finish the
   work which had been, comparatively speaking, so roughly and hurriedly
   done on that dread evening!

   It was all right and I drew much comfort and joy out of this fact when
   I was thinking it over. I said to myself, "Sometimes I am so oppressed
   with the care of the many things entrusted to me that I cannot study my
   sermon as I would like." Perhaps it is all the better for that--the
   Master does not need studied sermons. It may also be that it suits the
   hearer all the better. If you cannot bury Christ as you would like to
   because there is not time, when you have done the best that you could,
   and sorrowed over it, you have done the very thing that your Lord wants
   you to do! Rest content with that and just say to yourself, "He takes
   the will for the deed, and all my blundering and mistakes He overlooks
   because I did it all out of love for His dear name."

   I have talked thus to you about Christ's dead body. Oh, that I had an
   opportunity of speaking to you about Him as the living Lord! But as I
   cannot, for our time is gone, I would ask you to just stoop down and,
   in faith and love, kiss those wounds, admire that pierced hand, that
   other hand, that nailed foot, that other foot, that side with the spear
   gash, that dear face with closed eyes and then say, "He bore all this
   for me--what have I done for Him? "God bless you! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Mark15:34-47; John19:38-42; 1 Corinthians
   15:1-9.

   Concerning the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall read in three
   portions of the New Testament. First, in the Gospel according to Mark,
   the 15th chapter, beginning at the 34th verse.

   Mark 15:34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
   saying, Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
   God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? It is, "My El, My strong God, My
   mighty One, why have You forsaken Me?"--the most bitter words that were
   ever uttered by mortal lips--and expressing the quintessence of agony.
   Alas, that my Savior should ever have had to say as much as this when
   He hung upon the Cross, suffering and dying for me!

   35. And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold,
   He calls Elijah. Did they misunderstand His bitter cry of woe? Could
   they mistake what He meant? Was it not, on the part of these people
   that stood by, a willful wicked witticism upon what our Lord Jesus had
   said? We fear that it was so.

   36, 37. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on
   a reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let Him alone; let us see
   whether Elijah will come to take Him down. And Jesus cried with a loud
   voice, and gave up the ghost. His last words were, "It is finished."--

   "It is finished!"--Oh what pleasure Do these charming words afford!
   Heavenly blessings without measure Flow to us from Christ the Lord--
   'It is finished!'

   Saints, the dying words record."

   38, 39. And the veil of the Temple was rent in two from the top to the
   bottom. And when the Centurion, who stood over against Him. The officer
   who had charge of the arrangements for the execution--"when the
   Centurion, who stood over against Him"--

   39, Saw that He so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly
   this Man was the Son of God. Probably saying a great deal more than he
   understood! There was something so extraordinary about this central
   Sufferer that the Centurion could not understand who He could be unless
   He was truly, "the Son of God."

   40, 41. There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
   Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses and
   Salome; (Who also, when He was in Galilee, followed Him, and ministered
   unto Him), and many other women which came up with Him unto Jerusalem.
   Where was Peter? We know that John was near the Cross, but James and
   the rest of the Apostles were apparently hiding away. But the holy
   women were there!

   42,43. And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
   that is the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable
   counselor, which also waited for the Kingdom of God, came, and went in
   boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. I have no doubt that
   Pilate was very surprised that a member of the Sanhedrim should come
   and ask for the body of Jesus, when, a little while before, he had put
   Him to death, really, by the mandate of that body of men!

   44, 45. And Pilate marveled if He were already dead: and calling unto
   him the Centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while dead. And
   when he knew it of the Centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. This very
   Centurion who had declared that Jesus was the Son of God now came
   forward to bear witness that he had seen Him die. And then Pilate told
   Joseph that he might go and take the body.

   46. And he bought fine linen. This was probably the first time that
   fine linen had touched the flesh of the Son of Man--He had been
   accustomed to much coarser stuff in His lifetime--but now Joseph
   "bought fine linen."

   46, 47. And took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him
   in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone into
   the door of the sepulcher. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
   Joses beheld where He was laid. That is Mark's account of our Lord's
   death and burial, very terse and very suggestive. Let us now read
   John's description of the sad scene.

   John 19:38-40. And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of
   Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might
   take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came,
   therefore, and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus,
   which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of
   myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then took they the body
   of Jesus. Oh, how tenderly and with how many tears, did they take their
   Lord's body from the Cross!

   40-42. And wound it in linen strips with the spices, as the manner of
   the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was
   a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet
   laid. There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews'
   preparation day; for the sepulcher was near at hand. John's Gospel
   contains some particulars not mentioned by Mark. And the same may be
   said of Matthew's account and Luke's. Read them all when you are home
   and ponder the wonderful story! The Apostle Paul, speaking of our
   Lord's Resurrection, mentions His burial. We will now read in his first
   Epistle to the Corinthians, just a few verses from the 15th chapter.

   1 Corinthians 15:1. Moreover, brethren I declare unto you the
   Gospel--Mark that Paul writes concerning "the Gospel." We shall see now
   what, "the Gospel" is.

   1-3. Which I preached unto you, which also you have received, and
   wherein you stand, by which also you are saved, if you keep in memory
   what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. For I
   delivered unto you, first of all, that which I also received, how that
   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures. That is the
   central Truth of the Gospel.

   4. And that He was buried. That is an essential part of the Gospel.

   4. And that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.
   This is the bright light of the Gospel, the Resurrection of our Lord
   from the dead--

   5-9. And that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, He
   was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater
   part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that,
   He was seen of James; then of all the Apostles. And last of all He was
   seen of me, also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the least of
   the Apostles, that am not meet to be called an Apostle, because I
   persecuted the Church of God. Yet He was one among the many testifiers
   to the fact that Jesus really died, was buried and rose from the dead,
   of which we will speak more particularly, by-and-by.

The Keeper of the Vineyard

   (No. 2391)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 16, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   5, 1863.

   "I the LORD keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I
   will keep it night and day." Isaiah 27:3.

   MY discourse this evening can hardly be called a sermon. It will be
   just a simple talk about a few experimental Truths of God, but I trust
   that it will be useful to some of the Lord's people.

   The text follows a terrible verse in which the Lord's enemies are
   threatened with "His sore and great and strong sword." But even when
   God has the most anger against His adversaries, He is still full of
   love for His people. The Church of God is here compared to a vineyard.
   The vine is a tender plant, needing continual care, and if the vineyard
   is not well fenced and guarded, the enemies of the vine are sure to get
   in and destroy it. The Church is called "a vineyard of red wine,"
   because the red grape happened to be the best kind grown in Palestine
   and, in like manner, God's Church is, to Him, the best of the best, the
   excellent of the earth, in whom is all His delight! But what is true of
   the whole Church is also true of every member--the same God who keeps
   the vineyard also protects every vine, no, not only so, but His care
   extends to every little branch, to every spreading leaf and to every
   clinging tendril of that vine which He undertakes to keep night and
   day. Well did Toplady sing--

   "Upon my leaf, when parched with heat,

   Refreshing de w shall drop.

   The plant which Your right hand has set,

   Shall never be rooted up.

   Each moment watered by Your care,

   And fenced with power Divine,

   Fruit to eternal life shall bear

   The feeblest branch of Thine." Our text mentions two much-needed
   mercies and upon each of these I will speak briefly. We find in the
   text, first, continual keeping. And then, secondly, continual watering.
   In these gracious Words of the Lord, we have a promise that we shall be
   kept from foes without and from foes within. God is both a wall and a
   well to His people--a wall to guard them from their adversaries--and a
   well to supply all their needs out of His ever living, over-flowing
   fullness.

   I. First, then, concerning the CONTINUAL KEEPING which the Lord
   promises to His vineyard--"I, the Lord, keep it...lest any hurt it, I
   will keep it night and day." I will talk of that keeping in an
   experimental way, putting the subject before you in the form of
   questions which may be applied either to the Church as a whole, or to
   each individual Believer.

   The first will be, "Do I need keeping? I trust I have been called by
   God's Grace, that I have been washed in Jesus' blood and that I have
   been made one of the Lord's children--do I need keeping?" Ah, if I know
   anything of myself, I shall be compelled to answer that I do, for my
   foes are innumerable and I, like the vine, am subject to all sorts of
   perils and dangers! Brothers and Sisters there is the arch-enemy--how
   he longs to lay the axe to the roots of God's vines! If we were in his
   power, you and I would not have a grain of faith or a spark of love
   left! He is desirous to have us, not only that he may sift us as wheat,
   but that he may burn us as chaff! When we think of his malice and
   cunning, we may well pray, "Deliver us not over unto the will of our
   enemy." When God's people have met Satan in a hand-to-hand conflict,
   they have always found it a stern and difficult struggle, for he is
   ferocious, malicious and powerful--and he comes

   against us, not only to worry us--but seeking whom he may devour! We
   need keeping, then, if it were only because of that one adversary who
   would make a speedy end of us if we were left in his grip even for an
   hour!

   Like the vine, too, we have not only to dread him who would cut us
   down, but there is a wild boar of the woods that would gladly tear us
   up by the roots! I mean that wild boar of unbelief that is constantly
   prowling around us. How does it seek with its sharp tusks to tear our
   vines and fig trees! You know, dear Friends, how unbelief takes away
   your comforts, how it destroys your strength and how it mars your
   usefulness. Perhaps some of you, at times, hardly know whether you are
   the Lord's people or whether you are not His. Our friend, who addressed
   us last ordinance Sabbath, said that God's people ought never to have
   doubts and fears. I quite admit that they ought not to have them--but
   that they really do have them is quite as certain! I like that good old
   hymn of Dr. Watts and sing it as I find it--

   "When I can read my title clear

   To mansions in the skies

   I bid farewell to every fear

   And wipe my weeping eyes."

   1 am afraid, dear Brothers and Sisters, you and I cannot travel the
   same road if you are always confident and if you never have reason to
   look back and cry because you have lost your evidences. This I
   know--there are seasons with me when I do not doubt my Lord and Master,
   but I do doubt my interest in Him--and I have to come to Him just as I
   came at first, as an empty-handed sinner and accept His Grace as He
   freely presents it. Yes, if the Lord did not keep us, the wild boar of
   unbelief would soon tear us to pieces, and we would have no Grace left,
   but would become useless forever!

   Then, you know, the vine is often subject to injury from various kinds
   of insects. Almost all plants of any value are attacked, at times, by a
   peculiar kind of fly which devours the leaves and prevents
   fruit-bearing. And the vine is specially liable to attacks of this
   sort. So is it with Christians--we have the fly ofpride. If the great
   enemy never came to knock us down and unbelief never tried to root us
   up, the very quietude of the atmosphere and the calmness of the soft
   summertime would begin to breed that deadly fly which goes before
   destruction! I think we have even more cause to fear the effects of
   carnal security, self-confidence and pride than the assaults of Satan,
   himself! I do not know how it is with you, my Brothers and Sisters, but
   at times I feel so dead that I would almost welcome a temptation from
   Satan, so that I might feel a little spiritual life stirring within me
   in opposition to it!

   There have been dark times in our experience which have caused us great
   sorrow of heart and yet we have come to look back upon those sad
   seasons almost with a sort of envy--and we have wished that we might
   have them over, again, so that we might feel at least some pulsing,
   some palpitations of the new life within us! Oh, that dreadful fly of
   pride! John Bunyan tells us, in his Holy War, that it was Mr.
   Carnal-Security who drove Emmanuel from the town of Mansoul. He would
   have always stayed there and have given Mansoul high holiday, but that
   Diabolonian, Mr. Carnal-Security, whose father was Mr. Self-Conceit,
   and whose mother was Lady Fear-Nothing, filled the townspeople with
   such high notions of their greatness that the blessed Prince went His
   way in sorrow and anger!

   Alas for us when we say, "My mountain stands firm, I shall never be
   moved." For we are then in direst peril! That cankerworm of conceit,
   that caterpillar of pride, that locust of carnal security would soon
   destroy God's vineyard if it were not written, "I the Lord keep it. I
   will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and
   day." This promise assures us that the Lord will preserve us from the
   assaults of pride as well as from the attacks of unbelief and from the
   malice of the great adversary of our souls!

   Then, dear Friends, beside the enemies I have mentioned, the vine is
   subject to the attacks of the little foxes that Solomon speaks of in
   the Canticles--"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the
   vines." There are plenty of little foxes of all sorts about, nowadays.
   I mean false doctrine and skeptical teaching. Some of these crafty
   foxes come nibbling at us, trying to make us doubt the Inspiration of
   Scripture. Some of them even dare to try to root up and destroy our
   confidence in the Divinity of Christ! Others of these little foxes are
   still more insidious--they seek to tempt us away from the outward means
   of Grace and aim at making us forsake the assemblies of God's saints.
   Men pour into our ears all sorts of heresies and lies till our souls
   scarcely know the Truth of God from error and we are carried to and
   fro, and have a hard battle to fight! Ah, if the Lord did not keep His
   Church, she would soon become a prey to the graft of her adversaries!
   But He does preserve His vineyard from the little foxes and from the
   great foxes, too! His vines have tender grapes and the foxes would
   devour them if they could, but, blessed be the Lord, they are unable to
   do so! Our Lord preserves us and protects us from all the craft and
   cunning of our adversaries!

   Besides, dear Friends, when we have a few grapes that are beginning to
   ripen, there are the birds that come and try to pick the fruit--those
   dark-winged thoughts of worldliness and selfishness which come to us
   all. We begin to say, "Well done!" to ourselves and then it is always
   ill-done. The Prophet Habakkuk tells us of those who "sacrifice unto
   their net, and burn incense unto their drag." And if we ascribe our
   success to our own perseverance, our own zeal and so forth, we shall be
   like the birds which steal the fruit that belongs to the master, or
   like dishonest workmen who are set to till the garden and rob their
   employer of the produce. Let us never try to get our Master's money, to
   put it out to usury, and then, when the interest comes in, spend it on
   ourselves! The temptation to selfishness--to live for this world
   alone-- or to seek to bring forth fruit merely for our own
   aggrandizement, is so strong and comes so easily upon us, that if the
   Lord did not keep us, we would, none of us, retain our Christianity for
   a single hour--but would be wholly given up to worldliness, selfishness
   and every other form of sin!

   I ask again the question with which I began and I pray you, each one,
   to ask it yourself--"Do I need keeping?" Oh, my Heart, never did the
   tender vine so much need the gardener's care as you need to be kept by
   your Lord! You are like an infant suffering from a thousand diseases
   and unable to cure itself of any one of them! You are helplessly weak
   and if your Father, God, should leave you, there is nothing for you but
   to die in despair! Dear Brothers and Sisters, let us have a deep
   consciousness of the dangers to which we are exposed--not that we may
   live trembling lives--but that we may be weaned from all trust in self
   and may be driven nearer to God and always seek to live under His
   Divine protection!

   Another question may occur to someone here--"Even if I have to face all
   these dangers, can I not keep myself if I am very watchful and very
   prayerful? May I not by my own power and vigilance keep off these
   adversaries?" Ah, there is something wrong in the very question,
   itself, for who is to keep me watchful? Who is to make me prayerful? If
   my watchfulness and prayerfulness depended upon myself, I might
   slumber, and so I would, very soon, be destroyed! Brethren, it is a
   great mercy that the text puts it not that we must keep the vineyard
   ourselves, but, "I, the Lord keep it." Watchfulness is our duty--it is
   our privilege to abide much in earnest, wrestling prayer--but still, to
   keep up the watchfulness and the prayerfulness, there must constantly
   be the secret incoming of Divine Strength! Our watchfulness and
   prayerfulness are proofs of God's gracious working! The real cause of
   the vineyard of the Church and each individual vine being preserved
   must always be found in this blessed assurance--"I, the Lord keep it. I
   will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and
   day."

   What did you say--"Cannot I keep myself?" Alas, you are your own worst
   enemy! Augustine was known to say, "Lord, save me from that evil man,
   myself!" And you and I have good reason to pray the same prayer. We can
   very soon destroy ourselves, but we can never save ourselves. I bless
   the Lord that there is not even a semblance of truth in that verse in
   Wesley's hymn book--

   "A charge to keep I have A God to glorify! A never-dying soul to save,
   And fit it for the sky."

   It is the Lord who saves the souls of His people, and it is the Lord
   who fits them for the sky! If they had to do it, themselves, not a
   solitary soul among them would ever see His face with acceptance, or
   stand with joy before His Throne! "I, the Lord keep it. I will water it
   every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." It is
   always so put and for us to entirely get rid of all idea of carnal
   strength is both right and safe! It is well for us to feel that, in
   ourselves, we are as weak as water and as insignificant as the insects
   that die in a day--and that for all true strength we must look to God,
   and to God alone! Rest assured that you and I are never so weak as when
   we fancy that we are strong, and that we are never so strong as when we
   are conscious of our greatest weakness! This is an enigma, but our
   experience has often proved it to be true. Our supposed riches are
   generally the marks of deep spiritual poverty, while conscious poverty
   is an indication of the unsearchable riches which faith is enjoying.
   Learn to live every day, dear Brothers and Sisters, in Jesus, as having
   nothing, yet possessing all things!

   This is how God would have you live, trusting Him for all the Grace you
   continually need. When you wake in the morning, you are to look forward
   to temptations and trials, but you are to cry to the Lord for
   deliverance from them-- and not to think of keeping yourselves during
   the day, but to place yourselves, again, in the hands of God--to be
   kept and preserved by Him who has said of the vineyard of His Church,
   "I, the Lord keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I
   will keep it night and day." Then, when the day is over, let this be
   your evening song--

   "Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood,

   I lay me down to rest,

   As in the embraces of my God,

   Or on my Sa vior's breast."

   I will mention only one other question and then we will leave this part
   of the subject--"Do I enjoy this keeping??" This is a question that
   must make you search your heart. Do you enjoy this keeping? Is it your
   habit and mine, every day, to look to God to keep us? When we wake in
   the morning, is this our first desire, "Lord, keep me this day beneath
   the shadow of Your wings"? When we go out to business, or on our Lord's
   service, are we conscious that we are still under the Lord's eyes and
   protected by the Lord's power? When, at any time, we have slipped and
   erred, do we bitterly repent that we could have acted so wrongly as to
   wander away from the Good Shepherd? And at night, when we look back
   upon the engagements of the day, are we in the habit of blessing God
   for as His unseen mercies? Have we learned to bless Him for preserving
   us from all the mysterious spiritual dangers by which we are
   surrounded? Has it, in fact, become our practice to make this text
   experimentally our own, "I, the Lord keep it. I will water it every
   moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day"?

   Beloved, do you not think that we often live all day long as if there
   were no God? Do you not, sometimes, find yourselves going about the
   world as if God and you were strangers to each other? Do you not, at
   least now and then, venture upon the stormy sea of another day without
   getting your Pilot on board? And do you not think that, at night, when
   you come to the temporary haven of your chamber, you may often have
   cause to say to the Lord, "Alas! Alas! My God, I have lived this day
   and You have protected me, I doubt not, but still, I have not been
   mindful of You, I have not looked up to You, I have not been hanging on
   Your breast, I have not been nestling under Your wings as the chick
   hides itself under the hen"? I would that, as Church members, you and
   I, all of us, would learn the blessed lesson of this text, "I, the
   Lord, keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will
   keep it night and day. During My people's nights of adversity and
   during their days of prosperity, in their nights of soul-sorrow and in
   their days of hallowed rejoicing, in the nights when their spirit lies
   slumbering, and in the days when the sunlight of My Countenance shines
   upon them, and they go forth strong to labor and to do My will, I will
   keep them under all circumstances. I will never leave them, I will
   never, no never, forsake them."

   I am always afraid, whenever I preach about the security of God's
   people, lest you should grow carnally secure, that is to say, lest,
   instead of realizing the preciousness of the doctrine and its practical
   bearing, you should merely be satisfied with the outward shell of it. I
   want you not only to know that God keeps you, but to feel the power of
   that blessed Truth in your inmost soul--to enjoy it and to live upon
   it. You know that it is one thing to look at honey and to be told that
   it is sweet to the taste. But it is a very different thing to eat of it
   and to prove its sweetness for yourself! Be it yours, like Jonathan, to
   dip your rod into the honey of this text and to eat of it abundantly,
   for so shall your eyes be enlightened and every day you shall be able
   to say, "The Lord is my Keeper: the Lord is my Shade upon my right
   hand: the Lord is my Helper; I will not fear what man or even the
   devil, himself, may try to do to me."

   II. Now, with greater brevity, let me talk to you upon the second part
   of the subject, the Lord's CONTINUAL WATERING. He that keeps,
   waters--"I the Lord keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any
   hurt it, I will keep it night and day."

   I was rather struck, the other day, by this remark of a somewhat
   eminent horticulturist--"Depend upon it," he said, "that watering is a
   very essential part of a gardener's business." It is especially so in
   hot weather, for there is little doubt that if the flowers are to be
   kept constantly in bloom, and if the beds are to look fresh and
   beautiful, the watering pot must be in frequent use. In the summer, how
   very soon the grass looks brown and how very speedily the flowers begin
   to droop their heads and shrivel up their leaves, all for lack of
   watering! Well, now, we have this gracious provision in the text to
   meet the needs of the Lord's vines, the Keeper of the vineyard,
   Himself, says, "I will water it every moment."

   We will handle this part of the subject as we did the other portion, in
   the form of questions, and the first enquiry shall be, "Do I need
   watering within as well as keeping without??" The answer that must be
   given is--Yes, that I do, for there is not a single Grace I have that
   can live an hour without being Divinely watered! Have I not seen many a
   professor come forward to join the Church full of faith of a certain
   sort and full of zeal after a fashion? But, after a few months-- and
   there are some hypocrites who hold out even for years--they begin to
   falter! They do not care for the House of God as much as they did. They
   grow worldly and careless and, at last, they give up their profession
   altogether! What is the

   reason of their failure? Just this, they were not watered--they never
   had the living sap to nourish their roots--they never sucked up the
   Living Water of God's Grace and so, having no watering from the Most
   High, their flowers all withered, drooped their heads and died. There
   is no wonder at this result, for he who has only the strength that is
   within himself will be like snow that melts and passes away! It is only
   the man who derives His strength from God who will be like the sun that
   shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day! There is no Grace I
   have, then, which does not need watering from above!

   Beside that, the soil in which I am planted is very dry. Ask any
   Christian whether he ever gets any real good out of the world. Do you
   not find it a very dry soil where you go to business? The other day you
   said that you would change your employment--you would be a fool if you
   did--it would only be a change of troubles! The God who gave you your
   present set of trials knew that they were the best for you. If all the
   crosses in the world could be laid in a heap and I were told to take my
   pick of them, I would choose those that I have right now, for I know
   what they are, and God fits my back to them! But I do not know what the
   others are and I have no proof that I could bear them. You had better
   not take my troubles, for they might crush you, while I can bear them
   through the Divine Strength that is given to me. But if I had yours,
   they might crush me, while you can patiently endure them through God's
   Grace. This earth, however, is no very genial soil for a Christian's
   growth. Worldlings may flourish in it, but if the Christian would have
   Living Water, he must get it from some other place than this earth,
   for, spiritually, it is a dry and thirsty land where there is no water!

   Then, again, the atmosphere that is round about us does not naturally
   yield us any water. The means of Grace, which are like clouds hovering
   over our heads, are often nothing but clouds--they come and they
   go--but we receive no rain from them. The other day we looked up and we
   said that it would rain, directly, but lo, the one black cloud was soon
   gone! So, you sometimes go up to the House of God and you say to
   yourselves, "Our minister has often cheered and comforted us, perhaps
   he will have a good word for us today." And when the text is announced
   and the sermon is begun, you think, "Here is a cloud, there will be
   some rain, presently," but, whether it is your fault or the minister's,
   we will not say, often there is not a drop of moisture to refresh your
   spirit! The reason is that the Lord will have you know that He, and He,
   alone, must water you if you are to be effectually revived! He will
   teach you that you need watering, that all your Graces constantly
   require fresh supplies of Divine Grace, and that you must have them
   directly and only from Him.

   The beauty of the text seems to me to lie in the last two words--"I
   will water it every moment." There is no plant except a plant of Grace
   that needs to be watered every moment--but we do. I do not know to what
   object I can compare a Christian better than to one of those gas lights
   yonder. The Believer is not a candle, for a candle can burn of itself
   when it is once lighted because it carries its own burning materials.
   Neither is he a lamp that is supplied with a store of oil, except in a
   certain sense, but he is just like one of these gas lights. Turn the
   tap, cut off the connection with the gas meter, and out goes the light
   at once! There must be a stream of gas continually flowing to keep up
   the burning--and so is it with the Christian's spiritual life--it must
   be perpetually streaming in from his Lord! He cannot live even a tithe
   of a second unless life flows to him from God! Look at your hand. I
   suspect that if, for a moment, you could altogether suspend the
   circulation of your blood. If you could utterly cut off the life floods
   so as to dissever your hand from the rest of your body, though it were
   but for a second, yet vitality would be gone! And so, if the Christian
   could be for one instant without union to Christ, without receiving
   supplies of Divine Grace, he would at once expire!

   I will not talk to you much longer, for we need to gather around the
   Communion Table, but I will just put this one question--"Have we all
   realized, as a matter of experience, that the Lord waters us every
   moment?" Brothers and Sisters, I am very much afraid that there are but
   few of us who have ever learned the full meaning of this gracious
   promise. You can, perhaps, say, "The Lord waters me every Sabbath and
   on Monday and Thursday nights." Possibly you can go even farther, and
   say, "He waters me every morning, and every evening," but to be watered
   every moment--to have continually such a conscious connection with
   Christ as to be really receiving His Grace--you ask, "Is this
   experience attainable? It may be possible for a minister, for he has
   time to think of these things, but it is not possible for us working
   people who have to earn our bread by the sweat of our brows! Nor for us
   business men who have to be all day long occupied with accounts."

   Oh, but, Beloved, there are some of the Lord's people who have proved
   that this blessing can be obtained and that it is possible to be in the
   world and yet to be living near God, and every moment to be watered by
   Him! Have you never heard of that poor servant girl who expounded the
   meaning of the passage, "Pray without ceasing"? Some person could

   not understand how anyone could pray without ceasing, but Mary said,
   "Why, when I dress myself in the morning, my heart prays that I may be
   robed in my Savior's righteousness. When I light the fire, I pray the
   Holy Spirit to kindle a flame of sacred love in my heart. When I spread
   the cloth for breakfast, I ask God to feed me with the Bread of Heaven
   and whatever I do, all day long, I try to turn it into something that
   will make me live near to my God!" Do you not see, dear Friends, that a
   stirring life may yet be a spiritual life? There are some people, you
   know, who, when they get hold of some hobby, can attend to business and
   yet ride their hobby as well. It may be that they have taken to working
   out some mathematical problem--if so, you will see them attending to
   the shop, but all the while they are thinking about that problem--and
   the first opportunity they get, they begin figuring away on a scrap of
   paper, trying to work it out. Whatever takes place during the day, the
   man is always thinking of that problem! And when he is on his way home,
   as he is riding along, he is still thinking of that one thing because
   his heart is full of it. Thus it may be with you, so that while you are
   engaged in business and in the lawful affairs of your daily life, your
   heart may still be always going out towards

   God.

   I was struck by a remark of a dear friend, the other day, who said that
   Mr. So-and-So was so fond of everything Gothic that he had his chairs
   Gothic, his bedstead Gothic and all the furniture of his house Gothic.
   I think that a Christian should have everything full of Christ, so that
   whether he eats, or drinks, or whatever he does, he does all to the
   Glory of God! It was said of Ambrose that he used to eat, drink and
   sleep eternal life--so may it be said of each of us! Why, sometimes,
   when we have some dear one upon our hearts, we may go and attend to
   fifty thousand things, but we do not forget that beloved object of our
   affection! A mother may have to go on an errand and she may be
   compelled to stay away a long while, but her sick child at home is on
   her heart all the time! So I want that we should have Christ and have
   the Holy Spirit, and have our Father who is in Heaven continually upon
   our minds! And in that way shall we learn the meaning of this passage,
   "I, the Lord keep it. I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I
   will keep it night and day."

   Now, as I close my discourse, I fear that there are some of you who are
   not saved--and to you I have to put a personal question--"Why should
   not this night be the time of your salvation?" Why did you come into
   the Tabernacle tonight? Some of you have been inconvenienced, for you
   have had to stand all through the service. I hope you have not come
   here for nothing. I trust that the Lord meant to bless you when He
   induced you to come up those steps and between those pillars. Remember
   that the righteous God must punish sin, but that His Son, Jesus Christ,
   was punished in the place of all those who will believe on Him! To
   believe on Him is to trust Him. Have you done that? Then, though your
   sins were as scarlet, they are now whiter than snow! If you have
   trusted Jesus, your iniquities, which were like a black cloud, have all
   been rolled away and you are so completely saved that there is, now, no
   condemnation to you, for you are in Christ Jesus! God bring you to
   trust in Christ, for believing in Him, you are saved!

   May we, who are about to gather around the Communion Table, have our
   Master's special Presence and blessing! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Isaiah 64.

   Verse 1. Oh that You would rend the heavens. God's ancient people were
   in great trouble and the Prophet saw no way out of their perplexity.
   But God can make a way of escape where there is not one, He can rend
   even Heaven, itself, if need be, in order to deliver His saints.
   Therefore, the Prophet, or the people, pray, "Oh that You would rend
   the heavens"--

   1. That You would come down. "Come down, Yourself, great God, in all
   the majesty of Your Glory! Burst through the firmament and appear in
   Divine splendor!"

   1. That the mountains might bow down at Your Presence. The eternal
   hills are made to melt at the touch of God's feet. Mountains are the
   things that are last to move, but God moves them when He once comes
   near! How often we forget Omnipotence! That is a factor we are too apt
   to leave out of our calculations and yet, my Brothers and Sisters,
   Omnipotence is at the back of all our feebleness when that feebleness
   is with the truth and the right, and is engaged in the service of God!
   If the Lord's Presence is manifested, even the mountains will flow
   down, as we read in Micah's prophecy, "For, behold, the Lord comes
   forth out of His place and will come down, and tread upon the high
   places of the earth. And the

   mountains shall be molten under Him and the valleys shall be cleft, as
   wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep
   place."

   2, 3. As when the melting fire burns, the fire causes the waters to
   boil, to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may
   tremble at Your Presence! When You did terrible things which we looked
   not for, You came down, the mountains flowed down at Your Presence.
   Where God is, everything begins to melt. He touches the mountains and
   makes them boil over with lava, like volcanoes in action! At His touch
   the very sea begins to boil with the fervent heat of Divine Power.
   Then, when these wonderful results are perceived, even God's enemies
   are compelled to say, "This is the finger of God," and they tremble at
   His Presence. We never know, Brothers and Sisters, what great things
   God will do, as we do not know all that He can do, but we do believe
   that all things are possible to the Omnipotent Jehovah! When He brings
   His reserve forces into the field, the battle is a short one. "When You
   did terrible things which we looked not for, You came down, the
   mountains flowed down at Your Presence." It was so when Sennacherib, in
   Isaiah's day, besieged the city of Jerusalem. There was, apparently, no
   way of escape from the stupendous hordes of the mighty monarch, but the
   Angel of the Lord killed a 185,000 of them in one night and utterly
   overthrew them! God has but to appear in His terrible power and His
   adversaries tremble at His Presence, or are destroyed in an instant!

   4. For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
   perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside You, what
   He has prepared for him that waits for Him. The unexpected is always
   happening! God interposes in a way which we never thought of. Even if
   we have been listening for His footstep, we have not heard the sound of
   it--if we have been watching for His coming, we have not seen His
   approach. God alone knows all that He will do--

   "He in the thickest darkness dwells," but out of that darkness He
   brings forth purposes of light and brightness to completely amaze His
   servants. "Ah," says one, "but is He not long in doing it?" No, no, it
   is our impatience that makes us think so, but the Lord never really
   delays.

   5. You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness. God comes to
   meet us before we get to Him and then there is a blessed meeting. "You
   meet him that rejoices and works righteousness." If you do right, God
   will meet you. But He will meet you much sooner if you can rejoice at
   the same time, for there is no service for God that is so acceptable to
   Him as the service that is done with delight! "You meet him that
   rejoices and works righteousness." When we are glad to serve God. When
   we take a delight in suffering for His name's sake, then God will come
   and meet us for certain. We need not think that, under such
   circumstances, He will let us stand alone--"You meet him that rejoices
   and works righteousness."

   5. Those that remember You in Your ways. If you remember God, He will
   certainly remember you! The fact that you are thinking of Him is proof
   positive that the Lord has thoughts of love towards you!

   5. Behold, You are angry; for we have sinned: in those is continuance,
   and we shall be saved. God's wrath has no continuance in it towards His
   own people. He soon makes it to pass away from them. His anger may
   endure for a night, but His mercy comes in the morning. His own Word
   is, "For a small moment have I forsaken you, but with great mercies
   will I gather you. In a little wrath I hid My face from you for a
   moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, says
   the Lord, Your Redeemer." The Lord has a rod in His hand, but the
   scourging of His own children does not last long. It is a rod, mark
   you, not an axe that brings death. But His mercy, His goodness, the
   purposes of His Grace are perpetual--"In those is continuance, and we
   shall be saved." Now comes a very mournful passage. You have read some
   of the lamentations of Jeremiah. Here is one of the lamentations of
   Isaiah. He lived to see his country in a very sad condition. Perhaps
   this was the state of affairs when Sennacherib invaded the land.

   6. But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as
   filthy rags. If this is true of our righteousnesses, what must our sins
   be? If even our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, where shall we find
   a metaphor to describe our sins?

   6. And we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,
   have taken us away. This does not allude to our mortality, but to our
   sin--"We all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have
   taken us away." We are not like the green leaf on the tree--we may seem
   to be so for a moment, but very soon our righteousness fades like a
   withered leaf and, in consequence, our iniquities, like the wind which
   bears the withered leaves from the bough, carry us away. This is what
   we all are by nature. This is what the people were in Isaiah's day--the
   whole nation seemed to be unholy--its outwardly righteous men were not
   really righteous, its ministers were not truthful, its magistrates were
   not honest and even the professors of purity were, at heart, immoral!

   7. And there is none that calls upon Your name, that stirs up himself
   to take hold of You. We have not come quite to that condition, yet.
   There are still some who stir themselves up to take hold upon God and
   who call upon His name. We are not left in so sad a state as the
   favored nation was in in Isaiah's days. It is a terrible thing when
   intercession fails! Perhaps the dark day that will mark the world's
   final doom will be a day unwhitened by prayer. Certainly, while prayer
   remains, the world is blessed, but when prayer shall cease, when that
   Divine disinfectant is taken away from this poor leper house, then the
   pestilence of sin will rage and destroy most terribly! It was so in the
   Prophet's day--"There is none that calls upon Your name, that stirs up
   himself to take hold of You."

   7, 8. For You have hid Your face from us, and have consumed us, because
   of our iniquities. But now, O LORD, You are our Father. The Prophet,
   himself, begins to plead with God. Jehovah was known as the God of the
   children of Abraham. He was not recognized as the God of the Assyrian,
   Sennacherib worshipped Nisroch as his God--"But now, O Jehovah, You are
   our Father."

   8, 9. We are the clay, and You our potter; and we all are the work of
   Your hands. Do not be furious, O LORD, neither remember iniquity
   forever! Behold, see, we beseech You, we are all Your people. Isaiah
   could plead that, in a certain way, they were nominally the people of
   God. But if we can plead this truly and spiritually on the behalf of
   any man. If we can plead it for ourselves, what a mighty plea it is!
   "Lord, You have made us. You have new-made us and You can keep us. We
   are the clay and You are our potter; we belong to You. Oh, break not
   the vessels that You have made! Cast not away the people You have
   chosen. Be merciful to us, O God, for we are Your people!" Then the
   Prophet gives a pitiful description of the condition unto which the
   land of Judah was reduced.

   10, 11. Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
   Jerusalem a desolation. Our holy and our beautiful house, where our
   fathers praised You, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant
   things are laid waste. Their houses and God's House went together to
   destruction. When their houses were burnt, God's House did not escape.
   This is the most bitter part of the trial to a genuine Believer--when
   his own estate is impoverished, he can bear it, but when the Kingdom of
   God suffers damage--this cuts him to the quick! God's House is our
   house, the Prophet thus speaks of it--"Our holy and our beautiful
   house, where our fathers praised You, is burned up with fire: and all
   our pleasant things are laid waste."

   12. Will you refrain Yourself for these things, O LORD? "Can You stand
   still and see all this?" This is the kind of pleading for the people of
   God to use when sin abounds. When the Truth of God is trampled like
   mire in the street, we may come before the Lord and say, "Will You
   refrain Yourself for these things, O Jehovah?"

   12. Will You hold Your peace and afflict us very severely? May God
   teach us how to plead for His people and make us great intercessors on
   behalf of His Church and His cause in these evil days! Amen.

The Birth Of Christ

   (No. 2392)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 23, 1891.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL, SOUTHWARK, ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING,
   DECEMBER 24, 1854.

   "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His
   name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to
   refuse the evil, and choose the Good." Isaiah 7:14,15.

   The kingdom of Judah was in a condition of imminent peril. Two monarchs
   had leagued themselves against her, two nations had risen up for her
   destruction. Syria and Israel had come up against the walls of
   Jerusalem with full intent to raze them to the ground and utterly
   destroy the monarchy of Judah. Ahaz the king, in great trouble, exerted
   all his ingenuity to defend the city and, among the other contrivances
   which his wisdom taught him, he thought it fit to cut off the waters of
   the upper pool, so that the besiegers might be in distress for lack of
   water. He goes out in the morning, no doubt attended by his courtiers,
   makes his way to the conduit of the upper pool, intending to see after
   the stopping of the stream of water, but lo, he meets with something
   which sets aside his plans and renders them needless! Isaiah steps
   forward and tells him not to be afraid for the smoke of those two
   firebrands, for God should utterly destroy both the nations that had
   risen up against Judah. Ahaz need not fear the present invasion, for
   both he and his kingdom would be saved. The king looked at Isaiah with
   an eye of incredulity, as much as to say, "If the Lord were to send
   chariots from Heaven, could such a thing as this be? Should He animate
   the dust and quicken every stone in Jerusalem to resist my foes, could
   this be done?"

   The Lord, seeing the littleness of the king's faith, tells him to ask
   for a sign. "Ask it," He says, "either in the depth, or in the height
   above. Let the sun go backward ten degrees, or let the moon stop in her
   midnight marches. Let the stars move from one side to the other in the
   sky in grand procession! Ask any sign you please in the Heaven above,
   or, if you wish, choose the earth beneath, let the depths give forth
   the sign, let some mighty waterspout lose its way across the pathless
   ocean and travel through the air to Jerusalem's very gates! Let the
   heavens shower a golden rain instead of the watery fluid which usually
   they distill. Ask that the fleece may be wet upon the dry floor, or dry
   in the midst of dew. Whatever you please to request, the Lord will
   grant it to you for the confirmation of your faith." Instead of
   accepting this offer with all gratitude, as Ahaz should have done, he,
   with a pretended humility, declares that he will not ask, neither will
   he tempt the Lord his God! Whereupon Isaiah, waxing indignant, tells
   him that since he will not, in obedience to God's command, ask for a
   sign, behold, the Lord, Himself, will give him one--not simply a sign,
   but this sign, the sign and wonder of the world, the mark of God's
   mightiest mystery and of His most consummate wisdom, for, "a virgin
   shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel."

   It has been said that the passage I have taken for my text is one of
   the most difficult in all the Word of God. It may be so--I certainly
   did not think it was until I saw what the commentators had to say about
   it and I rose up from reading them perfectly confused! One said one
   thing and another denied what the other had said. And if there was
   anything that I liked, it was so self-evident that it had been copied
   from one to the other and handed through the whole of them!

   One set of commentators tells us that this passage refers entirely to
   some person who was to be born within a few months after this prophecy,
   "for," they say, "it says here, 'Before the child shall know to refuse
   the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be
   forsaken of both her kings.'" "Now," say they, "this was an immediate
   delivery which Ahaz required and there was a promise of a speedy
   rescue, that, before a few years had elapsed, before the child should
   be able to know right from wrong, Syria and Israel should both lose
   their kings." Well, that seems a strange frittering away of a wonderful
   passage, full of meaning, and I cannot see how they can substantiate
   their view when we find

   the Evangelist Matthew quoting this very passage in reference to the
   birth of Christ, and saying, "Now all this was done, that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Behold,
   a virgin shall be with Child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they
   shall call His name Immanuel."

   It strikes me that this Immanuel, who was to be born, could not be a
   mere simple man and nothing else, for if you turn to the next chapter
   of Isaiah, at the 8th verse, you will find it said, "He [king of
   Assyria] shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he
   shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall
   fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel." Here is a government
   ascribed to Immanuel which could not be His if we were to suppose that
   the Immanuel here spoken of was either Shear-Jashub, or
   Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, or any other of the sons of Isaiah! I therefore
   reject that view of the matter. It is, to my mind, far below the height
   of this great argument--it does not speak or allow us to speak one half
   of the wondrous depth which couches beneath this mighty passage!

   I find, moreover, that many of the commentators divide the 16th verse
   from the 14th and 15th verses, and they read the 14th and 15th verses
   exclusively of Christ, and the 16th verse of Shear-Jashub, the son of
   Isaiah. They say that there were two signs, one was the conception by
   the virgin of a Son, who was to be called Immanuel, who is none other
   than Christ, but the second sign was Shear-Jashub, the Prophet's son,
   of whom Isaiah said, "Before this child, whom I now lead before
   you--before this son of mine shall be able to know good and evil, so
   soon shall both nations that have now risen against you lose their
   kings." But I do not like that explanation because it seems to me to be
   pretty plain that the same child is spoken of in the one verse as in
   the others. "Before the Child"--the same Child--it does not say that
   Child in one verse and then this child in another verse, but before the
   Child, this one of whom I have spoken, the Immanuel, before He "shall
   know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor
   shall be forsaken of both her kings."

   Then another view, which is the most popular of all, is to refer the
   passage, first of all, to some child that was then to be born, and
   afterwards, in the highest sense, to our blessed Lord Jesus Christ.
   Perhaps that is the true sense of it-- perhaps that is the best way of
   smoothing difficulties--but I think that if I had never read those
   books at all, but had simply come to the Bible, without knowing what
   any man had written upon it, I would have said, "There is Christ here
   as plainly as possible! Never could His name have been written more
   legibly than I see it here. 'Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a
   Son.' It is an unheard of thing, it is a miraculous thing and,
   therefore, it must be a God-like thing! She 'shall call His name
   Immanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to refuse the
   evil, and choose the good.' And before that Child, the Prince Immanuel,
   shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you
   abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings, and Judah shall smile upon
   their ruined palaces."

   This morning, then, I shall take my text as relating to our Lord Jesus
   Christ, and we have three things, here, about Him. First, the birth.
   Secondly, the food. And, thirdly, the name of Christ.

   I. Let us commence with THE BIRTH OF CHRIST--"Behold a virgin shall
   conceive and bear a Son."

   "Let us even now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to
   pass," said the shepherds. "Let us follow the star in the sky," said
   the Eastern Magi, and so say we this morning. Hard by the day when we,
   as a nation, celebrate the birthday of Christ, let us go and stand by
   the manger to behold the commencement of the Incarnation of Jesus! Let
   us recall the time when God first enveloped Himself in mortal form and
   tabernacled among the sons of men! Let us not blush to go to so humble
   a spot--let us stand by that village inn and let us see Jesus Christ,
   the God-Man, become an Infant of a span long!

   And, first, we see here, in speaking of this birth of Christ, a
   miraculous conception. The text says expressly, "Behold, a virgin shall
   conceive and bear a Son." This expression is unparalleled even in
   Sacred Writ! Of no other woman could it be said beside the Virgin Mary,
   and of no other man could it be written that his mother was a virgin.
   The Greek word and the Hebrew are both very expressive of the true and
   real virginity of the mother, to show us that Jesus Christ was born of
   woman and not of man. We shall not enlarge upon the thought, but still,
   it is an important one, and ought not to be passed over without
   mentioning. Just as the woman, by her venturous spirit, stepped first
   into transgression--lest she should be despised and trampled on, God,
   in His wisdom devised that the woman, and the woman, alone, should be
   the author of the Body of the God-Man who should redeem mankind! Albeit
   that she, herself, first tasted the accursed fruit, and tempted her
   husband (it may be that Adam, out of love to her, tasted that fruit
   lest she should be degraded, lest she should not stand on an equality
   with him), God has ordained that so it should be, that His Son should
   be sent forth

   "born of a woman," and the first promise was that the Seed of the
   woman, not the seed of the man, should bruise the serpent's head.

   Moreover, there was a peculiar wisdom ordaining that Jesus Christ
   should be the Son of the woman, and not of the man, because, had He
   been born of the flesh, "that which is born of the flesh is flesh," and
   merely flesh--and He would, naturally, by carnal generation, have
   inherited all the frailties and the sins and the infirmities which man
   has from his birth. He would have been conceived in sin and shaped in
   iniquity, even as the rest of us. Therefore He was not born of man, but
   the Holy Spirit overshadowed the Virgin Mary and Christ stands as the
   one Man, save one other, who came forth pure from his Maker's hands,
   who could ever say, "I am pure." Yes, and He could say far more than
   that other Adam could say concerning his purity, for He maintained His
   integrity and never let it go! And from His birth down to His death He
   knew no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. Oh, marvelous sight!
   Let us stand and look at it. A Child of a virgin, what a mixture!

   There is the finite and the Infinite, there is the mortal and the
   Immortal, corruption and Incorruption, the manhood and the Godhead,
   time married to eternity! There is God linked with a creature, the
   Infinity of the august Maker come to tabernacle on this speck of
   earth--the vast unbounded One whom earth could not hold and the heavens
   cannot con-tain--lying in His mother's arms! He who fastened the
   pillars of the universe and riveted the nails of creation, hanging on a
   mortal breast, depending on a creature for nourishment! Oh, marvelous
   birth! Oh, miraculous conception! We stand and gaze and admire. Verily,
   angels may wish to look into a subject too dark for us to speak of!
   There we leave it, a virgin has conceived and borne a Son.

   In this birth, moreover, having noticed the miraculous conception, we
   must notice, next, the humble parentage. It does not say, "A princess
   shall conceive and bear a Son," but a virgin. Her virginity was her
   highest honor--she had no other. True, she was of royal lineage--she
   could reckon David among her forefathers--and Solomon among those who
   stood in the tree of her genealogy. She was a woman not to be despised,
   albeit that I speak of humble parentage, for she was of the blood-royal
   of Judah. O Babe, in Your veins there runs the blood of kings! The
   blood of an ancient monarchy found its way from Your heart all through
   the courses of Your body! You were born, not of mean parents, if we
   look at their ancient ancestry, for You are the Son of him who ruled
   the mightiest monarchy in his day, even Solomon, and You are the
   descendant of one who devised in his heart to build a Temple for the
   mighty God of Jacob!

   Nor was Christ's mother, in point of intellect, an inferior woman. I
   take it that she had great strength of mind, otherwise she could not
   have composed so sweet a piece of poetry as that which is called the
   Virgin's Song, beginning, "My soul does magnify the Lord." She is not a
   person to be despised. I would, this morning, especially utter my
   thoughts on one thing which I consider to be a fault among us
   Protestants. Because Roman Catholics pay too much respect to the Virgin
   Mary, and offer prayer to her, we are too apt to speak of her in a
   slighting manner. She ought not to be placed under the ban of contempt,
   for she could truly sing, "From henceforth all generations shall call
   me blessed." I suppose Protestant generations are among the "all
   generations" who ought to call her blessed. Her name is Mary, and
   quaint George Herbert wrote an anagram upon it--

   "How well her name an ARMY does present, In whom the Lord of Hosts did
   pitch His tent."

   Though she was not a princess, yet her name, Mary, by interpretation,
   signifies a princess, and though she is not the queen of Heaven, yet
   she has a right to be reckoned among the queens of earth. And though
   she is not the lady of our Lord, she does walk among the renowned and
   mighty women of Scripture.

   Yet Jesus Christ's birth was a humble one. Strange that the Lord of
   Glory was not born in a palace! Princes, Christ owes you nothing!
   Princes, Christ is not your debtor! You did not swaddle Him, He was not
   wrapped in purple, you had not prepared a golden cradle for Him to be
   rocked in! Queens, you did not dandle Him on your knees, He hung not at
   your breasts! And you mighty cities, which then were great and famous,
   your marble halls were not blessed with His little footsteps! He came
   out of a village, poor and despised, even Bethlehem! When there, He was
   not born in the governor's house, or in the mansion of the chief man,
   but in a manger! Tradition tells us that His manger was cut in solid
   rock-- there was He laid and the oxen likely enough came to feed from
   the same manger, the hay and the fodder of which was His only bed. Oh,
   wondrous stoop of condescension, that our blessed Jesus should be
   girded with humility and stoop so low!

   Ah, if He stooped, why should He bend to such a lowly birth? And if He
   bowed, why should He submit, not simply to become the Son of poor
   parents, but to be born in so miserable a place?

   Let us take courage here. If Jesus Christ was born in a manger in a
   rock, why should He not come and live in our rocky hearts? If He was
   born in a stable, why should not the stable of our souls be made into a
   house for Him? If He was born in poverty, may not the poor in spirit
   expect that He will be their Friend? If He thus endured degradation at
   the first, will He count it any dishonor to come to the very poorest
   and humblest of His creatures and tabernacle in the souls of His
   children? Oh, no! We can gather a lesson of comfort from His humble
   parentage and we can rejoice that not a queen, or an empress, but that
   a humble woman became the mother of the Lord of Glory!

   We must make one more remark upon this birth of Christ before we pass
   on, and that remark shall be concerning a glorious birthday. With all
   the humility that surrounded the birth of Christ, there was yet very
   much that was glorious, very much that was honorable. No other man ever
   had such a birthday as Jesus Christ had! Of whom had Prophets and seers
   ever written as they wrote of Him? Whose name is engraved on so many
   tablets as His? Who had such a scroll of prophecy, all pointing to Him
   as Jesus Christ, the God-Man? Then remember, concerning His birth, when
   did God ever hang a fresh lamp in the sky to announce the birth of a
   Caesar? Caesars may come and they may die, but stars shall never
   prophesy their birth! When did angels ever stoop from Heaven and sing
   choral symphonies on the birth of a mighty man? No, all others are
   passed by, but look--in Heaven there is a great light shining and a
   song is heard--"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good
   will toward men."

   Christ's birth is not despicable, even if we consider the visitors who
   came around His cradle. Shepherds came first and, as it has been
   quaintly remarked by an old Divine, the shepherds did not lose their
   way, but the wise men did! Shepherds came first, unguided and unfed, to
   Bethlehem. The wise men, directed by the star, came next. The
   representative men of the two bodies of mankind--the rich and the
   poor--knelt around the manger--and gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,
   and all manner of precious gifts were offered to the Child who was the
   Prince of the kings of the earth, who, in ancient times was ordained to
   sit upon the Throne of His father, David, and in the wondrous future to
   rule all nations with His rod of iron!

   "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son." Thus have we spoken
   of the birth of Christ.

   II. The second thing that we have to speak of is THE FOOD OF
   CHRIST--"Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to refuse the
   evil, and choose the good."

   Our translators were certainly very good scholars and God gave them
   much wisdom so that they craned up our language to the majesty of the
   original, but here they were guilty of very great inconsistency. I do
   not see how butter and honey can make a child choose good and refuse
   evil. If it is so, I am sure butter and honey ought to go up greatly in
   price, for good men are very much required! But it does not say, in the
   original, "Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to refuse
   the evil, and choose the good," but, "Butter and honey shall He eat,
   till He shall know how to refuse the evil, and choose the good," or,
   better still, "Butter and honey shall He eat, when He shall know how to
   refuse the evil, and choose the good."

   We shall take that translation and just try to make clear the meaning
   couched in the words. They should teach us, first of all, Christ's
   proper Humanity. When He would convince His disciples that He was
   flesh, and not spirit, He took a piece of a broiled fish and of a
   honeycomb, and ate as others did. "Handle Me," He said, "and see, for a
   spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see I have." Some heretics
   taught, even a little after the death of Christ, that His body was a
   mere shadow, that He was not an actual, real Man--but here we are told
   He ate butter and honey just as other men did. While other men were
   nourished with food, so was Jesus! He was very Man as certainly as He
   was verily and eternally God. "In all things it behooved Him to be made
   like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High
   Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins
   of the people." Therefore we are told that He ate butter and honey to
   teach us that it was actually a real Man who, afterwards, died on
   Calvary.

   The butter and honey teach us, again, that Christ was to be born in
   times of peace. Such products are not to be found in Judea in times of
   strife--the ravages of war sweep away all the fair fruits of
   industry--the unwatered pastures yield no grass and, therefore, there
   could be no butter. The bees may make their hive in the lion's carcass
   and there may be honey there, but when the land is disturbed, who shall
   go to gather the sweetness? How shall the babe eat butter when its
   mother flees away, even in the winter time, with the child clinging to
   her breast? In times of war, we have no choice of

   food--then men eat whatever they can procure and the supply is often
   very scanty. Let us thank God that we live in the land of peace and let
   us see a mystery in this text, that Christ was born in times of peace.

   The temple of Janus was shut before the Temple of Heaven was opened!
   Before the King of Peace came to the Temple of Jerusalem, the horrid
   mouth of war was stopped! Mars had sheathed his sword and all was
   still. Augustus Caesar was emperor of the world, none other ruled it
   and, therefore, wars had ceased--the earth was still, the leaves
   quivered not upon the trees of the field, the ocean of strife was
   undisturbed by a ripple, the hot winds of war blew not upon man to
   trouble him--all was peaceful and quiet! And then came the Prince of
   Peace, who, in later days, shall break the bow, cut the spear in sunder
   and burn the chariot in the fire.

   There is another thought here. "Butter and honey shall He eat when He
   shall know how to refuse the evil, and choose the good." This is to
   teach us the precocity of Christ, by which I mean that even when He was
   a child, even when He lived upon butter and honey, which is the food of
   children, He knew the evil from the good. It is, usually, not until
   children leave off the food of their infancy that they can discern good
   from evil in the fullest sense. It requires years to ripen the
   faculties, to develop the judgment, to give full play to the man--in
   fact, to make him a man. But Christ, even while He was a Baby, even
   while He lived upon butter and honey, knew the evil from the good,
   refused the one, and chose the other. Oh, what a mighty intellect there
   was in that brain! While He was an Infant, surely there must have been
   spar-klings of genius from His eyes! The fire of intellect must have
   often lit up that brow! He was not an ordinary child--how would His
   mother talk about the wonderful things the little Prattler said! He
   played not as others did. He cared not to spend His time in idle
   amusements. His thoughts were lofty and wondrous. He understood
   mysteries and when He went up to the Temple in His early days, He was
   not found, like the other children, playing about the courts or the
   markets, but sitting among the doctors, both hearing and asking them
   questions! His was a master-mind--"Never man spoke like this Man." So,
   never child thought like this Child--He was an astonishing One, the
   wonder and the marvel of all children, the Prince of children--the
   God-Man even when He was a Child! I think this is taught us in the
   words, "Butter and honey shall He eat when He shall know how to refuse
   the evil, and choose the good."

   Perhaps it may seem somewhat playful, but, before I close speaking upon
   this part of the subject, I must say how sweet it is to my soul to
   believe that as Christ lived upon butter and honey, surely butter and
   honey drop from His lips. Sweet are His Words unto our souls, more to
   be desired than honey or the honeycomb! Well might He eat butter whose
   Words are smooth to the tried, whose utterances are like oil upon the
   waters of our sorrows! Well might He eat butter, who came to bind up
   the broken-hearted, and well did He live upon the fat of the land, who
   came to restore the earth to its old fertility and make all flesh soft
   with milk and honey, ah, honey in the heart--

   "Where can such sweetness be As I have tasted in Your love, As I have
   found in Thee?"

   Your Words, O Christ, are like honey! I, like a bee, have flown from
   flower to flower to gather sweets and concoct some precious essence
   that shall be fragrant to me, but I have found honey drop from Your
   lips, I have touched Your mouth with my finger and put the honey to my
   lips, and my eyes have been enlightened, sweet Jesus! Every Word of
   Yours is precious to my soul--no honey can compare with You--well did
   You eat butter and honey!

   And perhaps I ought not to have forgotten to say that the effect of
   Christ's eating butter and honey was to show us that He would not, in
   His lifetime, differ from other men in His outward guise. Other
   Prophets, when they came, were dressed in rough garments and were
   austere and solemn in manner. Christ came not so--He came to be a Man
   among men, a feaster with those that feast, an eater of honey with
   eaters of honey. He differed from none and, therefore, He was called a
   gluttonous man and a wine-bibber. Why did Christ do so? Why did He so
   commit Himself, as men said, though it was verily a slander? It was
   because He would have His disciples not regard meats and drinks, but
   despise these things, and live as others do. It was because He would
   teach them that it is not that which goes into a man, but that which
   comes out, that defiles him! It is not what a man eats, with
   temperance, that does him injury--it is what a man says and thinks. It
   is not abstaining from meat, it is not the carnal ordinance of, "Touch
   not, taste not, handle not," that makes the fundamentals of our
   religion, albeit it may be good addenda thereunto. Butter and honey
   Christ ate, and butter and honey may His people eat! No, whatever God,
   in His Providence gives unto them, that is to be the food of the Child
   Christ.

   III. Now we come to close with THE NAME OF CHRIST--"And shall call His
   name Immanuel."

   I hoped, dear Friends, that I would have my voice this morning, that I
   might talk about my Master's name. I hoped to be allowed to drive along
   in my swift chariot, but, as the wheels are taken off, I must be
   content to go as I can. We sometimes creep when we cannot go and go
   when we cannot run, but oh, here is a sweet name to close up with--"She
   shall call His name Immanuel." Others in the olden time called their
   children by names which had meaning in them. They did not give them the
   names of eminent persons whom they would very likely grow up to hate,
   and wish they had never heard of! They had names full of meaning which
   recorded some circumstance of their birth. There was Cain--"I have
   gotten a man from the Lord," said his mother, and she called him Cain,
   that is, "Gotten," or, "Acquired." There was Seth--that is,
   "Appointed," for his mother said, "God has appointed me another seed
   instead of Abel." Noah means "Rest," or, "Comfort." Ishmael was so
   called by his mother because God had heard her. Isaac was called,
   "Laughter," because he brought laughter to Abraham's home. Jacob was
   called the supplanter, or the crafty one, because he would supplant his
   brother. We might point out many similar instances--perhaps this custom
   was a good one among the Hebrews, though the peculiar formation of our
   language might not allow us to do the same, except in a certain
   measure.

   We see, therefore, that the Virgin Mary called her son, Immanuel, that
   there might be a meaning in His name, "God with us." My soul, ring
   these words again, "God with us." Oh, it is one of the bells of Heaven!
   Let us strike it yet again--"God with us." Oh, it is a stray note from
   the sonnets of Paradise! "God with us." Oh, it is the lisping of a
   seraph! "God with us." Oh, it is one of the notes of the singing of
   Jehovah when He rejoices over His Church with singing! "God with us."
   Tell it, tell it, tell it--this is the name of Him who is born today--

   "Hark, the herald angels sing!"

   This is His name, "God with us"--God with us, by His Incarnation, for
   the august Creator of the world did walk upon this globe! He who made
   ten thousand orbs, each of them more mighty and more vast than this
   earth, became the Inhabitant of this tiny atom! He who was from
   everlasting to everlasting, came to this world of time and stood upon
   the narrow neck of land betwixt the two unbounded seas! "God with us."
   He has not lost that name--Jesus had that name on earth and He has it,
   now, in Heaven! He is now, "God with us."

   Believer, He is God with you to protect you! You are not alone, because
   the Savior is with you! Put me in the desert, where vegetation grows
   not--I can still say, "God with us." Put me on the wild ocean and let
   my ship dance madly on the waves--I would still say, "Immanuel, God
   with us." Mount me on the sunbeam and let me fly beyond the western
   sea--still I would say, "God with us." Let my body dive down into the
   depths of the ocean and let me hide in its caverns--still I could, as a
   child of God say, "God with us." Yes, and in the grave, sleeping there
   in corruption--still I can see the footmarks of Jesus! He trod the path
   of all His people and His name is still, "God with us."

   But if you would know this name most sweetly, you must know it by the
   teaching of the Holy Spirit. Has God been with us this morning? What is
   the use of coming to Chapel if God is not there? We might as well be at
   home if we have no visits of Jesus Christ and, certainly, we may come,
   and come, and come as regularly as that door turns on its hinges unless
   it is, "God with us," by the influence of the Holy Spirit! Unless the
   Holy Spirit takes the things of Christ and applies them to our heart,
   it is not, "God with us." Otherwise, God is a consuming fire. It is
   "God with us" that I love--

   "Till God in human flesh I see, My thoughts no comfort find."

   Now ask yourselves, do you know what "God with us" means? Has it been
   God with you in your tribulations, by the Holy Spirit's comforting
   influence? Has it been God with you in searching the Scriptures? Has
   the Holy Spirit shone upon the Word? Has it been God with you in
   conviction, bringing you to Sinai? Has it been God with you in
   comforting you, by bringing you, again, to Calvary? Do you know the
   full meaning of that name, Immanuel, "God with us"? No-- he who knows
   it best knows little of it! Alas, he who knows it not at all is
   ignorant, indeed--so ignorant that his ignorance is not bliss, but will
   be his damnation! Oh, may God teach you the meaning of that name,
   Immanuel, "God with

   us"!

   Now let us close. "Immanuel." It is wisdom's mystery, "God with us."
   Sages look at it and wonder. Angels desire to see it. The plumb-line of
   reason cannot reach half-way into its depths. The eagle wings of
   science cannot fly so high and the piercing eye of the vulture of
   research cannot see it! "God with us." It is Hell's terror! Satan
   trembles at the sound of it. His legions fly apace, the black-winged
   dragon of the Pit quails before it! Let Satan come to you suddenly and
   do you but whisper that word, "God with us"--back he falls--confounded
   and confused! Satan trembles when he hears that

   name, "God with us." It is the laborer's strength--how could he preach
   the Gospel, how could he bend his knees in prayer, how could the
   missionary go into foreign lands, how could the martyr stand at the
   stake, how could the confessor acknowledge his Master, how could men
   labor if that one word were taken away? "God with us," is the
   sufferer's comfort, is the balm of his woe, is the alleviation of his
   misery, is the sleep which God gives to His beloved, is their rest
   after exertion and toil.

   Ah, and to finish, "God with us" is eternity's sonnet, is Heaven's
   hallelujah, is the shout of the glorified, is the song of the redeemed,
   is the chorus of angels, is the everlasting oratorio of the great
   orchestra of the sky! "God with us"--

   "Hail You Immanuel, all Divine,

   In You Your Father's glories shine!

   You brightest, sweetest, fairest One,

   That eyes have seen or angels known." Now, a happy Christmas to you all
   and it will be a happy Christmas if you have God with you! I shall say
   nothing, today, against festivities on this great birthday of Christ. I
   hold that, perhaps, it is not right to have the birthday celebrated,
   but we will never be among those who think it as much a duty to
   celebrate it the wrong way as others the right! But we will, tomorrow,
   think of Christ's birthday. We shall be obliged to do it, I am sure,
   however sturdily we may hold to our rough Puritanism. And so, "let us
   keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice
   and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
   Do not feast as if you wished to keep the festival of Bacchus! Do not
   live, tomorrow, as if you adored some heathen divinity. Feast,
   Christians, feast! You have a right to feast. Go to the house of
   feasting tomorrow! Celebrate your Savior's birth. Do not be ashamed to
   be glad--you have a right to be happy. Solomon says, "Go your way, eat
   your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God
   now accepts your works. Let your garments be always white and let your
   head lack no ointment."--

   "Religion never was designed To make our pleasures less."

   Remember that your Master ate butter and honey. Go your way, rejoice
   tomorrow, but, in your feasting, think of the Man in Bethlehem--let Him
   have a place in your hearts, give Him the glory, think of the virgin
   who conceived Him--but think, most of all, of the Man born, the Child
   given! I finish by again saying--

   "A HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Matthew 2:1-12.

   Verse 1. Now when Jesus was born is Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
   Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem,
   Our Lord was born in Bethlehem, an inconsiderable village of Judea. Its
   name, however, is significant--it means, "the house of bread." Truly
   Bethlehem has become, in a spiritual sense, the house of bread to all
   who feed on Christ. When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, there came wise
   men from the East to Jerusalem--

   2. Saying, Where is He that is born King of the Jews? There was another
   king, of whom we have just read--"Herod the king," but he was an
   Idumaean, an Edomite. He had no right to the throne. But here is born
   the true Heir to the throne of David, and the Magi from the East have
   come to ask for Him.

   2, 3. For we have seen His star is the East, and are come to worship
   Him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and
   all Jerusalem with him. Tidings of the arrival of these strangers in
   the Jewish capital, asking for the new-born King, would be sure to
   spread rapidly! The news soon reached the palace and Herod, one of the
   most suspicious and cruel of tyrants and, therefore, the most cowardly
   of men, "was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."

   4. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
   people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. They
   could tell him if they wished to do so, for they were deeply versed in
   the Scriptures. The Scribes copied the Sacred Writings. The Pharisees
   had counted the very letters of the Word--they could tell which was the
   middle letter of the Old Testament. They were great at the letter, but,
   alas, they had missed the spirit! Men may know a great deal about the
   Bible and yet really know nothing of it. The husks of Scripture yield
   small profit--we need to come to the kernel, the real corn, the
   spiritual meaning of the Inspired Word.

   5-7. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is
   written by the Prophet, And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are
   not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of you shall come a
   Governor who shall rule My people Israel. King Herod, when he had
   privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the
   star appeared. He half suspected that he would not see them again, so
   he determined to get all the information he possibly could out of them.

   8. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently
   for the young Child; and when you have found Him, bring me word again,
   that I may come and worship Him also. It was like his deep, cunning
   spirit to try to find out where the Child was, that he might kill Him!
   He looked upon Him as a rival, as one who might rob him of his throne,
   so he would put Him to death if he could and, meanwhile, he would
   pretend that he wanted to worship Him.

   9. When they had heard the king, they departed, and, lo, the star,
   which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood
   over where the young Child was. It was probably not a star in the sense
   in which we use the word, that is a planet, or a fixed star, but a
   meteoric brightness which moved in the sky, and so guided the wise men.
   They do not appear to have seen its light after they set out on their
   journey--it directed them to the region of Judea so they came to the
   capital city, Jerusalem. When they departed from Herod, the star
   appeared, again, and guided them to the little town of Bethlehem, where
   they found the Christ. God may sometimes send us stars, bright lights
   of joy, to guide us on our way. He may also take them away, again, and
   then we must walk by faith. When they reappear, we will be glad to have
   them once more, as the wise men were.

   10. 11. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great
   joy. And when they were come into the house. For it would seem that the
   mother and child had moved out of the stable into a house. The town
   was, perhaps, not now quite so crowded, and there was more room for
   Mary and her blessed baby--"When they were come into the house"--

   11. They saw the young Child with Mary, His mother, and fell down and
   worshipped Him: and when they had opened their treasures, they
   presented unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. These were
   the products of their country, such as they would give to princes. Such
   treasures must have been of great use to Mary and Joseph to help them
   take care of the wondrous child who had been entrusted to their charge.

   12. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
   Herod, they departed into their own country another way. I remember a
   long sermon by a learned man, to show that we may sometimes break our
   promise, if, upon further consideration, we find we did wrong in making
   it, saying that these wise men, though they had promised to go and tell
   Herod all about the young Child, did not do so when warned of God by a
   dream. After reading his very ingenious dissertation, I turned to the
   text and there discovered that the wise men never made any promise of
   the kind--so that it was a sermon on a nonexistent text! They never
   agreed to return! Herod told them to do so, which is one thing, but
   they did not promise to do so--that would have been quite another
   thing. They broke no promise and, therefore, needed no excuse. They
   were in supernatural communication with God--He had guided them by a
   star and now He speaks to them in a dream and bids them go back to
   their own country another way. May we all be under like unerring
   guidance! Amen.

A Comforting Message for the Closing Year

   (No. 2393)

   A SERMON INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S DAY, DECEMBER 30, 1894.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   1, 1863.

   "Rest in the Lord." Psalm 37:7.

   IT is certain, Christian, that you have nowhere else to rest. Of the
   whole of this time-state it was well said, "This is not your rest," and
   of all the comfort that you find in earthly friendships and
   relationships, in the good things of this life, or in any hopes short
   of Heaven, we may truly say, "This is not your rest." The other day, at
   Highgate, I passed some fine old trees that were marked with a white
   cross, to indicate, no doubt, that they were to be cut down. So,
   everything we have here is marked with the woodman's cross and the axe
   must fell all our joys. You birds of paradise, build not your nests on
   trees that are marked to fall! This earth is not your rest! You shall
   fly the wide world over till your wings are weary, but, you doves of
   Christ, you shall find no rest till you come back to the hand of your
   Noah and nestle in His ark of Covenant Grace. "Rest in the Lord," says
   the text, and in saying so it does, as it were, condemn all other
   pretended rests and fancied refuges! May everyone of you who have
   wandered hear the voice of Wisdom and may your hearts say, "Return unto
   your rest, O my Soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you!"

   But though there is no rest to be found in earthly things, yet we may
   have rest even while here--rest which drops from above. Just as the
   wilderness yielded no bread to the children of Israel, yet there was
   bread for them in the wilderness, for it fell from Heaven! The arid
   sands could give no streams of cooling water, yet there was water even
   there, for the Apostle Paul tells us that "they drank of that spiritual
   Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ." Because I tell you
   that this world is a wilderness and you find it true, do not think that
   you are never to have any rest in it. Behold, your rest is sent to you
   from on high! Behold, your refreshment comes from the Rock of Ages! In
   Jesus you have rest, even though you are pilgrims, and even though you
   are troubled, for we who have believed in Him, even now have entered
   into rest! True Christians, when they are in a healthy state of mind
   and heart, rest in the Lord and, as I hope this Tabernacle is not a
   leper house, but a place where the warriors of Christ have come to
   feast at the table of their great Captain, I desire for each of you,
   and for myself, also, that all of us who are in Christ may this night
   have perfect "rest in the Lord."

   What is this rest that is mentioned in our text?

   I. The rest which Believers enjoy is, first of all, REST FROM
   WANDERING.

   You know that God promised to give rest to His ancient people. They had
   none in the wilderness, for, often, they had no sooner pitched their
   tents than they had to strike them again. As quickly as the
   fiery-cloudy pillar moved, so had they, though weary and footsore, to
   follow. Joshua said to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, and to the
   half tribe of Manasseh, whose inheritance was to be on the further side
   of Jordan "You shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty
   men of valor, and help them until the Lord has given your brethren
   rest." The Promised Land was always looked forward to by the weary and
   wandering tribes as a place where they would rest.

   Well, Beloved, you and I no longer wander--we have come to our rest. O
   my Heart, how you did wander, like a weary pilgrim, through the Egypt
   of your bondage! You did wander to Sinai, where you did hear the Law of
   God that made you tremble! You did wander across the wilderness of Sin,
   where your good works vexed and tired you, and your evil works, like
   fiery serpents, bit you! But that is all over now. My Soul, you have
   crossed the Jordan and, having found Christ, you have no inclination to
   wander anymore. My Brothers and Sisters, remember how our minds used to
   wander after 50 pretended comforts and we found no joy in any of them?
   One day we thought this, the next day we thought that.

   One day we dreamed that peace was to be found here, the next day, we
   fancied it was to be obtained yonder, the bubble mocked us as we
   pursued it and it continually fled from our grasp! We thought full sure
   that we had secured something solid, but the apple of Sodom was crushed
   when we laid hold upon it--it turned to ashes in our hand!

   We used to be always wandering--none could tell where we would rest on
   the morrow--but now we rest in the Lord! We have no inclination to
   wander to anyone else. "My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I
   will sing and give praise." Every now and then people discover a new
   gospel and they want us to believe it, but we say to them, "No, we are
   perfectly content with what we have received." Sometimes a new form of
   religion is invented, but it has no attractions for us! We have left
   off being pilgrims--we are settled down and cannot, by God's Grace, be
   moved! We say of all these inventions--

   "Should all the forms that men devise

   Assault my faith with treacherous art,

   I'd call them vanity and lies

   And bind the Gospel to my heart." I do not usually find it worth my
   while, nowadays, when anybody tells me, at the beginning of a book,
   that he is going to disprove all that I believe, to read the book at
   all! If a cook informs me that a joint of meat is bad and, on tasting
   the first mouthful, I find that it is so, there is no need that I
   should eat it all in order to prove that it is not good wholesome food!
   So, you had better leave these tainted doctrines alone! When you have
   your principles firmly fixed, especially when you have come to rest at
   the very feet of the unchanging Jesus and have learned the meaning of
   that text, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever,"
   you have reached perfection's own self and you may well grow
   conservative and never go a step beyond! Paul could say to the
   Galatians, "If any man preaches any other Gospel unto you than that you
   have received, let him be accursed," for he could also say, "other
   foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."--

   "Now rest, my long-divided Heart,

   Fixed on this blissful center, rest, never more to go gadding abroad,
   to seek after other loves and other trusts! In that sense, dear
   Friends, "rest in the Lord." Be not carried about with every wind of
   doctrine, but abide fast by Christ, whom you have received by faith.

   II. We have also another rest, and that is, REST FROM ALL OUR FOES.

   Scripture, speaking of the victories of the children of Israel under
   Joshua and Caleb, says, "The land had rest from war." When Saul of
   Tarsus, the great persecutor, was converted, we read, "Then had the
   churches rest." Now, dear Friends, the people of God are always being
   molested by enemies--there are multitudes of foes on the right hand and
   on the left. Yet was David right when he penned that verse, "You
   prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies." The moment we
   begin to think of the prevalence of Christ's plea, the merit of
   Christ's blood, the power of Christ's arm, the faithfulness of Christ's
   heart--what are all our sins within us, or all our foes without us? Do
   they not melt away like the host of Midian before the sword of the Lord
   and of Gideon? Does some stout sin, like Goliath of Gath, come out and
   challenge you to fight? Take the name of the Lord as your sling and
   stone, and you shall yet be able to cut off the giant's head! Do your
   foes come out against you with multitudes of chariots? Let your faith
   open its eyes and you shall see horses of fire and chariots of fire
   round about you! Put your trust in God and you shall soon learn that
   more are they that are for you than all that can be against you. "War,
   war, war!" the voices of enemies constantly cry around the walls of
   Zion, but what is that sweet sound within the city? It is the music of
   the harp and the song of them that make merry!--

   "There is a stream whose gentle flow

   Supplies the city of our God

   Life, love, and joy, still gliding through,

   And watering our Divine abode." Yes, Brothers and Sisters,
   notwithstanding that Hell is against us, and that devilish trinity, the
   world, the flesh, and Satan--yet, when we come to our Lord Jesus Christ
   and sit under the shadow of His great Atonement and remember His
   glorious Resurrection and Ascension--we feel at once that we can "rest
   in the Lord."

   III. Further, we have REST IN THE SENSE OF CONFIDENCE.

   In this meaning of the word, beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, we
   do really, "rest in the Lord." We are not Christians if we do not, for
   the first mark of a Believer is that he rests in Christ for everything,
   depending on the blood

   and righteousness of Christ as the Alpha and the Omega of his
   salvation. Now, as Believers rest in Christ for the first things, so
   ought they to rest in Christ for all things. Whatever need you have,
   rest on the bare arm of God to supply it. Though you should require
   infinity, it is at your beck and call. Only rest in God, for
   Omniscience is watching for your good and Omnipotence is prepared to
   aid you!

   Beloved, I fear that we often place our confidence in ourselves, or get
   resting on an arm of flesh, depending first on this friend and then on
   that, relying first upon this scheme and then upon that plan. Happy is
   the man who has learned to cast off Saul's armor, saying, "I cannot go
   with these." The man who can cry, as David did to the giant, "You come
   to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to
   you in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
   whom you have defied." "Rest in the Lord," Christian, whatever it is
   that you require to bring you safely to His dwelling place above, and
   let your confidence exercise itself upon your Lord's faithfulness,
   almightiness and truth.

   IV. Now, though we have used the word, "rest," in three senses, we have
   not as yet come to the sweetest part of our subject. Believers have
   REST IN THE SENSE OF SAFETY.

   A Hebrew, pursued by the manslayer, never rested till he reached the
   City of Refuge. Lot must not rest until he gets into the little city of
   Zoar. So, we must never think of resting till we are saved. You who are
   afraid you are not saved have no rest. There are some of you who never
   say more than this, "Well, I hope I am saved," or, "I trust I may be
   saved." You do not have real rest, dear Friends--you may have something
   like rest, but you do not know the perfect peace of one who has fled
   for refuge to Christ--one who has given up every resting place except
   the finished work of Jesus! Such a person, having taken refuge in
   Christ, feels positively sure that nothing can harm him. What if I
   should venture to make my boast in my God tonight? What if I should
   say--

   "In my Surety I am free His dear wounds avail for me."

   What if I should glory in sin completely pardoned and in a robe of
   righteousness, woven from the top throughout, in which I stand arrayed
   before the Lord? If I said all this, I should say no more than you
   ought to say, you who are trusting in the Lord!

   You are saved, you are saved now! You are safe for all the days and all
   the nights you may live. You are safe in life and in death, in time and
   through eternity! Since Christ endured your condemnation, it cannot
   rest on you! God acquits you--therefore no accusation can lie against
   you. God absolves you. Christ pleads on your behalf--it is not possible
   that all your past sin can ruin you, for it was laid upon the
   Scapegoat's head of old--nothing in the present can daunt you, for
   Jesus says, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."
   Nothing in the future shall cast you down, for even to the end does the
   Lord keep His people! He gives unto them eternal life and they shall
   never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of His hand.

   I recollect when I first heard the glorious doctrine of the Believer's
   eternal safety--the good old man preached it very plainly, indeed, but
   its effect on me--I was then an unconverted but anxious soul--its
   effect on me was that it set my mouth a-watering. "Oh," I thought,
   "what would I not give to be saved?" I never had any relish for that
   tinkering gospel which is preached by Arminians--it is a very fine
   thing to look at, but it does not bear the wear and tear of life! I
   never cared for that sham gospel which may save today, but may damn
   tomorrow. I never admired that gospel chariot which has no bottom to
   it, or has wheels with rotten spokes, and that breaks down in the miry
   places of the way. I never had a taste for that sort of teaching, even
   before I was converted.

   But that Gospel which says, "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved," and makes no, "ifs," and, "ands," about it--that Gospel which
   promises eternal life and says that Believers shall never perish--oh it
   set my heart a-longing! How ardently I desired to get hold of it! And
   when I learned that I might have it, that I, the vilest of the vile,
   might have it, have it on these terms--"Look unto Me, and be you saved,
   all the ends of the earth"--oh, it seemed worthy of God's giving and
   worthy of man's accepting, worthy of the Spirit's work, worthy of
   Christ's procuring, worthy, indeed, of the man it blesses and of the
   God who is glorified in blessing him! O dear Friends, let us, if we are
   not safe in Christ, long to be so, and may the Lord bring us to Him,
   even at this very hour!

   "Rest in the Lord," then, Christians, for in Him is every Believer
   perfectly safe--

   "Munitions of stupendous rock His dwelling place shall be.

   There might his soul without a shock, The wreck of nature see."

   V. But the word, "rest," has a further meaning. God gives to His people
   PERFECT REST FROM WEARINESS. Man sometimes wipes his brow, and asks,
   "When will the shadows come? When shall I have fulfilled as a hireling
   my

   day of toil? " To think of being saved by our feelings and works brings
   much weariness to the spirit and, indeed, even to a Believer, this
   world's cares and strifes may often make him fling himself down upon
   his couch, and say, "Lord, let me die; I am no better than my fathers!"
   But, dear Friends, when we really rest in Christ--when we sit down
   under His shadow with great delight--all our weariness goes away at
   once! Do you not know what it is to spring up with elastic footsteps
   and go forth to some new duty, or to some fresh suffering, at the mere
   mention of your Lord's name, when, just before, you were bowed down
   with sorrow and thought that surely your end must soon come, and that
   you must speedily fall by the hand of the enemy? Every now and then,
   you know, our bodily strength needs to be renewed in sleep--constantly
   must this experience recur, or else we must die. Now, Jesus, "gives His
   beloved sleep," and all the calm that sleep can infuse into the body,
   does faith in Christ give to the soul! The jaded mind is calm when He
   is near. The distracted heart, when Christ has breathed upon it, is
   like a mountain lake on a summer's day.

   Absence from Christ produces weariness, but the Presence of Jesus
   always brings a sense of perfect ease. Have I not seen a man go
   staggering along beneath a little load of trouble because he had not
   gone to God with his burden? Yet I have seen another carry three times
   the weight and stand like a Hercules, unmoved, with his feet firmly
   set, because God was in him, and his confidence was in the Most High. I
   have seen you, Friend, groaning and repining because you had a trifling
   loss, or a slight sickness. And I have seen another, close to the verge
   of death, who has suffered the loss of all things, who has,
   nevertheless, rejoiced in the Lord and sung aloud in his Redeemer's
   name. All the difference is here--if we rest in the Lord, we rest, and
   nothing can make us weary--but if we go not to Him, we know no rest,
   and the slightest fatigue bows us down.

   I would, dear Friends, that all the members of this Church had more of
   this resting in the Lord. Sometimes I wish that some of you had more
   weariness--you will never work yourselves to death serving Christ--you
   are a great deal more likely to weary yourselves by serving the world.
   How men will moil and toil, and run here and there, to get a little of
   this world's goods--and then they put it into a bag that is full of
   holes! They neglect the means of Grace and, as to the week-night
   service--dear, dear, dear, there is that shop that must be attended to!
   And some of you can scarcely give yourselves time to pray because you
   must rise up early and sit up late, and eat the bread of carefulness. I
   wish that you would sometimes grow weary in that kind of labor, and
   take to another Master, and work for Him as you have worked for the
   world, till you grew weary in His cause, for then would you know the
   sweet rest with which He makes the weary to rest when they have wearied
   themselves for Him in preaching, in teaching, in spreading His truth!

   We read in Isaiah's prophecy, "This is the rest wherewith you may cause
   the weary to rest," and I know there are some weary ones here. You are
   not weary of God's work, but you are weary of bearing Christ's Cross.
   You have had so much shame and so much sorrow--well, well, Brothers and
   Sisters--"rest in the Lord." You may come to Him and since He carried
   His Cross, and that Cross was yours as well as His, you may put your
   cross upon His shoulder, and then you will find it easy work to carry
   the cross, yourselves! This, then, is one of the rests which every
   Christian may have--rest from weariness.

   VI. There is also a rest called THE REST OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.

   Was it not said of Boaz, by the mother-in-law of Ruth, "The man will
   not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day"? Some
   Christians never have any rest, or they have but very little, because
   they do not understand the doctrine of a finished salvation. If you and
   I are only half-saved, why, of course, we can never be really restful
   till the work is finished. No, if we are only three-quarters saved, we
   shall never have any true rest till the other quarter of the work is
   done! If there is one stone for us to lay in order to complete the
   edifice, we must not give sleep to our eyes, nor slumber to our
   eyelids, till it is fixed in its place.

   But here is the joy, here is the peace of Christians, that our
   salvation is a finished one! We have not a farthing to pay to complete
   the ransom of our souls. We have not a stitch to set to finish the robe
   of our salvation. We have not an act to perform, a prayer to offer, a
   tear to weep, a thought to think in order to finish the work of our
   redemption! I know that

   all these things shall be worked in us and, that by the Spirit of God
   we shall be made to do them--but all that shall not be with any view to
   the completion of our salvation--that was finished in the Person of the
   bleeding Lamb of Calvary!

   There are a great many people who imagine that they will be saved
   because they regularly go to Church--they might go to Church as long as
   Methuselah lived, but not get an inch nearer to Heaven by doing so!
   Others of you may suppose that you will go to Glory through constantly
   coming here. We will soon drive that delusion out of your minds if you
   are indulging any such notion! Still, there it is--you think that if
   you are kind, moral, upright, if you do good to your neighbors, if you
   bring up your families well--in some way Jesus Christ will mysteriously
   come in to make up your deficiencies and then when you get to Glory, of
   course, you intend to have a song all to yourself! You will say,
   "Praise and glory and honor be to myself! I did my part and Christ's
   assistance made the matter all right." The man who thinks that the work
   of salvation is partly his own does not understand the finished work of
   Christ! Either Christ completed all that was necessary for your
   salvation, or He did not! If He did finish it, then rest in Him and be
   glad, and say, "I am secure forever because my salvation is finished. I
   have nothing to do but to live to the honor of Him who has completely
   saved me by His Grace, His blood, His righteousness."

   But if Christ did not finish the work, you cannot complete it! If He
   has left a stitch unsewn or a stone unlaid, you cannot supply the
   deficiency. What? The human and the Divine joined together as equals?
   What? Yoke your little, insignificant, insect-like power with the
   Omnipotent strength of the Divine Redeemer? God forbid! What? Shall the
   dross and scum of human merit come and be reckoned with the pure gold
   of Christ's atoning Sacrifice? No! That can never be! Grace reigns, and
   Grace, alone, reigns! It reigns in this, that there is a finished work!
   Therefore, Christian, rest--"rest in the Lord," for the work is done!
   Be of good cheer, take your ease in Christ. Eat of Him, drink of Him
   and be merry, for you have much goods laid up for many years. Your
   feasting will never bring to you the censure of being a fool, but you
   will be as foolish as a thousand fools if you do not rest in Jesus!

   VII. Once again, we have, as Christians, enjoyed and we do now enjoy,
   THE REST OF COMPLETE SATISFACTION. There are very few persons in this
   world who are perfectly contented, but true Believers, when they are in
   a right state of mind, are always so. I do not believe that I have a
   wish in all this world except to know more of my Master and to win more
   souls for Him. Besides that, I cannot see anything to long for and I
   can truly sing--

   "I would not change my blest estate, For all that earth calls good or
   great! And while my faith can keep her hold, I envy not the sinner's
   gold."

   Rich sinners think poor saints are great fools. You, young man, over
   there, you own a fine horse and you have a splendid house and garden,
   or you have a flourishing business and very bright prospects. But I
   could pick out some old woman here--and, thank God, there are many such
   who regularly come to the Tabernacle, poor souls who have little else
   but the Grace of God to comfort them--I could bring this old women up
   for you to see. Her clothes are darned in a hundred places, or else she
   would be in rags. She works very hard to earn the little that keeps her
   out of the workhouse. She has not many comforts, yet sometimes, when we
   get a shake of her hand, we find she has some comforts, though they are
   of a sort that this young man does not understand.

   Well now, come here, my good Sister! Do you see that young man over
   there? He never has rheumatism in his bones. He never has to sit
   shivering in winter because there is no fire in the grate. He never has
   to say to his landlord, "I do not know where I shall get the week's
   rent." He never has to pinch himself and live on nothing but a small
   piece of bread-and-butter for a couple of days--no, never! I ask her,
   "Will you change places with this young gentleman?" "Well," she says,
   "I should like to know, first, whether he has an interest in Christ."
   When I tell her that he has not, I am sure her answer would be, "Change
   places with him? No, never! I'd sooner starve and have Christ as my
   Savior, than own all the wealth and comforts of this world, and be
   without Christ." So say we, Brothers and Sisters, and in the language
   of Watts we sing--

   "Go now, and boast of all your stores And tell how bright you shine!

   Your heaps of glittering dust are yours, And my Redeemer's mine."

   Having Christ, we feel perfect satisfaction and need nothing more! If
   we go up or down, to the right or to the left, we can find nothing
   beyond our Lord! Having Him, we possess all things, and our soul is
   satisfied! You remember that Naomi spoke of Ruth finding rest in the
   house of her husband. That is to say, she would have all she needed.
   Her husband would be all things to her. She did not need another
   husband, she did not need to find another house, nor broader fields,
   nor larger wealth. Boaz was all in all to her and what he gave her was
   enough for all her needs. So is it with the Christian--Christ is All in
   All to him--whatever He may give, or whatever He may deny, the
   Christian is perfectly content!

   VIII. I close, dear Friends, by noticing that all these forms of rest
   should bring to the Believer THE REST OF CONSCIOUS ENJOYMENT.

   Going down to Windsor to preach some time ago, my friend, John
   Anderson, was with me. And about twelve o'clock, as we were near
   Datchet, under the broad trees of a park we saw a number of sheep lying
   down peacefully. My friend quoted that passage in the Canticles, "Tell
   me, O You whom my soul loves, where You feed, where You make Your flock
   to rest at noon." It was the very picture of content and restful
   enjoyment! And as I came along tonight, I was thinking that I should
   like to see the same picture in this Church when we meet presently
   around the Communion Table. May you all have the rest of enjoyment! You
   have Christ to feed upon. You have heard about Him, again, this
   evening. You know He is yours. Then kiss Him with the kisses of your
   mouth. You have not a doubt, I hope, of your interest in Him-- if you
   have, come to Him, again, just as you came at first, as poor sinners
   resting on Him alone!

   And if He is, indeed, yours, treat Him as you would treat a loaf of
   bread if you were hungry--do not merely look at Him, but eat of Him and
   eat abundantly, O Beloved! Leave all your cares behind. You remember
   what Pharaoh said to Joseph's brethren, "Also regard not your stuff,
   for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours." Now, do not regard
   that household of yours, tonight, leave that stock-in-trade behind, let
   all that lumber lie where it is, for the good of Christ and of all the
   land of Heaven is yours! Come now, and be satisfied with all the
   goodness of God's Grace. "Ah," you say, "it is not quite so easy to
   leave all these things. There are such attractions in the world."
   Attractions, Brothers and Sisters? Rather, call them distractions! But
   I say that the attractions of Christ are greater than the distractions
   of the world! Fix your souls steadily on this fact, that you have
   Christ, that Christ is All in All to them that trust Him, and so come,
   now, and take your full rest in the Lord your God!

   Oh, that some might be set a-longing, tonight, and say, "That is what
   we want to do!" Well, if you long for Christ, then Christ longs for
   you! If you want Christ, then Christ wants you! If you penitently
   return to the Lord now, He will hasten towards you while you are yet a
   great way off! He will run to meet you, even as the father ran to meet
   his prodigal son. If you begin to confess with the prodigal, "Father, I
   have sinned against Heaven, and in Your sight, and am no more worthy to
   be called Your son," the Lord will say to His servants, as the father
   in the parable said, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and
   put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring here the
   fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry: for this, My
   son, was dead, and is alive again! He was lost, and is found."

   Remember that verse of Joseph Hart's which we have often sung, and as I
   repeat it, trust the Savior of whom He sings--

   "Trust Him; He will not deceive us,

   Though we hardly of Him deem: He will never, never leave us, Nor will
   let us quite leave Him."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: Psalm123,124.125.

   We shall read, this evening, three short Psalms--the 123rd , 124th and
   125th . May the Holy Spirit, who Inspired the writers of them,
   strengthen our faith while we read these songs of joyous confidence!

   Psalm 123:1. Unto You lift I up my eyes. Instead of looking downward in
   despair, or looking to the right hand or to the left to human
   confidence, or looking within in pride, "Unto You lift I up my eyes."--

   1. O You that dwells in the heavens. It is always delightful to the
   Christian to remember what the title of his God is-- "Our Father, which
   are in Heaven." It is the place of prospect from which God looks down
   and sees all men, and under-

   stands all their ways. And it is also the place of His Power and His
   Glory. Lord, I look up to You! You dwell in Glory, therefore all power
   is in Your hands, and You know how to use that power on the behalf of
   Your people!

   2. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
   and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
   wait upon the LORD our God, until that He have mercy upon us. The
   servant looks to his master's hand for direction and for support. If he
   has a work to do that is too heavy for him, he looks to his master to
   send him help. And he also looks to his master's hand for his reward
   when his work is done. So, dear Friends, are we, day by day, walking as
   in our Master's light?

   3. Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
   exceedingly filled with contempt. The best thing that the best of men
   can ask for is God's mercy! And that mercy is so great, even to the
   heavens, that, under the weariness of trials and troubles, it is a
   sufficient help for them. When we are not only in contempt, but even
   filled with contempt and, as the text puts it, "exceedingly filled with
   contempt," so that we have lost our good name among men, still may we
   turn to our God and seek His mercy.

   4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are
   at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. This was the lot of God's
   people in David's day. It is the same with Believers, now, and I
   suppose that, so long as the earth stands, the saints of the Lord will
   have to cry to Him concerning their adversaries. Let them remember
   always to use the same remedy that the godly ones of old used and not
   plead in earthly courts of law, but take the case to the great Court of
   King's Bench in Heaven! Let not any of the Lord's children ever be
   concerned about defending their own characters, but let them always go
   at once to Him whose bare arm is quite sufficient to right all wrongs
   and to deliver the oppressed.

   Psalm 124:1. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
   Israel say. There is a break here, the sentence is not finished, so
   finish it for yourselves. If the Lord had not been on your side, what
   then? You would have been condemned on account of sin! If the Lord had
   not been on your side as the Redeemer, you would have been left to
   perish through the natural depravity of your own heart! If He who is
   "mighty to save" had not been your Helper, just think, Christians, you
   who are today filled with joy, whose feet are treading Mount
   Tabor--think what you would have been if the Lord had not been on your
   side--and then praise and magnify that Grace to which you owe so much!

   2, 3. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up
   against us: then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
   kindled against us. The word, "quick," here means, "living." Before we
   were dead, they would have swallowed us up, for the anger of men
   against God's people is always exceedingly great. They called the
   Master of the house, "Beelzebub," so they are not likely to be very
   warmly affected towards His disciples! Suppose that we had been given
   up to the devices of wicked men, where would we have been?

   My brethren, a man may live so circumspectly that, outwardly, he may be
   without fault, yet he may wake up, come morning, and find his character
   blasted! And it may remain so for years, for the tongue of slander is
   full of all manner of villainy and, often, the more pure the alabaster
   of a man's character may be, the more black are the filthy spots which
   the world makes upon it! Be not too much cast down, O you children of
   the living God, when you are dishonored among men, for so was it with
   the Lord God, Himself, who was slandered in the garden of Eden! Expect
   not, therefore, that you will escape the serpent's venom!

   4, 5. Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
   soul: then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Here, in this life,
   we may have troubles, not only from our own evil hearts, but also from
   Satan and from the world. Truly, if it had not been for the Lord, the
   proud waters had gone right over our souls! It is a wonder that we are
   alive, Brothers and Sisters! We can sing with Watts--

   "Our life contains a thousand springs And dies if one is gone! Strange,
   that a harp of thousand strings Should keep in tune so long!"

   But it is a ten thousand times greater miracle that we are spiritually
   alive when there are so many in this world seeking to destroy us! This
   is a marvel of marvels and the whole world, itself, contains no greater
   wonders than are to be found in that one little world of Mansoul!

   6. Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
   We were almost in their teeth, like David's lamb, but David's Son
   plucked us out of the jaws of the lion and out of the paws of the bear!
   Now the Psalmist uses another figure. First he spoke of the proud
   waters, then of the wild beasts--now he mentions the fowlers.

   7, 8. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
   the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the
   LORD, who made Heaven and earth. What a blessed conclusion is it to our
   experience when we can sing of what the Lord has done and so are
   encouraged by the all of what He will yet do! Let us write this text
   upon our banners and lift them up in the face of every adversary, "Our
   help is in the name of the Lord." As John Wesley said, "The best of all
   is, God is with us," that is the best of all to the Christian, so good
   an, "all," that he is blessed with that even if he has nothing besides!

   Psalm 125:1-3. They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion,
   which cannot be removed, but abides forever. As the mountains are round
   about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about His people from henceforth
   even forever. For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of
   the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
   By, "the rod," is here meant, "the scepter." The wicked shall not
   permanently rule over the righteous--they may have a temporary dominion
   and sovereignty but, in due season, their rod shall be broken and their
   power shall be scattered to the winds.

   4, 5. Do good O Lord, unto those that are good, and to them that are
   upright in their hearts. As for such as turn aside unto their crooked
   ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but
   peace shall be upon Israel. May we have faith to lay hold upon that
   last blood promise and so enjoy the peace of God which passes all
   understanding! Amen!
