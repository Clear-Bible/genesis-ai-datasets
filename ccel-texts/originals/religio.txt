[Harvard Classics Introduction]

   Sir Thomas Browne was born in London on October 19, 1605, educated at
   Winchester and Oxford, and trained for the practise of medicine. After
   traveling on the Continent he finally settled as a physician in
   Norwich, and enjoyed a distinguished professional reputation. Later he
   became equally famous as a scholar and antiquary, and was knighted by
   Charles II on the occasion of the King's visit to Norwich in 1671. In
   1641 he married, and he was survived by four of his ten children. He
   died on his seventy-seventh birthday.

   His "Religio Medici" seems to have been written about 1635, without
   being intended for publication. In 1642, however, two surreptitious
   editions appeared, and he was induced by the inaccuracies of these to
   issue an authorized edition in 1643. Since that time between thirty and
   forty editions have appeared, and the work has been translated into
   Latin, Dutch, French, German, and Italian. Of his other works the most
   famous are "Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into Vulgar Errors"
   (1646), a treatise of vast learning and much entertainment;
   "Hydriotaphia, or Urn Burial," a discourse on burial customs, which
   closes with a chapter on death and immortality, the majestic eloquence
   of which places Browne in the first rank of writers of English prose;
   and "The Garden of Cyrus," a fantastic account of horticulture from the
   Garden of Eden down to the time of Cyrus, King of Persia, with much
   discussion on the mystical significations of the number five. His
   miscellaneous writings cover a great variety of subjects, religious,
   scientific, and antiquarian.

   The "Religio Medici" is an excellent typical example of the author's
   style. At once obscured and enriched by his individual and sometimes
   far-fetched vocabulary, his full and sonorous periods remain the
   delight of readers with an ear for the cadences of English prose. The
   matter of the book also reveals a personality of great charm and humor,
   a mind at once surprisingly acute and surprisingly credulous, and a
   character of an exalted nobility.

To The Reader

   Certainly that man were greedy of Life, who should desire to live when
   all the world were at an end; and he must needs be very impatient, who
   would repine at death in the society of all things that suffer under
   it. Had not almost every man suffered by the Press, or were not the
   tyranny thereof become universal, I had not wanted reason for
   complaint: but in times wherein I have lived to behold the highest
   perversion of that excellent invention, the name of his Majesty
   defamed, the Honour of Parliament depraved, the Writings of both
   depravedly, anticipatively, counterfeitly imprinted; complaints may
   seem ridiculous in private persons; and men of my condition may be as
   incapable of affronts, as hopeless of their reparations. And truely,
   had not the duty I owe unto the importunity of friends, and the
   allegiance I must ever acknowledge unto truth, prevailed with me, the
   inactivity of my disposition might have made these sufferings
   continual, and time, that brings other things to light, should have
   satisfied me in the remedy of its oblivion. But because things
   evidently false are not onely printed, but many things of truth most
   falsly set forth, in this latter I could not but think my self engaged:
   for, though we have no power to redress the former, yet in the other
   the reparation being within our selves, I have at present represented
   unto the world a full and intended Copy of that Piece, which was most
   imperfectly and surreptitiously published before.

   [Footnote 1: Not in accordance.]

   This, I confess, about seven years past, with some others of affinity
   thereto, for my private exercise and satisfaction, I had at leisurable
   hours composed; which being communicated unto one, it became common
   unto many, and was by Transcription successively corrupted, untill it
   arrived in a most depraved Copy at the Press. He that shall peruse that
   work, and shall take notice of sundry particularities and personal
   expressions therein, will easily discern the intention was not publick;
   and, being a private Exercise directed to my self, what is delivered
   therein, was rather a memorial unto me, than an Example or Rule unto
   any other; and therefore, if there be any singularity therein
   correspondent unto the private conceptions of any man, it doth not
   advantage them; or if dissentaneous1 thereunto, it no way overthrows
   them. It was penned in such a place, and with such disadvantage, that,
   (I protest,) from the first setting of pen unto paper, I had not the
   assistance of any good Book whereby to promote my invention or relieve
   my memory; and therefore there might be many real lapses therein, which
   others might take notice of, and more that I suspected my self. It was
   set down many years past, and was the sense of my conceptions at that
   time, not an immutable Law unto my advancing judgement at all times;
   and therefore there might be many things therein plausible unto my
   passed apprehension, which are not agreeable unto my present self.
   There are many things delivered Rhetorically, many expressions therein
   meerly Tropical, and as they best illustrate my intention; and
   therefore also there are many things to be taken in a soft and flexible
   sense, and not to be called unto the rigid test of Reason. Lastly, all
   that is contained therein is in submission unto maturer discernments;
   and, as I have declared, shall no further father them than the best and
   learned judgments shall authorize them: under favour of which
   considerations I have made its secrecy publick, and committed the truth
   thereof to every Ingenuous Reader.

   Tho. Browne.

Section I.

   For my Religion, though there be several Circumstances that might
   perswade the World I have none at all, (as the general scandal of my
   Profession, [1] the natural course of my Studies, the indifferency of
   my Behaviour and Discourse in matters of Religion, neither violently
   Defending one, nor with that common ardour and contention Opposing
   another;) yet, in despight hereof, I dare without usurpation assume the
   honourable Stile of a Christian. Not that I meerly owe this Title to
   the Font, my Education, or the clime wherein I was born, (as being bred
   up either to confirm those Principles my Parents instilled into my
   unwary Understanding, or by a general consent proceed in the Religion
   of my Country;) but having in my riper years and confirmed Judgment
   seen and examined all, I find my self obliged by the Principles of
   Grace, and the Law of mine own Reason, to embrace no other Name but
   this. Neither doth herein my zeal so far make me forget the general
   Charity I owe unto Humanity, as rather to hate than pity Turks,
   Infidels, and (what is worse,) Jews; rather contenting my self to enjoy
   that happy Stile, than maligning those who refuse so glorious a Title.

   II. But, because the Name of a Christian is become too general to
   express our Faith, (there being a Geography or Religions as well as
   Lands, and every Clime distinguished not only by their Laws and Limits,
   but circumscribed by their Doctrines and Rules of Faith;) to be
   particular, I am of that Reformed new-cast Religion, wherein I dislike
   nothing but the Name; of the same belief our Saviour taught, the
   Apostles disseminated, the Fathers authorized, and the Martyrs
   confirmed; but by the sinister ends of Princes, the ambition and
   avarice of Prelates, and the fatal corruption of times, so decayed,
   impaired, and fallen from its native Beauty, that it required the
   careful and charitable hands of these times to restore it to its
   primitive Integrity. Now the accidental occasion whereupon, the slender
   means whereby, the low and abject condition of the Person [2] by whom
   so good a work was set on foot, which in our Adversaries beget contempt
   and scorn, fills me with wonder, and is the very same Objection the
   insolent Pagans first cast at Christ and His Disciples.

   III. Yet have I not so shaken hands with those desperate Resolutions,
   [3] (who had rather venture at large their decayed bottom, than bring
   her in to be new trimm'd in the Dock; who had rather promiscuously
   retain all, than abridge any, and obstinately be what they are, than
   what they have been,) as to stand in Diameter [4] and Swords point with
   them. We have reformed from them, not against them; for (omitting those
   Improperations [5] and Terms of Scurrility betwixt us, which only
   difference our Affections, and not our Cause,) there is between us one
   common Name and Appellation, one Faith and necessary body of Principles
   common to us both; and therefore I am not scrupulous to converse and
   live with them, to enter their Churches in defect of ours, and either
   pray with them, or for them. I could never perceive any rational
   Consequence from those many Texts which prohibit the Children of Israel
   to pollute themselves with the Temples of the Heathens; we being all
   Christians, and not divided by such detested impieties as might
   prophane our Prayers, or the place wherein we make them; or that a
   resolved Conscience may not adore her Creator any where, especially in
   places devoted to His Service; where, if their Devotions offend Him,
   mine may please Him; if theirs prophane it, mine may hallow it.
   Holy-water and Crucifix (dangerous to common people,) deceive not my
   judgment, nor abuse my devotion at all. I am, I confess, naturally
   inclined to that which misguided Zeal terms Superstition. My common
   conversation [6] I do acknowledge austere, my behaviour full of rigour,
   sometimes not without morosity; yet at my Devotion I love to use the
   civility of my knee, my hat, and hand, with all those outward and
   sensible motions which may express or promote my invisible Devotion. I
   should violate my own arm rather than a Church; nor willingly deface
   the name of Saint or Martyr. At the sight of a Cross or Crucifix I can
   dispense with my hat, but scarce with the thought or memory of my
   Saviour. I cannot laugh at, but rather pity, the fruitless journeys of
   Pilgrims, or contemn the miserable condition of Fryars; for, though
   misplaced in Circumstances, there is something in it of Devotion. I
   could never hear the Ave-Mary Bell without an elevation; or think it a
   sufficient warrant, because they erred in one circumstance, for me to
   err in all, that is, in silence and dumb contempt. Whilst, therefore,
   they directed their Devotions to Her, I offered mine to God, and
   rectified the Errors of their Prayers by rightly ordering mine own. At
   a solemn Procession I have wept abundantly, while my consorts, blind
   with opposition and prejudice, have fallen into an excess of scorn and
   laughter. There are, questionless, both in Greek, Roman, and African
   Churches, Solemnities and Ceremonies, whereof the wiser Zeals do make a
   Christian use, and stand condemned by us, not as evil in themselves,
   but as allurements and baits of superstition to those vulgar heads that
   look asquint on the face of Truth, and those unstable Judgments that
   cannot consist in the narrow point and centre of Virtue without a reel
   or stagger to the Circumference.

   IV. As there were many Reformers, so likewise many Reformations; every
   Country proceeding in a particular way and method, according as their
   national Interest, together with their Constitution and Clime, inclined
   them; some angrily, and with extremity; others calmly, and with
   mediocrity; not rending, but easily dividing the community, and leaving
   an honest possibility of a reconciliation; which though peaceable
   Spirits do desire, and may conceive that revolution of time and the
   mercies of God may effect, yet that judgment that shall consider the
   present antipathies between the two extreams, their contrarieties in
   condition, affection, and opinion, may with the same hopes expect an
   union in the Poles of Heaven.

   V. But (to difference my self nearer, and draw into a lesser Circle,)
   there is no Church whose every part so squares unto my Conscience;
   whose Articles, Constitutions, and Customs seem so consonant unto
   reason, and as it were framed to my particular Devotion, as this
   whereof I hold my Belief, the Church of England; to whose Faith I am a
   sworn Subject, and therefore in a double Obligation subscribe unto her
   Articles, and endeavour to observe her Constitutions. Whatsoever is
   beyond, as points indifferent, I observe according to the rules of my
   private reason, or the humor and fashion of my Devotion; neither
   believing this, because Luther affirmed it, or disproving that, because
   Calvin hath disavouched it. I condemn not all things in the Council of
   Trent, nor approve all in the Synod of Dort. In brief, where the
   Scripture is silent, the Church is my Text; where that speaks, tis but
   my Comment: where there is a joynt silence of both, I borrow not the
   rules of my Religion from Rome or Geneva, but the dictates of my own
   reason. It is an unjust scandal of our adversaries, and a gross errour
   in our selves, to compute the Nativity of our Religion from Henry the
   Eighth, who, though he rejected the Pope, refus'd not the faith of
   Rome, and effected no more than what his own Predecessors desired and
   assayed in Ages past, and was conceived the State of Venice would have
   attempted in our days. It is as uncharitable a point in us to fall upon
   those popular scurrilities and opprobrious scoffs of the Bishop of
   Rome, to whom, as a temporal Prince, we owe the duty of good language.
   I confess there is cause of passion between us: by his sentence I stand
   excommunicated; Heretick is the best language he affords me; yet can no
   ear witness I ever returned him the name of Antichrist, Man of Sin, or
   Whore of Babylon. It is the method of Charity to suffer without
   reaction: those usual Satyrs and invectives of the Pulpit may perchance
   produce a good effect on the vulgar, whose ears are opener to Rhetorick
   than Logick; yet do they in no wise confirm the faith of wiser
   Believers, who know that a good cause needs not to be patron'd by
   passion, but can sustain itself upon a temperate dispute.

   VI. I could never divide myself from any man upon the difference of an
   opinion, or be angry with his judgment for not agreeing with me in that
   from which perhaps within a few days I should dissent my self. I have
   no Genius to disputes in Religion, and have often thought it wisdom to
   decline them, especially upon a disadvantage, or when the cause of
   Truth might suffer in the weakness of my patronage. Where we desire to
   be informed, tis good to contest with men above our selves; but to
   confirm and establish our opinions, tis best to argue with judgments
   below our own, that the frequent spoils and Victories over their
   reasons may settle in ourselves an esteem and confirmed Opinion of our
   own. Every man is not a proper Champion for Truth, nor fit to take up
   the Gauntlet in the cause of Verity: many from the ignorance of these
   Maximes, and an inconsiderate Zeal unto Truth, have too rashly charged
   the Troops of Error, and remain as Trophies unto the enemies of Truth.
   A man may be in as just possession of Truth as of a City, and yet be
   forced to surrender; tis therefore far better to enjoy her with peace,
   than to hazzard her on a battle. If, therefore, there rise any doubts
   in my way, I do forget them, or at least defer them till my better
   setled judgement and more manly reason be able to resolve them; for I
   perceive every man's own reason is his best Oedipus, and will, upon a
   reasonable truce, find a way to loose those bonds wherewith the
   subtleties of error have enchained our more flexible and tender
   judgements. In Philosophy, where Truth seems double-fac'd, there is no
   man more Paradoxical than my self: but in Divinity I love to keep the
   Road; and, though not in an implicite, yet an humble faith, follow the
   great wheel of the Church, by which I move, not reserving any proper
   Poles or motion from the Epicycle [7] of my own brain. By this means I
   leave no gap for Heresies, Schismes, or Errors, of which at present I
   hope I shall not injure Truth to say I have no taint or tincture. I
   must confess my greener studies have been polluted with two or three;
   not any begotten in the latter Centuries, but old and obsolete, such as
   could never have been revived, but by such extravagant and irregular
   heads as mine: for indeed Heresies perish not with their Authors, but,
   like the river Arethusa, though they lose their currents in one place,
   they rise up again in another. One General Council is not able to
   extirpate one single Heresie: it may be cancell'd for the present; but
   revolution of time, and the like aspects from Heaven, will restore it,
   when it will flourish till it be condemned again. For as though there
   were a Metempsuchosis, and the soul of one man passed into another,
   Opinions do find, after certain Revolutions, men and minds like those
   that first begat them. To see our selves again, we need not look for
   Plato's year: [8] every man is not only himself; there hath been many
   Diogenes, and as many Timons, though but few of that name: men are
   liv'd over again, the world is now as it was in Ages past; there was
   none then, but there hath been some one since that parallels him, and
   is, as it were, his revived self.

   VII. Now the first of mine was that of the Arabians, That the Souls of
   men perished with their Bodies, but should yet be raised again at the
   last day. Not that I did absolutely conceive a mortality of the Soul;
   but if that were, (which Faith, not Philosophy, hath yet throughly
   disproved,) and that both entred the grave together, yet I held the
   same conceit thereof that we all do of the body, that it should rise
   again. Surely it is but the merits of our unworthy Natures, if we sleep
   in darkness until the last Alarum. A serious reflex upon my own
   unworthiness did make me backward from challenging this prerogative of
   my Soul: so that I might enjoy my Saviour at the last, I could with
   patience be nothing almost unto Eternity.

   The second was that of Origen, That God would not persist in His
   vengeance for ever, but after a definite time of His wrath, He would
   release the damned Souls from torture. Which error I fell into upon a
   serious contemplation of the great Attribute of God, His Mercy; and did
   a little cherish it in my self, because I found therein no malice, and
   a ready weight to sway me from the other extream of despair, whereunto
   Melancholy and Contemplative Natures are too easily disposed.

   A third there is, which I did never positively maintain or practise,
   but have often wished it had been consonant to Truth, and not offensive
   to my Religion, and that is, the Prayer for the Dead; whereunto I was
   inclin'd from some charitable inducements, whereby I could scarce
   contain my Prayers for a friend at the ringing of a Bell, or behold his
   Corps without an Orison for his Soul. Twas a good way, methought, to be
   remembered by posterity, and far more noble than an History.

   These opinions I never maintained with pertinacy, or endeavoured to
   enveagle any mans belief unto mine, nor so much as ever revealed or
   disputed them with my dearest friends; by which means I neither
   propagated them in others, nor confirmed them in my self; but suffering
   them to flame upon their own substance, without addition of new fuel,
   they went out insensibly of themselves. Therefore these Opinions,
   though condemned by lawful Councels, were not Heresies in me, but bare
   Errors, and single Lapses of my understanding, without a joynt
   depravity of my will. Those have not onely depraved understandings, but
   diseased affections, which cannot enjoy a singularity without an
   Heresie, or be the Author of an Opinion without they be of a Sect also.
   This was the villany of the first Schism of Lucifer, who was not
   content to err alone, but drew into his Faction many Legions of
   Spirits; and upon this experience he tempted only Eve, as well
   understanding the Communicable nature of Sin, and that to deceive but
   one, was tacitely and upon consequence to delude them both.

   VIII. That Heresies should arise, we have the Prophesie of Christ; but
   that old ones should be abolished, we hold no prediction. That there
   must be Heresies, is true, not only in our Church, but also in any
   other: even in doctrines heretical, there will be super-heresies; and
   Arians not only divided from their Church, but also among themselves.
   For heads that are disposed unto Schism and complexionally propense [9]
   to innovation, are naturally indisposed for a community, nor will be
   ever confined unto the order or oeconomy of one body; and therefore,
   when they separate from others, they knit but loosely among themselves;
   nor contented with a general breach or dichotomy with their Church do
   subdivide and mince themselves almost into Atoms. Tis true, that men of
   singular parts and humours have not been free from singular opinions
   and conceits in all Ages; retaining something, not only beside the
   opinion of his own Church or any other, but also any particular Author;
   which, notwithstanding, a sober Judgment may do without offence or
   heresie; for there is yet, after all the Decrees of Councils and the
   niceties of the Schools, many things untouch'd, unimagin'd, wherein the
   liberty of an honest reason may play and expatiate with security, and
   far without the circle of an Heresie.

   IX. As for those wingy Mysteries in Divinity, and airy subtleties in
   Religion, which have unhing'd the brains of better heads, they never
   stretched the Pia Mater [10] of mine. Methinks there be not
   impossibilities enough in Religion for an active faith; the deepest
   Mysteries ours contains have not only been illustrated, but maintained,
   by Syllogism and the rule of Reason. I love to lose my self in a
   mystery, to pursue my Reason to an O altitudo! Tis my solitary
   recreation to pose my apprehension with those involved Aenigmas and
   riddles of the Trinity, with Incarnation, and Resurrection. I can
   answer all the Objections of Satan and my rebellious reason with that
   odd resolution I learned of Tertullian, Certum est, quia impossibile
   est. I desire to exercise my faith in the difficultest point; for to
   credit ordinary and visible objects is not faith, but perswasion. Some
   believe the better for seeing Christ's Sepulchre; and, when they have
   seen the Red Sea, doubt not of the Miracle. Now, contrarily, I bless my
   self and am thankful that I lived not in the days of Miracles, that I
   never saw Christ nor His Disciples. I would not have been one of those
   Israelites that pass'd the Red Sea, nor one of Christ's patients on
   whom He wrought His wonders; then had my faith been thrust upon me, nor
   should I enjoy that greater blessing pronounced to all that believe and
   saw not. Tis an easie and necessary belief, to credit what our eye and
   sense hath examined. I believe He was dead, and buried, and rose again;
   and desire to see Him in His glory, rather than to contemplate Him in
   His Cenotaphe or Sepulchre. Nor is this much to believe; as we have
   reason, we owe this faith unto History: they only had the advantage of
   a bold and noble Faith, who lived before His coming, who upon obscure
   prophesies and mystical Types could raise a belief, and expect apparent
   impossibilities.

   X. Tis true, there is an edge in all firm belief, and with an easie
   Metaphor we may say, the Sword of Faith; but in these obscurities I
   rather use it in the adjunct the Apostle gives it, a Buckler; under
   which I conceive a wary combatant may lye invulnerable. Since I was of
   understanding to know we knew nothing, my reason hath been more pliable
   to the will of Faith; I am now content to understand a mystery without
   a rigid definition, in an easier and Platonick description. That
   allegorical description of Hermes [11] pleaseth me beyond all the
   Metaphysical definitions of Divines. Where I cannot satisfy my reason,
   I love to humour my fancy: I had as live you tell me that anima est
   angelus hominis, est Corpus Dei, [the soul is man's angel, God's body]
   as Entelechia; [12] --Lux est umbra Dei, [Light is God's shadow] as
   actus perspicui. [13] Where there is an obscurity too deep for our
   Reason, tis good to sit down with a description, periphrasis, or
   adumbration; for by acquainting our Reason how unable it is to display
   the visible and obvious effects of Nature, it becomes more humble and
   submissive unto the subtleties of Faith; and thus I teach my haggard
   [14] and unreclaimed Reason to stoop unto the lure of Faith. I believe
   there was already a tree whose fruit our unhappy Parents tasted,
   though, in the same Chapter when God forbids it, tis positively said,
   the plants of the field were not yet grown, for God had not caus'd it
   to rain upon the earth. I believe that the Serpent, (if we shall
   literally understand it,) from his proper form and figure, made his
   motion on his belly before the curse. I find the tryal of the Pucellage
   and virginity of Women, which God ordained the Jews, is very fallible.
   Experience and History informs me, that not onely many particular
   Women, but likewise whole Nations, have escaped the curse of
   Childbirth, which God seems to pronounce upon the whole Sex. Yet I do
   believe that all this is true, which indeed my Reason would perswade me
   to be false; and this I think is no vulgar part of Faith, to believe a
   thing not only above but contrary to Reason, and against the Arguments
   of our proper Senses.

   XI. In my solitary and retired imagination

   (neque enim cum porticus aut me Lectulus accepit, desum mihi,)

   [for when porch or bed has received me, I do not lose myself]

   I remember I am not alone, and therefore forget not to contemplate Him
   and His Attributes Who is ever with me, especially those two mighty
   ones, His Wisdom and Eternity. With the one I recreate, with the other
   I confound, my understanding; for who can speak of Eternity without a
   soloecism, or think thereof without an Extasie? Time we may comprehend;
   tis but five days elder then our selves, and hath the same Horoscope
   with the World; but to retire so far back as to apprehend a beginning,
   to give such an infinite start forwards as to conceive an end, in an
   essence that we affirm hath neither the one nor the other, it puts my
   Reason to St. Paul's Sanctuary. [15] My Philosophy dares not say the
   Angels can do it. God hath not made a Creature that can comprehend Him;
   tis a privilege of His own nature. I am that I am, was His own
   definition unto Moses; and twas a short one, to confound mortality,
   that durst question God, or ask Him what He was. Indeed, He onely is;
   all others have and shall be. But in Eternity there is no distinction
   of Tenses; and therefore that terrible term Predestination, which hath
   troubled so many weak heads to conceive, and the wisest to explain, is
   in respect to God no prescious [16] determination of our Estates to
   come, but a definitive blast of His Will already fulfilled, and at the
   instant that He first decreed it; for to His Eternity, which is
   indivisible and all together, the last Trump is already sounded, the
   reprobates in the flame, and the blessed in Abraham's bosome. St. Peter
   speaks modestly, [17] when he saith, a thousand years to God are but as
   one day; for, to speak like a Philosopher, those continued instances of
   time which flow into a thousand years, make not to Him one moment: what
   to us is to come, to His Eternity is present, His whole duration being
   but one permanent point, without Sucession, Parts, Flux, or Division.

   XII. There is no Attribute that adds more difficulty to the mystery of
   the Trinity, where, though in a relative way of Father and Son, we must
   deny a priority. I wonder how Aristotle could conceive the World
   eternal, or how he could make good two Eternities. His similitude of a
   Triangle comprehended in a square doth somewhat illustrate the Trinity
   of our Souls, and that the Triple Unity of God; for there is in us not
   three, but a Trinity of Souls; because there is in us, if not three
   distinct Souls, yet differing faculties, that can and do subsist apart
   in different Subjects, and yet in us are so united as to make but one
   Soul and substance.

   If one Soul were so perfect as to inform three distinct Bodies, that
   were a petty Trinity: conceive the distinct number of three, not
   divided nor separated by the intellect, but actually comprehended in
   its Unity, and that is a perfect Trinity. I have often admired the
   mystical way of Pythagoras, and the secret Magick of numbers. Beware of
   Philosophy, is a precept not to be received in too large a sense; for
   in this Mass of Nature there is a set of things that carry in their
   Front (though not in Capital Letters, yet in Stenography and short
   Characters,) something of Divinity, which to wiser Reasons serve as
   Luminaries in the Abyss of Knowledge, and to judicious beliefs as
   Scales [18] and Roundles [19] to mount the Pinacles and highest pieces
   of Divinity. The severe Schools shall never laugh me out of the
   Philosophy of Hermes, that this visible World is but a Picture of the
   invisible wherein, as in a Pourtraict, things are not truely, but in
   equivocal shapes, and as they counterfeit some more real substance in
   that invisible fabrick.

   XIII. That other Attribute wherewith I recreate my devotion, is His
   Wisdom, in which I am happy; and for the contemplation of this only, do
   not repent me that I was bred in the way of Study: the advantage I have
   of the vulgar, with the content and happiness I conceive therein, is an
   ample recompence for all my endeavours, in what part of knowledge
   soever. Wisdom is His most beauteous Attribute; no man can attain unto
   it, yet Solomon pleased God when he desired it. He is wise, because He
   knows all things; and He knoweth all things, because He made them all;
   but His greatest knowledge is in comprehending that He made not, that
   is, Himself. And this is also the greatest knowledge in man. For this
   do I honour my own profession, and embrace the Counsel even of the
   Devil himself: had he read such a Lecture in Paradise as he did at
   Delphos, [20] we had better known our selves, nor had we stood in fear
   to know him. I know He is wise in all, wonderful in what we conceive,
   but far more in what we comprehend not; for we behold Him but asquint,
   upon reflex or shadow; our understanding is dimmer than Moses Eye; we
   are ignorant of the back-parts or lower side of His Divinity; therefore
   to prie into the maze of His Counsels is not only folly in man, but
   presumption even in Angels. Like us, they are His Servants, not His
   Senators; He holds no Counsel, but that mystical one of the Trinity,
   wherein, though there be three Persons, there is but one mind that
   decrees without contradiction. Nor needs He any: His actions are not
   begot with deliberation, His Wisdom naturally knows what's best; His
   intellect stands ready fraught with the superlative and purest Ideas of
   goodness; consultation and election, which are two motions in us, make
   but one in Him, His actions springing from His power at the first touch
   of His will. These are Contemplations metaphysical: my humble
   speculations have another Method, and are content to trace and discover
   those expressions He hath left in His Creatures, and the obvious
   effects of Nature. There is no danger to profound [21] these mysteries,
   no sanctum sanctorum in Philosophy. The World was made to be inhabited
   by Beasts, but studied and contemplated by Man: tis the Debt of our
   Reason we owe unto God, and the homage we pay for not being Beasts.
   Without this, the World is still as though it had not been, or as it
   was before the sixth day, when as yet there was not a Creature that
   could conceive or say there was a World. The Wisdom of God receives
   small honour from those vulgar Heads that rudely stare about, and with
   a gross rusticity admire His works: those highly magnifie Him, whose
   judicious inquiry into His Acts, and deliberate research into His
   Creatures, return the duty of a devout and learned admiration.
   Therefore,

   Search while thou wilt, and let thy Reason go, To ransome Truth, even
   to th' Abyss below; Rally the scattered Causes; and that line, Which
   Nature twists, be able to untwine. It is thy Makers will, for unto none
   But unto Reason can He e're be known. The Devils do know Thee, but
   those damned Meteors Build not Thy Glory, but confound Thy Creatures.
   Teach my indeavours so Thy works to read, That learning them in Thee, I
   may proceed. Give Thou my reason that instructive flight,

   Whose weary wings may on Thy hands still light. Teach me to soar aloft,
   yet ever so, When neer the Sun, to stoop again below. Thus shall my
   humble Feathers safely hover, And, though near Earth, more than the
   Heavens discover. And then at last, when homeward I shall drive, Rich
   with the Spoils of Nature, to my Hive, There will I sit like that
   industrious Flie, Buzzing Thy praises, which shall never die, Till
   Death abrupts them, and succeeding Glory Bid me go on in a more lasting
   story.

   And this is almost all wherein an humble Creature may endeavour to
   requite and some way to retribute [22] unto his Creator: for if not he
   that saith, "Lord, Lord," but he that doth the will of his Father,
   shall be saved; certainly our wills must be our performances, and our
   intents make out our Actions; otherwise our pious labours shall find
   anxiety in our Graves, and our best endeavours not hope, but fear, a
   resurrection.

Section II.

   XIV. There is but one first cause, and four second causes of all
   things. Some are without efficient, as God; others without matter, as
   Angels; some without form, as the first matter: but every Essence,
   created or uncreated, hath its final cause, and some positive end both
   of its Essence and Operation. This is the cause I grope after in the
   works of Nature; on this hangs the Providence of God. To raise so
   beauteous a structure as the World and the Creatures thereof, was but
   His Art; but their sundry and divided operations, with their
   predestinated ends, are from the Treasure of His Wisdom. In the causes,
   nature, and affections [23] of the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, there
   is most excellent speculation; but to profound [24] farther, and to
   contemplate a reason why His Providence hath so disposed and ordered
   their motions in that vast circle as to conjoyn and obscure each other,
   is a sweeter piece of Reason, and a diviner point of Philosophy.
   Therefore sometimes, and in some things, there appears to me as much
   Divinity in Galen his books De Usu Partium, as in Suarez Metaphysicks.
   Had Aristotle been as curious in the enquiry of this cause as he was of
   the other, he had not left behind him an imperfect piece of Philosophy,
   but an absolute tract of Divinity.

   XV. Natura nihil agit frustra, [Nature does nothing in vain] is the
   only indisputed Axiome in Philosophy. There are no Grotesques in
   Nature; not anything framed to fill up empty Cantons, [25] and
   unnecessary spaces. In the most imperfect Creatures, and such as were
   not preserved in the Ark, but, having their Seeds and Principles in the
   womb of Nature, are every where, where the power of the Sun is, in
   these is the Wisdom of His hand discovered. Out of this rank Solomon
   chose the object of his admiration. Indeed what Reason may not go to
   School to the Wisdom of Bees, Ants, and Spiders? what wise hand
   teacheth them to do what Reason cannot teach us? Ruder heads stand
   amazed at those prodigious pieces of Nature, Whales, Elephants,
   Dromidaries and Camels; these, I confess, are the Colossus and
   majestick pieces of her hand: but in these narrow Engines there is more
   curious Mathematicks; and the civility of these little Citizens more
   neatly sets forth Wisdom of their Maker. Who admires not Regio-Montanus
   [26] his Fly beyond his Eagle, or wonders not more at the operation of
   two Souls [27] in those little Bodies, than but one in the Trunk of a
   Cedar? I could never content my contemplations with those general
   pieces of wonder, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, the increase of Nile,
   the conversion of the Needle to the North; and have studied to match
   and parallel those in the more obvious and neglected pieces of Nature,
   which without further travel I can do in the Cosmography of myself. We
   carry with us the wonders we seek without us: there is all Africa and
   her prodigies in us; we are that bold and adventurous piece of Nature,
   which he that studies wisely learns in a compendium what others labour
   at in a divided piece and endless volume.

   XVI. Thus there are two Books from whence I collect my Divinity;
   besides that written one of God, another of His servant Nature, that
   universal and publick Manuscript, that lies expans'd unto the Eyes of
   all: those that never saw Him in the one, have discovered Him in the
   other. This was the Scripture and Theology of the Heathens: the natural
   motion of the Sun made them more admire Him than its supernatural
   station did the Children of Israel; the ordinary effects of Nature
   wrought more admiration in them than in the other all His Miracles.
   Surely the Heathens knew better how to joyn and read these mystical
   Letters than we Christians, who cast a more careless Eye on these
   common Hieroglyphicks, and disdain to suck Divinity from the flowers of
   Nature. Nor do I so forget God as to adore the name of Nature; which I
   define not, with the Schools, to be the principle of motion and rest,
   but that straight and regular line, that settled and constant course
   the Wisdom of God hath ordained the actions of His creatures, according
   to their several kinds. To make a revolution every day is the Nature of
   the Sun, because of that necessary course which God hath ordained it,
   from which it cannot swerve but by a faculty from that voice which
   first did give it motion. Now this course of Nature God seldom alters
   or perverts, but, like an excellent Artist, hath so contrived His work,
   that with the self same instrument, without a new creation, He may
   effect His obscurest designs. Thus He sweetneth the Water with a Wood,
   [28] preserveth the Creatures in the Ark, which the blast of His mouth
   might have as easily created; for God is like a skilful Geometrician,
   who, when more easily and with one stroak of his Compass he might
   describe or divide a right line, had yet rather do this in a circle or
   longer way, according to the constituted and forelaid principles of his
   Art. Yet this rule of His He doth sometimes pervert, to acquaint the
   World with His Prerogative, lest the arrogancy of our reason should
   question His power, and conclude He could not. And thus I call the
   effects of Nature the works of God, Whose hand and instrument she only
   is; and therefore to ascribe His actions unto her, is to devolve the
   honour of the principal agent upon the instrument; which if with reason
   we may do, then let our hammers rise up and boast they have built our
   houses, and our pens receive the honour of our writings. I hold there
   is a general beauty in the works of God, and therefore no deformity in
   any kind or species of creature whatsoever. I cannot tell by what
   Logick we call a Toad, a Bear, or an Elephant ugly; they being created
   in those outward shapes and figures which best express the actions of
   their inward forms, and having past that general Visitation [29] of
   God, Who saw that all that He had made was good, that is, conformable
   to His Will, which abhors deformity, and is the rule of order and
   beauty. There is no deformity but in Monstrosity; wherein,
   notwithstanding, there is a kind of Beauty; Nature so ingeniously
   contriving the irregular parts, as they become sometimes more
   remarkable than the principal Fabrick. To speak yet more narrowly,
   there was never any thing ugly or mis-shapen, but the Chaos; wherein,
   notwithstanding, (to speak strictly,) there was no deformity, because
   no form; nor was it yet impregnant by the voice of God. Now Nature is
   not at variance with Art, nor Art with Nature, they being both servants
   of His Providence. Art is the perfection of Nature. Were the World now
   as it was the sixth day, there were yet a Chaos. Nature hath made one
   World, and Art another. In brief, all things are artificial; for Nature
   is the Art of God.

   XVII. This is the ordinary and open way of His Providence, which Art
   and Industry have in a good part discovered; whose effects we may
   foretell without an Oracle: to foreshew these, is not Prophesie, but
   Prognostication. There is another way, full of Meanders and Labyrinths,
   whereof the Devil and Spirits have no exact Ephemerides; [30] and that
   is a more particular and obscure method of His Providence, directing
   the operations of individuals and single Essences: this we call
   Fortune, that serpentine and crooked line, whereby He draws those
   actions His Wisdom intends, in a more unknown and secret way. This
   cryptick and involved method of His Providence have I ever admired; nor
   can I relate the History of my life, the occurrences of my days, the
   escapes of dangers, and hits of chance, with a Bezo las Manos [31] to
   Fortune, or a bare Gramercy to my good Stars. Abraham might have
   thought the Ram in the thicket came thither by accident; humane [32]
   reason would have said that meer chance conveyed Moses in the Ark to
   the sight of Pharaoh's Daughter: what a Labyrinth is there in the story
   of Joseph, able to convert a Stoick! Surely there are in every man's
   Life certain rubs, doublings, and wrenches, which pass a while under
   the effects of chance, but at the last, well examined, prove the meer
   hand of God. Twas not dumb chance, that, to discover the Fougade or
   Powder-plot, contrived a miscarriage in the Letter. [33] I like the
   Victory of 88 the better for that one occurrence, which our enemies
   imputed to our dishonour and the partiality of Fortune, to wit, the
   tempests and contrariety of Winds. King Philip did not detract from the
   Nation, when he said, he sent his Armado to fight with men, and not to
   combate with the Winds. Where there is a manifest disproportion between
   the powers and forces of two several agents, upon a Maxime of reason we
   may promise the Victory to the Superiour; but when unexpected accidents
   slip in, and unthought of occurrences intervene, these must proceed
   from a power that owes no obedience to those Axioms; where, as in the
   writing upon the wall, we may behold the hand, but see not the spring
   that moves it. The success of that petty Province of Holland (of which
   the Grand Seignour [34] proudly said, if they should trouble him as
   they did the Spaniard, he would send his men with shovels and
   pick-axes, and throw it into the Sea,) I cannot altogether ascribe to
   the ingenuity and industry of the people, but the mercy of God, that
   hath disposed them to such a thriving Genius; and to the will of His
   Providence, that disposeth her favour to each Country in their
   pre-ordinate season. All cannot be happy at once; for, because the
   glory of one State depends upon the ruine of another, there is a
   revolution and vicissitude of their greatness, and must obey the swing
   of that wheel, not moved by Intelligences, but by the hand of God,
   whereby all Estates arise to their Zenith and Vertical points according
   to their predestinated periods. For the lives, not only of men, but of
   Commonwealths, and the whole World, run not upon an Helix, [35] that
   still enlargeth, but on a Circle, where, arriving to their Meridian,
   they decline in obscurity, and fall under the Horizon again.

   XVIII. These must not therefore be named the effects of Fortune, but in
   a relative way, and as we term the works of Nature. It was the
   ignorance of mans reason that begat this very name, and by a careless
   term miscalled the Providence of God; for there is no liberty for
   causes to operate in a loose and stragling way; nor any effect
   whatsoever, but hath its warrant from some universal or superiour
   Cause. Tis not a ridiculous devotion to say a prayer before a game at
   Tables; for even in sortilegies [36] and matters of greatest
   uncertainty there is a setled and preordered course of effects. It is
   we that are blind, not Fortune: because our Eye is too dim to discover
   the mystery of her effects, we foolishly paint her blind, and hoodwink
   the Providence of the Almighty. I cannot justify that contemptible
   Proverb, That fools only are Fortunate, or that insolent Paradox, That
   a wise man is out of the reach of Fortune; much less those opprobrious
   epithets of Poets, Whore, Bawd, and Strumpet. Tis, I confess, the
   common fate of men of singular gifts of mind to be destitute of those
   of Fortune, which doth not any way deject the Spirit of wiser
   judgements, who throughly understand the justice of this proceeding;
   and being enriched with higher donatives, [37] cast a more careless eye
   on these vulgar parts of felicity. It is a most unjust ambition to
   desire to engross the mercies of the Almighty, not to be content with
   the goods of mind, without a possession of those of body or Fortune;
   and it is an error worse than heresie, to adore these complemental and
   circumstantial pieces of felicity, and undervalue those perfections and
   essential points of happiness wherein we resemble our Maker. To wiser
   desires it is satisfaction enough to deserve, though not to enjoy, the
   favours of Fortune: let Providence provide for Fools. Tis not
   partiality, but equity in God, Who deals with us but as our natural
   Parents: those that are able of Body and Mind He leaves to their
   deserts; to those of weaker merits He imparts a larger portion, and
   pieces out the defect of one by the excess of the other. Thus have we
   no just quarrel with Nature for leaving us naked; or to envy the Horns,
   Hoofs, Skins, and Furs of other Creatures, being provided with Reason,
   that can supply them all. We need not labour with so many Arguments to
   confute Judicial Astrology; for, if there be a truth therein, it doth
   not injure Divinity. If to be born under Mercury disposeth us to be
   witty, under Jupiter to be wealthy; I do not owe a Knee unto these, but
   unto that merciful Hand that hath ordered my indifferent and uncertain
   nativity unto such benevolous Aspects. Those that hold that all things
   are governed by Fortune, had not erred, had they not persisted [38]
   there. The Romans, that erected a Temple to Fortune, acknowledged
   therein, though in a blinder way, somewhat of Divinity; for, in a wise
   supputation, [39] all things begin and end in the Almighty. There is a
   nearer way to Heaven than Homer's Chain; [40] an easie Logic may
   conjoyn Heaven and Earth in one Argument, and with less than a Sorites,
   [41] resolve all things into God. For though we christen effects by
   their most sensible [42] and nearest Causes, yet is God the true and
   infallible Cause of all; whose concourse, [43] though it be general,
   yet doth it subdivide it self into the particular Actions of every
   thing, and is that Spirit, by which each singular Essence not only
   subsists, but performs its operation.

   XIX. The bad construction and perverse comment on these pair of second
   Causes, or visible hands of God, have perverted the Devotion of many
   unto Atheism; who, forgetting the honest Advisoes [44] of Faith, have
   listened unto the conspiracy of Passion and Reason. I have therefore
   always endeavoured to compose those Feuds and angry Dissentions between
   Affection, Faith, and Reason; for there is in our Soul a kind of
   Triumvirate, or triple Government of three Competitors, which distract
   the Peace of this our Commonwealth, not less than did that other the
   State of Rome.

   As Reason is a Rebel unto Faith, so Passion unto Reason: as the
   propositions of Faith seem absurd unto Reason, so the Theorems of
   Reason unto Passion, and both unto Faith. Yet a moderate and peaceable
   discretion may so state and order the matter, that they may be all
   Kings, and yet make but one Monarchy, every one exercising his
   Soveraignty and Prerogative in a due time and place, according to the
   restraint and limit of circumstance. There is, as in Philosophy, so in
   Divinity, sturdy doubts and boisterous Objections, wherewith the
   unhappiness of our knowledge too nearly acquainteth us. More of these
   no man hath known than myself, which I confess I conquered, not in a
   martial posture, but on my Knees. For our endeavours are not only to
   combat with doubts, but always to dispute with the Devil. The villany
   of that Spirit takes a hint of Infidelity from our Studies, and, by
   demonstrating a naturality in one way, makes us mistrust a miracle in
   another. Thus, having perused the Archidoxis [45] and read the secret
   Sympathies of things, he would disswade my belief from the miracle of
   the Brazen Serpent, make me conceit that Image worked by Sympathy, and
   was but an Aegyptian trick to cure their Diseases without a miracle.
   Again, having seen some experiments of Bitumen, and having read far
   more of Naphtha, he whispered to my curiosity the fire of the Altar
   might be natural; and bid me mistrust a miracle in Elias, when he
   entrenched the Altar round with Water; for that inflamable substance
   yields not easily unto Water, but flames in the Arms of its Antagonist.
   And thus would he inveagle my belief to think the combustion of Sodom
   might be natural, and that there was an Asphaltick and Bituminous
   nature in that Lake before the fire of Gomorrah. I know that Manna is
   now plentifully gathered in Calabria; and Josephus tells me, in his
   days it was as plentiful in Arabia; the Devil therefore made the
   quaere, Where was then the miracle in the days of Moses? the Israelites
   saw but that in his time, the Natives of those Countries behold in
   ours. Thus the Devil played at Chess with me, and yielding a Pawn,
   thought to gain a Queen of me, taking advantage of my honest
   endeavours; and whilst I laboured to raise the structure of my Reason,
   he strived to undermine the edifice of my Faith.

   XX. Neither had these or any other ever such advantage of me, as to
   incline me to any point of Infidelity or desperate positions of
   Atheism; for I have been these many years of opinion there was never
   any. Those that held Religion was the difference of Man from Beasts,
   have spoken probably, and proceed upon a principle as inductive as the
   other. That doctrine of Epicurus, that denied the Providence of God,
   was no Atheism, but a magnificent and high strained conceit of His
   Majesty, which he deemed too sublime to mind the trivial Actions of
   those inferior Creatures. That fatal Necessity of the Stoicks is
   nothing but the immutable Law of His Will. Those that heretofore denied
   the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, have been condemned but as Hereticks;
   and those that now deny our Saviour, (though more than Hereticks,) are
   not so much as Atheists; for, though they deny two persons in the
   Trinity, they hold, as we do, there is but one God.

   That Villain and Secretary of Hell, [46] that composed that miscreant
   piece Of the Three Impostors, though divided from all Religions, and
   was neither Jew, Turk, nor Christian, was not a positive Atheist. I
   confess every Country hath its Machiavel, every age its Lucian, whereof
   common Heads must not hear, nor more advanced Judgments too rashly
   venture on: it is the Rhetorick of Satan, and may pervert a loose or
   prejudicate belief.

   XXI. I confess I have perused them all, and can discover nothing that
   may startle a discreet belief; yet are there heads carried off with the
   Wind and breath of such motives. I remember a Doctor in Physick, of
   Italy, who could not perfectly believe the immortality of the Soul,
   because Galen seemed to make a doubt thereof. With another I was
   familiarly acquainted in France, a Divine, and a man of singular parts,
   that on the same point was so plunged and gravelled with three lines of
   Seneca, that all our Antidotes, drawn from both Scripture and
   Philosophy, could not expel the poyson of his errour. There are a set
   of Heads, that can credit the relations of Mariners, yet question the
   Testimonies of St. Paul; and peremptorily maintain the traditions of
   Aelian or Pliny, yet in Histories of Scripture raise Queries and
   Objections, believing no more than they can parallel in humane [47]
   Authors. I confess there are in Scripture Stories that do exceed the
   Fables of Poets, and to a captious Reader sound like Garagantua or
   Bevis. Search all the Legends of times past, and the fabulous conceits
   of these present, and twill be hard to find one that deserves to carry
   the Buckler unto Sampson; yet is all this of an easie possibility, if
   we conceive a Divine concourse, [48] or an influence but from the
   little Finger of the Almighty. It is impossible that either in the
   discourse of man, or in the infallible Voice of God, to the weakness of
   our apprehensions, there should not appear irregularities,
   contradictions, and antinomies: [49] my self could shew a Catalogue of
   doubts, never yet imagined nor questioned, as I know, which are not
   resolved at the first hearing; not fantastick Queries or Objections of
   Air; for I cannot hear of Atoms in Divinity. I can read the History of
   the Pigeon that was sent out of the Ark, and returned no more, yet not
   question how she found out her Mate that was left behind: that Lazarus
   was raised from the dead, yet not demand where in the interim his Soul
   awaited; or raise a Lawcase, whether his Heir might lawfully detain his
   inheritance bequeathed unto him by his death, and he, though restored
   to life, have no Plea or Title unto his former possessions. Whether Eve
   was framed out of the left side of Adam, I dispute not; because I stand
   not yet assured which is the right side of a man, or whether there be
   any such distinction in Nature: that she was edified out of the Rib of
   Adam I believe, yet raise no question who shall arise with that Rib at
   the Resurrection. Whether Adam was an Hermaphrodite, as the Rabbins
   contend upon the Letter of the Text, because it is contrary to reason,
   there should be an Hermaphrodite before there was a Woman, or a
   composition of two Natures before there was a second composed.
   Likewise, whether the World was created in Autumn, Summer, or the
   Spring, because it was created in them all; for whatsoever Sign the Sun
   possesseth, those four Seasons are actually existent. It is the nature
   of this Luminary to distinguish the several Seasons of the year, all
   which it makes at one time in the whole Earth, and successive in any
   part thereof. There are a bundle of curiosities, not only in
   Philosophy, but in Divinity, proposed and discussed by men of most
   supposed abilities, which indeed are not worthy our vacant hours, much
   less our serious Studies: Pieces only fit to be placed in Pantagruel's
   Library, or bound up with Tartaretus De modo Cacandi. [50]

   XXII. These are niceties that become not those that peruse so serious a
   Mystery. There are others more generally questioned and called to the
   Bar, yet methinks of an easie and possible truth.

   'Tis ridiculous to put off or drown the general Flood of Noah in that
   particular inundation of Deucalion. That there was a Deluge once, seems
   not to me so great a Miracle, as that there is not one always. How all
   the kinds of Creatures, not only in their own bulks, but with a
   competency of food and sustenance, might be preserved in one Ark, and
   within the extent of three hundred Cubits, to a reason that rightly
   examines it will appear very feasible. There is another secret, not
   contained in the Scripture, which is more hard to comprehend, and put
   the honest Father [51] to the refuge of a Miracle; and that is, not
   only how the distinct pieces of the World and divided Islands, should
   be first planted by men, but inhabited by Tigers, Panthers, and Bears.
   How America abounded with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals, yet
   contained not in it that necessary Creature, a Horse, is very strange.
   By what passage those, not only Birds, but dangerous and unwelcome
   Beasts, came over; how there be Creatures there, which are not found in
   this Triple Continent; (all which must needs be strange unto us, that
   hold but one Ark, and that the Creatures began their progress from the
   Mountains of Ararat:) they who, to salve this, would make the Deluge
   particular, proceed upon a principle that I can no way grant; not only
   upon the negative of Holy Scriptures, but of mine own Reason, whereby I
   can make it probable, that the World was as well peopled in the time of
   Noah as in ours; and fifteen hundred years to people the World, as full
   a time for them, as four thousand years since have been to us.

   There are other assertions and common Tenents drawn from Scripture, and
   generally believed as Scripture, whereunto, notwithstanding, I would
   never betray the liberty of my Reason. Tis a Postulate to me, that
   Methusalem was the longest liv'd of all the Children of Adam; and no
   man will be able to prove it, when, from the process of the Text, I can
   manifest it may be otherwise. That Judas perished by hanging himself,
   there is no certainty in Scripture: though in one place it seems to
   affirm it, and by a doubtful word hath given occasion to translate it;
   yet in another place, in a more punctual description, it makes it
   improbable, and seems to overthrow it. That our Fathers, after the
   Flood, erected the Tower of Babel to preserve themselves against a
   second Deluge, is generally opinioned and believed; yet is there
   another intention of theirs expressed in Scripture: besides, it is
   improbable from the circumstances of the place, that is, a plain in the
   Land of Shinar. These are no points of Faith, and therefore may admit a
   free dispute.

   There are yet others, and those familiarly concluded from the text,
   wherein (under favour,) I see no consequence. The Church of Rome
   confidently proves the opinion of Tutelary Angels from that Answer,
   when Peter knockt at the Door, Tis not he, but his Angel; that is
   (might some say,) his Messenger, or some body from him; for so the
   Original signifies, and is as likely to be the doubtful Families
   meaning. This exposition I once suggested to a young Divine, that
   answered upon this point; to which I remember the Franciscan Opponent
   replyed no more, but That it was a new, and no authentick
   interpretation.

Section III.

   XXIII. These are but the conclusions and fallible discourses of man
   upon the Word of God, for such I do believe the Holy Scriptures: yet,
   were it of man, I could not chuse but say, it was the singularest and
   superlative piece that hath been extant since the Creation. Were I a
   Pagan, I should not refrain the Lecture [52] of it; and cannot but
   commend the judgment of Ptolomy, [53] and thought not his Library
   compleat without it. The Alcoran of the Turks (I speak without
   prejudice,) is an ill composed Piece, containing in vain and ridiculous
   Errors in Philosophy, impossibilities, fictions, and vanities beyond
   laughter, maintained by evident and open Sophisms, the Policy of
   Ignorance, deposition of Universities, and banishment of Learning, that
   hath gotten Foot by Arms and violence: this without a blow hath
   disseminated it self through the whole Earth. It is not unremarkable
   what Philo first observed, that the Law of Moses continued two thousand
   years without the least alteration; whereas, we see the Laws of other
   Common-weals do alter with occasions; and even those that pretended
   their original from some Divinity, to have vanished without trace or
   memory. I believe, besides Zoroaster, there were divers that writ
   before Moses, who, notwithstanding, have suffered the common fate of
   time. Mens Works have an age like themselves; and though they out-live
   their Authors, yet have they a stint [54] and period to their duration:
   this only is a work too hard for the teeth of time, and cannot perish
   but in the general Flames, when all things shall confess their Ashes.

   XXIV. I have heard some with deep sighs lament the lost lines of
   Cicero; others with as many groans deplore the combustion of the
   Library of Alexandria: for my own part, I think there be too many in
   the World, and could with patience behold the urn and ashes of the
   Vatican, could I, with a few others, recover the perished leaves of
   Solomon. I would not omit a copy of Enoch's Pillars, [55] had they many
   nearer Authors than Josephus, or did not relish somewhat of the Fable.
   Some men have written more than others have spoken; Pineda [56] quotes
   more Authors in one work, than are necessary in a whole World. Of those
   three great inventions [57] in Germany, there are two which are not
   without their incommodities, and tis disputable whether they exceed not
   their use and commodities. Tis not a melancholy Utinam [58] of my own,
   but the desires of better heads, that there were a general Synod; not
   to unite the incompatible difference of Religion, but for the benefit
   of learning, to reduce it as it lay at first, in a few and solid
   Authors; and to condemn to the fire those swarms and millions of
   Rhapsodies, begotten only to distract and abuse the weaker judgements
   of Scholars, and to maintain the trade and mystery of Typographers.

   XXV. I cannot but wonder with what exception the Samaritans could
   confine their belief to the Pentateuch, or five Books of Moses. I am
   ashamed at the Rabbinical Interpretation of the Jews upon the Old
   Testament, as much as their defection from the New: and truly it is
   beyond wonder, how that contemptible and degenerate issue of Jacob,
   once so devoted to Ethnick [59] Superstition, and so easily seduced to
   the Idolatry of their Neighbours, should now in such an obstinate and
   peremptory belief adhere unto their own Doctrine, expect
   impossibilities, and, in the face and eye of the Church, persist
   without the least hope of Conversion. This is a vice in them, that were
   a virtue in us; for obstinacy in a bad Cause is but constancy in a
   good. And herein I must accuse those of my own Religion, for there is
   not any of such a fugitive Faith, such an unstable belief, as a
   Christian; none that do so oft transform themselves, not unto several
   shapes of Christianity and of the same Species, but unto more unnatural
   and contrary Forms of Jew and Mahometan; that, from the name of
   Saviour, can condescend to the bare term of Prophet; and, from an old
   belief that He is come, fall to a new expectation of His coming. It is
   the promise of Christ to make us all one Flock; but how and when this
   Union shall be, is as obscure to me as the last day. Of those four
   Members of Religion [60] we hold a slender proportion. There are, I
   confess, some new additions, yet small to those which accrew to our
   Adversaries, and those only drawn from the revolt of Pagans, men but of
   negative Impieties, and such as deny Christ, but because they never
   heard of Him. But the Religion of the Jew is expressly against the
   Christian, and the Mahometan against both. For the Turk, in the bulk he
   now stands, he is beyond all hope of conversion; if he fall asunder,
   there may be conceived hopes, but not without strong improbabilities.
   The Jew is obstinate in all fortunes; the persecution of fifteen
   hundred years hath but confirmed them in their Errour: they have
   already endured whatsoever may be inflicted, and have suffered in a bad
   cause, even to the condemnation of their enemies. Persecution is a bad
   and indirect way to plant Religion: it hath been the unhappy method of
   angry Devotions, [61] not only to confirm honest Religion, but wicked
   Heresies, and extravagant Opinions. It was the first stone and Basis of
   our Faith; none can more justly boast of Persecutions, and glory in the
   number and valour of Martyrs. For, to speak properly, those are true
   and almost only examples of fortitude: those that are fetch'd from the
   field, or drawn from the actions of the Camp, are not oft-times so
   truely precedents of valour as audacity, and at the best attain but to
   some bastard piece of fortitude. If we shall strictly examine the
   circumstances and requisites which Aristotle requires to true and
   perfect valour, we shall find the name only in his Master, Alexander,
   and as little in that Roman Worthy, Julius Caesar; and if any in that
   easie and active way have done so nobly as to deserve that name, yet in
   the passive and more terrible piece these have surpassed, and in a more
   heroical way may claim the honour of that Title. Tis not in the power
   of every honest Faith to proceed thus far, or pass to Heaven through
   the flames. Every one hath it not in that full measure, nor in so
   audacious and resolute a temper, as to endure those terrible tests and
   trials; who, notwithstanding, in a peaceable way, do truely adore their
   Saviour, and have (no doubt,) a Faith acceptable in the eyes of God.

   XXVI. Now, as all that dye in the War are not termed Souldiers; so
   neither can I properly term all those that suffer in matters of
   Religion, Martyrs. The Council of Constance condemns John Huss for an
   Heretick; the Stories of his own Party stile him a Martyr: he must
   needs offend the Divinity of both, that says he was neither the one nor
   the other. There are many (questionless), canonized on earth, that
   shall never be Saints in Heaven; and have their names in Histories and
   Martyrologies, who in the eyes of God are not so perfect Martyrs as was
   that wise Heathen, Socrates, that suffered on a fundamental point of
   Religion, the unity of God. I have often pitied the miserable Bishop
   [62] that suffered in the cause of Antipodes; yet cannot chuse but
   accuse him of as much madness, for exposing his living on such a
   trifle, as those of ignorance and folly, that condemned him. I think my
   conscience will not give me the lye, if I say there are not many extant
   that in a noble way fear the face of death less than myself; yet, from
   the moral duty I owe to the Commandment of God, and the natural
   respects that I tender unto the conservation of my essence and being, I
   would not perish upon a Ceremony, Politick points, or indifferency: nor
   is my belief of that untractible temper, as not to bow at their
   obstacles, or connive at matters wherein there are not manifest
   impieties. The leaven, therefore, and ferment of all, not only civil
   but Religious actions, is Wisdom; without which, to commit our selves
   to the flames is Homicide, and (I fear,) but to pass through one fire
   into another.

   XXVII. That Miracles are ceased, I can neither prove, nor absolutely
   deny, much less define the time and period of their cessation. That
   they survived Christ, is manifest upon the Record of Scripture; that
   they out-lived the Apostles also, and were revived at the Conversion of
   Nations many years after, we cannot deny, if we shall not question
   those Writers whose testimonies we do not controvert in points that
   make for our own opinions. Therefore that may have some truth in it
   that is reported by the Jesuites of their Miracles in the Indies; I
   could wish it were true, or had any other testimony than their own
   Pens. They may easily believe those Miracles abroad, who daily conceive
   a greater at home, the transmutation of those visible elements into the
   Body and Blood of our Saviour. For the conversion of Water into Wine,
   which He wrought in Cana, or, what the Devil would have had Him done in
   the Wilderness, of Stones into Bread, compared to this, will scarce
   deserve the name of a Miracle: though indeed, to speak properly, there
   is not one Miracle greater than another, they being the extraordinary
   effects of the Hand of God, to which all things are of an equal
   facility; and to create the World, as easie as one single Creature. For
   this is also a Miracle, not onely to produce effects against or above
   Nature, but before Nature; and to create Nature, as great a Miracle as
   to contradict or transcend her. We do too narrowly define the Power of
   God, restraining it to our capacities. I hold that God can do all
   things; how He should work contradictions, I do not understand, yet
   dare not therefore deny. I cannot see why the Angel of God should
   question Esdras to recall the time past, if it were beyond His own
   power; or that God should pose mortality in that which He was not able
   to perform Himself. I will not say God cannot, but He will not, perform
   many things, which we plainly affirm He cannot. This, I am sure, is the
   mannerliest proposition, wherein, notwithstanding, I hold no Paradox;
   for, strictly, His power is the same with His will, and they both, with
   all the rest, do make but one God.

   XXVIII. Therefore that Miracles have been, I do believe; that they may
   yet be wrought by the living, I do not deny; but have no confidence in
   those which are fathered on the dead. And this hath ever made me
   suspect the efficacy of reliques, to examine the bones, question the
   habits and appurtenances of Saints, and even of Christ Himself. I
   cannot conceive why the Cross that Helena found, and whereon Christ
   Himself dyed, should have power to restore others unto life. I excuse
   not Constantine from a fall off his Horse, or a mischief from his
   enemies, upon the wearing those nails on his bridle, which our Saviour
   bore upon the Cross in His Hands. I compute among your Piae fraudes,
   [63] nor many degrees before consecrated Swords and Roses, that which
   Baldwyn, King of Jerusalem, returned the Genovese for their cost and
   pains in his War, to wit, the ashes of John the Baptist. Those that
   hold the sanctity of their Souls doth leave behind a tincture and
   sacred faculty on their bodies, speak naturally of Miracles, and do not
   salve the doubt. Now one reason I tender so little Devotion unto
   Reliques, is, I think, the slender and doubtful respect I have always
   held unto Antiquities. For that indeed which I admire, is far before
   Antiquity, that is, Eternity; and that is, God Himself; Who, though He
   be styled the Ancient of Days, cannot receive the adjunct of Antiquity;
   Who was before the World, and shall be after it, yet is not older than
   it; for in His years there is no Climacter [64] His duration is
   Eternity, and far more venerable than Antiquity.

   XXIX. But above all things I wonder how the curiosity of wiser heads
   could pass that great and indisputable Miracle, the cessation of
   Oracles; and in what swoun their Reasons lay, to content themselves and
   sit down with such a far-fetch'd and ridiculous reason as Plutarch
   alleadgeth for it. The Jews, that can believe the supernatural Solstice
   of the Sun in the days of Joshua, have yet the impudence to deny the
   Eclipse, which every Pagan confessed, at His death: but for this, it is
   evident beyond all contradiction, the Devil himself confessed it. [65]
   Certainly it is not a warrantable curiosity, to examine the verity of
   Scripture by the concordance of humane history, or to seek to confirm
   the Chronicle of Hester or Daniel, by the authority of Megasthenes or
   Herodotus. I confess, I have had an unhappy curiosity this way, till I
   laughed my self out of it with a piece of Justine, where he delivers
   that the Children of Israel for being scabbed were banished out of
   Egypt. And truely since I have understood the occurrences of the World,
   and know in what counterfeit shapes and deceitful vizards times present
   represent on the stage things past, I do believe them little more then
   things to come. Some have been of my opinion, and endeavoured to write
   the History of their own lives; wherein Moses hath outgone them all and
   left not onely the story of his life, but (as some will have it,) of
   his death also.

   XXX. It is a riddle to me, how this story of Oracles hath not worm'd
   out of the World that doubtful conceit of Spirits and Witches; how so
   many learned heads should so far forget their Metaphysicks, and destroy
   the ladder and scale of creatures, as to question the existence of
   Spirits. For my part, I have ever believed, and do now know, that there
   are Witches: they that doubt of these, do not onely deny them, but
   Spirits; and are obliquely and upon consequence a sort not of Infidels,
   but Atheists. Those that to confute their incredulity desire to see
   apparitions, shall questionless never behold any, nor have the power to
   be so much as Witches; the Devil hath them already in a heresie as
   capital as Witchcraft; and to appear to them, were but to convert them.
   Of all the delusions wherewith he deceives morality, there is not any
   that puzzleth me more than the Legerdemain of Changelings. I do not
   credit those transformations of reasonable creatures into beasts, or
   that the Devil hath a power to transpeciate [66] a man into a Horse,
   who tempted Christ (as a trial of His Divinity,) to convert but stones
   into bread. I could believe that Spirits use with man the act of
   carnality, and that in both sexes; I conceive they may assume, steal,
   or contrive a body, wherein there may be action enough to content
   decrepit lust, or passion to satisfie more active veneries; [67] yet,
   in both, without a possibility of generation: and therefore that
   opinion that Antichrist should be born of the Tribe of Dan by
   conjunction with the Devil, is ridiculous, and a conceit fitter for a
   Rabbin than a Christian. I hold that the Devil doth really possess some
   men, the spirit of Melancholy others, the spirit of Delusion others;
   that, as the Devil is concealed and denyed by some, so God and good
   Angels are pretended by others, whereof the late defection [68] of the
   Maid of Germany hath left a pregnant example.

   XXXI. Again, I believe that all that use sorceries, incantations, and
   spells, are not Witches, or, as we term them, Magicians. I conceive
   there is a traditional Magick, not learned immediately from the Devil,
   but at second hand from his Scholars, who, having once the secret
   betrayed, are able, and do emperically practise without his advice,
   they both proceeding upon the principles of Nature; where actives,
   aptly conjoyned to disposed passives, will under any Master produce
   their effects. Thus I think at first a great part of Philosophy was
   Witchcraft; which, being afterward derived to one another, proved but
   Philosophy, and was indeed no more but the honest effects of Nature:
   what, invented by us, is Philosophy, learned from him, is Magick. We do
   surely owe the discovery of many secrets to the discovery of good and
   bad Angels. I could never pass that sentence of Paracelsus without an
   asterisk or annotation; Ascendens constellatum multa revelat
   quaerentibus magnalia naturae, (i.e. opera Dei.) [69] [The ascending
   constellation reveals to inquirers many of nature's great things.] I do
   think that many mysteries ascribed to our own inventions have been the
   courteous revelations of Spirits; (for those noble essences in Heaven
   bear a friendly regard unto their fellow Natures on Earth;) and
   therefore believe that those many prodigies and ominous prognosticks,
   which forerun the ruines of States, Princes, and private persons, are
   the charitable premonitions of good Angels, which more careless
   enquiries term but the effects of chance and nature.

   XXXII. Now, besides these particular and divided Spirits, there may be
   (for ought I know,) an universal and common Spirit to the whole World.
   It was the opinion of Plato, and it is yet of the Hermetical
   Philosophers. If there be a common nature that unites and types the
   scattered and divided individuals into one species, why may there not
   be one that unites them all? However, I am sure there is a common
   Spirit that plays within us, yet makes no part of us; and that is, the
   Spirit of God, the fire and scintillation of that noble and mighty
   Essence, which is the life and radical heat of Spirits, and those
   essences that know not the vertue of the Sun; a fire quite contrary to
   the fire of Hell. This is that gentle heat that brooded on the waters,
   and in six days hatched the World; this is that irradiation that
   dispels the mists of Hell, the clouds of horrour, fear, sorrow,
   despair; and preserves the region of the mind in serenity. Whosoever
   feels not the warm gale and gentle ventilation of this Spirit, though I
   feel his pulse, I dare not say he lives: for truely, without this, to
   me there is no heat under the Tropick; nor any light, though I dwelt in
   the body of the Sun.

   As, when the labouring Sun hath wrought his track Up to the top of
   lofty Cancers back, The icey Ocean cracks, the frozen pole Thaws with
   the heat of the Celestial coale; So, when Thy absent beams begin t'
   impart Again a Solstice on my frozen heart, My winter's ov'r, my
   dropping spirits sing, And every part revives into a Spring. But if Thy
   quickning beams a while decline, And with their light bless not this
   Orb of mine, A chilly frost surpriseth every member, And in the midst
   of June I feel December. O how this earthly temper doth debase The
   noble Soul, in this her humble place; Whose wingy nature ever doth
   aspire To reach that place whence first it took its fire. These flames
   I feel, which in my heart do dwell, Are not Thy beams, but take their
   fire from Hell: O quench them all, and let Thy Light divine Be as the
   Sun to this poor Orb of mine; And to Thy sacred Spirit convert those
   fires, Whose earthly fumes choak my devout aspires.

   XXXIII. Therefore for Spirits, I am so far from denying their
   existence, that I could easily believe, that not onely whole Countries,
   but particular persons, have their Tutelary and Guardian Angels. It is
   not a new opinion of the Church of Rome, but an old one of Pythagoras
   and Plato; there is no heresie in it; and if not manifestly defin'd in
   Scripture, yet is it an opinion of a good and wholesome use in the
   course and actions of a mans life, and would serve as an Hypothesis to
   salve many doubts, whereof common Philosophy affordeth no solution.
   Now, if you demand my opinion and Metaphysics of their natures, I
   confess them very shallow; most of them in a negative way, like that of
   God; or in a comparative, between ourselves and fellow-creatures; for
   there is in this Universe a Stair, or manifest Scale of creatures,
   rising not disorderly, or in confusion, but with a comely method and
   proportion. Between creatures of meer existence, and things of life,
   there is a large disproportion of nature; between plants, and animals
   or creatures of sense, a wider difference; between them and Man, a far
   greater: and if the proportion hold one, between Man and Angels there
   should be yet a greater. We do not comprehend their natures, who retain
   the first definition of Porphyry, and distinguish them from our selves
   by immortality; for before his Fall, tis thought, Man also was
   Immortal; yet must we needs affirm that he had a different essence from
   the Angels. Having therefore no certain knowledge of their Natures, tis
   no bad method of the Schools, whatsoever perfection we find obscurely
   in our selves, in a more compleat and absolute way to ascribe unto
   them. I believe they have an extemporary knowledge, and upon the first
   motion of their reason do what we cannot without study or deliberation;
   that they know things by their forms, and define by specifical
   difference what we describe by accidents and properties; and therefore
   probabilities to us may be demonstrations unto them: that they have
   knowledge not onely of the specifical, but numerical forms of
   individuals, and understand by what reserved difference each single
   Hypostasis [70] (besides the relation to its species,) becomes its
   numerical self: that, as the Soul hath a power to move the body it
   informs, so there's a faculty to move any, though inform none: ours
   upon restraint of time, place, and distance; but that invisible hand
   that conveyed Habakkuk to the Lyons Den, [71] or Philip to Azotus, [72]
   infringeth this rule, and hath a secret conveyance, wherewith mortality
   is not acquainted. If they have that intuitive knowledge, whereby as in
   reflexion they behold the thoughts of one another, I cannot
   peremptorily deny but they know a great part of ours. They that, to
   refute the Invocation of Saints, have denied that they have any
   knowledge of our affairs below, have proceeded too far, and must pardon
   my opinion, till I can thoroughly answer that piece of Scripture, At
   the conversion of a sinner the Angels in Heaven rejoyce. I cannot, with
   those in that great Father, [73] securely interpret the work of the
   first day, Fiat lux, [Let there be light] to the creation of Angels;
   though I confess, there is not any creature [74] that hath so neer a
   glympse of their nature as light in the Sun and Elements. We stile it a
   bare accident; but, where it subsists alone, tis a spiritual Substance,
   and may be an Angel: in brief, conceive light invisible, and that is a
   Spirit.

   XXXIV. These are certainly the Magisterial and masterpieces of the
   Creator, the Flower, or (as we may say,) the best part of nothing;
   actually existing, what we are but in hopes and probability. We are
   onely that amphibious piece between a corporal and spiritual Essence,
   that middle form that links those two together, and makes good the
   Method of God and Nature, that jumps not from extreams, but unites the
   incompatible distances by some middle and participating natures. That
   we are the breath and similitude of God, it is indisputable, and upon
   record of Holy Scripture; but to call ourselves a Microcosm, or little
   World, I thought it only a pleasant trope of Rhetorick, till my neer
   judgement and second thoughts told me there was a real truth therein.
   For first we are a rude mass, and in the rank of creatures which onely
   are, and have a dull kind of being, not yet priviledged with life, or
   preferred to sense or reason; next we live the life of Plants, the life
   of Animals, the life of Men, and at last the life of Spirits, running
   on in one mysterious nature those five kinds of existences, which
   comprehend the creatures not onely of the World, but of the Universe.
   Thus is Man that great and true Amphibium, whose nature is disposed to
   live, not onely like other creatures in divers elements, but in divided
   and distinguished worlds: for though there be but one to sense, there
   are two to reason, the one visible, the other invisible; whereof Moses
   seems to have left description, and of the other so obscurely, that
   some parts thereof are yet in controversie. And truely, for the first
   chapters of Genesis, I must confess a great deal of obscurity; though
   Divines have to the power of humane reason endeavoured to make all go
   in a literal meaning, yet those allegorical interpretations are also
   probable, and perhaps the mystical method of Moses bred up in the
   Hieroglyphical Schools of the Egyptians.

   XXXV. Now for that immaterial world, methinks we need not wander so far
   as beyond the first moveable; [75] for even in this material Fabrick
   the Spirits walk as freely exempt from the affection of time, place,
   and motion, as beyond the extreamest circumference. Do but extract from
   the corpulency of bodies, or resolve things beyond their first matter,
   and you discover the habitation of Angels, which if I call the
   ubiquitary and omnipresent Essence of God, I hope I shall not offend
   Divinity: for before the Creation of the World God was really all
   things. For the Angels He created no new World, or determinate mansion,
   and therefore they are everywhere where is His Essence, and do live at
   a distance even in Himself. That God made all things for Man, is in
   some sense true, yet not so far as to subordinate the Creation of those
   purer Creatures unto ours, though as ministring Spirits they do, and
   are willing to fulfill the will of God in these lower and sublunary
   affairs of Man. God made all things for Himself, and it is impossible
   He should make them for any other end than His own Glory; it is all He
   can receive, and all that is without Himself. For, honour being an
   externat adjunct, and in the honourer rather than in the person
   honoured, it was necessary to make a Creature, from whom He might
   receive this homage; and that is, in the other world, Angels, in this,
   Man; which when we neglect, we forget the very end of our Creation, and
   may justly provoke God, not onely to repent that He hath made the
   World, but that He hath sworn He would not destroy it. That there is
   but one World, is a conclusion of Faith: Aristotle with all his
   Philosophy hath not been able to prove it, and as weakly that the World
   was eternal. That dispute much troubled the Pen of the ancient
   Philosophers, but Moses decided that question, and all is salved with
   the new term of a Creation, that is, a production of something out of
   nothing. And what is that? whatsoever is opposite to something; or more
   exactly, that which is truely contrary unto God: for He onely is, all
   others have an existence with dependency, and are something but by a
   distinction. And herein is Divinity conformant unto Philosophy, and
   generation not onely founded on contrarieties, but also creation; God,
   being all things, is contrary unto nothing, out of which were made all
   things, and so nothing became something, and Omneity informed Nullity
   into an Essence.

Section IV.

   XXXVI. The whole Creation is a mystery, and particularly that of Man.
   At the blast of His mouth were the rest of the Creatures made, and at
   His bare word they started out of nothing: but in the frame of Man (as
   the Text describes it,) He played the sensible operator, and seemed not
   so much to create, as make him. When He had separated the materials of
   other creatures, there consequently resulted a form and soul; but,
   having raised the walls of Man, He was driven to a second and harder
   creation of a substance like Himself, an incorruptible and immortal
   Soul. For these two affections [76] we have the Philosophy and opinion
   of the Heathens, the flat affirmative of Plato, and not a negative from
   Aristotle. There is another scruple cast in by Divinity concerning its
   production, much disputed in the Germane auditories, and with that
   indifferency and equality of arguments, as leave the controversie
   undetermined. I am not of Paracelsus mind, that boldly delivers a
   receipt to make a man without conjunction; [77] yet cannot but wonder
   at the multitude of heads that do deny traduction, [78] having no other
   argument to confirm their belief then that Rhetorical sentence and
   Antimetathesis [79] of Augustine, Creando infunditur, infundendo
   creatur. [By creating it is poured in, by pouring in it is created.]
   Either opinion will consist well enough with Religion: yet I should
   rather incline to this, did not one objection haunt me, (not wrung from
   speculations and subtilties, but from common sense and observation; not
   pickt from the leaves of any Author, but bred amongst the weeds and
   tares of mine own brain;) and this is a conclusion from the equivocal
   and monstrous productions in the conjunction of Man with Beast: for if
   the Soul of man be not transmitted and transfused in the seed of the
   Parents, why are not those productions meerly beasts, but have also an
   impression and tincture of reason in as high a measure as it can
   evidence it self in those improper Organs? Nor, truely, can I
   peremptorily deny that the Soul, in this her sublunary estate, is
   wholly and in all acceptions [80] inorganical; but that for the
   performance of her ordinary actions there is required not onely a
   symmetry and proper disposition of Organs, but a Crasis [81] and temper
   correspondent to its operations: yet is not this mass of flesh and
   visible structure the instrument and proper corps of the Soul, but
   rather of Sense, and that the hand of Reason. In our study of Anatomy
   there is a mass of mysterious Philosophy, and such as reduced the very
   Heathens to Divinity: yet, amongst all those rare discoveries and
   curious pieces I find in the Fabrick of Man, I do not so much content
   my self, as in that I find not, there is no Organ or Instrument for the
   rational Soul; for in the brain, which we term the seat of Reason,
   there is not anything of moment more than I can discover in the crany
   [82] of a beast: and this is a sensible and no inconsiderable argument
   of the inorganity of the Soul, at least in that sense we usually so
   receive it. Thus we are men, and we know not how: there is something in
   us that can be without us, and will be after us; though it is strange
   that it hath no history what it was before us, nor cannot tell how it
   entered in us.

   XXXVII. Now, for these walls of flesh, wherein the Soul doth seem to be
   immured before the Resurrection, it is nothing but an elemental
   composition, and a Fabrick that must fall to ashes. All flesh is grass,
   is not onely metaphorically, but literally, true; for all those
   creatures we behold are but the herbs of the field, digested into flesh
   in them, or more remotely carnified [83] in our selves. Nay further, we
   are what we all abhor, Anthropophagi and Cannibals, devourers not onely
   of men, but of our selves; and that not in an allegory, but a positive
   truth: for all this mass of flesh which we behold, came in at our
   mouths; this frame we look upon, hath been upon our trenchers; in
   brief, we have devour'd our selves. I cannot believe the wisdom of
   Pythagoras did ever positively, and in a literal sense, affirm his
   Metempsychosis, or impossible transmigration of the Souls of men into
   beasts. Of all Metamorphoses or transmigrations, I believe only one,
   that is of Lots wife; for that of Nebuchodonosor proceeded not so far:
   in all others I conceive there is no further verity than is contained
   in their implicite sense and morality. I believe that the whole frame
   of a beast doth perish, and is left in the same state after death as
   before it was materialled unto life: that the Souls of men know neither
   contrary nor corruption; that they subsist beyond the body, and outlive
   death by the priviledge of their proper natures, and without a Miracle;
   that the Souls of the faithful, as they leave Earth, take possession of
   Heaven: that those apparitions and ghosts of departed persons are not
   the wandring souls of men, but the unquiet walks of Devils, prompting
   and suggesting us unto mischief, blood, and villany; instilling and
   stealing into our hearts that the blessed Spirits are not at rest in
   their graves, but wander sollicitous of the affairs of the World. But
   that those phantasms appear often, and do frequent Coemeteries,
   Charnel-houses, and Churches, it is because those are the dormitories
   of the dead, where the Devil, like an insolent Champion, beholds with
   pride the spoils and Trophies of his Victory over Adam.

   XXXVIII. This is that dismal conquest we all deplore, that makes us so
   often cry, O Adam, quid fecisti? [O Adam, what hast thou done?] I thank
   God I have not those strait ligaments, or narrow obligations to the
   World, as to dote on life, or be convulst and tremble at the name of
   death. Not that I am insensible of the dread and horrour thereof; or by
   raking into the bowels of the deceased, continual sight of Anatomies,
   Skeletons, or Cadaverous reliques, like Vespilloes, [84] or
   Grave-makers, I am become stupid, or have forgot the apprehension of
   Mortality; but that, marshalling all the horrours, and contemplating
   the extremities thereof, I find not any thing therein able to daunt the
   courage of a man, much less a well-resolved Christian; and therefore am
   not angry at the errour of our first Parents, or unwilling to bear a
   part of this common fate, and like the best of them to dye, that is, to
   cease to breathe, to take a farewell of the elements, to be a kind of
   nothing for a moment, to be within one instant of a Spirit. When I take
   a full view and circle of my self without this reasonable moderator,
   and equal piece of Justice, Death, I do conceive my self the
   miserablest person extant. Were there not another life that I hope for,
   all the vanities of this World should not intreat a moments breath from
   me; could the Devil work my belief to imagine I could never dye, I
   would not outlive that very thought. I have so abject a conceit [85] of
   this common way of existence, this retaining to the Sun and Elements, I
   cannot think this is to be a Man, or to live according to the dignity
   of humanity. In expectation of a better, I can with patience embrace
   this life, yet in my best meditations do often defie death; I honour
   any man that contemns it, nor can I highly love any that is afraid of
   it: this makes me naturally love a Souldier, and honour those tattered
   and contemptible Regiments that will die at the command of a Sergeant.
   For a Pagan there may be some motives to be in love with life; but for
   a Christian to be amazed at death, I see not how he can escape this
   Dilemma, that he is too sensible of this life, or hopeless of the life
   to come.

   XXXIX. Some Divines count Adam thirty years old at his Creation,
   because they suppose him created in the perfect age and stature of man.
   And surely we are all out of the computation of our age, and every man
   is some months elder than he bethinks him; for we live, move, have a
   being, and are subject to the actions of the elements, and the malice
   of diseases, in that other World, the truest Microcosm, the Womb of our
   Mother. For besides that general and common existence we are conceived
   to hold in our Chaos, and whilst we sleep within the bosome of our
   causes, we enjoy a being and life in three distinct worlds, wherein we
   receive most manifest graduations. In that obscure World and Womb of
   our Mother, our time is short, computed by the Moon, yet longer then
   the days of many creatures that behold the Sun; our selves being not
   yet without life, sense, and reason; though for the manifestation of
   its actions, it awaits the opportunity of objects, and seems to live
   there but in its root and soul of vegetation. Entering afterwards upon
   the scene of the World, we arise up and become another creature,
   performing the reasonable actions of man, and obscurely manifesting
   that part of Divinity in us; but not in complement [86] and perfection,
   till we have once more cast our secondine, [87] that is, this slough of
   flesh, and are delivered into the last World, that is, that ineffable
   place of Paul, that proper ubi [88] of Spirits. The smattering I have
   of the Philosophers Stone (which is something more than the perfect
   exaltation of gold,) hath taught me a great deal of Divinity, and
   instructed my belief, how that immortal spirit and incorruptible
   substance of my Soul may lye obscure, and sleep a while within this
   house of flesh. Those strange and mystical transmigrations that I have
   observed in Silk-worms, turned my Philosophy into Divinity. There is in
   these works of nature, which seem to puzzle reason, something Divine,
   and hath more in it then the eye of a common spectator doth discover.

   XL. I am naturally bashful; nor hath conversation, age, or travel, been
   able to effront [89] or enharden me; yet I have one part of modesty
   which I have seldom discovered in another, that is, (to speak truely,)
   I am not so much afraid of death, as ashamed thereof. Tis the very
   disgrace and ignominy of our natures, that in a moment can so disfigure
   us, that our nearest friends, Wife, and Children, stand afraid and
   start at us: the Birds and Beasts of the field, that before in a
   natural fear obeyed us, forgetting all allegiance, begin to prey upon
   us. This very conceit hath in a tempest disposed and left me willing to
   be swallowed up in the abyss of waters, wherein I had perished unseen,
   unpityed, without wondering eyes, tears of pity, Lectures of mortality,
   and none had said.

   Quantum mutatus ab illo! [How changed from that man!]

   Not that I am ashamed of the Anatomy of my parts, or can accuse Nature
   for playing the bungler in any part of me, or my own vitious life for
   contracting any shameful disease upon me, whereby I might not call my
   self as wholesome a morsel for the worms as any.

   XLI. Some, upon the courage of a fruitful issue, wherein, as in the
   truest Chronicle, they seem to outlive themselves, can with greater
   patience away with death. This conceit and counterfeit subsisting in
   our progenies seems to me a meer fallacy, unworthy the desires of a man
   that can but conceive a thought of the next World; who, in a nobler
   ambition, should desire to live in his substance in Heaven, rather than
   his name and shadow in the earth. And therefore at my death I mean to
   take a total adieu of the World, not caring for a Monument, History or
   Epitaph, not so much as the bare memory of my name to be found any
   where but in the universal Register of God. I am not yet so Cynical as
   to approve the Testament of Diogenes, [90] nor do I altogether allow
   that Rodomontado [91] of Lucan,

   -Caelo tegitur, qui non habet urnam.

   He that unburied lies wants not his Herse, For unto him a Tomb's the
   Universe.

   but commend in my calmer judgement those ingenuous intentions that
   desire to sleep by the urns of their Fathers, and strive to go the
   neatest way unto corruption. I do not envy the temper of Crows and
   Daws, [92] nor the numerous and weary days of our Fathers before the
   Flood. If there be any truth in Astrology, I may outlive a Jubilee:
   [93] as yet I have not seen one revolution of Saturn, [94] nor hath my
   pulse beat thirty years; and yet, excepting one, have seen the Ashes
   and left under ground all the Kings of Europe; have been contemporary
   to three Emperours, four Grand Signiours, and as many Popes. Methinks I
   have outlived my self, and begin to be weary of the Sun; I have shaken
   hands with delight, in my warm blood and Canicular [95] days, I
   perceive I do anticipate the vices of age; the World to me is but a
   dream or mockshow, and we all therein but Pantalones and Anticks, to my
   severer contemplations.

   XLII. It is not, I confess, an unlawful Prayer to desire to surpass the
   days of our Saviour, or wish to outlive that age wherein He thought
   fittest to dye; yet if (as Divinity affirms,) there shall be no gray
   hairs in Heaven, but all shall rise in the perfect state of men, we do
   but outlive those perfections in this World, to be recalled unto them
   by a greater Miracle in the next, and run on here but to be retrograde
   hereafter. Were there any hopes to outlive vice, or a point to be
   super-annuated from sin, it were worthy our knees to implore the days
   of Methuselah. But age doth not rectify, but incurvate [96] our
   natures, turning bad dispositions into worser habits, and (like
   diseases,) brings on incurable vices; for every day as we grow weaker
   in age, we grow stronger in sin, and the number of our days doth but
   make our sins innumerable. The same vice committed at sixteen, is not
   the same, though it agree in all other circumstances, at forty, but
   swells and doubles from the circumstance of our ages; wherein, besides
   the constant and inexcusable habit of transgressing, the maturity of
   our judgement cuts off pretence unto excuse or pardon. Every sin, the
   oftner it is committed, the more it acquireth in the quality of evil;
   as it succeeds in time, so it proceeds in degrees of badness; for as
   they proceed they ever multiply, and, like figures in Arithmetick, the
   last stands for more than all that went before it. And though I think
   no man can live well once, but he that could live twice, yet for my own
   part I would not live over my hours past, or begin again the thread of
   my days: not upon Cicero's ground, because I have lived them well, but
   for fear I should live them worse. I find my growing Judgment daily
   instruct me how to be better, but my untamed affections and confirmed
   vitiosity makes me daily do worse. I find in my confirmed age the same
   sins I discovered in my youth; I committed many then, because I was a
   Child; and because I commit them still, I am yet an infant. Therefore I
   perceive a man may be twice a Child, before the days of dotage; and
   stand in need of Aesons Bath [97] before threescore.

   XLIII. And truly there goes a great deal of providence to produce a
   mans life unto threescore: there is more required than an able temper
   for those years; though the radical humour [98] contain in it
   sufficient oyl for seventy, yet I perceive in some it gives no light
   past thirty: men assign not all the causes of long life, that write
   whole Books thereof. They that found themselves on the radical balsome,
   [99] or vital sulphur99 of the parts, determine not why Abel lived not
   so long as Adam. There is therefore a secret glome [100] or bottom
   [101] of our days: twas His wisdom to determine them, but His perpetual
   and waking providence that fulfils and accomplisheth them; wherein the
   spirits, ourselves, and all the creatures of God in a secret and
   disputed way do execute His will. Let them not therefore complain of
   immaturity that die about thirty; they fall but like the whole World,
   whose solid and well-composed substance must not expect the duration
   and period of its constitution: when all things are completed in it,
   its age is accomplished; and the last and general fever may as
   naturally destroy it before six thousand, as me before forty. There is
   therefore some other hand that twines the thread of life than that of
   Nature: we are not onely ignorant in Antipathies and occult qualities;
   our ends are as obscure as our beginnings; the line of our days is
   drawn by night, and the various effects therein by a pensil that is
   invisible; wherein though we confess our ignorance, I am sure we do not
   err if we say it is the hand of God.

   XLIV. I am much taken with two verses of Lucan, since I have been able
   not onely, as we do at School, to construe, but understand:

   Victurosque Dei celant, ut vivere durent, Felix esse mori. [102]

   We're all deluded, vainly searching ways To make us happy by the length
   of days; For cunningly to make's protract this breath, The Gods conceal
   the happiness of Death.

   There be many excellent strains in that Poet, wherewith his Stoical
   Genius hath liberally supplied him; and truely there are singular
   pieces in the Philosophy of Zeno, and doctrine of the Stoicks, which I
   perceive, delivered in a Pulpit, pass for current Divinity: yet herein
   are they in extreams, that can allow a man to be his own Assassine, and
   so highly extol the end and suicide of Cato. This is indeed not to fear
   death, but yet to be afraid of life. It is a brave act of valour to
   contemn death; but where life is more terrible than death, it is then
   the truest valour to dare to live. And herein Religion hath taught us a
   noble example; for all the valiant acts of Curtius, Scevola, or Codrus,
   do not parallel or match that one of Job; and sure there is no torture
   to the rack of a disease, nor any Ponyards in death it self like those
   in the way or prologue to it.

   Emori nolo, sed me esse mortuum nihil curo. [103]

   I would not die, but care not to be dead.

   Were I of Caesar's Religion, I should be of his desires, and wish
   rather to go off at one blow, then to be sawed in pieces by the grating
   torture of a disease. Men that look no farther than their outsides,
   think health an appurtenance unto life, and quarrel with their
   constitutions for being sick; but I, that have examined the parts of
   man, and know upon what tender filaments that Fabrick hangs, do wonder
   that we are not always so; and, considering the thousand doors that
   lead to death, do thank my God that we can die but once. Tis not onely
   the mischief of diseases, and the villany of poysons, that make an end
   of us; we vainly accuse the fury of Guns, and the new inventions of
   death; it is in the power of every hand to destroy us, and we are
   beholding unto every one we meet, he doth not kill us. There is
   therefore but one comfort left, that, though it be in the power of the
   weakest arm to take away life, it is not in the strongest to deprive us
   of death: God would not exempt Himself from that, the misery of
   immortality in the flesh, He undertook not that was immortal. Certainly
   there is no happiness within this circle of flesh, nor is it in the
   Opticks of these eyes to behold felicity. The first day of our Jubilee
   is Death; the Devil hath therefore failed of his desires: we are
   happier with death than we should have been without it: there is no
   misery but in himself, where there is no end of misery; and so indeed,
   in his own sense, the Stoick [104] is in the right. He forgets that he
   can dye who complains of misery; we are in the power of no calamity
   while death is in our own.

   XLV. Now, besides this literal and positive kind of death, there are
   others whereof Divines make mention, and those, I think, not merely
   Metaphorical, as mortification, dying unto sin and the World.
   Therefore, I say, every man hath a double Horoscope, one of his
   humanity, his birth; another of his Christianity, his baptism; and from
   this do I compute or calculate my Nativity, not reckoning those Horae
   combustae [105] and odd days, or esteeming my self any thing, before I
   was my Saviours, and inrolled in the Register of Christ. Whosoever
   enjoys not this life, I count him but an apparition, though he wear
   about him the sensible affections [106] of flesh. In these moral
   acceptions, [107] the way to be immortal is to dye daily: nor can I
   think I have the true Theory of death, when I contemplate a skull, or
   behold a Skeleton, with those vulgar imaginations it casts upon us; I
   have therefore enlarged that common Memento mori, [Remember you must
   die] into a more Christian memorandum, Memento quatuor Novissima,
   [Remember the four last things] those four inevitable points of us all,
   Death, Judgement, Heaven, and Hell. Neither did the contemplations of
   the Heathens rest in their graves, without a further thought of
   Rhadamanth, [108] or some judicial proceeding after death, though in
   another way, and upon suggestion of their natural reasons. I cannot but
   marvail from what Sibyl or Oracle they stole the Prophesie of the
   Worlds destruction by fire, or whence Lucan learned to say,

   Communis mundo superest rogus, ossibus astra Misturus. [109]

   There yet remains to th' World one common Fire, Wherein our bones with
   stars shall make one Pyre.

   I believe the World grows near its end, yet is neither old nor decayed,
   nor shall ever perish upon the ruines of its own Principles. As the
   work of Creation was above Nature, so is its adversary, annihilation;
   without which the World hath not its end, but its mutation. Now what
   force should be able to consume it thus far, without the breath of God,
   which is the truest consuming flame, my Philosophy cannot inform me.
   Some believe there went not a minute to the Worlds creation, nor shall
   there go to its destruction; those six days, so punctually described,
   make not to them one moment, but rather seem to manifest the method and
   Idea of the great work of the intellect of God, than the manner how He
   proceeded in its operation. I cannot dream that there should be at the
   last day any such Judicial proceeding, or calling to the Bar, as indeed
   the Scripture seems to imply, and the literal Commentators do conceive:
   for unspeakable mysteries in the Scriptures are often delivered in a
   vulgar and illustrative way; and, being written unto man, are
   delivered, not as they truely are, but as they may be understood;
   wherein, notwithstanding, the different interpretations according to
   different capacities may stand firm with our devotion, nor be any way
   prejudicial to each single edification.

Section V.

   XLVI. Now to determine the day and year of this inevitable time, is not
   onely convincible [110] and statute-madness, [111] but also manifest
   impiety. How shall we interpret Elias six thousand years, [112] or
   imagine the secret communicated to a Rabbi, which God hath denyed unto
   His Angels? It had been an excellent Quaere [113] to have posed the
   Devil of Delphos, [114] and must needs have forced him to some strange
   amphibology. [115] It hath not onely mocked the predictions of sundry
   Astrologers in Ages past, but the prophesies of many melancholy heads
   in these present; who, neither understanding reasonably things past or
   present, pretend a knowledge of things to come: heads ordained onely to
   manifest the incredible effects of melancholy, and to fulfil old
   prophecies rather than be the authors of new. In those days there shall
   com Wars and rumours of Wars, to me seems no prophecy, but a constant
   truth, in all times verified since it was pronounced. There shall be
   signs in the Moon and Stars; how comes He then like a Thief in the
   night, when He gives an item of His Coming? That common sign drawn from
   the revelation of Antichrist, is as obscure as any: in our common
   compute He hath been come these many years: but for my own part, (to
   speak freely,) I am half of opinion that Antichrist is the
   Philosopher's stone in Divinity, for the discovery and invention
   whereof, though there be prescribed rules and probable inductions, yet
   hath hardly any man attained the perfect discovery thereof. That
   general opinion that the World grows near its end, hath possessed all
   ages past as nearly as ours. I am afraid that the Souls that now
   depart, cannot escape that lingring expostulation of the Saints under
   the Altar, Quousque, Domine? How long, O Lord? and groan in the
   expectation of that great Jubilee.

   XLVII. This is the day that must make good that great attribute of God,
   His Justice; that must reconcile those unanswerable doubts that torment
   the wisest understandings; and reduce those seeming inequalities and
   respective distributions in this world, to an equality and recompensive
   Justice in the next. This is that one day, that shall include and
   comprehend all that went before it; wherein, as in the last scene, all
   the Actors must enter, to compleat and make up the Catastrophe of this
   great piece. This is the day whose memory hath onely power to make us
   honest in the dark, and to be vertuous without a witness.

   Ipsa sui pretium virtus sibi, [116]

   that Vertue is her own reward, is but a cold principle, and not able to
   maintain our variable resolutions in a constant and setled way of
   goodness. I have practised that honest artifice of Seneca, and in my
   retired and solitary imaginations, to detain me from the foulness of
   vice, have fancied to my self the presence of my dear and worthiest
   friends, before whom I should lose my head, rather than be vitious: yet
   herein I found that there was nought but moral honesty, and this was
   not be vertuous for His sake Who must reward us at the last. I have
   tryed if I could reach that great resolution of his, to be honest
   without a thought of Heaven or Hell: and indeed I found, upon a natural
   inclination and inbred loyalty unto virtue, that I could serve her
   without a livery, [117] yet not in that resolved and venerable way, but
   that the frailty of my nature, upon an easie temptation, might be
   induced to forget her. The life, therefore, and spirit of all our
   actions is the resurrection, and a stable apprehension that our ashes
   shall enjoy the fruit of our pious endeavours: without this, all
   Religion is a Fallacy, and those impieties of Lucian, Euripides, and
   Julian, are no blasphemies, but subtle verities, and Atheists have been
   the onely Philosophers.

   XLVIII. How shall the dead arise, is no question of my Faith; to
   believe only possibilities, is not Faith, but meer Philosophy. Many
   things are true in Divinity, which are neither inducible by reason, nor
   confirmable by sense; and many things in Philosophy confirmable by
   sense, yet not inducible by reason. Thus it is impossible by any solid
   or demonstrative reasons to perswade a man to believe the conversion
   [118] of the Needle to the North; though this be possible, and true,
   and easily credible, upon a single experiment unto the sense. I believe
   that our estranged and divided ashes shall unite again; that our
   separated dust, after so many Pilgrimages and transformations into the
   parts of Minerals, Plants, Animals, Elements, shall at the Voice of God
   return into their primitive shapes, and joyn again to make up their
   primary and predestinate forms. As at the Creation there was a
   separation of that confused mass into its species; so at the
   destruction thereof there shall be a separation into its distinct
   individuals. As at the Creation of the World, all the distinct species
   that we behold lay involved in one mass, till the fruitful Voice of God
   separated this united multitude into its several species; so at the
   last day, when those corrupted reliques shall be scattered in the
   Wilderness of forms, and seem to have forgot their proper habits, God
   by a powerful Voice shall command them back into their proper shapes,
   and call them out by their single individuals. Then shall appear the
   fertility of Adam, and the magick of that sperm [119] that hath dilated
   into so many millions. I have often beheld as a miracle, that
   artificial resurrection and revivification [120] of Mercury, how being
   mortified into a thousand shapes, it assumes again its own, and returns
   into its numerical [121] self. Let us speak naturally and like
   Philosophers, the forms of alterable bodies in these sensible
   corruptions perish not; nor, as we imagine, wholly quit their mansions,
   but retire and contract themselves into their secret and unaccessible
   parts, where they may best protect themselves from the action of their
   Antagonist. A plant or vegetable consumed to ashes to a contemplative
   and school-Philosopher seems utterly destroyed, and the form to have
   taken his leave for ever; but to a sensible Artist the forms are not
   perished, but withdrawn into their incombustible part, where they lie
   secure from the action of that devouring element. This is made good by
   experience, which can from the Ashes of a Plant revive the plant, and
   from its cinders recall it into its stalk and leaves again. What the
   Art of man can do in these inferiour pieces, what blasphemy is it to
   affirm the finger of God cannot do in these more perfect and sensible
   structures! This is that mystical Philosophy, from whence no true
   Scholar becomes an Atheist, but from the visible effects of nature
   grows up a real Divine, and beholds not in a dream, as Ezekiel, but in
   an ocular and visible object, the types of his resurrection.

   XLIX. Now, the necessary Mansions of our restored selves are those two
   contrary and incompatible places we call Heaven and Hell. To define
   them, or strictly to determine what and where these are, surpasseth my
   Divinity. That elegant [122] Apostle, [123] which seemed to have a
   glimpse of Heaven, hath left but a negative description thereof; which
   neither eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor can enter into the heart
   of man: he was translated out of himself to behold it; but, being
   returned into himself, could not express it. St. John's description by
   Emerals, Chrysolites, and precious Stones, is too weak to express the
   material Heaven we behold. Briefly therefore, where the Soul hath the
   full measure and complement of happiness; where the boundless appetite
   of that spirit remains compleatly satisfied, that it can neither desire
   addition nor alteration: that, I think, is truly Heaven: and this can
   onely be in the enjoyment of that essence, whose infinite goodness is
   able to terminate the desires of it self, and the unsatiable wishes of
   ours: wherever God will thus manifest Himself, there is Heaven, though
   within the circle of this sensible world. Thus the Soul of man may be
   in Heaven any where, even within the limits of his own proper body; and
   when it ceaseth to live in the body, it may remain in its own soul,
   that is, its Creator: and thus we may say that St. Paul, whether in the
   body, or out of the body, was yet in Heaven. To place it in the
   Empyreal, or beyond the tenth sphear, is to forget the world's
   destruction; for, when this sensible world shall be destroyed, all
   shall then be here as it is now there, an Empyreal Heaven, a quasi
   vacuity; when to ask where Heaven is, is to demand where the Presence
   of God is, or where we have the glory of that happy vision. Moses, that
   was bred up in all the learning of the Egyptians, committed a gross
   absurdity in Philosophy, when with these eyes of flesh he desired to
   see God, and petitioned his Maker, that is, Truth it self, to a
   contradiction. Those that imagine Heaven and Hell neighbours, and
   conceive a vicinity between those two extreams, upon consequence of the
   Parable, where Dives discoursed with Lazarus in Abraham's bosome, do
   too grosly conceive of those glorified creatures, whose eyes shall
   easily out-see the Sun, and behold without a perspective [124] the
   extreamest distances: for if there shall be in our glorified eyes, the
   faculty of sight and reception of objects, I could think the visible
   species there to be in as unlimitable a way as now the intellectual. I
   grant that two bodies placed beyond the tenth sphear, or in a vacuity,
   according to Aristotle's Philosophy, could not behold each other,
   because there wants a body or Medium to hand and transport the visible
   rays of the object unto the sense; but when there shall be a general
   defect of either Medium to convey, or light to prepare and dispose that
   Medium, and yet a perfect vision, we must suspend the rules of our
   Philosophy, and make all good by a more absolute piece of opticks.

   L. I cannot tell how to say that fire is the essence of Hell: I know
   not what to make of Purgatory, or conceive a flame that can either prey
   upon, or purifie the substance of a Soul. Those flames of Sulphur
   mention'd in the Scriptures, I take not to be understood of this
   present Hell, but of that to come, where fire shall make up the
   complement of our tortures, and have a body or subject wherein to
   manifest its tyranny. Some, who have had the honour to be textuary in
   Divinity, are of opinion it shall be the same specifical fire with
   ours. This is hard to conceive; yet can I make good how even that may
   prey upon our bodies, and yet not consume us: for in this material
   World there are bodies that persist invincible in the powerfullest
   flames; and though by the action of fire they fall into ignition and
   liquation, yet will they never suffer a destruction. I would gladly
   know how Moses with an actual fire calcined or burnt the Golden Calf
   unto powder: for that mystical metal of Gold, whose solary [125] and
   celestial nature I admire, exposed unto the violence of fire, grows
   onely hot, and liquifies, but consumeth not; so, when the consumable
   and volatile pieces of our bodies shall be refined into a more
   impregnable and fixed temper like Gold, though they suffer from the
   action of flames, they shall never perish, but lye immortal in the arms
   of fire. And surely, if this frame must suffer onely by the action of
   this element, there will many bodies escape; and not onely Heaven, but
   Earth will not be at an end, but rather a beginning. For at present it
   is not earth, but a composition of fire, water, earth, and air; but at
   that time, spoiled of these ingredients, it shall appear in a substance
   more like it self, its ashes. Philosophers that opinioned the worlds
   destruction by fire, did never dream of annihilation, which is beyond
   the power of sublunary causes; for the last and proper action of that
   element is but vitrification, or a reduction of a body into glass; and
   therefore some of our Chymicks facetiously affirm, that at the last
   fire all shall be christallized and reverberated into glass, which is
   the utmost action of that element. Nor need we fear this term,
   annihilation, or wonder that God will destroy the works of His
   Creation; for man subsisting, who is, and will then truely appear, a
   Microcosm, the world cannot be said to be destroyed. For the eyes of
   God, and perhaps also of our glorified selves, shall as really behold
   and contemplate the World in its Epitome or contracted essence, as now
   it doth at large and in its dilated substance. In the seed of a Plant
   to the eyes of God, and to the understanding of man, there exists,
   though in an invisible way, the perfect leaves, flowers, and fruit
   thereof; for things that are in posse to the sense, are actually
   existent to the understanding. Thus God beholds all things, Who
   contemplates as fully His works in their Epitome, as in their full
   volume; and beheld as amply the whole world in that little compendium
   of the sixth day, as in the scattered and dilated pieces of those five
   before.

   LI. Men commonly set forth the torments of Hell by fire, and the
   extremity of corporal afflictions, and describe Hell in the same method
   that Mahomet doth Heaven. This indeed makes a noise, and drums in
   popular ears; but if this be the terrible piece thereof, it is not
   worthy to stand in diameter [126] with Heaven, whose happiness consists
   in that part that is best able to comprehend it, that immortal essence,
   that translated divinity and colony of God, the Soul. Surely, though we
   place Hell under Earth, the Devil's walk and purlue is about it: men
   speak too popularly who place it in those flaming mountains, which to
   grosser apprehensions represent Hell. The heart of man is the place the
   Devils dwell in: I feel sometimes a Hell within my self; Lucifer keeps
   his Court in my breast, Legion is revived in me. There are as many
   Hells, as Anaxagoras conceited worlds. [127] There was more than one
   Hell in Magdalene, when there were seven Devils, for every Devil is an
   Hell unto himself; he holds enough of torture in his own ubi, and needs
   not the misery of circumference to afflict him: and thus a distracted
   Conscience here, is a shadow or introduction unto Hell hereafter. Who
   can but pity the merciful intention of those hands that do destroy
   themselves? the Devil, were it in his power, would do the like; which
   being impossible, his miseries are endless, and he suffers most in that
   attribute wherein he is impassible, [128] his immortality.

   LII. I thank God, and with joy I mention it, I was never afraid of
   Hell, nor never grew pale at the description of that place. I have so
   fixed my contemplations on Heaven, that I have almost forgot the Idea
   of Hell, and am afraid rather to lose the Joys of the one, than endure
   the misery of the other: to be deprived of them is a perfect Hell, and
   needs, methinks, no addition to compleat our afflictions. That terrible
   term hath never detained me from sin, nor do I owe any good action to
   the name thereof. I fear God, yet am not afraid of Him: His Mercies
   make me ashamed of my sins, before His Judgements afraid thereof. These
   are the forced and secondary method of His wisdom, which He useth but
   as the last remedy, and upon provocation; a course rather to deter the
   wicked, than incite the virtuous to His worship. I can hardly think
   there was ever any scared into Heaven; they go the fairest way to
   Heaven that would serve God without a Hell; other Mercenaries, that
   crouch into Him in fear of Hell, though they term themselves the
   servants, are indeed but the slaves, of the Almighty.

   LIII. And to be true, and speak my soul, when I survey the occurrences
   of my life, and call into account the Finger of God, I can perceive
   nothing but an abyss and mass of mercies, either in general to mankind,
   or in particular to my self. And (whether out of the prejudice of my
   affection, or an inverting and partial conceit of His mercies, I know
   not; but) those which others term crosses, afflictions, judgements,
   misfortunes, to me, who inquire farther into them then their visible
   effects, they both appear, and in event have ever proved, the secret
   and dissembled favours of His affection. It is a singular piece of
   Wisdom to apprehend truly, and without passion the Works of God, and so
   well to distinguish His Justice from His Mercy, as not to miscall those
   noble Attributes: yet it is likewise an honest piece of Logick, so to
   dispute and argue the proceedings of God, as to distinguish even His
   judgments into mercies. For God is merciful unto all, because better to
   the worst than the best deserve; and to say He punisheth none in this
   World, though it be a Paradox, is no absurdity. To one that hath
   committed Murther, if the Judge should only ordain a Fine, it were a
   madness to call this a punishment, and to repine at the sentence,
   rather than admire the clemency of the Judge. Thus, our offences being
   mortal, and deserving not only Death, but Damnation, if the goodness of
   God be content to traverse and pass them over with a loss, misfortune,
   or disease, what frensie were it to term this a punishment, rather than
   an extremity of mercy, and to groan under the rod of His Judgements,
   rather than admire the Scepter of His Mercies! Therefore to adore,
   honour, and admire Him, is a debt of gratitude due from the obligation
   of our nature, states, and conditions; and with these thoughts, He that
   knows them best, will not deny that I adore Him. That I obtain Heaven,
   and the bliss thereof, is accidental, and not the intended work of my
   devotion; it being a felicity I can neither think to deserve, nor
   scarce in modesty to expect. For these two ends of us all, either as
   rewards or punishments, are mercifully ordained and disproportionably
   disposed unto our actions; the one being so far beyond our deserts, the
   other so infinitely below our demerits.

   LIV. There is no Salvation to those that believe not in Christ, that
   is, say some, since His Nativity, and, as Divinity affirmeth, before
   also; which makes me much apprehend [129] the ends of those honest
   Worthies and Philosophers which dyed before His Incarnation. It is hard
   to place those Souls in Hell, whose worthy lives do teach us Virtue on
   Earth; methinks, amongst those many subdivisions of Hell, there might
   have been one Limbo left for these. What a strange vision will it be to
   see their Poetical fictions converted into Verities, and their imagined
   and fancied Furies into real Devils! How strange to them will sound the
   History of Adam, when they shall suffer for him they never heard of!
   when they who derive their genealogy from the Gods, shall know they are
   the unhappy issue of sinful man! It is an insolent part of reason, to
   controvert the works of God, or question the Justice of His
   proceedings. Could Humility teach others, as it hath instructed me, to
   contemplate the infinite and incomprehensible distance betwixt the
   Creator and the Creature; or did we seriously perpend that one simile
   of St. Paul, Shall the Vessel say to the Potter, "Why hast thou made me
   thus?" it would prevent these arrogant disputes of reason; nor would we
   argue the definitive sentence of God, either to Heaven or Hell. Men
   that live according to the right rule and law of reason, live but in
   their own kind, as beasts do in theirs; who justly obey the prescript
   of their natures, and therefore cannot reasonably demand a reward of
   their actions, as onely obeying the natural dictates of their reason.
   It will, therefore, and must at last appear, that all salvation is
   through Christ; which verity, I fear, these great examples of virtue
   must confirm, and make it good how the perfectest actions of earth have
   no title or claim unto Heaven.

   LV. Nor truely do I think the lives of these, or of any other, were
   ever correspondent, or in all points conformable, unto their doctrines.
   It is evident that Aristotle transgressed the rule of his own Ethicks.
   The Stoicks that condemn passion, and command a man to laugh in
   Phalaris [130] his Bull, could not endure without a groan a fit of the
   Stone or Colick. The Scepticks that affirmed they knew nothing, even in
   that opinion confute themselves, and thought they knew more than all
   the World beside. Diogenes I hold to be the most vain-glorious man of
   his time, and more ambitious in refusing all Honours, than Alexander in
   rejecting none. Vice and the Devil put a Fallacy upon our Reasons, and,
   provoking us too hastily to run from it, entangle and profound us
   deeper in it. The Duke of Venice, that weds himself unto the Sea by a
   Ring of Gold, I will not argue of prodigality, because it is a
   solemnity of good use and consequence in the State; but the Philosopher
   that threw his money into the Sea to avoid Avarice, was a notorious
   prodigal. There is no road or ready way to virtue: it is not an easie
   point of art to disentangle our selves from this riddle, or web of Sin.
   To perfect virtue, as to Religion, there is required a Panoplia, or
   compleat armour; that, whilst we lye at close ward against one Vice, we
   lye not open to the venny [131] of another. And indeed wiser
   discretions that have the thred of reason to conduct them, offend
   without pardon; whereas underheads may stumble without dishonour. There
   go so many circumstances to piece up one good action, that it is a
   lesson to be good, and we are forced to be virtuous by the book. Again,
   the Practice of men holds not an equal pace, yea, and often runs
   counter to their Theory: we naturally know what is good, but naturally
   pursue what is evil: the Rhetorick wherewith I perswade another, cannot
   perswade my self. There is a depraved appetite in us, that will with
   patience hear the learned instructions of Reason, but yet perform no
   farther than agrees to its own irregular humour. In brief, we all are
   monsters, that is, a composition of Man and Beast, wherein we must
   endeavor to be as the Poets fancy that wise man Chiron, [132] that is,
   to have the Region of Man above that of Beast, and Sense to sit but at
   the feet of Reason. Lastly, I do desire with God that all, but yet
   affirm with men that few, shall know Salvation; that the bridge is
   narrow, the passage strait, unto life: yet those who do confine the
   Church of God, either to particular Nations, Churches, or Families,
   have made it far narrower than our Saviour ever meant it.

   LVI. The vulgarity of those judgements that wrap the Church of God in
   Strabo's cloak, [133] and restrain it unto Europe, seem to me as bad
   Geographers as Alexander, who thought he had Conquer'd all the World,
   when he had not subdued the half of any part thereof. For we cannot
   deny the Church of God both in Asia and Africa, if we do not forget the
   Peregrinations of the Apostles, the deaths of the Martyrs, the Sessions
   of many and (even in our reformed judgement) lawful Councils, held in
   those parts in the minority and nonage of ours. Nor must a few
   differences, more remarkable in the eyes of man than perhaps in the
   judgement of God, excommunicate from Heaven one another; much less
   those Christians who are in a manner all Martyrs, maintaining their
   Faith in the noble way of persecution, and serving God in the Fire,
   whereas we honour him but in the Sunshine. "Tis true we all hold there
   is a number of Elect, and many to be saved; yet, take our Opinions
   together, and from the confusion thereof there will be no such thing as
   salvation, nor shall any one be saved. For first, the Church of Rome
   condemneth us, we likewise them; the Subreformists and Sectaries
   sentence the Doctrine of our Church as damnable; the Atomist, [134] or
   Familist, [135] reprobates all these; and all these, them again. Thus,
   whilst the Mercies of God do promise us Heaven, our conceits and
   opinions exclude us from that place. There must be, therefore, more
   than one St. Peter: particular Churches and Sects usurp the gates of
   Heaven, and turn the key against each other; and thus we go to Heaven
   against each others wills, conceits, and opinions, and, with as much
   uncharity as ignorance, do err, I fear, in points not only of our own,
   but one anothers salvation.

   LVII. I believe many are saved, who to man seem reprobated; and many
   are reprobated, who, in the opinion and sentence of man, stand elected.
   There will appear at the Last day strange and unexpected examples both
   of His Justice and His Mercy; and therefore to define either, is folly
   in man, and insolency even in the Devils. Those acute and subtil
   spirits, in all their sagacity, can hardly divine who shall be saved;
   which if they could Prognostick, their labour were at an end, nor need
   they compass the earth seeking whom they may devour. Those who, upon a
   rigid application of the Law, sentence Solomon unto damnation, condemn
   not onely him, but themselves, and the whole World: for, by the Letter
   and written Word of God, we are without exception in the state of
   Death; but there is a prerogative of God, and an arbitrary pleasure
   above the Letter of His own Law, by which alone we can pretend unto
   Salvation, and through which Solomon might be as easily saved as those
   who condemn him.

   LVIII. The number of those who pretend unto Salvation, and those
   infinite swarms who think to pass through the eye of this Needle, have
   much amazed me. That name and compellation of little Flock, doth not
   comfort, but deject, my Devotion; especially when I reflect upon mine
   own unworthiness, wherein, according to my humble apprehensions, I am
   below them all. I believe there shall never be an Anarchy in Heaven;
   but, as there are Hierarchies amongst the Angels, so shall there be
   degrees of priority amongst the Saints. Yet is it (I protest,) beyond
   my ambition to aspire unto the first ranks; my desires onely are (and I
   shall be happy therein,) to be but the last man, and bring up the Rere
   in Heaven.

   LIX. Again, I am confident and fully perswaded, yet dare not take my
   oath, of my Salvation. I am as it were sure, and do believe without all
   doubt, that there is such a City as Constantinople; yet for me to take
   my Oath thereon were a kind of Perjury, because I hold no infallible
   warrant from my own sense to confirm me in the certainty thereof. And
   truly, though many pretend an absolute certainty of their Salvation,
   yet, when an humble Soul shall contemplate her own unworthiness, she
   shall meet with many doubts, and suddenly find how little we stand in
   need of the Precept of St.Paul, Work out your salvation with fear and
   trembling. That which is the cause of my Election, I hold to be the
   cause of my Salvation, which was the mercy and beneplacit [136] of God,
   before I was, or the foundation of the World. Before Abraham was, I am,
   is the saying of Christ; yet is it true in some sense, if I say it of
   my self; for I was not onely before my self, but Adam, that is, in the
   Idea of God, and the decree of that Synod held from all Eternity. And
   in this sense, I say, the World was before the Creation, and at an end
   before it had a beginning; and thus was I dead before I was alive:
   though my grave be England, my dying place was Paradise: and Eve
   miscarried of me before she conceiv'd of Cain.

   LX. Insolent, zeals, [137] that do decry good Works and rely onely upon
   Faith, take not away merit: for, depending upon the efficacy of their
   Faith, they enforce the condition of God, and in a more sophistical way
   do seem to challenge Heaven. It was decreed by God, that only those
   that lapt in the water like Dogs, should have the honour to destroy the
   Midianites; yet could none of those justly challenge, or imagine he
   deserved, that honour thereupon. I do not deny but that true Faith, and
   such as God requires, is not onely a mark or token, but also a means,
   of our Salvation; but where to find this, is as obscure to me as my
   last end. And if our Saviour could object unto His own Disciples and
   Favourites, a Faith, that, to the quantity of a grain of Mustard-seed,
   is able to remove Mountains; surely, that which we boast of, is not any
   thing, or at the most, but a remove from nothing. This is the Tenor of
   my belief; wherein though there be many things singular, and to the
   humour of my irregular self, yet if they square not with maturer
   Judgements, I disclaim them, and do no further father them, than the
   learned and best judgements shall authorize them.

Section I.

   Now for that other Virtue of Charity, without which Faith is a meer
   notion, and of no existence, I have ever endeavoured to nourish the
   merciful disposition and humane inclination I borrowed from my Parents,
   and regulate it to the written and prescribed Laws of Charity. And if I
   hold the true Anatomy of my self, I am delineated and naturally framed
   to such a piece of virtue; for I am of a constitution so general, that
   it consorts and symphathiseth with all things. I have no antipathy, or
   rather Idiosyncrasie, in dyet, humour, air, any thing. I wonder not at
   the French for their dishes of Frogs, Snails and Toadstools, nor at the
   Jews for Locusts and Grasshoppers; but being amongst them, make them my
   common Viands, and I find they agree with my Stomach as well as theirs.
   I could digest a Salad gathered in a Church-yard, as well as in a
   Garden. I cannot start at the presence of a Serpent, Scorpion, Lizard,
   or Salamander: at the sight of a Toad or Viper, I find in me no desire
   to take up a stone to destroy them. I feel not in my self those common
   Antipathies that I can discover in others: those National repugnances
   do not touch me, nor do I behold with prejudice the French, Italian,
   Spaniard, or Dutch: but where I find their actions in balance with my
   Country-men's, I honour, love, and embrace them in the same degree. I
   was born in the eighth Climate, [138] but seem for to be framed and
   constellated unto all. I am no Plant that will not prosper out of a
   Garden. All places, all airs, make unto me one Countrey; I am in
   England every where, and under any Meridian. I have been shipwrackt,
   yet am not enemy with the Sea or Winds; I can study, play, or sleep in
   a Tempest. In brief, I am averse from nothing: my Conscience would give
   me the lye if I should say I absolutely detest or hate any essence but
   the Devil; or so at least abhor any thing, but that we might come to
   composition. If there be any among those common objects of hatred I do
   contemn and laugh at, it is that great enemy of Reason, Virtue and
   Religion, the Multitude: that numerous piece of monstrosity, which,
   taken asunder, seem men, and the reasonable creatures of God; but,
   confused together, make but one great beast, and a monstrosity more
   prodigious than Hydra. It is no breach of Charity to call these Fools;
   it is the style all holy Writers have afforded them, set down by
   Solomon in Canonical Scripture, and a point of our Faith to believe so.
   Neither in the name of Multitude do I onely include the base and minor
   sort of people; there is a rabble even amongst the Gentry, a sort of
   Plebeian heads, whose fancy moves with the same wheel as these; men in
   the same Level with Mechanicks, though their fortunes do somewhat guild
   their infirmities, and their purses compound for their follies. But as,
   in casting account, three or four men together come short in account of
   one man placed by himself below them; so neither are a troop of these
   ignorant Doradoes [139] of that true esteem and value, as many a
   forlorn person, whose condition doth place him below their feet. Let us
   speak like Politicians: [140] there is a Nobility without Heraldry, a
   natural dignity, whereby one man is ranked with another, another filed
   before him, according to the quality of his Desert, and preheminence of
   his good parts. Though the corruption of these times and the byas of
   present practice wheel another way, thus it was in the first and
   primitive Commonwealths, and is yet in the integrity and Cradle of
   well-order'd Polities, till corruption getteth ground; ruder desires
   labouring after that which wiser considerations contemn, every one
   having a liberty to amass and heap up riches, and they a licence or
   faculty to do or purchase any thing.

   II. This general and indifferent temper of mine doth more neerly
   dispose me to this noble virtue. It is a happiness to be born and
   framed unto virtue, and to grow up from the seeds of nature, rather
   than the inoculation and forced graffs of education: yet if we are
   directed only by our particular Natures, and regulate our inclinations
   by no higher rule than that of our reasons, we are but Moralists;
   Divinity will still call us Heathens. Therefore this great work of
   charity must have other motives, ends, and impulsions. I give no alms
   only to satisfy the hunger of my Brother, but to fulfil and accomplish
   the Will and Command of my God: I draw not my purse for his sake that
   demands it, but His That enjoyned it: I relieve no man upon the
   Rhetorick of his miseries, nor to content mine own commiserating
   disposition; for this is still but moral charity, and an act that oweth
   more to passion than reason. He that relieves another upon the bare
   suggestion and bowels of pity, doth not this, so much for his sake as
   for his own; for by compassion we make others misery our own, and so,
   by relieving them, we relieve our selves also. It is as erroneous a
   conceit to redress other Mens misfortunes upon the common
   considerations of merciful natures, that it may be one day our own
   case; for this is a sinister and politick kind of charity, whereby we
   seem to bespeak the pities of men in the like occasions. And truly I
   have observed that those professed Eleemosynaries, though in a croud or
   multitude, do yet direct and place their petitions on a few and
   selected persons: there is surely a Physiognomy, which those
   experienced and Master Mendicants observe, whereby they instantly
   discover a merciful aspect, and will single out a face wherein they spy
   the signatures and marks of Mercy. For there are mystically in our
   faces certain Characters which carry in them the motto of our Souls,
   wherein he that cannot read A. B. C. may read our natures. I hold
   moreover that there is a Phytognomy, or Physiognomy, not only of Men,
   but of Plants and Vegetables; and in every one of them some outward
   figures which hang as signs or bushes [141] of their inward forms. The
   Finger of God hath left an Inscription upon all His works, not
   graphical or composed of Letters, but of their several forms,
   constitutions, parts, and operations, which, aptly joyned together, do
   make one word that doth express their natures. By these Letters God
   calls the Stars by their names; and by this Alphabet Adam assigned to
   every creature a name peculiar to its Nature. Now there are, besides
   these Characters in our Faces, certain mystical figures in our Hands,
   which I dare not call meer dashes, strokes a la volee, or at random,
   because delineated by a Pencil that never works in vain; and hereof I
   take more particular notice, because I carry that in mine own hand
   which I could never read of nor discover in another. Aristotle, I
   confess, in his acute and singular Book of Physiognomy, hath made no
   mention of Chiromancy; yet I believe the Egyptians, who were neerer
   addicted to those abstruse and mystical sciences, had a knowledge
   therein, to which those vagabond and counterfeit Egyptians [142] did
   after pretend, and perhaps retained a few corrupted principles, which
   sometimes might verifie their prognosticks.

   It is the common wonder of all men, how among so many millions of
   faces, there should be none alike: now contrary, I wonder as much how
   there should be any. He that shall consider how many thousand several
   words have been carelessly and without study composed out of
   twenty-four Letters; withal, how many hundred lines there are to be
   drawn in the Fabrick of one Man, shall easily find that this variety is
   necessary; and it will be very hard that they shall so concur as to
   make one portract like another. Let a Painter carelesly limb out a
   million of Faces, and you shall find them all different; yea, let him
   have his Copy before him, yet after all his art there will remain a
   sensible distinction; for the pattern or example of every thing is the
   perfectest in that kind, whereof we still come short, though we
   transcend or go beyond it, because herein it is wide, and agrees not in
   all points unto the copy. Nor doth the similitude of Creatures
   disparage the variety of Nature, nor any way confound the Works of God.
   For even in things alike there is diversity; and those that do seem to
   accord do manifestly disagree. And thus is man like God; for in the
   same things that we resemble Him, we are utterly different from Him.
   There was never anything so like another as in all points to concur:
   there will ever some reserved difference slip in, to prevent the
   identity; without which, two several things would not be alike, but the
   same, which is impossible.

   III. But to return from Philosophy to Charity: I hold not so narrow a
   conceit of this virtue, as to conceive that to give Alms is onely to be
   Charitable, or think a piece of Liberality can comprehend the Total of
   Charity. Divinity hath wisely divided the act thereof into many
   branches, and hath taught us in this narrow way many paths unto
   goodness; as many ways as we may do good, so many ways we may be
   charitable. There are infirmities not onely of Body, but of Soul, and
   Fortunes, which do require the merciful hand of our abilities. I cannot
   contemn a man for ignorance, but behold him with as much pity as I do
   Lazarus. It is no greater Charity to cloath his body, than apparel the
   nakedness of his Soul. It is an honourable object to see the reasons of
   other men wear our Liveries, and their borrowed understandings do
   homage to the bounty of ours: it is the cheapest way of beneficence,
   and, like the natural charity of the Sun, illuminates another without
   obscuring itself. To be reserved and caitiff in this part of goodness,
   is the sordidest piece of covetousness, and more contemptible than
   pecuniary Avarice. To this (as calling my self a Scholar,) I am obliged
   by the duty of my condition: I make not therefore my head a grave, but
   a treasure, of knowledge; I intend no Monopoly, but a community, in
   learning; I study not for my own sake only, but for theirs that study
   not for themselves. I envy no man that knows more than my self, but
   pity them that know less. I instruct no man as an exercise of my
   knowledge, or with intent rather to nourish and keep it alive in mine
   own head then beget and propagate it in his: and in the midst of all my
   endeavours there is but one thought that dejects me, that my acquired
   parts must perish with my self, nor can be Legacied among my honoured
   Friends. I cannot fall out or contemn a man for an errour, or conceive
   why a difference in Opinion should divide an affection; for
   Controversies, Disputes, and Argumentations, both in Philosophy and in
   Divinity, if they meet with discreet and peaceable natures, do not
   infringe the Laws of Charity. In all disputes, so much as there is of
   passion, so much there is of nothing to the purpose; for then Reason,
   like a bad Hound, spends upon a false Scent, and forsakes the question
   first started. And this is one reason why Controversies are never
   determined; for, though they be amply proposed, they are scarce at all
   handled, they do so swell with unnecessary Digressions; and the
   Parenthesis on the party is often as large as the main discourse upon
   the subject. The Foundations of Religion are already established, and
   the Principles of Salvation subscribed unto by all: there remains not
   many controversies worth a Passion; and yet never any disputed without,
   not only in Divinity, but inferiour Arts. What a Barpaxomuomaxia [143]
   and hot skirmish is betwixt S. and T. in Lucian.! [144] How do
   Grammarians hack and slash for the Genitive case in Jupiter! [145] How
   do they break their own pates to salve that of Priscian!

   Si foret in terris, rideret Democritus.

   [If he were on earth, Democritus would laugh.]

   Yea, even amongst wiser militants, how many wounds have been given, and
   credits slain, for the poor victory of an opinion or beggerly conquest
   of a distinction! Scholars are men of Peace, they bear no Arms, but
   their tongues are sharper than Actius his razor; [146] their Pens carry
   farther, and give a louder report than Thunder: I had rather stand the
   shock of a Basilisco, [147] than the fury of a merciless Pen. It is not
   meer Zeal to Learning, or Devotion to the Muses, that wiser Princes
   Patron the Arts, and carry an indulgent aspect unto Scholars; but a
   desire to have their names eternized by the memory of their writings,
   and a fear of the revengeful Pen of succeeding ages; for these are the
   men, that, when they have played their parts, and had their exits, must
   step out and give the moral of their Scenes, and deliver unto Posterity
   an Inventory of their Virtues and Vices. And surely there goes a great
   deal of Conscience to the compiling of an History: there is no reproach
   [148] to the scandal of a Story; it is such an authentick kind of
   falshood that with authority belies our good names to all Nations and
   Posterity.

   IV. There is another offence unto Charity, which no Author hath ever
   written of, and few take notice of; and that's the reproach, not of
   whole professions, mysteries, and conditions, but of whole Nations,
   wherein by opprobrious Epithets we miscall each other, and by an
   uncharitable Logick, from a disposition in a few, conclude a habit in
   all.

   Le mutin Anglois, et le bravache Escossois, Et le fol Francois, Le
   poultron Romain, le larron de Gascongne, L'Espagnol superbe, et
   l'Aleman yurongne.

   [The stubborn Englishman, the swaggering Scot, the foolish Frenchman,
   the coward Roman, the Gascon thief, the proud Spaniard, and the drunken
   German.]

   St. Paul, that calls the Cretians lyars, [149] doth it but indirectly,
   and upon quotation of their own Poet. [150] It is as bloody a thought
   in one way, as Nero's [151] was in another; for by a word we wound a
   thousand, and at one blow assassine the honour of a Nation. It is as
   compleat a piece of madness to miscal and rave against the times, or
   think to recal men to reason by a fit of passion. Democritus, that
   thought to laugh the times into goodness, seems to me as deeply
   Hypochondriack as Heraclitus, that bewailed them. It moves not my
   spleen to behold the multitude in their proper humours, that is, in
   their fits of folly and madness; as well understanding that wisdom is
   not prophan'd unto the World, and tis the priviledge of a few to be
   Vertuous. They that endeavour to abolish Vice, destroy also Virtue; for
   contraries, though they destroy one another, are yet the life of one
   another. Thus Virtue (abolish vice,) is an Idea. Again, the community
   [152] of sin doth not disparage goodness; for when Vice gains upon the
   major part, Virtue, in whom it remains, becomes more excellent; and
   being lost in some, multiplies its goodness in others which remain
   untouched and persist intire in the general inundation. I can therefore
   behold Vice without a Satyr, content only with an admonition, or
   instructive reprehension; for Noble Natures, and such as are capable of
   goodness, are railed into vice, that might as easily be admonished into
   virtue; and we should be all so far the Orators of goodness, as to
   protect her from the power of Vice, and maintain the cause of injured
   truth. No man can justly censure or condemn another, because indeed no
   man truly knows another. This I perceive in my self; for I am in the
   dark to all the world, and my nearest friends beheld me but in a cloud.
   Those that know me but superficially, think less of me than I do of my
   self; those of my neer acquaintance think more; God, Who truly knows
   me, knows that I am nothing; for He only beholds me and all the world,
   Who looks not on us through a derived ray, or a trajection [153] of a
   sensible species, but beholds the substance without the helps of
   accidents, and the forms of things as we their operations. Further, no
   man can judge another, because no man knows himself: for we censure
   others but as they disagree from that humour which we fancy laudable in
   our selves, and commend others but for that wherein they seem to
   quadrate [154] and consent with us. So that, in conclusion, all is but
   that we all condemn, Self-love. Tis the general complaint of these
   times, and perhaps of those past, that charity grows cold; which I
   perceive most verified in those which most do manifest the fires and
   flames of zeal; for it is a virtue that best agrees with coldest
   natures, and such as are complexioned for humility. But how shall we
   expect Charity towards others, when we are uncharitable to our selves?
   Charity begins at home, is the voice of the World; yet is every man his
   greatest enemy, and, as it were, his own Executioner. Non occides,
   [Thou shalt not kill] is the Commandment of God, yet scarce observed by
   any man; for I perceive every man is his own Atropos, [155] and lends a
   hand to cut the thred of his own days. Cain was not therefore the first
   Murtherer, but Adam, who brought in death; whereof he beheld the
   practice and example in his own son Abel, and saw that verified in the
   experience of another, which faith could not perswade him in the Theory
   of himself.

   V. There is, I think, no man that apprehends his own miseries less than
   my self, and no man that so neerly apprehends anothers. I could lose an
   arm without a tear, and with few groans, methinks; be quartered into
   pieces; yet can I weep most seriously at a Play, and receive with true
   passion the counterfeit grief of those known and professed Impostures.
   It is a barbarous part of inhumanity to add unto any afflicted parties
   misery, or indeavour to multiply in any man a passion whose single
   nature is already above his patience. This was the greatest affliction
   of Job, and those oblique expostulations of his Friends a deeper injury
   than the down-right blows of the Devil. It is not the tears of our own
   eyes only, but of our friends also, that do exhaust the current of our
   sorrows; which, falling into many streams, runs more peaceably, and is
   contented with a narrower channel. It is an act within the power of
   charity, to translate a passion out of one breast into another, and to
   divide a sorrow almost out of it self; for an affliction, like a
   dimension, may be so divided, as, if not indivisible, at least to
   become insensible. Now with my friend I desire not to share or
   participate, but to engross, his sorrows; that, by making them mine
   own, I may more easily discuss them; for in mine own reason, and within
   my self, I can command that which I cannot intreat without my self, and
   within the circle of another. I have often thought those noble pairs
   and examples of friendship not so truly Histories of what had been, as
   fictions of what should be; but I now perceive nothing in them but
   possibilities, nor anything in the Heroick examples of Damon and
   Pythias, Achilles and Patroclus, which methinks upon some grounds I
   could not perform within the narrow compass of my self. That a man
   should lay down his life for his Friend, seems strange to vulgar
   affections, and such as confine themselves within that Worldly
   principle, Charity begins at home. For mine own part I could never
   remember the relations that I held unto my self, nor the respect that I
   owe unto my own nature, in the cause of God, my Country, and my
   Friends. Next to these three, I do embrace my self. I confess I do not
   observe that order that the Schools ordain our affections, to love our
   Parents, Wives, Children, and then our Friends; for, excepting the
   injunctions of Religion, I do not find in my self such a necessary and
   indissoluble Sympathy to all those of my blood. I hope I do not break
   the fifth Commandment, if I conceive I may love my friend before the
   nearest of my blood, even those to whom I owe the principles of life. I
   never yet cast a true affection on a woman; but I have loved my friend
   as I do virtue, my soul, my God. From hence me thinks I do conceive how
   God loves man, what happiness there is in the love of God. Omitting all
   other, there are three most mystical unions: 1. two natures in one
   person; 2. three persons in one nature; 3. one soul in two bodies; for
   though indeed they be really divided, yet are they so united, as they
   seem but one, and make rather a duality than two distinct souls.

   VI. There are wonders in true affection: it is a body of Enigma's,
   mysteries, and riddles; wherein two so become one, as they both become
   two. I love my friend before my self, and yet methinks I do not love
   him enough: some few months hence my multiplied affection will make me
   believe I have not loved him at all. When I am from him, I am dead till
   I be with him; when I am with him, I am not satisfied, but would still
   be nearer him. United souls are not satisfied with imbraces, but desire
   to be truly each other; which being impossible, their desires are
   infinite, and must proceed without a possibility of satisfaction.
   Another misery there is in affection, that whom we truly love like our
   own selves, we forget their looks, nor can our memory retain the Idea
   of their faces; and it is no wonder, for they are our selves, and our
   affection makes their looks our own. This noble affection falls not on
   vulgar and common constitutions, but on such as are mark'd for virtue:
   he that can love his friend with this noble ardour, will in a competent
   degree affect all. Now, if we can bring our affections to look beyond
   the body, and cast an eye upon the soul, we have found out the true
   object, not only of friendship, but Charity; and the greatest happiness
   that we can bequeath the soul, is that wherein we all do place our last
   felicity, Salvation; which though it be not in our power to bestow, it
   is in our charity and pious invocations to desire, if not procure and
   further. I cannot contentedly frame a prayer for my self in particular,
   without a catalogue for my friends; nor request a happiness, wherein my
   sociable disposition doth not desire the fellowship of my neighbour. I
   never hear the Toll of a passing Bell, though in my mirth, with out my
   prayers and best wishes for the departing spirit; I cannot go to cure
   the body of my patient, but I forget my profession, and call unto God
   for his soul; I cannot see one say his prayers, but, in stead of
   imitating him, I fall into a supplication for him, who perhaps is no
   more to me than a common nature: and if God hath vouchsafed an ear to
   my supplications, there are surely many happy that never saw me, and
   enjoy the blessing of mine unknown devotions. To pray for Enemies, that
   is, for their salvation, is no harsh precept, but the practice of our
   daily and ordinary devotions. I cannot believe the story of the
   Italian: [156] our bad wishes and uncharitable desires proceed no
   further than this life; it is the Devil, and the uncharitable votes of
   Hell, that desire our misery in the world to come.

   VII. To do no injury, nor take none, was a principle, which to my
   former years and impatient affections seemed to contain enough of
   Morality; but my more setled years and Christian constitution have
   fallen upon severer resolutions. I can hold there is no such thing as
   injury; that, if there be, there is no such injury as revenge, and no
   such revenge as the contempt of an injury; that to hate another, is to
   malign himself; that the truest way to love another, is to despise our
   selves. I were unjust unto mine own Conscience, if I should say I am at
   variance with any thing like my self. I find there are many pieces in
   this one fabrick of man; this frame is raised upon a mass of
   Antipathies. I am one methinks, but as the World; wherein
   notwithstanding there are a swarm of distinct essences, and in them
   another World of contrarieties; we carry private and domestic enemies
   within, publick and more hostile adversaries without. The Devil, that
   did but buffet St. Paul, plays methinks at sharp [157] with me. Let me
   be nothing, if within the compass of my self I do not find the battail
   of Lepanto, [158] Passion against Reason, Reason against Faith, Faith
   against the Devil, and my Conscience against all. There is another man
   within me, that's angry with me, rebukes, commands, and dastards me. I
   have no Conscience of Marble to resist the hammer of more heavy
   offences; nor yet so soft and waxen, as to take the impression of each
   single peccadillo or scape of infirmity. I am of a strange belief, that
   it is as easie to be forgiven some sins, as to commit some others. For
   my Original sin, I hold it to be washed away in my Baptism: for my
   actual transgressions, I compute and reckon with God but from my last
   repentance, Sacrament, or general absolution; and therefore am not
   terrified with the sins or madness of my youth. I thank the goodness of
   God, I have no sins that want a name; I am not singular in offences; my
   transgressions are Epidemical, and from the common breath of our
   corruption. For there are certain tempers of body, which, matcht with
   an humorous depravity of mind, do hatch and produce vitiosities, whose
   newness and monstrosity of nature admits no name: this was the temper
   of that Lecher that fell in love with a Statua, and the constitution of
   Nero in his Spintrian [159] recreations. For the Heavens are not only
   fruitful in new and unheard-of stars, the Earth in plants and animals,
   but mens minds also in villany and vices. Now the dulness of my reason,
   and the vulgarity [160] of my disposition, never prompted my invention,
   nor solicited my affection unto any of these; yet even those common and
   quotidian infirmities that so necessarily attend me, and do seem to be
   my very nature, have so dejected me, so broken the estimation that I
   should have otherwise of my self, that I repute my self the most
   abjectest piece of mortality. Divines prescribe a fit of sorrow to
   repentance: there goes indignation, anger, sorrow, hatred, into mine;
   passions of a contrary nature, which neither seem to sute with this
   action, nor my proper constitution. It is no breach of charity to our
   selves, to be at variance with our Vices, nor to abhor that part of us
   which is an enemy to the ground of charity, our God; wherein we do but
   imitate our great selves, the world, whose divided Antipathies and
   contrary faces do yet carry a charitable regard unto the whole, by
   their particular discords preserving the common harmony, and keeping in
   fetters those powers, whose rebellions, once Masters, might be the
   ruine of all.

   VIII. I thank God, amongst those millions of Vices I do inherit and
   hold from Adam, I have escaped one, and that a mortal enemy to Charity,
   the first and father-sin, not onely of man, but of the devil, Pride: a
   vice whose name is comprehended in a Monosyllable, but in its nature
   not circumscribed with a World. I have escaped it in a condition that
   can hardly avoid it. Those petty acquisitions and reputed perfections
   that advance and elevate the conceits of other men, add no feathers
   unto mine. I have seen a Grammarian tower and plume himself over a
   single line in Horace, and shew more pride in the construction of one
   Ode, than the Author in the composure of the whole book. For my own
   part, besides the Jargon and Patois of several Provinces, I understand
   no less than six Languages; yet I protest I have no higher conceit of
   my self, than had our Fathers before the confusion of Babel, when there
   was but one Language in the World, and none to boast himself either
   Linguist or Critick. I have not onely seen several Countries, beheld
   the nature of their Climes, the Chorography [161] of their Provinces,
   Topography of their Cities, but understood their several Laws, Customs,
   and Policies; yet cannot all this perswade the dulness of my spirit
   unto such an opinion of my self, as I behold in nimbler and conceited
   heads, that never looked a degree beyond their Nests. I know the names,
   and somewhat more, of all the constellations in my Horizon; yet I have
   seen a prating Mariner, that could onely name the pointers and the
   North Star, out-talk me, and conceit himself a whole Sphere above me. I
   know most of the Plants of my Countrey, and of those about me; yet
   methinks I do not know so many as when I did but know a hundred, and
   had scarcely ever Simpled [162] further than Cheap-side [163] . For,
   indeed heads of capacity, and such as are not full with a handful or
   easie measure of knowledge, think they know nothing till they know all;
   which being impossible, they fall upon the opinion of Socrates, and
   only know they know not anything. I cannot think that Homer pin'd away
   upon the riddle of the fishermen; or that Aristotle, who understood the
   uncertainty of knowledge, and confessed so often the reason of man too
   weak for the works of nature, did ever drown himself upon the flux and
   reflux of Euripus. We do but learn to-day what our better advanced
   judgements will unteach to morrow; and Aristotle doth but instruct us,
   as Plato did him; that is, to confute himself. I have run through all
   sorts, yet find no rest in any: though our first studies and junior
   endeavours may style us Peripateticks, Stoicks, or Academicks; yet I
   perceive the wisest heads prove, at last, almost all Scepticks, and
   stand like Janus [164] in the field of knowledge. I have therefore one
   common and authentick Philosophy I learned in the Schools, whereby I
   discourse and satisfy the reason of other men; another more reserved,
   and drawn from experience, whereby I content mine own. Solomon, that
   complained of ignorance in the height of knowledge, hath not only
   humbled my conceits, but discouraged my endeavours. There is yet
   another conceit [165] that hath sometimes made me shut my books, which
   tells me it is a vanity to waste our days in the blind pursuit of
   knowledge; it is but attending a little longer, and we shall enjoy that
   by instinct and infusion, which we endeavour at here by labour and
   inquisition. It is better to sit down in a modest ignorance, and rest
   contented with the natural blessing of our own reasons, than buy the
   uncertain knowledge of this life with sweet and vexation, which Death
   gives every fool gratis, and is an accessary of our glorification.

Section II.

   IX. I was never yet once, and commend their resolutions who never marry
   twice: not that I disallow of second marriage; as neither, in all
   cases, of Polygamy, which, considering some times, and the unequal
   number of both sexes, may be also necessary. The whole World was made
   for man, but the twelfth part of man for woman: Man is the whole World,
   and the Breath of God; Woman the Rib and crooked piece of man. I could
   be content that we might procreate like trees, without conjunction, or
   that there were any way to perpetuate the World without this trivial
   and vulgar way of union: it is the foolishest act a wise man commits in
   all his life; nor is there any thing that will more deject his cool'd
   imagination, when he shall consider what an odd and unworthy piece of
   folly he hath committed. I speak not in prejudice, nor am averse from
   that sweet Sex, but naturally amorous of all that is beautiful. I can
   look a whole da infallible; their perfectest rules are raised upon the
   erroneous reasons of Man, and the Laws of one do but condemn the rules
   of another; as Aristotle oft-times the opinions of his Predecessours,
   because, though agreeable to reason, yet were not consonant to his own
   rules, and the Logick of his proper Principles. Again, (to speak
   nothing of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, whose cure not onely but
   whose nature is unknown,) I can cure the Gout or Stone in some, sooner
   than Divinity, Pride or Avarice in others. I can cure Vices by Physick
   when they remain incurable by Divinity, and shall obey my Pills when
   they contemn their precepts. I boast nothing, but plainly say, we all
   labour against our own cure; for death is the cure of all diseases.
   There is no Catholicon or universal remedy I know, but this; which,
   though nauseous to queasie stomachs, yet to prepared appetites is
   Nectar, and a pleasant potion of immortality.

   X. For my Conversation, [166] it is like the Sun's, with all men, and
   with a friendly aspect to good and bad. Methinks there is no man bad,
   and the worst, best; that is, while they are kept within the circle of
   those qualities wherein they are good: there is no man's mind of such
   discordant and jarring a temper, to which a tunable disposition may not
   strike a harmony. Magnae virtutes, nec minora vitia [Great virtues, nor
   less vices]; it is the posie of the best natures, and may be inverted
   on the worst; there are in the most depraved and venemous dispositions,
   certain pieces that remain untoucht, which by an Antiperistasis [167]
   become more excellent, or by the excellency of their antipathies are
   able to preserve themselves from the contagion of their enemy vices,
   and persist intire beyond the general corruption. For it is also thus
   in nature: the greatest Balsomes do lie enveloped in the bodies of most
   powerful Corrosives. [168] I say, moreover, and I ground upon
   experience, that poisons contain within themselves their own Antidote,
   and that which preserves them from the venome of themselves, without
   which they were not deleterious to others onely, but to themselves
   also. But it is the corruption that I fear within me, not the contagion
   of commerce [169] without me. Tis that unruly regiment [170] within me,
   that will destroy me; tis I that do infect my self; the man without a
   Navel [171] yet lives in me; I feel that original canker corrode and
   devour me; and therefore Defenda me Dios de me, "Lord deliver me from
   my self," is a part of my Letany, and the first voice of my retired
   imaginations. There is no man alone, because every man is a Microcosm,
   and carries the whole World about him. Nunquam minus solus quam cum
   solus [Never less alone than when alone], though it be the Apothegme of
   a wise man, is yet true in the mouth of a fool. Indeed, though in a
   Wilderness, a man is never alone, not only because he is with himself
   and his own thoughts, but because he is with the Devil, who ever
   consorts with our solitude, and is that unruly rebel that musters up
   those disordered motions which accompany our sequestered imaginations.
   And to speak more narrowly, there is no such thing as solitude, nor any
   thing that can be said to be alone and by itself, but God, Who is His
   own circle, and can subsist by Himself; all others, besides their
   dissimilary and Heterogeneous parts, which in a manner multiply their
   natures, cannot subsist without the concourse [172] of God, and the
   society of that hand which doth uphold their natures. In brief, there
   can be nothing truly alone and by it self, which is not truly one; and
   such is only God: all others do transcend an unity, and so by
   consequence are many.

   XI. Now for my life, it is a miracle of thirty years, which to relate,
   were not a History, but a piece of Poetry, and would sound to common
   ears like a Fable. For the World, I count it not an Inn, but an
   Hospital; and a place not to live, but to dye in. The world that I
   regard is my self; it is the Microcosm of my own frame that I cast mine
   eye on; for the other, I use it but like my Globe, and turn it round
   sometimes for my recreation. Men that look upon my outside, their own
   corps, as spirits with the bodies they assume, wherein they seem to
   hear, see, and feel, though indeed the Organs are destitute of sense,
   and their natures of those faculties that should inform them. Thus it
   is observed, that men sometimes, upon the hour of their departure, do
   speak and reason above themselves; for then the soul, beginning to be
   freed from the ligaments of the body, begins to reason like her self,
   and to discourse in a strain above mortality.

   XII. We term sleep a death; and yet it is waking that kills us, and
   destroys those spirits that are the house of life. Tis indeed a part of
   life that best expresseth death; for every man truely lives, so long as
   he acts his nature, or some way makes good the faculties of himself.
   Themistocles, therefore, that slew his Soldier in his sleep, was a
   merciful Executioner: tis a kind of punishment the mildness of no laws
   hath invented: I wonder the fancy of Lucan and Seneca did not discover
   it. It is that death by which we may be literally said to dye daily; a
   death which Adam dyed before his mortality; a death whereby we live a
   middle and moderating point between life and death: in fine, so like
   death, I dare not trust it without my prayers, and an half adieu unto
   the World, and take my farewell in a Colloquy with God.

   The night is come, like to the day, Depart not Thou, great God, away.
   Let not my sins, black as the night, Eclipse the lustre of Thy light:
   Keep still in my Horizon; for to me The Sun makes not the day, but
   Thee. Thou, Whose nature cannot sleep, On my temples Centry keep; Guard
   me gainst those watchful foes, Whose eyes are open while mine close.
   Let no dreams my head infest, But such as Jacob's temples blest. While
   I do rest, my Soul advance; Make my sleep a holy trance; That I may, my
   rest being wrought, Awake into some holy thought; And with as active
   vigour run My course, as doth the nimble Sun. Sleep is a death; O make
   me try, By sleeping, what it is to die; And as gently lay my head On my
   grave, as now my bed. However I rest, great God, let me Awake again at
   last with Thee; And thus assur'd, behold I lie Securely, or to awake or
   die. These are my drowsie days; in vain I do not wake to sleep again: O
   come that hour, when I shall never Sleep again, but wake for ever.

   This is the Dormative [173] I take to bedward; I need no other Laudanum
   than this to make me sleep; after which I close mine eyes in security,
   content to take my leave of the Sun, and sleep unto the Resurrection.

   XIII. The method I should use in distributive Justice, [174] I often
   observe in commutative; [175] and keep a Geometrical proportion in
   both, whereby becoming equable to others, I become unjust to my self,
   and supererogate [176] in that common principle, Do unto others as thou
   wouldst be done unto thy self. I was not born unto riches, neither is
   it, I think, my Star to be wealthy; or, if it were, the freedom of my
   mind, and frankness of my disposition, were able to contradict and
   cross my fates: for to me, avarice seems not so much a vice, as a
   deplorable piece of madness; to conceive ourselves pipkins, or be
   perswaded that we are dead, is not so ridiculous, nor so many degrees
   beyond the power of Hellebore, [177] as this. The opinions of Theory,
   and positions of men, are not so void of reason as their practised
   conclusions. Some have held that Snow is black, that the earth moves,
   that the Soul is air, fire, water; but all this is Philosophy, and
   there is no delirium, if we do but speculate [178] the folly and
   indisputable dotage of avarice. To that subterraneous Idol and God of
   the Earth I do confess I am an Atheist; I cannot perswade myself to
   honour that the World adores; whatsoever virtue its prepared substance
   [179] may have within my body, it hath no influence nor operation
   without. I would not entertain a base design, or an action that should
   call me villain, for the Indies; and for this only do I love and honour
   my own soul, and have methinks two arms too few to embrace myself.
   Aristotle is too severe, that will not allow us to be truely liberal
   without wealth, and the bountiful hand of Fortune. If this be true, I
   must confess I am charitable only in my liberal intentions, and
   bountiful well-wishes; but if the example of the Mite be not only an
   act of wonder, but an example of the noblest Charity, surely poor men
   may also build Hospitals, and the rich alone have not erected
   Cathedrals. I have a private method which others observe not; I take
   the opportunity of my self to do good; I borrow occasion of Charity
   from mine own necessities, and supply the wants of others, when I am in
   most need my self: for it is an honest stratagem to take advantage of
   our selves, and so to husband the acts of vertue, that, where they are
   defective in one circumstance, they may repay their want and multiply
   their goodness in another. I have not Peru [180] in my desires, but a
   competence, and ability to perform those good works to which He hath
   inclined my nature. He is rich, who hath enough to be charitable; and
   it is hard to be so poor, that a noble mind may not find a way to this
   piece of goodness. He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord:
   there is more Rhetorick in that one sentence, than in a Library of
   Sermons; and indeed, if those Sentences were understood by the Reader,
   with the same Emphasis as they are delivered by the Author, we needed
   not those Volumes of instructions, but might be honest by an Epitome.
   Upon this motive only I cannot behold a Beggar without relieving his
   Necessities with my Purse, or his Soul with my Prayers; these scenical
   and accidental differences between us, cannot make me forget that
   common and untoucht part of us both: there is under these Centoes [181]
   and miserable outsides, these mutilate and semi-bodies, a soul of the
   same alloy with our own, whose Genealogy is God as well as ours, and in
   as fair a way to Salvation as our selves. Statists that labour to
   contrive a Common-wealth without poverty, take away the object of
   charity, not understanding only the Commonwealth of a Christian, but
   forgetting the prophecie of Christ. [182]

   XIV. Now, there is another part of charity, which is the Basis and
   Pillar of this, and that is the love of God, for Whom we love our
   neighbour; for this I think charity, to love God for Himself, and our
   neighbour for God. All that is truly amiable is God, or as it were a
   divided piece of Him, that retains a reflex or shadow of Himself. Nor
   is it strange that we should place affection on that which is
   invisible: all that we truly love is thus; what we adore under
   affection of our senses, deserves not the honour of so pure a title.
   Thus we adore Virtue, though to the eyes of sense she be invisible:
   thus that part of our noble friends that we love, is not that part that
   we embrace, but that insensible part that our arms cannot embrace. God,
   being all goodness, can love nothing but Himself; He loves us but for
   that part which is as it were Himself, and the traduction [183] of His
   Holy Spirit. Let us call to assize the loves of our parents, the
   affection of our wives and children, and they are all dumb shows and
   dreams, without reality, truth, or constancy. For first there is a
   strong bond of affection between us and our Parents; yet how easily
   dissolved! We betake our selves to a woman, forget our mother in a
   wife, and the womb that bare us, in that that shall bear our Image.
   This woman blessing us with children, our affection leaves the level it
   held before, and sinks from our bed unto our issue and picture of
   Posterity, where affection holds no steady mansion. They, growing up in
   years, desire our ends; or applying themselves to a woman, take a
   lawful way to love another better than our selves. Thus I perceive a
   man may be buried alive, and behold his grave in his own issue.

   XV. I conclude therefore, and say, there is no happiness under (or, as
   Copernicus will have it, above) the Sun, nor any Crambe [184] in that
   repeated verity and burthen of all the wisdom of Solomon, All is vanity
   and vexation of Spirit. There is no felicity in that the World adores.
   Aristotle, whilst he labours to refute the Idea's of Plato, falls upon
   one himself; for his summum bonum is a Chimaera, and there is no such
   thing as his Felicity. That wherein God Himself is happy, the holy
   Angels are happy, in whose defect the Devils are unhappy, that dare I
   call happiness: whatsoever conduceth unto this, may with an easy
   Metaphor deserve that name; whatsoever else the World terms Happiness,
   is to me a story out of Pliny, a tale of Boccace or Malizspini, an
   apparition, or neat delusion, wherein there is no more of Happiness
   than the name. Bless me in this life with but peace of my Conscience,
   command of my affections, the love of Thy self and my dearest friends,
   and I shall be happy enough to pity Caesar. These are, O Lord, the
   humble desires of my most reasonable ambition, and all I dare call
   happiness on earth; wherein I set no rule or limit to Thy Hand or
   Providence. Dispose of me according to the wisdom of Thy pleasure: Thy
   will be done, though in my own undoing.
