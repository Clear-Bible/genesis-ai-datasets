CHAPTER I.

  HISTORY OF DOGMA IN THE PERIOD OF CLUGNY, ANSELM, AND BERNARD, TILL THE CLOSE
  OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY.

   A tenaciously maintained tradition relates that in the closing years of
   the tenth century the Christians of the West looked forward with fear
   and trembling to the destruction of the world in the year 1000, and
   that a kind of reformation, expressing itself in the keenest activity
   in all branches of religion, was the consequence of this expectation.
   This representation has long since been proved a legend; [2] but there
   lies at the basis of it, as is the case with so many legends, an
   accurate historic observation. From the end of the tenth century [3] we
   really discern the beginnings of a powerful rise of religious and
   ecclesiastical life. This revival grew in strength, suffering from no
   reaction of any consequence, till the beginning of the thirteenth
   century. During this period it released, and took command of all the
   forces of mediæval manhood. All institutions of the past, and all the
   new elements of culture that had been added were subjected to its
   influence, and even the most hostile powers were ultimately made to
   yield it service and support. In the thirteenth century the supremacy
   of the Church and the system of the mediæval view of the world appear
   in perfected form. [4]

   This perfecting is the conclusion, not only of Mediæval Church history,
   but also of that historical development of Christianity, the beginnings
   of which lie as far back as the history of the primitive Church.
   Certainly, if Christianity is regarded only as doctrine, the Middle
   Ages appear almost as a supplement to the history of the ancient
   Church; but if it is regarded as life, our judgment must be that it was
   only in the Western Church of the Middle Ages that the Christianity of
   the early Church came to its completion. In ancient times the Church
   was confronted with restrictions in the motives, standards, and ideas
   of ancient life. These restrictions it was never able to break through,
   and so it continued to be with the Church of the Eastern Empire:
   Monachism stood alongside the Church; the Church of the world was the
   old world itself with Christian manners. It was otherwise in the West.
   Here the Church was able to apply much more effectively its peculiar
   standards of monastic asceticism and domination of this world by the
   world beyond, [5] because it had not to subdue an ancient civilisation,
   but met with its restrictions simply in the most elementary forces of
   human life, in the desire to live, hunger, love and cupidity. It was
   thus able to propagate here through all circles, from the highest to
   the lowest, a view of the world which would inevitably have driven all
   into the cloisters, had not these elementary forces been stronger than
   even the fear of hell.

   It is not the task of the History of Dogma to show how the mediæval
   view of the world was fully constructed and applied from the end of the
   tenth (for here the beginnings lie) till the thirteenth century.
   Substantially not much that is new would be discovered, for it is still
   the old well-known body of thought; what is new is merely the
   application of the material to all provinces of life, the comprehensive
   control in the hands of the Pope, and the gradual progressive
   development in its prior stages of religious individualism. But before
   we describe the changes, partly really, and partly apparently slight,
   which dogma underwent down to the time of the Mendicant Orders, it is
   necessary to indicate in a few lines the conditions under which these
   changes came about. We must direct our attention to the fresh rise of
   piety, to the development of ecclesiastical law, and to the beginnings
   of mediæval science.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. The Fresh Rise of Piety.

   The Monastery of Clugny, founded in the tenth century, became the
   centre of the great reform which the Church in the West passed through
   in the eleventh century. [6] Instituted by monks, it was at first
   supported against the secularised monachism, priesthood (Episcopate),
   [7] and papacy by pious and prudent princes and bishops, above all, by
   the Emperor, the representative of God on earth, until the great
   Hildebrand laid hold of it, and, as Cardinal and successor of Peter,
   set it in opposition to the princes, the secularised clergy, and the
   Emperor. What the West obtained in it was a monastic reform of the
   Church, that rested on the idea of a view of the world that made
   everything alike, and that consequently favoured the universal
   supremacy of Rome over the Church. What were the aims of this new
   movement which took hold of the entire Church in the second half of the
   eleventh century? In the first instance, and chiefly, the restoration
   in the monasteries themselves of the "old" discipline, of the true
   abnegation of the world, and piety; but then, also, first, the monastic
   training of the whole secular clergy, second, the supremacy of the
   monastically trained clergy over the lay world, over princes and
   nations; third, the reduction of national churches, with their pride
   and secularity, in favour of the uniform supremacy of Rome. [8]

   The attempt to control the life of the whole clergy by monastic rules
   had already begun in the Carlovingian period; but in part it had
   failed, in part the Chapters had only become thoroughly secularised.
   Now, however, it was undertaken anew and with greater efficiency. In
   the Cluniacensian reform Western monachism raised for the first time
   the decided claim to apply, and find recognition for, itself as the
   Christian order of life for all Christians of full age -- the priests.
   This Western monachism could not withdraw from the. task of serving the
   Church and urging itself upon it, i.e., upon the clergy of the day, as
   Christianity. The Christian freedom which it strove for was for it,
   with all wavering, not only a freedom from the world, but the freedom
   of Christendom for unrestricted preparation for the life beyond, and
   for the service of God in this world. But no man can serve two masters.

   Herewith there was given also its relation to the laity, with the
   position of the latter. If the mature confessors of Christianity must
   be trained according to monastic rules, then the immature -- and these
   are the laity -- must leave an entirely free course to the former, and
   must at least pay respect to their majesty, that it may be possible to
   stand approved in the coming judgment. If Clugny and its great Popes
   required the strict observance of celibacy, the estrangement of the
   priests from secular life, and especially the extirpation of all
   "simony," then this last demand of itself involved, under the then
   existing distribution of power and property, the subjection of the
   laity, inclusive of the civil power, to the Church. But what was the
   Church's dominion over the world to mean, side by side with the
   renunciation of the world exacted of all priests? How does that power
   over the earth harmonise with exclusive concern for the soul's
   salvation in the world beyond? How can the same man who exclaims to his
   brother who thinks of leaving him all the patrimonial property, "What
   an unjust division, -- for thee, heaven, and for me, the earth," and
   who then himself enters a monastery -- how can this same man bring
   himself to contend from within the monastery for dominion over the
   world? Now in a certain sense this dominion is something
   substitutionary, so long as and because the true, universal
   Christianising has not been carried out. As long as all are not genuine
   Christians, the obstinate world and the half-developed Christendom must
   be governed and educated, for otherwise the gospel would be captured by
   the powers hostile to it, and would not be in the position to fulfil
   its mission. But the dominion is certainly not merely something
   substitutionary. Christianity is asceticism and the City of God. All
   earthly relations must be moulded by the transcendent and universal
   idea of God's kingdom, and all national political forms of life must be
   brought under control in accordance therewith. But the kingdom of God
   has its existence on this side of things in the Church. The States,
   therefore, must become subject to the divine ends of the Church; they
   must merge themselves in the kingdom of righteousness and of the
   victorious Christ, which is a truly heavenly kingdom, because it has
   its source in heaven, and is ruled by Christ's representative. Thus out
   of the programme of renunciation of the world and out of the
   supra-mundane world that was to permeate this world, out of the
   Augustinian idea of the city of God and out of the idea of the one
   Roman world-empire, an idea that had never disappeared, but that had
   reached its glorification in the papal supremacy, there developed
   itself the claim to world-dominion, though the ruin of many an
   individual monk might be involved in making it. With sullied
   consciences and broken courage many monks, whose only desire was to
   seek after God, yielded to the plans of the great monastic Popes, and
   became subservient to their aims. And those whom they summoned from the
   retirement of the cloisters were just those who wished to think least
   of the world. They knew very well that it was only the monk who fled
   from the world, and would be rid of it, that could give help in
   subduing the world. Abandonment of the world in the service of the
   world-ruling Church, dominion over the world in the service of
   renunciation of the world, -- this was the problem, and the ideal of
   the Middle Ages! What an innocent simplicity, what a wealth of
   illusions, was involved in believing that this ideal could be realised,
   and in working for it! What a childlike reverence for the Church was
   necessary for developing that paradoxical flight from the world," which
   at one and the same moment could join the fight and pray, utter cursing
   and blessing, exercise dominion and do penance! What a spirit of
   romance filled those souls, which at a single view could see in nature
   and all sensuous life an enchantment of the devil, and could behold in
   it at the same time, as illumined by the Church, the reflection of the
   world beyond What kind of men were they, who abandoned the world and
   gladsome life, and then took back from the hand of the Church the good
   things of earth, love-making, combat and victory, speculating and
   money-making, feasting, and the joys of sense! Of course, with a slight
   turn of the kaleidoscope, all these things were in ruins; there must be
   fasting and repentance; but again a slight turn, and everything was
   back again which the world could afford -- but glorified with the light
   of the Church and of the world beyond.

   At the close of this period (about 1200) the Church was victorious. If
   ever ideals were carried out in the world and gained dominion over
   souls it happened then. "It was as if the world had cast aside its old
   garment and clothed itself in the white robe of the Church." [9]
   Negation of the world and rule of the world by the Church appeared to
   men identical. That age bore in its culture "the pained look of
   world-renunciation on the one hand, and the look of strong character
   suggesting world-conquest on the other." [10] But in the period we are
   reviewing the development, which had to cancel itself when it seemed to
   have come near its completion, was still in process. Much was still to
   be done in the way of excavating secularised Christendom from its rough
   surroundings. And the masses were really changed in temper and set on
   fire -- set on fire to contend against

   the secularised clergy and against simonistic princes in the whole of
   Europe. A new enthusiasm of a religious kind stirred the nations of the
   West, especially the Romanic. The ardour of the Crusades was the direct
   fruit of the monastic papal reform movement of the eleventh century. In
   them most vividly the religious revival which had passed over the West
   revealed itself in its specific character. The supremacy of the Church
   must be given effect to on earth. It was the ideas of the world-ruling
   monk of Clugny that guided the Crusaders on their path. The Holy Land
   and Jerusalem were parts of heaven on earth. They must be conquered.
   The dreadful and affecting scenes at the taking of the sacred city
   illustrate the spirit of mediæval piety.

   Christianity is ascetism and the City of God -- but the Church, which
   really fired souls for these ideas, lit also thereby the flame of
   religious individualism; it awakened the power which was ultimately
   strong enough to burst through the strict bonds of system and sever the
   chain. But it was long before things went so far as this. The
   Cluniacensian reform, if I see aright, produced as yet no religious
   individualism at all, in the sense of manifold expressions of piety.
   The enthusiastic religious spirit of the eleventh century was quite of
   the same kind in individual cases. Among the numerous founders of
   orders during this period, there still prevailed the greatest
   uniformity: spiritual need, flight from the world, contemplation -- all
   of them are expressed in similar forms and by the same means. [11] An
   appeal must not be made to the Sectaries, already numerous in this
   century; they stood in scarcely any connection with the ecclesiastical
   revival, and had as yet no influence upon it. [12]

   Through the Crusades this became changed. The primitive Christian
   intuitions were restored. The sacred places stirred the imagination,
   and led it to the Christ of the Gospels. Piety was quickened by the
   most vivid view of the suffering and dying Redeemer; He must be
   followed through all the stages of His path of sorrow! Negative
   asceticism thus obtained a positive form, and a new and more certain
   aim. The notes of the Christ-Mysticism, which Augustine had struck only
   singly and with uncertainty, [13] became a ravishing melody. Beside the
   sacramental Christ the image of the historical took its place [14] --
   majesty in humility, innocence in penal suffering, life in death. That
   dialectic of piety without dialectic, that combined spectacle of
   suffering and of glory, that living picture of the true communicatio
   idiomatum (communication of attributes) developed itself, before which
   mankind stood worshipping, adoring with equal reverence the sublimity
   and the abasement. The sensuous and the spiritual, the earthly and the
   heavenly, shame and honour, renunciation and fulness of life were no
   longer tumultuously intermingled: they were united in serene majesty in
   the "Ecce homo." And so this piety broke forth into the solemn hymn:
   "Salve caput cruentatum" ("O Lamb of God once wounded"). We cannot
   measure the effects which this newly-tempered piety produced, nor can
   we calculate the manifold types it assumed, and the multitude of images
   it drew within its range. We need only recall the picture -- new, and
   certainly only derived from the cross -- of the mother and child, the
   God in the cradle, omnipotence in weakness. Where this piety appears
   without dogmatic formule, without fancifulness, without subtlety, or
   studied calculation, it is the simple expression, now brought back
   again, of the Christian religion itself; for in reverence for the
   suffering Christ, and in the power which proceeds from His image, all
   the forces of religion are embraced. But even where it does not appear
   in its purity, where there is intermingled with it the trivial -- down
   even to the heart-of-Jesus-worship [15] -- the over-refined and
   studied, it can still be salutary and worthy of honour, more salutary
   and worthy of honour, at least, than the strivings of a purely negative
   asceticism governed by no living conception. Even, indeed, where it
   manifestly degenerates into paganism, there will still remain some
   remnant of that liberating message, that the divine is to be found in
   humility and in patient suffering, and that the innocent suffers that
   the guilty may have peace.

   In the period under review, this newly attuned piety, born of the
   Crusades, and nurtured on Augustine as now understood, was still in
   process of growth. But we have already alluded to the man who stood at
   the beginning, though he was himself no initiator, Saint Bernard. [16]
   Bernard is the religious genius of the twelfth century, and therefore
   also the leading spirit of the age. Above all, in him the Augustinian
   contemplation was revived. Too much is not asserted when it is said
   that he was Augustinus redivivus, that he moulded himself entirely on
   the pattern of the great African, [17] and that from him what lay at
   the foundation of his pious contemplations was derived. So far as
   Bernard furnishes a system of contemplation, and describes the
   development of love, [18] on to its fourth and highest stage, at which
   man, rising above self-love, is wholly absorbed in the love of God, and
   experiences that momentary ecstasy in which he becomes one with God --
   so far Bernard has simply experienced anew what Augustine experienced
   before him. Even his language indeed is to a very large extent
   dependent on the language of the Confessions. [19] But Bernard has also
   learned his relation to Jesus Christ from the great leader. Like the
   latter [20] he writes: "Dry is all food of the soul if it is not
   sprinkled with the oil of Christ. When thou writest, promise me
   nothing, unless I read Jesus in it. When thou conversest with me on
   religious themes, promise me nothing if I hear not Jesus' voice. Jesus
   -- honey to the taste, melody to the ear, gladness to the soul." [21]
   But here Bernard has taken a step beyond Augustine. "Reverence for what
   is beneath us" dawned upon him, as it had never dawned upon any
   Christian of the older world (not even upon Augustine); for these
   earlier Christians, while revering asceticism as the means of escape
   from the body, still, as men of the ancient world, were unable to see
   in suffering and shame, in the cross and death, the form of the divine.
   The study of the Song of Songs (under the direction of Ambrose), and
   the spirit enkindled by the Crusades, led him before the image of the
   crucified Saviour as the bridegoom of the soul. In this picture he
   became absorbed. From the features of the suffering Christ there shone
   forth upon him truth and love. In a literal sense He hangs on His lips
   and gazes on His limbs: "My beloved, saith the Spouse, is white and
   ruddy: in this we see both the white light of truth and the ruddy glow
   of love" (in hoc nobis et candet veritas et rubet caritas), says
   Gilbert in the spirit of Bernard. [22] The basis for this
   Christ-contemplation -- the wounds of Christ as the clearest token of
   His love -- was laid by Ambrose and Augustine (Christ, mediator as
   man), and the image of the soul's bridegroom goes back to Origen and
   Valentinus (cf. also Ignatius); but Bernard was the first to give to
   the pious spirit its historic Christian intuitions; he united the
   Neoplatonic self-discipline for rising to God with contemplation of the
   suffering and dying Redeemer, and released the subjectivity of the
   Christ-Mysticism and the Christ-Lyricism. [23]

   But in spite of all quickening of the imagination, and in spite of his
   most ardent devotion to the person of Christ, even Bernard was obliged
   to pay the heavy tribute that is exacted of every mystic, -- the mood
   of abandonment after the blessed feeling of union, and the exchange of
   the historic Christ for the dissolving picture of the ideal. With him
   the latter is specially remarkable. It might have been expected that
   for one who became so absorbed in the picture of the suffering Christ,
   it would have been impossible to repeat the direction given by Origen
   and Augustine, that we must rise from the word of scripture, and from
   the Incarnate Word, to the "Spirit." And yet this final and most
   questionable direction of mysticism, which nullifies historical
   Christianity and leads on to pantheism, was most distinctly repeated by
   Bernard. No doubt what he has written in ep. 106, on the uselessness of
   the study of Scripture, as compared with practical devotion to Christ,
   [24] may still be interpreted in the light of the thought, that
   Christianity must be experienced, not known. But there is no ambiguity
   in the ex-positions in the twentieth sermon on the Song of Songs. Here
   the love to Christ that is stirred by what Christ did or offered in the
   flesh is described as still to some extent fleshly. It is no doubt a
   valuable circumstance that Bernard does not regard the distress and
   anguish awakened by the picture of the man Jesus as the highest thing,
   that he rather sees in it a portion of the fleshly love. But he then
   goes on to say, that in true spiritual love we must rise altogether
   from the picture of the historic Christ to the Christ kata pneuma
   (after the spirit), and for this he appeals to John VI. and 2 Cor. V.
   16. All the mysticism of after times retained this feature. It learned
   from Bernard the Christ-contemplation; [25] but, at the same time, it
   adopted the pantheistic tendency of the Neoplatonists and Augustine.
   [26] In the second half of the twelfth century the new piety was
   already a powerful force in the Church. [27] The subjectivity of pious
   feeling was unfettered in the monasteries. [28] But as the same man
   who, in the seclusion of his monastery, spoke a new language of
   adoration, preached flight from the world, and called to the Pope that
   he sat in Peter's chair to serve and not to rule -- as this man at the
   same time continued fettered by all the hierarchical prejudices of his
   age, and himself guided the policy of the world-ruling Church, even the
   pious in the Church in the twelfth century had not yet felt the
   contrast between Church and Christianity. The attachment of monachism
   to the Church was still of a naive kind; the contradiction between the
   actual form of the world-ruling Church and the gospel which it preached
   was felt, indeed, but always suppressed again. [29] That great
   mendicant monk had not yet come on the scene whose appearing was to
   work the crisis in the fluctuating struggle between renunciation of the
   world and lordship over it. But already the Church was beset all around
   by the wrathful curses of the "heretics," who saw in the Church's
   powerful exercise of her dominion and in the alienation of her gifts of
   grace the features of the ancient Babylon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] The following partly corresponds with my Lecture on Monachism (3rd
   ed. 1886, p. 43 ff.). Two sources appear in the tenth century from
   which the religious awakening proceeded, the Monastery of Clugny, and
   the Saxon dynasty. We cannot attach too much importance to the
   influence of Matilda (cf. in general the Essay by Lamprecht, Das
   deutsche Geistesleben unter den Ottonen in the deutsche Zeitschrift f.
   Geschichtswissensch. Vol. VII., part 1, p. i. ff.). It extended to
   Henry II., and even, indeed, to the third Henry; v. Nitzsch, Gesch. des
   deutschen Volkes I., p. 318 f. For the history of the world the
   ecclesiastical sympathies of the dynasty, and the spirit of ascetic
   piety that emanated from the saintly devotee in the Quedlinburg Convent
   were of as great importance as the reformed monachism of Clugny. The
   history of mediæval Germanic piety may be said to have begun with
   Matilda. Charlemagne is still in many respects a Christian of the type
   of Constantius and Theodosius.

   [7] From Hauck (K.-Gesch. Deutschlands III., p. 342 ff.) and the work
   of Sackur, Die Cluniacenser in ihrer Kirchl. und allgemeingesch.
   Wirksamkeit bis zur Mitte des 11. Jahrh. (2 vols., 1892-1894) we learn
   that the reform of Clugny had for centuries to contend with the same
   difficulties against the secularised Church and the secularised, but
   also more independent monachism (see also Hauck, "Zur Erklärung von
   Ekkeh. Cas. s. Galli " c. 87 in the Festschrift f. Luthardt, p. 107
   ff.) as had the old monachism formerly on its introduction about 400
   into Gaul and Spain (and as had the Minorites at a later time). It is
   instructive to notice the attitude of the laity in connection with
   these three great reforms of the Church. Towards the first they were
   substantially indifferent, in the second they took a share from the
   outset (against the secularised clergy), the third (the Minorite) was
   simply carried out by them.

   [8] Sackur (II., p. 464 f.) characterises this French monastic reform
   thus: "The movement of Clugny did not start with announcing a
   programme: it was the product of a view of the world. It had no other
   aim than to oppose the coarse materialism of those days by reviving
   those institutions that admitted of an existence in sympathy with
   evangelical injunctions, even in the midst of a barbarised society. It
   was a formation of autonomous associations, such as usually arise in
   disorganised States under a weak central government, and serve to
   supplement by self-help the great social unions of, e.g., State and
   Church. From this there resulted the design of influencing from these
   institutions those around, and winning them for religion. The restored
   monasteries increased in number, the task became always greater; but it
   became in no way different. The winning of souls was, and continued to
   be, the real end. Connections became extended; we have seen how ready
   the princes were to support the efforts of the monks. Very soon every
   family of mark had its family monastery. . . . Monachism found its way
   to the courts . . . by means of a conspicuous social activity monachism
   gained hold of the masses. . . . Not a few bishops, especially in the
   South, were carried away by the current, friends of the movement came
   to occupy the Episcopal Sees. What followed was a spiritual
   transformation (but no transformation of any consequence of a literary
   and scientific kind. See what Sackur has stated, II., p. 327 ff.),
   giving pain to those who had previously built their house out of the
   ruins of the Carlovingian order of society, giving annoyance especially
   to a part of the Episcopate. . . . With this the opposition also was
   given. The ascetic Romanic movement issuing from the South mastered in
   the end the French North, captured the new Capetian dynasty, and here
   found itself confronted with an Episcopate which defended itself, in
   some cases, with desperation, against the assaults of a monachism that
   set out from the idea of a view of the world that made all things
   alike, from the thought of the universal Romanism, and that had no
   understanding for the independent pride of national churches. . . . The
   strict organisation of the German Imperial Church, its close union with
   the monarchy, the morality of the clergy (of a higher character as
   compared with the West-Frankian Church), still kept back the movement
   (at first) from the borders of Germany. It was only the process of
   ecclesiastical and civil dissolution, which began tinder Henry IV.,
   that opened the breaches through which the monastic Romanic spirit
   could penetrate into the organism of the German State." -- On Clugny
   and Rome, see Sackur II., p. 441 ff.

   characteristic expressed in its piety, it would inevitably have
   developed into Islam, or rather would have been crushed by the Roman
   world-empire. But the Mediæval Church from its origin (period of the
   migration of the nations) had absorbed into itself the Roman
   world-empire as an idea and as a force, and stood face to face with
   uncivilised nations; hence its aggressive character, which, moreover,
   it only developed after Charlemagne had shown it how the vicarius
   Christi on earth must rule. Nicolas I. learned from Charles I., the
   Gregorian popes from Otto I., Henry II., and Henry III., how the rector
   ecclesiæ must administer his office.

   [12] Their doctrines were imported from the East -- from Bulgaria; that
   old remnants of sects survived in the West itself (Priscillians) is not
   impossible. But spontaneous developments also must be recognised, such
   as have arisen in all ages of the Church's history, from reading
   Scripture and the Fathers, and from old reminiscences. In the twelfth
   century, heresy became an organised power, frightfully dangerous to the
   Church, in some regions -- indeed, superior to it; see Reuter I., p.
   153 f., and Döllinger's work, Beiträge zur Sectengesch. des
   Mittelalters, 2 Thl., München 1890, in which the Paulicians, Bogomili,

   lactavit, manus ejus tornatiles, quibus ei servivit, et pectus ejus, in

   [23] See the Poems of Bernard and the 86 Sermons on the Song of Songs,
   which determined the character of the piety of the following
   generations. These sermons became the source of the Catholic
   Christ-mysticism. Ritschl, however, (Lesefrüchte aus dem hl. Bernhard,
   Stud. u. Krit. 1879, pp. 317-335) has noted (see Neander, 1.c. p. 116),
   that in these sermons true evangelical thoughts also find expression.
   "The cause of that I was constrained to see in this, that the preacher
   did not handle his doctrinal material in the historical order which
   dogmatic theology adheres to among both Catholics and Evangelicals --
   an order according to which the doctrines treated first are dealt with
   without regard to those that follow. We can see rather, without
   difficulty, that the preacher uses the points of doctrine as they
   present themselves in the practical circle of vision." Ritschl points
   to the following passages (see also Wolff, Die Entw. d. einen christl.
   K. 1889, p. 165 ff.): Sermo LXIX. 3 (the gravity of original sin: the
   degree of injury is determined by regeneration); Sermo LXXII. 8
   (significance of death: among the redeemed "propter quos omnia fiunt,"
   it must be regarded as an expression, not of God's wrath, but of His
   mercy, as the act of redemption from the conflict between the law in
   the members and the sanctified will); Sermo XXII. 7-11 (righteousness
   by faith; it is not equivalent to power given for good works, but "unde
   vera justitia nisi de Christi misericordia? . . .soli justi qui de ejus
   misericordia veniam peccatorum consecuti sunt . . .quia non modo justus
   sed et beatus, cui non imputabit deus peccatum"); Sermo XX. 2; XI. 3;
   VI. 3 (redemptive work of Christ: the work of love ["non in omni mundi
   fabrica tantum fatigationis auctor assumpsit"], of which the modus is
   the exinanitio of God, its fruit nostri de illo repletio, and which is
   divine, because Christ here kept in view the way of acting which is
   God's way, who makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good. The
   communicatio idiomatum is not understood here in the Greek sense, but
   is exhibited in the motives of Christ; VI. 3: "dum in carne et per
   carnem facit opera, non carnis sed dei . . .manifeste ipsum se esse
   judicat, per quem eadem et ante fiebant, quando fiebant. In carne,
   inquam, et per carnem potenter et patienter operatus mira, locutus
   salubria, passus indigna evidentur ostendit, quia ipse sit, qui
   potenter sed invisibiliter sæcula condidisset, sapienter regeret,
   benigne protegeret. Denique dum evangelizat ingratis, signa præbet
   infidelibus, pro suis crucifixoribus orat, nonne liquido ipsum se esse
   declarat, qui cum patre suo quotidie oriri facit solem super bonos et
   malos, pluit super justos et injustos?" ): Sermo XXI. 6, 7; LXXXV. 5
   (the restored image of God in man); Sermo LXVIII. 4; LXXI. 11 (the
   founding of the Church as the aim of redemption); LXXVIII. 3 (Church
   and predestination); Sermo VIII. 2, XII. 11, XLVI. 4, LI. 5 (conception
   and marks of the historic Church, where the rigidly juristic view is
   quite absent: in XII. 11, it is said that no individual may declare
   himself the bride of Christ; the members of the Church only share in
   the honour which belongs to the Church as bride). Cf. also Ritschl,
   Gesch. des Pietismus I., p. 46 ff., and Rechtfert. u. Versöhn, I.2 p.
   109 ff., where it is shown how for Bernard the thought of grace
   controls everything.

   [24] "Why dost thou seek in the Word for the Word that already stands
   before thine eyes as Incarnate? Iie that hath ears to hear, let him
   hear Him crying in the temple, If any man thirst, let him come unto me
   and drink. . . . O, if thou only once tastedst of the rich marrow of
   the grain with which the heavenly Jerusalem is satisfied, how willingly
   wouldst thou leave the Jewish scribes to gnaw at their
   bread-crusts. . . . Experto crede, aliquid amplius invenies in silvis,
   quam in libris. Ligna et lapides docebunt, quod a magistris audire non
   possis."

   [25] Bernard was reverenced as an apostle and prophet "among all
   nations of Gaul and Germany." The lament of Odo of Morimond (see
   Hüffer, l.c. p. 21 ff.) is very touching, and proves at the same time
   the incomparable influence of his personality. Since Augustine, no such
   man had been given to the Church. "Vivit Bernardus et nardus ejus dedit
   odorem suum etiam in morte." "His life is hid with Christ in God," with
   this the disciple comforted himself at the grave. "Verba ejus spiritus
   et vita erant." The recollection of the days when Bernard wandered as a
   preacher of the cross through the districts of Germany long survived;
   for the Germans had never heard such a preacher. See the Historia
   miraculorum in itinere Germanico patratorum in Migne CLXXXV.; Hüffer,
   p. 70 ff. (who certainly is remarkably credulous). The correspondence
   of Bernard stands alone in the twelfth century as regards importance
   and extent. Almost 500 letters by himself are extant.

   [26] The "excedere et cum Christo esse" (S. LXXXV.) was understood even
   by Bernard as meaning, that the soul loses itself, and in the embraces
   of the bridegroom ceases to be a proper ego. But where the soul is
   merged in the Godhead, the Godhead becomes resolved into the All-One.

   [27] Follow Christ became the watchword; it broke through the
   restrictions which dogmatic had drawn, and turned to the Lord Himself.
   For all relations of life, the suffering, humble, and patient Saviour
   was presented as an example. What a quickening was the result! But from
   this point it was possible that a familiarity of feeling should develop
   itself, which conflicts with reverence for the Redeemer, and because
   the value of Christ was seen, in a one-sided way, in His example, other
   sides necessarily suffered neglect. With Bernard that was not yet the
   case; but already in him it is astonishing how the Greek dogmatic
   scheme of Christology had to give place in praxi to a scheme quite
   different. After he has shown in the 16th sermon that the rapid spread
   of Christianity was due simply to the preaching of the person of Jesus,
   that the image of Jesus had assuaged wrath, humbled pride, healed the
   wounds of envy, checked luxury, quenched lust, bridled avarice, and, in
   short, had driven out all the lower passions of men, he continues:
   Siquidem cum nomino Jesum, hominem mihi propono mitem et humilem corde,
   benignum, sobrium, castum, misericordem et omni denique honestate et
   sanctitate conspicuum eundemque ipsum deum omnipotentem, qui suo me et
   exemplo sanet et roboret adjutorio. Hæc omnia simul mihi sonant, cum
   insonuerit Jesus. Sumo itaque mihi exempla de homine et auxilium de
   potente." Thus did one write, while in theory rejecting Adoptianism!
   This Bemardine Christology, of which the roots lie in Augustine,
   requires no two-nature doctrine; it excludes it. It is fully
   represented by the formula that Jesus is the sinless man, approved by
   suffering, to whom the divine grace by which He lives has lent such
   power that His image takes shape in other men, i.e., incites to counter
   love and imparts humility. Caritas and humilitas were practical
   Christianity, till St. Francis gave as much vividness of form to the
   latter in his demand for poverty as was to be exhibited by love in
   imitation of Christ in His course of suffering. All the ascetic
   treatises of the period speak of humility; see Petrus Comestor, Hist.
   evang. c. 133: "est debita humilitas subdere se majori propter deum,
   abundans (humilitas) subdere se pari, superabundans subdere se minori."
   Note the distinction also, so important subsequently in the doctrine of
   the merit of Christ, between debita, abundans, and superabundans.

   [28] It counterbalanced the legal righteousness and "meritoriousness"
   that lay close at hand from other sides. Ritschl remarks very correctly
   (Rechtf. und Versöhn. I.2, p. 117): "It is an erroneous view that the
   Latin Catholicism of the Middle Ages was summed up in the cultivation
   of legal righteousness and meritoriousness." It has as its correlate
   the mysticism that sacrifices the personal ego, to which at one time a
   theologico-acosmistic, at another time a christologico-lyrical
   character is given. But the simple trust in God, who reveals His grace
   in Christ, with the confession: "Sufficit mihi ad omnem justitiam solum
   habere propitium, cui soli peccavi" (Bernh. serm. in cant. xxiii. 15),
   was certainly not wanting in individual cases. Here and there, but
   above all in view of death, it triumphed, both over the calculations of
   legal righteousness and over the vagueness of mysticism. Flacius and
   Chemnitz were right in seeking and collecting testimonies for the
   evangelical doctrine of justification from the Middle Ages, and as
   Augustine in his day could justly assert that his doctrine of grace had
   its tradition in the prayers of the Church, so Chemnitz also was
   entitled to affirm that the cardinal evangelical doctrine could produce
   evidence for itself from earlier times, "Non in declamatoriis
   rhetoricationibus nec in otiosis disputationibus, sed in seriis
   exercitiis pænitentiæ et fidei, quando conscientia in tentationibus cum
   sua indignitate vel coram ipso judicio dei vel in agone mortis
   luctatur. Hoc enim solo modo rectissime intelligi potest doctrina de
   justificatione, sicut in scriptura traditur."

   [29] The "eternal gospel" of Joachim of Fiore belongs to the close of
   our period, and for a time remained latent; see Reuter, l.c. II., p.
   198 ff.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. The Development of Ecclesiastical Law. [30]

   Let us notice at least in a few words the increased activity in
   ecclesiastical law in the period under review, which was not without
   its influence on the mode of conceiving of dogma, and on the history of
   dogma.

   First, it is a fact of importance that from the middle of the second
   half of the ninth century, Church law was framed more and more on a
   Pseudoisidorian basis. Second, the preponderating attention given to
   law in general, and the growing subjection of all ecclesiastical
   questions to legal conceptions are characteristics of the period. As to
   the first point, it is well known that the Popes always continued to
   take more to do with the administration of the dioceses, [31] that the
   old metropolitan constitution lost its importance, and that the old
   constitutional state of things in general -- during the first half of
   our period -- fell into decay and ceased to exist. The Episcopal power,
   it is true, strengthened itself in many places by assuming a civil
   character, and on the other hand, the Emperors, from Otto I. to Henry
   III. after having reformed the enfeebled papacy, brought it for a time
   into dependence on the imperial crown. But as they also deprived all
   laymen, who were not princes, of all share in the direction of
   ecclesiastical affairs, and as they suppressed the independence of the
   local ecclesiastical bodies (the congregations), in the interests of
   imperialism and of "piety," only the Emperor (who called himself rector
   ecclesiæ and vicarius Christi), the Pope, and the bishops remained as
   independent powers. It was about the property of the bishops, and on
   the question as to who was the true ruler of the divine state and the
   vicar of Christ, that the great battle was really waged between the
   empire and the reformed papacy. In this struggle the latter, acting on
   the impulse given by Gregory VII., developed itself into the autocratic
   power in the Church, and accordingly after having freed itself in Rome
   from the last remnants of older constitutional conditions, framed its
   legislation by means of numerous decretals. At the "oecumenical"
   Lateran Synods of 1123 and 1139, the papacy left no doubt as to this
   new position which it meant to assert. [32] The Popes afterwards, till
   the time of Innocent III., defended and strengthened their autocratic
   position in the Church amid severe but victorious struggles. No doubt,
   they had to hear many an anxious word from their most faithful sons;
   but the rise of the papacy to despotic power in the Church, and thereby
   to dominion over the world, was promoted by the piety and by all the
   ideal forces of the period. Not in opposition to the spirit of the
   times -- how would that have been possible? -- but in union with it,
   the papacy ascended the throne of the world's history in the eleventh
   and twelfth centuries. Its opponents, so far as they possessed
   religion, were its secret allies, or contended with doubtful
   consciences, or, at least, were unable to show that the benefits for
   which they fought (national churchism, etc.) were the highest and the
   holiest. Under such circumstances the papal decretals obtained an
   ever-increasing authority. [33] They took their place beside the old
   canons, [34] nay even beside the decrees of the oecumenical Councils.
   Yet, strictly speaking, the measure of their authority remained still
   quite uncertain, and prior to Innocent III. dogmatic questions were not
   treated in them, or treated only very seldom, while the Popes in
   general, in the period of 150 years from the Synod of Sutri till 1198,
   had their hands fully occupied with establishing the Roman autocratic
   and monastic Church order. [35]

   In developing itself as the supreme court of jurisdiction, the papacy
   could never have obtained in the Church, which assuredly is fellowship
   in faith and worship, monarchical rule as regards faith and morals, had
   not the amalgamation of dogma and law become perfect in this period. It
   was not the Popes who brought about this fusion; they merely turned to
   account a mode of view which prevailed everywhere, and from which
   scarcely an individual dissented. In what has been represented from the
   beginning of Book II. of our Second Part, it has been shown that the
   legal view of religion was an old inheritance of the Latin Church;
   religion is lex dei, lex Christi. In principle, it is true, this view
   had been radically corrected by Augustinianism; but Augustine himself
   allowed the legal schemes to remain in many important particulars. Then
   there followed the mission of the Western Church among the foreign
   nations, pagan and Arian. With these it came into contact, not merely
   as an institution for religious worship, but as the Roman Christian
   system of civilisation and law. Not simply as a system of faith did it
   wish and venture to assert itself; it could assert itself at all,
   rather, only by placing its entire equipment, and all its principles,
   some of which had an extremely profane origin, under the protection of
   the divine law. Thus the Germanic and Romanic nations came to regard
   all legal ordinances of the Church as ordinances of faith, and vice
   versâ. Boniface and Charlemagne then set themselves to secure that the
   two would harmonise. The "must" became identical in the three
   sentences: "He who will be saved must believe as follows"; "the
   Christian must pay tithes"; "adultery must be atoned for by this
   particular penalty." How busily the framing, or the codification, of
   Church law was carried on from the time when Dionysius Exiguus made his
   collection till the time of Pseudoisidore, is shown by the numerous
   collections which were everywhere produced -- even in Rome still -- by
   the rich synodical life of the provincial Churches, and which were
   meant to guard the independence, the rights, and the distinctive life
   of the Church in the new world of Germanic manners. Everywhere (prior
   to the ninth century) dogma fell quite into the background; but just on
   that account the feeling became habitual, of regarding all deliverances
   of the Church as legal ordinances. The Cluniacensian-Gregorian reform
   of the eleventh century put an end to numerous traditional ordinances
   pertaining to constitution and law, and replaced them with new ones, in
   which the independence of the Church in relation to the State, and of
   Roman universalism in relation to the national Churches, found ever
   stronger expression. As the result of this, there developed itself in
   the eleventh century an imposing legislation, which was gathered up and
   completed in Gratian's collection -- though this collection was in so
   far out of date and behind the facts, as in it the legislation was not
   yet determined throughout by the thought of the concentration of
   ecclesiastical power in the hands of the Pope. [36] But besides their
   adoption of the Gregorian doctrines, this collection, and some older
   ones that preceded it, show quite a new turn of things, for they are
   the product of a study of law. Here also Gregory VII. was epoch-making.
   He was the great jurist in the papal chair, and from his time onward,
   the treatment of all functions of the Church in accordance with
   juristic science began to be the main problem. The study of law,
   carried on chiefly in Bologna, [37] exercised an immeasurable influence
   on the intellectual vision of the Church throughout its whole extent;
   the study of law, indeed, moulded thought in general. Hellenism also at
   that time exerted an incalculable influence in the way of fostering
   this study. The Romo-Grecian legislation came into the West, and
   although, at the first, it began by modifying what was still a
   "barbarian" form of secular legal life there, and by building up a
   sovereign State with its laws and officials, it yet gradually exercised
   also a furthering influence on the construction of the strict
   monarchical Church system; for what is legal for the Emperor is
   allowable for the Pope; or rather -- he is in truth the Emperor. It
   cannot be doubted that here also Rome knew how to gather grapes of
   thorns and figs of thistles. The new rights of its adversary, the
   Emperor, it applied to itself.

   What had formerly developed itself under the force of circumstances --
   the Church as a legal institution -- was now strengthened and built up
   by thought. [38] Juristic thought laid its arrest on everything. And
   yet even here need controlled the situation. For when the impulse to
   reflect is once awakened, what else can those at first become, who
   still live in a world of abstractions and are blind to nature and
   history, but jurists and dialecticians? Thus there settled down upon
   the whole Church, even upon its faith, the spirit of jurisprudence, now
   grown conscious of itself. Everything was laid hold of by it. It was a
   strong force in what is styled "Scholasticism"; it governed the most
   powerful Popes (Alexander III. as Magister Rolandus), and it began to
   bring within its sweep the form in which the traditional dogmas were
   presented. Certainly this was an easy matter for it; for in their
   practical conclusions these dogmas had already been made to serve quite
   as legal means in a legal process. What still remained was to submit to
   juristic exposition even the central tenets of faith themselves, and so
   to justify and defend them "scientifically." Here too, indeed, the
   material was not entirely in a raw state; to some extent, rather, the
   foundation stones had received a juristic shaping from the Latin
   fathers of dogma themselves (cf. Tertullian); but there was still an
   immense task presenting itself, to the full accomplishment of which an
   approach even had never been made; it was to re-think the whole
   dogmatic tradition in the spirit of jurisprudence, to represent
   every-thing under the categories of judge (God), accused, advocate,
   legal measures, satisfactions, penalties, indulgences, to make out of
   dogmas as many distinctions as obtain in secular legal order between
   universally valid, relatively valid, probable, consuetudinary law,
   positive law, etc., and to convert dogmatics into a chamber of justice,
   out of which there was afterwards to develop the merchant's hall and
   the den of thieves.

   But in the period we are considering, the Church was certainly the
   basis and sum of the highest ideals of the mediæval man, and the
   enormous contradiction on which one proceeded -- had proceeded indeed,
   from the time of Augustine -- of regarding the Church as at once the
   society of the faithful (societas fidelium), and as the hierarchically
   organised assemblage (coetus), of recognising the secular power in its
   divine right and yet suppressing its authority, was by many scarcely
   felt [39] . Only at the end of the epoch did the inner antagonism
   become apparent; but the hierarchy had then already become the Church.
   Just at that time, therefore, the claim of the hierarchy, and specially
   of the papacy, was proclaimed as dogma, and the struggle of the civil
   powers against the despotism of the Pope was declared to be as really
   rebellion against Christ as was the assertion of the sects that the
   true Church is the opposite of the hierarchy. This will have to be
   dealt with in the following chapter.

   [31] Nicholas I., Leo IX., Alexander II., Alexander III. represent the
   stages prior to Innocent III. But Gregory VII. was the soul of the
   great movement in the eleventh century.

   [32] The numbering of the oecumenical Councils, which has now become a
   sententia communis among the curialist theologians, has been
   established on the authority of Bellarmin (see Döllinger and Reusch,
   Die Selbstbiographie des Cardinals Bellarmin, 1887, p. 226 ff. That
   previous to him Antonius Augustinus [ob. 1586] counted them in the same
   way, has been pointed out by Buschball: "Die Professiones fidei der
   Päpste," separately printed from the Röm. Quartalschr. 10 Bd., 1896, p.
   62). In the sixteenth century there still prevailed the greatest
   diversity in the enumeration: indeed the majority did not regard those
   Councils in which the Greek Church did not take part as oecumenical at
   all. There was likewise conflict of opinion as to whether the Councils
   of Bâsle, Florence (and Constance), were to be reckoned in. Antonius
   Augustinus and Bellarmin (in the Roman edition of the Concilia
   generalia of 1608 f.), included the Lateran Councils of 1123 and 1139
   (and left out the Council of Bâsle). "The question, it is true, was of
   subordinate importance for Bellarmin, in as much as he places on the
   same level with the decrees of the General Councils those of the
   Particular' Councils held under the presidency of the Pope, or
   sanctioned by him; but having in view those who held, not that the
   Pope, but that the General Council was infallible, it was certainly
   necessary for him to discuss the question as to what Councils are to be
   regarded as general." But in thus determining the question, he
   naturally allowed himself to be influenced by his strong curialistic
   standpoint, that is, he set aside the Council of Constance and Bâsle,
   and placed among the oecumenical Councils that of Florence, the fourth
   and fifth Lateran Councils, the first of Lyons, and that of Vienna, on
   the ground that these favoured the papacy. He thus arrived at the
   number of eighteen approved General Councils (eight from the first ten
   centuries, the Lateran Councils of 1123, 1139, 1179, 1215, those of
   Lyons in 1245 and 1274, that of Vienna in 1311, that of Florence, the
   fifth Lateran Council, and that of Trent). But here also, as everywhere
   in Catholic dogmatics, there are "half" authorities, and half genuine
   coin, in spite of the Holy Ghost who guides into all truth. That is to
   say, several Councils are "partly ratified, partly rejected," those of
   Constance and Bâsle being among them, and the Council of Pisa in 1409
   is "neither manifestly ratified nor manifestly rejected." Since the
   year 1870, the question about the number of the Councils has completely
   lost all real interest for Catholics. But reactionary Protestantism has
   every reason to feel interested in it. Buschball (l.c. pp. 60, 74, 79),
   holds that in the Middle Ages a distinction in principle was not made
   between the view taken of the Councils of the first thousand years and
   that taken of those that were later. But he adduces no proof that prior
   to the Council of Constance the later Councils were placed quite on a
   level with the earlier, and even by what he adduces for the time
   subsequent uncertainty is suggested. How could the Mediæval Councils be
   regarded even before the Council of Trent as quite of equal standing
   with those of the first ten centuries, when, up to the time of this
   Council, the general opinion was certainly to the effect that dogma was
   contained in fundamental and final form in the twelve articles, and in
   the interpretation relating to them which they had received from the
   older Councils! The process of equalising was probably begun by the
   Councils of Florence and Basle, with their high degree of
   self-consciousnes. That Councils at all could be pointed to in the long
   period between the ninth and the fifteenth centuries, was necessarily
   of more importance than the taking account of what was decided at these
   Councils, of how they were constituted, and of the authority that
   guided them. We may very well venture to say therefore: in the
   fifteenth century the equalising had begun with some hesitation, the
   Council of Trent favoured it by its weight, and it then became
   established.

   [33] On the development of the primacy in the eleventh and twelfth
   centuries, see Döllinger, Janus, p. 107 ff. (Schwane, Dogmengesch. des
   Mittelalters, p. 530 ff.). How much stronger was the Gregorian party in
   the eleventh century than the Pseudoisidorian in the ninth, and how
   much more revolutionary and aware of his aim was Gregory VII. than
   Nicolas I.! "He was the first who, with full, clear consciousness, was
   determined to introduce a new condition of things into the Church by
   new means. He regarded himself not merely as the reformer of the
   Church, but as the divinely chosen founder of an order of things such
   as had never before existed." His chief means were Synods held by the
   Pope (this was begun by Leo IX.) and new ecclesiastical law-books. The
   nephew of Pope Alexander II., Anselm of Lucca, became the founder of
   the new Gregorian Church law, this being effected by him partly by
   making apt use of that of Pseudoisidore, and partly by a new set of
   fictions (e.g., that the episcopacy everywhere originated from Peter)
   and forgeries. He was followed by Deusdedit, Bonizo, and Cardinal
   Gregorius. Deusdedit formulated the new principle, that contradictions
   in the traditional Church law must always be harmonised by letting, not
   the older, but the greater authority, that is, the dictum of the Pope
   cancel the opposite view. In this way the autocracy of the Popes was
   established. On the series of new fictions and falsifications of the
   old tradition, see Janus, p.:12 ff. Specially important is the way in
   which history was induced to furnish testimony in proof of the
   infallibility of the papal decretals, and in which even Augustine was
   pronounced an authority for this new doctrine (p. 119 ff. ). A sentence
   of his was so manipulated that it came to mean that the papal letters
   stood on a level with canonical Scripture. Since then the defenders of
   the infallibility of the Pope, to which Gregory VII. already made a
   distinct claim, and, indeed, treated it as concessum (p. 124 ff.), have
   always appealed to Augustine. Indeed, Gregory VII., following an
   earlier precedent, ciaimed for the Popes a complete personal holiness
   -- for they have all that Peter had -- and the Pope's holiness, in
   addition to his infallibility, was so boldly taught by the Gregorians
   (imputation of the merit of Peter) that anything stronger in the way of
   claim became impossible.

   [34] Alexander II. wrote to King Philip of France, requesting him to
   rank the papal decrees along with the canons; see Jaffé, Regesta, 2
   Edit., Nr. 4525.

   [35] The Lateran Synods of 1123, 1139, 1179, contain nothing whatever
   of a dogmatic character (excepting the twenty-seventh canon of the
   Council of 1179, which urges the extermination of the Cathari, but says
   nothing of their doctrine); see Mansi XXI., XXII., Hefele V.2, pp. 378

   that everything is to be traced back to the power given to it, the
   legal organism was placed in the foreground; see Kahl, Die

   significance of Augustine for the struggles in Church politics in the
   eleventh century has for the first time been methodically and
   thoroughly described. It amounted directly to less than one would have
   expected, and it is noteworthy that the Antigregorians can show a
   larger heritage of Augustinian thoughts than their opponents (see

   3. The Revival of Science. [40]

   Theologians and philosophers have vied with one another in endeavouring
   to find a specific definition of Scholasticism, and to differentiate
   what this term is meant to denote, from the theology and philosophy of
   the old (Greek) Church on the one hand, and from modern science on the
   other. These efforts have led to no accepted result; nor could they
   lead to any such, for Scholasticism is simply nothing but scientific
   thought. That this thought was governed by prejudices, [41] and that
   from these it in some respects did not free itself at all, and in some
   respects freed itself only slowly, is shared by the science of the
   Middle Ages with the science of every age. Neither dependence on
   authorities, nor the preponderance of the deductive method, was
   specially characteristic of Scholasticism; for science in fetters has
   existed in every period -- our descendants will find that present-day
   science is in many respects not controlled merely by pure experience --
   and the dialectico-deductive method is the means that must be used by
   all science that has the courage to emphasise strongly the conviction
   of the unity of all that is. But it is not even correct to say that
   within mediæval science that method prevailed alone, or chiefly. The
   realism that was represented by Albert and Thomas, acting upon impulses
   received from Augustine, made excellent use of experience, and Scotism
   and Nominalism in particular are partly based on the empiric method,
   though as compared with the deductive, Duns may have found fault with
   this method as confused. What is of importance here is only this, that
   the observation of the external world was extremely imperfect, that, in
   a word, natural science, and the science of history did not exist, the
   reason being that men knew how to observe spirit, but not how to
   observe things of sense. [42] But least of all must Scholasticism be
   reproached with treating "artificial," "fabricated" problems. On its
   premises they were not artificial, and if they were boldly wrought out,
   it was only a proof of scientific energy.

   The Scholasticism of the Middle Ages, then, was simply science, and it
   is merely perpetuating an unwarranted mistrust when it is thought that
   this part of the general history of science may be designated by a
   special name. [43] As if science in general had not its stages, as if
   the mediæval stage was distinguished from the rest by its unparalleled
   and culpable obscurity! On the contrary, it may rather be said that
   Scholasticism furnishes a unique and luminous example of the fact that
   thought finds its way even under the most adverse conditions, and that
   even the gravest prejudices that weigh it down are not heavy enough to
   quench its life. The science of the Middle Ages gives practical proof
   of eagerness in thinking, and exhibits an energy in subjecting all that
   is real and valuable to thought, to which we can find, perhaps, no
   parallel in any other age. [44]

   Hence it is useless to direct one's ingenuity to answering the question
   as to what kind of science presents itself in Scholasticism; we have
   simply rather to inquire into the conditions under which scientific
   thought was placed at that time. Not equally useless, but vaguely
   treated, is the academic question, much discussed and marked by
   confusion and wearisomeness, with regard to the relation of
   Scholasticism to Mysticism. [45] If by Scholasticism there is
   understood (though this is arbitrary) "the hand-maid of hierarchism,"
   or, with sudden change of front, the "construction of systems without
   concern for the needs of the inner life," or the "rationalistic craving
   for proof," and if Mysticism is then placed alongside as the free
   pectoral theology, then the most beautiful contrasts can be drawn --
   Hagar and Sarah, Martha and Mary. But with little trouble Scholasticism
   and Mysticism can, on the other hand, be resolved into each other, and
   a daring dialectic performance can be carried on with these terms,
   which does honour to the acuteness of the author, but which has only
   the disadvantage that one is as wise after, as before, the definitions
   have been given. The thing to be dealt with here is simple.
   Scholasticism is science, applied to religion, and -- at least, till
   the time when it underwent self-disintegration -- science setting out
   from the axiom, that all things are to be understood from theology,
   that all things therefore must be traced back to theology. This axiom
   regularly presupposes that the thinker feels himself to be in entire
   dependence on God, that he seeks to know this dependence ever more
   deeply, and that he uses every means for the strengthening of his own
   religious life; for only in the measure in which he finds, and knows
   himself to be, under and in God, is he made capable of understanding
   all else, since, of course, to understand things means nothing else
   than to know their relation to the One and All, or to the Author (i.e.,
   in both cases, to God). From this it follows at once that personal
   piety is the presupposition of science. But in so far as personal piety
   at that time was always thought of as contemplation of the relation of
   the ego to God accompanied by asceticism, [46] Mysticism is the
   presupposition of Scholasticism; in other words, mediæval science bases
   itself on piety, and on piety, too, which is itself contemplation,
   which lives therefore in an intellectual element. From this it follows,
   that this piety itself prompts to thought; for the strong impulse to
   become acquainted with the relation of one's own ego to God necessarily
   leads to the determination of the relation of the creation, of which
   one knows himself to be a part, to God. Now, where this knowledge is so
   pursued that insight into the relation of the world to God is sought
   for solely or chiefly with the view of understanding the position of
   one's own soul to God, and of inwardly growing through such
   understanding, we speak of Mystic theology. [47] But where this reflex
   aim of the process of knowledge does not present itself so distinctly,
   where, rather, the knowledge of the world in its relation to God
   acquires a more independent objective interest, [48] the term
   Scholastic theology is employed. From this it appears that we have not
   before us two magnitudes that run parallel, or that, forsooth, collide
   with each other, but that Mystic theology and Scholastic theology are
   one and the same phenomenon, which only present themselves in manifold
   gradations, according as the subjective or objective interest prevails.
   [49] The former interest was so little lacking even to the most
   distinguished Schoolmen that their whole theology can be unhesitatingly
   described as also Mystic theology -- for Thomas, Mysticism is the
   starting-point and practical application of Scholasticism -- and, on
   the other hand, there are theologians who are described as Mystics, but
   who, in the strength of their desire to know the world, and to
   understand in a systematic way the Church doctrine, are not a whit
   behind the so-called Schoolmen. But in saying this the further position
   is already stated, that a specific difference between the scientific
   means had likewise no existence. Here also it is simply a question of
   shade (nuance). The view of the God in whom, and from whom, all things
   must be understood, was given by the Church tradition. But in this view
   also subjective piety was trained. The formal shaping elements were
   likewise everywhere the same. Inasmuch as the scientific means were
   derived entirely from the same three sources, the authoritative dogma,
   inner experience, and the traditional philosophy, any differences that
   would be more than varieties cannot be made out (a greater or less
   passing into the background of logical formalism, a preference for
   inner observation over authoritative tradition [50] ).

   Yet it is said that great inner antagonisms entered into mediæval
   science. Anselm and his opponents are pointed to, Bernard and Abelard,
   the German theologians of the fourteenth century and the Churchmen who
   pronounced them heretics, and from the contrasted positions in these
   cases the formula is framed, that here Mysticism is in conflict with
   Scholasticism. Differences certainly there are here; but that stock
   controversial term throws a very uncertain light on them. Above all,
   the phenomena here gathered together can by no means be united in one
   group. But before we deal with them, it will be well to answer the main
   question stated above, under what conditions the scientific thought of
   the Middle Ages was placed, or, let us say, how it developed itself,
   and what were the concrete factors which determined it (in the way of
   advancing or retarding), and thereby gave it its peculiar stamp. From
   this inquiry the proper light will naturally be thrown upon these
   "antagonisms" which are erroneously represented when they are described
   as a struggle of two opposing principles.

   The Middle Ages received from the ancient Church not only the
   substantially completed dogma, but also -- as a living force -- the
   philosophy, or say, the theology which had been employed in the shaping
   of dogma, and together with this also a treasury of classical
   literature, which had little or no connection with the philosophy and
   the dogma, but which answered to an element in the antique view of life
   in Italy and Byzantium that had never quite disappeared. These three
   things constituted the legacy of the old world to the new. But they
   already contained in them all the contrasts that came to view in the
   inner life of the Middle Ages, when consciousness of that inheritance
   had been awakened. These "antagonisms" were as actively at work in the
   Greek Church from the days of Origen and Jerome as they afterwards were
   in the Mediæval Church. In this sense all scientific developments of
   the West in the Middle Ages were simply a continuation of what the
   Greek Church had already partly passed through, and was partly still
   continuing to pass through in feeble movements. The difference
   consisted only in this, that in the West everything gradually developed
   itself to a higher degree of energy; that the Church, as the visible
   commonwealth of God on earth, impressed its stamp on all secular life,
   taking even science into closer connection with itself, giving it a
   higher flight, and at the same time requiring it by its authority to
   adopt juristic thought; and finally in this, that from Greek science
   Augustinianism was absent.

   We have remarked above that along with the substantially completed
   dogma the Middle Ages received from antiquity the related philosophy or
   theology. But this very circumstance introduced strain: for while this
   theology was certainly "related," yet as certainly also did it contain,
   as a living force, elements that were hostile to dogma, whether we
   think of Neoplatonism or Aristotelianism. It is well known that in the
   Greek Church, from the fifth and sixth centuries, both schools worked
   upon dogma, and that "heresies" to the right and left were the result
   (pantheism and tritheism, spiritualistic Mysticism and rationalistic
   Criticism), and that then, from the Justinian age, the Scholasticism
   evolved itself which found the via media between the Areopagite and
   John Philoponus. [51]

   In the theological science of John of Damascus there presents itself
   the reconciliation of dogma with Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism. [52]
   Here the former plays the principal part in the principles, the latter
   in the working out; for with the help of dialectic distinction one can
   remove all difficulties and contradictions that emerge. But the
   independent force of the Neoplatonic and Aristotelian philosophies was
   not broken by the harmonising. The books in which they were contained
   continued to be read, and thus in Byzantium the strain did not cease.
   Mystic theology was further cultivated, Aristotle was studied, and
   although the acts of aggression always grew feebler, both of them
   threatened the Church with its dogma, the Church that was meanwhile
   growing more powerless in the embraces of the State. There were the
   further circumstances that memories of the theologically unconcerned
   age of antiquity had never died out, that a certain worldly culture,
   indifferent to religion, and often indeed degenerating into barbarism,
   still survived, which was strong enough to hinder the Eastern Church
   from ever making even an approach to the carrying out of its ideals and
   aims in secular life and secular culture. From the days of the
   Alexandrian Theophilus monks and pious laymen might lament over the
   godlessness of the ancient literature and wish it in hell, but no one
   was able either to banish it, or to purify it, and bring it entirely
   into the service of ecclesiastical science.

   If we pass now to the Carlovingian period, i.e., to the first epoch of
   scientific advance in the West, we find exactly the same elements side
   by side, only with one important addition (Augustinianism). There is an
   eager endeavour to become acquainted with the traditional dogma and to
   think it out, and, as the Adoptian controversy shows, there is at the
   same time a surrender to entire dependence on the Greeks. In the
   writings of Boethius and Isidore there is possessed a source, rich
   enough for that period, from which the dialectic science of method may
   be learned. As the work of John Scotus shows, the Neoplatonic Mysticism
   had already become known to the West from the writings of Dionysius and
   Maximus; besides this, however, it was represented in a theistic
   setting, and with incomparable attractiveness, by Augustine. Finally,
   the ancient literature (poets and historians) was sought out, and
   through contact with Italy there arose the seductive pictures of a
   blithesome life that had never altogether vanished.

   But the forces which the West had at its command at that time were
   still too weak to admit of working independently with the capital that
   had been inherited. To become familiar with Augustine and Gregory I.,
   to understand the christological speculations of the Greeks, and to
   master the simplest rules of logic and method -- that was the real task
   of the period. What was attempted beyond this, Scotus excepted, was a
   feeble renaissance: indeed the union of the antique with the
   theological at the court of Charles the Great has something childish.
   This union therefore was soon dissolved again. Not for the first time
   under Louis the Pious, but as early as the last years of Charles I.
   himself, the ascetic thought of the ancient Church asserted its
   influence even in science. And so it continued to be afterwards; we can
   observe indeed, on till the thirteenth century, a steady increase of
   aversion to the antique, while, no doubt, some bold spirits sought more
   than before to learn from it. In theory secular studies were discarded.
   Ancient literature was regarded as a source of temptations. All science
   which did not place itself under theology, i.e., which did not refer
   everything to the knowledge of God, was held to be pernicious, nay, to
   be a seduction of the devil. But as what is characteristic, in all
   fields, of the mediæval view of the world consists in this, that it
   aims at uniting the ununitable, and requires that negation of the world
   shall be attained in the form of dominion over it, so we observe here
   also that what is rejected is again adopted. Ancient literature and
   philosophy were certainly employed as a formal means of culture, and
   with a view also to the refutation of pagans, Jews, and heretics, and
   to a fathoming of the divine mysteries. It was to some extent the same
   persons who rejected them in the end, who on their slow, toilsome
   journey to the summit made use of them. And where they were different
   persons, yet there was at bottom between the two an elective affinity;
   for all thinkers who came to be influential, though some of them may
   appear to us "illuminists" (Aufklärer) and others traditionalists, were
   dominated by the same fundamental thought of tracing back all things to
   God and understanding them from Him. And when in the end the Church
   released Aristotle and allowed full use to be made of him, that was not
   done by way of yielding to outward constraint, but because the Church
   theology was now strong enough to master this master, and because he
   could furnish it with the most effectual help against the dangers of a
   bold idealism which threatened dogma. Though the schools, the
   universities, might not be ecclesiastical institutions in the strict
   sense of the term, science was ecclesiastical, theological. There was
   no lay science. The thought of such science was for that age equivalent
   to paganism and nihilism.

   From the Carlovingian period a chain of scientific tradition and
   schools of learning extends into the eleventh century; [53] but a
   continuous increase of scientific activity cannot be ascertained, and
   even the greatest masters (Gerbert of Rheims) did not produce effects
   that were epoch-making. Not till the middle of the century was the
   advancement begun that was followed by no further declension, and the
   thread formed that was not again to break. The inner rise of the Church
   was unquestionably the determining cause of this upward movement of
   science, although we are surprised at meeting quite at the beginning
   with a trained skill in dialectic for which we had not been prepared,
   and which must have gone on developing in the dark ages (saculum
   obscurum) in spite of their darkness. But how could the inner revival
   of the Church have continued without results for science? The Church
   conceived itself at that time as spiritual power, as the power of the
   supersensuous life over the sensuous; the subject of science was the
   supersensuous; science, therefore, was challenged by this revival! But
   even the science which revels in the transcendental, and which readily
   attaches itself to revelations, cannot deny its character as science.
   Even where it is, and wishes to be, the handmaid of revelation, it will
   always embrace an element by which it offends the faith which desires
   rest; it will exhibit a freshness and joy which to devoutness appears
   as insolence; nay, even when it knows itself to be one with the Church
   in its starting-point and aims, it will never be able to deny a
   negative tendency, for it will always be justified in finding that the
   principles of the Church suffer deterioration in the concrete
   expressions of life, and are disfigured by superstition.

   In the dazzling light in which Reuter, the marvellous master of that
   literature, has presented the conflicts between young mediæval science
   and the men of the Church (Berengar and Lanfranc, Anselm and his
   opponents, Abelard and Bernard), the persons engaged appear like
   spectral caricatures. Because this scholar tries to find "negative
   illuminism" everywhere in the movements, things are deprived of their
   proportion, and the common ground on which the combatants stand almost
   entirely disappears. With wonder and astonishment we see one
   Herostratus after another cross the stage, surrounded by troops of
   like-minded disciples; the "primacy of infallible reason" is set up by
   them, after they have destroyed authority; the antitheses become as
   abrupt as cliffs, and frightful chasms open up. But the biographer of
   these heroes, so far as he does not charge them with hypocrisy, must
   himself regularly acknowledge in some stray turn of thought, that they
   stood in closest connection with their age and with their opponents,
   that their enormously magnified performances were of a much more modest
   kind, and that the great illuminists were obedient sons of the Church.
   In opposition to this representation we follow out the hints given
   above, in order to elucidate and understand these struggles.

   In the higher rise of science three things were involved: the
   penetrating more deeply into the Neoplatonic-Augustinian principles of
   all theology, the dialectic art of analysis, and, united with both, a
   certain knowledge of the ancient classics and of the Church Fathers. As
   regards those principles, it was the spirit of the so-called Platonic
   Realism that prevailed. By means of it, as it had been derived from
   Augustine and from dogma itself, and from a hundred little sources
   also, dogma -- but the world, too, as well -- came to be understood,
   and all things came to be known from and in God. Till the beginning of
   the twelfth century this Platonic Realism, with its spiritualistic
   sublimating tendency and its allegorical method, reigned pretty much
   unbroken. It reigned all the more securely, the less a conception of it
   had as yet been consciously formed (as a theory of knowledge). [54] It
   was peculiar to it that it set out from faith, and then made itself
   master of dogma in the way in which dogma had formerly arisen ("credo
   ut intelligam" -- this position of Augustine was not merely reasserted
   by Anselm, but was willingly assented to by all Church thinkers of the
   period). But it was, further, peculiar to it that it took a flight
   beyond dogma. This had occurred in Greek Mysticism as well as with
   Augustine, and it repeated itself, without the danger being observed,
   from the eleventh century (and just, too, among the "most pious"
   philosophers). Here lay the first antagonism. As one got to understand
   dogma by the help of the same means by which it had arisen, that idea
   of the immanence of God, of all things existing in God, asserted
   itself, before which the historical, and dogma itself, threatened to
   vanish, i.e., were viewed as the final stage needing sublimation. So
   Origen thought, so also had Augustine felt, and had expressed it at the
   outskirts of his speculation, [55] so was it taught by the Greek
   Mystics. [56] From this point, as by a circuit, a complete
   rehabilitation of reason could take place. After getting its dismissal
   at the beginning -- revelation decides and authority -- reason was now
   the means for removing out of the way whatever hindered the thought of
   the absoluteness, the immutability and immanence of God. It neutralised
   miracle, in order to give expression to the strict uniformity of the
   operation of the All-One; it neutralised even the history of salvation,
   and history in general, or transformed it into the circulating course

   of the operative Being that is, was, and shall be; it neutralised,
   finally, the creature. The "illuminist" of the eleventh and twelfth
   centuries would still have to be found who did not play his
   "illuminist" part under the influence of this mysticism, who did not
   likewise take the "credo ut intelligam" as his starting-point. Though,
   like Berengar, he might compare the literally understood Jewish law
   with the laws of the Romans, Athenians, and Spartans in order to give
   the palm to the latter, though like Abelard, he might unite into one
   the history of salvation and general history in the "philosophy of
   religion on a historic basis" -- this was still done on the
   understanding that there was to be absolute validity obtained for all
   that the Church offered of material content, by means of sublimating
   (allegory); it was done in the name of the conception of God and of the
   theology which prevailed also among the opponents, so far as they
   thought at all, and these latter started back before conclusions which
   Justin, Origen, and the great group of Greek and Latin Fathers had long
   before drawn. [57] So it was not that principle stood opposed to
   principle, but the amount of application was disputed [58] -- unless we
   should have to regard as the real principle of mediæval ecclesiastical
   theology, lack of thought, or blind surrender. But that was not what
   the Church Fathers taught, nor was it what the Church itself wished
   when it again conceived of itself as spiritual power in the eleventh
   century. How slight really is the distinction between Berengar and
   Anselm as theologians! It often entirely disappears; for how far were
   those represented as wild destroyers from drawing the conclusions in
   their totality, and from repeating, say, the thoughts of Erigena! They
   were not innovators, but restorers; not a trace is to be found in them
   of negative illuminism.

   In the Greek Church Aristotelianism had made its appearance when dogma
   and speculation could no longer be reconciled, and it rendered the
   Church invaluable service as the Horos which kept the Sophia of the
   Mystics from plunging into the abyss of the primeval Father. But along
   with these services it had at the same time brought at first unpleasant
   gifts in addition. While it checked unrestrained idealism, and at the
   same time set to work to make paradoxical and burdensome formulæ
   tolerable by means of distinctions, it also subjected to revision
   formulæ that collapsed as soon as their basis of Platonic Realism was
   taken from them. This Aristotelianism, which was so necessary, but of
   which there had been such bad experiences, as it appeared in John
   Philoponus and other Greeks, not to speak of the old Antiochian School,
   was known also to those in the West, through Boethius, and from other
   sources (in a poor enough form, no doubt, more directly as logical
   method), and long before had concluded (in the case of Boethius
   himself, e.g.), an irregular marriage with the Neoplatonic doctrine of
   principles. To the spirit of the West, which had more of understanding
   than of reason, and, as juristic also, constantly strove after
   distinctions, this Aristotelianism was congenial. From it there
   developed "dialectic," at first, too, as scientific art. And as this
   scientific art always encourages insolence and pride where it is held
   to be the sum of all wisdom, so was it at the beginning of the Middle
   Ages. The schooled " dialecticians" of the eleventh century looked
   proudly down on the obscurantists who did not understand art, while
   these again became concerned about the traditional Church doctrine,
   although the operations of the youthful science only seldom touched the
   kernel of things, unless it was that one here and there ventured too
   far with his art in regard to dogmas that stood in the centre of vision
   (doctrines of the Trinity, of the two natures, of the Eucharist), and,
   anticipating the later Nominalism, or recalling unpleasant facts in the
   history of tradition, served up a questionable attempt at solving the
   trinitarian problem (tritheistic, Sabellian), or approached too near
   the old Adoptianism, or threw doubt on the current opinion about the
   external miracle in the Eucharist. In this way the first conflicts
   arose, which were lacking in real sharpness, however, because the
   dialectic itself stood in league with Platonic Realism, and at bottom
   did not know very often what it really wanted. At the same time it must
   not be denied, that wherever the understanding is brought in, it will
   assert its own rights and will overleap the limits of a purely formal
   activity. But it is shown, e.g., by the science of Anselm, how
   peacefully, under certain conditions, dogma, Platonic Realism, and
   dialectic harmonised.

   Yet in the twelfth century that came to be otherwise. In Abelard [59]
   both the critical tendency of Platonic Realism (cf. his view of
   history) and the critical tendency of dialectic grew stronger, without
   his abandoning, however, in the fundamental theses, his relation of
   dependence on the Church doctrine. Abelard was the boldest theologian
   of his time, because he understood how to derive the critical side from
   all elements of tradition, and was really persuaded of the
   defectiveness just of what was held valid. His opponents of his day
   thought that the dangers of his science arose quite essentially from
   his dialectic, and, accordingly, discredited this above everything
   else. In point of fact, boldness in submitting particulars to the
   treatment of the understanding was an outstanding feature in Abelard;
   the understanding, too, when once released, asserted its own rights,
   frequently overleapt the boundaries theoretically recognised, scorned
   authority, and proclaimed, with the support of a certain knowledge of
   ancient history, the eternal right of reasonable thought as the highest
   court of appeal. But that the most dangerous theses of the restless
   scholar sprang from Platonic (Augustinian) Realism, i.e., from the
   fundamental view that was adhered to by one's self, was not observed.
   In principle Abelard certainly moderated this view by means of his
   critico-dialectic reflections. He was no more a representative of
   thorough-going Realism. He was rather the first to introduce into
   epistemology a kind of conceptualism, [60] to break through the strict
   doctrine of immanence, and, by beginning to restore independence to the
   creature, to begin also to emancipate the conception of God itself from
   pantheism. For Abelard, the dialectic art ceases to be mere art; it
   begins to become a material principle, and to correct the traditional
   (Neoplatonic-Augustinian) doctrines of the first and last things. The
   paradox in Abelard's position consists in this, that on the one hand in
   contemplating history he drew certain conclusions from the Mystic
   doctrine of God (cf. Justin, Origen, but also Augustine himself) more
   confidently than his contemporaries, while, on the other hand, he
   allowed sober thought to have a material influence on the view taken of
   ground principles. His opponents saw in him only the negative
   theologian. This negative theologian really laid the foundation for the
   classical structure of mediæval conservative theology. [61] For the
   Church dogma could not be held by the thinking mind under the entire
   domination of the Mystic Neoplatonic theology. Although it was by this
   theology that it had been chiefly elaborated, yet the Church had always
   reserved to itself the supra-mundane God and the independence of the
   creature, and had formed a set of dogmas which Platonism could only
   sublimate, but could not justify as the final expression of the matter
   itself. The Church needed, therefore, the help of dialectics (of sober
   intelligence, and of juristic acuteness directed to the given formulæ )
   and of a lowering of the lofty flight of speculation, and this help
   Aristotelianism alone could afford it, i.e., the Aristotelianism, which
   was then understood as such, and which was then exercising its
   influence, as the view of things according to which it is held -- not
   that the phenomenal and creaturely are the form transitorily expressing
   the divine -- but that the supernatural God, as Creator in the proper
   sense of the word, has created the creature and endowed it with
   independence. It needed the help of Aristotelianism to defend a set of
   dogmas in the form in which they were already established. [62] But
   still more was the "Aristotelianism" to do for it. Reason will never
   ultimately make a compact with authority, but the understanding will.
   Whoever has entered into the spirit of the All-One and embraces the
   doctrine of immanence, will feel himself to be as "God," and will
   therefore reject all authority, of whatever kind it be. Whoever, on the
   other hand, feels his independence, side by side with other forms of
   independence, will become certain of his dependence also. He will no
   longer take part in the dialectic performance of exchanging his
   estimate of himself as the perfect nothing (as an individual) for an
   estimate of himself as the perfect being (as spirit); but while within
   certain limits, and perhaps with great tenacity, he will embrace a
   rational mode of view, he will, in that which lies beyond these limits,
   be ready to recognise authorities.

   Yet for the great inaugurator of Mediæval Scholasticism (for Anselm
   everything is still naive) -- for Abelard, the elements were still
   vaguely intermingled. He set down already as force all that, in the
   time following, the period when Scholasticism flourished, was conceived
   of as mutually limiting potencies, or that then became differentiated
   as distinct tendencies. His contemporaries had as yet no presentiment,
   that an element in him which they specially censured would yet become
   the means of saving the Church doctrine. Orthodoxy and the Platonic
   Realism were still in closest union. The French Mystics declared the
   efforts of the "dialecticians" heretical; Aristotle was hated. When the
   great disciple of Abelard, Petrus Lombardus, published his Sentences,
   and in them fittingly placed the learning of his master at the service
   of the Church theology -- as yet the Middle Ages had not possessed a
   compendium for the study of theology [63] -- much would not have been
   required for even this book to be set aside on suspicion. No doubt,
   this work, because, from the patristic tradition being uncertain, it
   still frequently adds opinion to opinion, bears the stamp of a freedom
   which was afterwards lost. But the mere fact that it became the
   authoritative compendium of the thirteenth century is a proof that on
   the part of the Church free inquiry, dialectic investigation, and
   Aristotelian philosophy were now tolerated, not because inward freedom
   had increased, but because the faculty had grown for making friends
   with these forces, and because there began to be observed what the
   Aristotelian method and mode of thought could do for dogma. In the
   second half of the twelfth century the turn round of things was already
   preparing itself. The "pious" theologians (the Mystics), so far as they
   gave themselves up to the work of expounding and establishing dogma,
   were forced to see that by means of thoroughgoing Realism contemplation
   might be enriched, but the objective doctrine could not be defended.
   The coalition of naive faith on authority with a Mysticism that, in its
   ultimate ground, was not without danger, came to an end. Church faith,
   Mysticism, and Aristotelian science formed a close alliance. On the
   other hand, the dialecticians, in the degree in which they passed from
   the Aristotelian formalism to Aristotle's doctrine of principles
   (perhaps the increasing knowledge of this philosophy contributed most
   to this), lost that audacity which had once given so much offence, and
   which, certainly, had often been only a sign of playing with empty
   forms. No doubt in connection with this many a fresh piece of knowledge
   came to be lost. [64] One who has much to carry gets more anxious, and
   moves more slowly, than one who marches under an easy burden. To this
   there came to be added, that from decade to decade the authority of the
   Church grew stronger. Though there was a growth also of opposition,
   which forced to anxious reflection (Mohammedans, Jews, heretics,
   knowledge of the ancient classics), [65] at the end of the twelfth
   century the Church outshone all else with its lustre. Its rights in
   respect of life and doctrine became the worthiest subject of
   investigation and exposition. Into this task blended the other, of
   referring all things to God and construing the knowledge of the world
   as theology. The theology of the ecclesiastical facts pressed itself on
   the theology of speculation. Under what other auspices could this great
   structure be erected than under those of that Aristotelian Realism,
   which was at bottom a dialectic between the Platonic Realism and
   Nominalism, and which was represented as capable of uniting immanence
   and transcendence, history and miracle, the immutability of God and
   mutability, Idealism and Realism, reason and authority? Thus it was
   only in the thirteenth century that there made its appearance the
   theology adequate to the Church and its dogma, and no longer viewed
   with suspicion, [66] after a new wave of piety (the Mendicant Orders)
   had imparted to it the highest measure of power of which the Catholic
   religion is at all capable. The fear of the Lord was also the beginning
   of this new wisdom. In form and contents, in its systematic method, and
   in the exhaustive fulness of its material, it is related to the
   theology of the twelfth century as, we might say, Origen was related to
   Clement of Alexandria. This is more than a comparison, for the course
   of events really repeated itself. Clement, the inaugurator, the bolder
   spirit, the less "enlightened," who does not yet know that the full
   authority of the Catholic Church is against him; Origen, the man of
   system, more comprehensive, but at the same time more closely tied to
   the Church and its doctrine. The same relation obtained between the
   theologians of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. (Compare, e.g.,
   the "aggregating" character of the Sentences of Robert Pulleyn
   [Deutsch, p. 6 f.] with the Stromateis of Clement, and the great "Sums"
   of the thirteenth century with Origen's De principiis.) In the
   following chapter we shall take up the thread here again. If we direct
   no further attention here to the Lombard, and especially to Hugo, the
   somewhat earlier, and, in respect of matter, the most influential
   theologian of the twelfth century ("a second Augustine"), the fact may
   serve as an excuse that the importance which the two obtained for the
   history of dogma appeared only at the great Lateran Council, and in the
   theologians of the thirteenth century. On Hugo's Sentences see Denifle
   in the Archiv f. L-u. K.-Gesch. des Mittelalters III., p. 634 ff.

   [41] The fundamental prejudice, which, however, Scholasticism shared
   with the theology of antiquity, and unfortunately also of modern times,
   was that theology is cognition of the world, or that it has to verify
   and complete cognition of the world. If it is said to-day that it has
   to supplement it, seeing that it steps in where knowledge fails,
   modesty has extorted the expression, but the same thing is still meant.

   [42] Yet even this does not apply to the whole of Scholasticism.
   Especially in its later period, it pointed also to the book of nature.

   [43] Kaufmann remarks correctly, p. 5: "There still attaches to the
   term Scholasticism something of the hatred and contempt which the
   Humanists poured upon it." This hostile spirit is, no doubt,
   intelligible, inasmuch as Scholasticism still threatens our present-day
   science. Yet in more recent years a complete change of judgment has
   appeared, which comes to the help of the Pope in his renewed
   recommendations of St. Thomas. Indeed, in the effort to be just, the
   once disparaged Scholasticism is beginning to be extravagantly
   belauded, as is shown by the pronouncement of a very celebrated jurist.
   With this praise the circumstance may also have some connection, that
   the Schoolmen are now being read again, and readers find to their
   surprise that they are not so irrational as had been believed. The
   strongest contribution to the glorification of Thomas has been
   furnished by Otto Willmann in the second volume of his "Gesch. des
   Idealismus" (1896). Here Idealism and Thomism (of the strictest type)
   are simply placed on a level. Nominalism is the corrupt tree, which can
   hear no good fruit, and is to be regarded, moreover, merely as an
   episode, as a nubicula; for since its rising, the sun of the Thomist
   Realism has been always in the heavens, and has given warmth to every
   century. The real enemy of Thomas and of Idealism is Kantianism, which
   has slowly prepared itself, that, on its assuming its perfect form, it
   may forthwith be assailed and overthrown by the true Idealism.
   Protestantism is viewed as the continuation of monistic Mysticism (!),
   because it (v. the strict determinism) does not take account of the
   causes secundh. So Thomism alone, sans phrase, is the saviour of the
   holy things of humanity! Augustinianism at the same time still finds
   recognition here, but yet it is still no completed system; it only
   represents the way to the right one.

   [44] We may say, indeed, with the poet about that age: "Everything now
   aims at fathoming man from within and from without; truth, where hast
   thou an escape from the wild chase?"

   [45] On Mysticism, see the works which Karl Müller has cited in his
   krit. Uebersicht (Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch. VII., p. 102 ff.). Above all
   the numerous works of Denifle and Preger (Gesch. der deutschen Mystik
   I., II.) have to be consulted; as also Greith, Die deutsche Mystik im
   Predigerorden, 1861. For the earlier Mysticism, cf. the monographs on
   Anselm, Bernard, and the Victorinians.

   [46] Piety is, above all, not the hidden temper of feeling and will,
   from which spring love to one's neighbour, humility and patience, but
   it is growing cognition, begotten of steadfast reflection on the
   relation of the soul to God.

   [47] How largely dependent on Scholasticism the later Mystic theology
   in particular was; or, more correctly, how identical the two were, has
   been shown especially by the works of Denifle (against Preger in the
   histor. polit. Blattern, 1875, p. 679 ff., and on Master Eckhart in the
   Archiv f. Litt.-u. K.-Gesch. des Mittelalters II. Bd.).

   [48] It is only a question of difference of degree; very correctly Karl
   Müller says (Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch. VII., p. 118): "The character of
   mediæval piety always expresses itself, more or less, even in the
   theoretic discussions of Scholasticism, because among the
   representatives of the latter the entire half of the way of salvation
   is dominated throughout by the interests and points of view of
   Mysticism, this circumstance having a connection with their monastic
   training and education. As soon as these men come to deal in their
   theoretical discussions with the appropriation of salvation, they bring
   along with them the presuppositions of their practical Mysticism."

   [49] Even in Nitzsch's determination of the relationship (l.c., pp. 651
   ff., 655) I cannot find a clearing up, while in Thomasius-Seeberg the
   distinct vision of the matter is completely obscured by a mass of
   details. Nitzsch first accentuates strongly the formalistic character
   of Scholasticism, then, with a view to understanding Mystic theology,
   points to its origin, the Pseudo-Dionysian doctrine, and now concludes:
   "It is obvious that this theology of the soul, of feeling, and of
   direct intuition is fundamentally distinct from the
   Scholastico-dialectic theology." But the assertion that the Scholastic
   theology is formalistic is scarcely cum grano salis correct, as will
   appear more clearly below. How can one call a mode of thought
   formalistic which takes the greatest interest in relating everything to
   a living unity? And if the means employed cannot secure the proposed
   end (as we think), have we therefore a right to reproach these scholars
   with a merely formalistic interest in things? But, further, the
   Pseudo-Dionysian theology is as much the presupposition of
   Scholasticism as of Mysticism, and that which Nitzsch calls "theology
   of the soul, of feeling, and of direct intuition" plays in both the
   same part, as alpha and omega, while the Mystic theology certainly
   keeps manifestly to its point of departure throughout the whole
   alphabet, the Scholastic, on the other hand, apparently forsakes it,
   but in the end (doctrine of the way of salvation) always returns to it,
   thereby showing that it has never really lost sight of it.

   [50] Scholasticism shares with Mysticism the "finis," and Mysticism
   uses essentially the same means as Scholasticism.

   [53] Berengar was a disciple of Fulbert of Chartres (ob. 1028); the
   latter had studied under Gerhert.

   [54] Till far on in the twelfth century the scholars were not first
   philosophers and then theologians; they possessed as yet no philosophic
   system at all; their philosophy rather was quite essentially dialectic
   art; see Deutsch, Abælard, p. 96: "The relation of philosophy to
   theology in the initial period of Scholasticism was essentially
   different from what it was at its maturity. In the earlier period a
   proper philosophic system, a view of the world developed on different
   sides, had as yet no existence. Only logic was known with some
   completeness . . .but, as a distinct discipline, metaphysic did not yet
   exist for the philosophers of that period. What they had of it
   consisted in single propositions, partly Platonic, partly
   Aristotelian. . . . Only when the Aristotelian writings became known in
   the second half of the twelfth century did the West learn to know a
   real philosophic system."

   [55] See Vol. V., p. 125 ff.

   [56] Hence even in the question about the universals, which was already
   dealt with at that time on the basis of passages from Porphyry and
   Boethius, the treatment was almost entirely realistic: general notions
   exist in and of themselves, or they exist in things as their real
   essence (though very different turns of thought were possible here in
   matters of detail; see Prantl, Gesch. der Logik, II., p. 118 ff.).
   Certainly there were already to be found also in this period
   representatives of Nominalism, according to which general notions are
   intellectus, or, say, only voces; indeed, it probably always existed
   side by side with Realism; but theology still treated it with
   indifference. When the Nominalist Roscellin, the teacher of Ahelard,
   applied the Nominalist view to the doctrine of the Trinity, he was
   resisted by Anselm (v. Deutsch, p. 100 f.). The latter had no doubt
   that those who held the universales substantiæ to be mere votes, must
   err from the Christian faith, and were heretics. But how did it stand
   with those who logically applied the substantiality of general notions?

   [57] The inquiry would be interesting and important that would lead us
   to determine whether, and through what channels, the older Pre-Jeromic
   Church literature influenced Scholasticism; e.g., are the agreements of
   Abelard with Justin and Origen accidental, or only indirect, or direct?
   That the Shepherd of Hermas and the Didache continued to have influence
   admits of proof. Contradictions within tradition, between the older and
   the later, and again between tradition (the sacred canons) and
   Scripture had already been discovered in the Gregorian period, and up
   to a certain point had been admitted (see Mirbt, Augustine, p. 3 f.);
   but Abelard was the first to emphasise the importance of these
   contradictions, while on the other hand, certainly, he began to have an
   inkling of what his contemporaries were far from thinking of, namely,
   that errors promote the progress of truth.

   [58] It surely does not require to be specially noted, that no teacher
   of importance in this period drew all the conclusions of Platonic
   Realism (as little as Augustine did). They lay only on the horizon of
   their view, and were touched on in passages here and there. Till
   Abelard taught him better, William of Champeaux, it is true, seems to
   have asserted the full immanence of the generic notion, conceived of
   substantially, in every individual, a view which must necessarily have
   led to the doctrine of the one latent substance, and of the negating of
   all that is individual as mere semblance or mere contingency. This
   doctrine certainly lay on the outskirts of the view then taken of the
   world, and made its appearance in Mysticism as the expression of pious
   contemplation, afterwards even as a theoretic conviction. On Abelard's
   having the credit of discarding it see below.

   [59] See the excellent monograph of Deutsch upon him (1883), the best
   book we possess on the history of the theological science of that
   period, distinguished pre-eminently by calmness and caution of
   judgment, as compared with the overstrained biographies to the right
   and left. In the introduction, p. 11 f., it is denied on good grounds
   that there was a widely prevailing negative illuminism in this period.
   What widely prevailed was not negative but ecclesiastical, and what was
   negative (frivolity of course there has been in every age; "the
   frivolity and avarice of the jeunesse dorée that vaunted itself in the
   apostolic chair up to the middle of the eleventh century": Sackur) or
   expressly heretical had no widespread influence (to what extent at the
   time of the establishment of Clugny practical and theoretical atheism,
   frivolous criticism of the Bible, etc., prevailed among the
   West-Frankian lay circles is shown by Sackur). That to Abelard there
   belongs a unique position in his time, Deutsch has grounds for
   asserting, but he is far from characterising him simply as an
   illuminist. If it were necessary to describe him as such, then it would
   be peculiar to Catholic religion to be purely acquiescent faith -- but
   at that time at least it certainly had not yet made that claim; then
   Justin, Origen, and Augustine would be "creedless free-thinkers"; then
   Abelard himself would be a double-tongued hypocrite, for his wish was
   to be a Church theologian, believing in revelation, and yet at the same
   time one who could give account of his faith and was capable of showing
   it to be plain truth. That while this was his aim he became entangled
   in contradictions, that in undertaking to commend religion to the
   understanding he frequently had more regard to the judge than to the
   client, was certainly not peculiar to him as a theologian! For
   ascertaining the theology of Abelard the sentences of his disciple,
   Magister Roland Alexander III. (see the edition by Gietl, 1891, and
   Denifle in Archiv, Vol. I., pp. 434 ff. 603 ff.) may be consulted.

   [60] How his theory of knowledge is to be understood is a disputed
   point among scholars (v. Deutsch, p. 104 ff.). It is certain that he
   held a sceptical attitude towards Platonic Realism, that he rejected it
   indeed, without however passing over to Nominalism.

   [61] This seems paradoxical, and certainly other things come more
   prominently to view in Abelard at first: his genuine, unquenchable
   scientific ardour, his sense for the natural (sound human
   understanding), his ambitious striving, not devoid of vanity, his
   dialectic acuteness, his critical spirit, finally, the conviction
   animating him that the ratio has its own field of play, and that there
   are many questions on which it first, and it alone, must be heard (on
   his learning, which has often been over-rated, see Deutsch, p. 53 ff.).
   But on the other hand the following factors in his mode of teaching are
   to be noted, which obtained quite a positive importance for the time
   that followed (while we pass over what is an understood matter, viz.,
   that even by him all knowledge was ultimately traced up to the
   revelation of God): (1) The man charged with "rationalism" has no great
   confidence in the capabilities of the human power of knowledge, and
   openly expressed this, in opposition to the self-assurance of the
   dialecticians and mystics; he did not possess it, but pointed to
   revelation, because he (2) did not regard thought and being as
   identical, but took up a critico-sceptical attitude towards the
   reigning Realism, such as was just required for the defence of the
   Church doctrine -- as was taught by the time that followed. With this
   there is connected (3) that, while keeping very much on Augustine's
   lines in the conception of God, he avoided those conclusions from his
   conception which led at one time to the assumption of a rigid,
   unchangeable divine working (a rigid order of nature), at another time
   to an unlimited arbitrariness on God's part. This he effected by
   bringing in again (with Origen, partly against Augustine) very strongly
   though not at every point, the thought of the ethically determined
   character of the divine action, and of the limitation of the divine
   power by the notion of purpose (and so by what actually happens). With
   this he also drew a sharp distinction between God and the creature, and
   asserted the independence of the latter, corrected thereby the
   questionable Mystic conception of God, and prepared the way for the
   conception of God held by the great Schoolmen. His opponents, on the
   other hand, such as Hugo (and afterwards also the Lombard) adhered to
   that conception of God which afterwards proved more convenient in
   defending any kind of Church doctrine; but there is no question that
   Abelard was really the more positive. If he has nevertheless been
   classed with Spinoza, that only proves that there has been ignorance of
   the notion of God which elsewhere prevailed in his time among Church
   theologians, and that just that side in Abelard's notion of God has
   been emphasised which was not peculiar to him, for he sought to unite
   the standpoints of immanence and transcendence, while his opponents
   assailed him from the standpoint of the "Spinozist" notion of God. (4)
   As with the doctrine of God so is it with all the other doctrines of
   the faith: here Abelard always set out from Augustine (see Deutsch's
   account), keeps essentially to his formulations, but, with more courage
   and confidence than the great master, fettered by his Neoplatonism,
   strives to free theology and the objects of faith from the embraces of
   a Mysticism which is ultimately philosophy of nature. The ethical
   interest, the assurance that what answers to the moral law is also the
   holy and good before and for God, dominates Abelard (hence also his
   special interest in moral philosophy), and so far as this interest
   corrected the Mystical scheme of Christian doctrine in the thirteenth
   century, Abelard must be thought of as the pioneer. But if in this
   sense it may be said that Abelard laid the foundation for the great
   structures of Scholasticism in the thirteenth century -- not only
   because he was the teacher of the Lombard, nor only because he was the
   acutest thinker of the period, but because he was the first to attempt
   that amalgamation of the immanence and transcendence doctrines, and
   taught that lower estimation of the principles of knowledge, which
   became the presuppositions of ecclesiastical systems -- yet it cannot
   be denied that the following age did not attach itself directly to him.
   What he found independently the following age learned from Aristotle,
   who became more and more known to it from the second half of the
   twelfth century; it learned it only indirectly, or not at all, from
   Abelard. But that cannot diminish his fame. He was the first to show
   how all Church doctrines can and must be so treated that the principles
   of morality (the moral law) shall have as much justice done to them in
   the system as the fundamental thoughts of theological speculation on
   nature. That he did not solve this problem no one will make the ground
   of a reproach, for it is insoluble. But that it must be set down as the
   task of all ecclesiastical science -- so long as this science at all
   declares that its ideal is that of knowing the world -- is quite
   obvious. The contemporaries of Abelard were not willing to learn enough
   from him, and that, as a rule, determines the amount of influence that
   belongs to a teacher. They felt repelled (1) by the still novel form of
   the science in general; (2) by many propositions of Abelard, which were
   afterwards found to be tolerable -- indeed to be the only correct ones;
   (3) by many individual negative, or critical judgments, both in regard
   to history and the validity of opinion prevailing at the time, and in
   regard to particular ecclesiastical doctrines, of which his defensive
   presentation was felt to be questionable (Sabellianism in the doctrine
   of the Trinity, yet see Augustine; strong inner variance in the
   Christology, which thus approached Nestorianism, yet see likewise
   Augustine). (4) It must not be denied that Abelard himself injured the
   influence of his doctrines by many contradictions and by the immaturity
   of his systematising. But how much could have been learned from him;
   compare only his admirable discussions of love, reconciliation, and the
   Church! The Church had no genius between Augustine and Luther; but
   among the men of second rank, Abelard deserves to be named. Karl Müller
   (Abhandl. f. Weizsäcker 1892, pp. 308 f., 319 f.) has strongly
   emphasised the importance of Abelard for the ways of stating problems
   and for the positive views of the following period.

   [62] Very correctly v. Eicken l.c. p. 602: "The importance which Plato
   and Aristotle acquired in mediæval philosophy was really in the inverse
   relation to the position which the two had taken up in the history of
   the development of Greek philosophy. The Platonic philosophy had placed
   the substance of things in the general ideas, and had deduced from this
   assumption the transcendence of the latter, and especially of the
   highest idea, that is, the idea of God. But the extreme Realism of the
   Middle Ages adopted the Platonic doctrine of ideas, not to derive from
   it the transcendence of the supreme idea, but to derive rather the
   harmonious co-existence of all things in the supreme idea, and just
   with this aim before it it arrived at that doctrine of God which bore a
   pantheistic character, as compared with the strict transcendence of the
   Church doctrine. On the other hand the Aristotelian philosophy had
   asserted the reality of the general ideas in the individuals, with the
   view of refuting Plato's transcendent doctrine of ideas. The
   Aristotelian Realism, however, attached itself to the Aristotelian
   doctrine, in order that, by guarding the substantial character of the
   individuals, it might prove their extra-divine subsistence, and
   accordingly also the divine transcendence that harmonised with the
   Church doctrine. This view, which quite inverted the historical and
   logical relation of the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies, was
   maintained till the close of the Middle Ages."

   [63] Only since Abelard's times were there somewhat more comprehensive
   statements of Christian doctrine, which, besides, were still in many
   respects different. He himself and Hugo of St. Victor took the lead in
   producing them; see Abelard's "Introductio"; faith, love, the
   sacraments as subjects of dogmatic.

   [64] In the writings of the earlier Schoolmen, i.e., of Abelard
   chiefly, there are not a few thoughts that were directly fitted either
   to enrich or to modify dogma. But at that time the Church accepted
   nothing from the Schoolmen, and when it was prepared to have the
   doctrine interpreted to it by them, these men had no longer the freedom
   and boldness to say anything new to the Church.

   [65] What importance for Abelard the discussion with the Jew and the
   philosopher had may be learned from the "Dialogue" (v. Deutsch, p. 433
   ff., against Reuter I., pp. 198-221.)

   [66] The diminishing distrust of theology in contra-distinction to the
   former period is also to be explained from the circumstance that the
   general average of culture among the higher clergy became higher. The
   theologians of the thirteenth century were no longer confronted with so
   much unreason as the "dialecticians" of the eleventh century had to
   contend with in the wide development of the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   4. Elaboration of Dogma.

   The theological conflicts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, as
   they were fought out between the dialecticians and their opponents, do
   not belong to the history of dogma. This science has to confine itself
   to showing what position dogma asserted in connection with the revival
   and the crises of theology, what enrichments it received, and how far
   the Scholastic activity (or the theological systematising) already
   influenced it. As to the first of these questions, the statement may be
   quite brief: dogma, as it was fixed by the Councils, as it had been
   described by Augustine and Gregory I., [67] was the presupposition of
   all theological thought, and was held inviolate. Isolated exceptions
   were without any importance. The dialectic experiments on dogma were
   always based on the traditional view of it. As regards the third
   question, an influence on dogma of Scholastic activity and systematic
   theology can already be pointed to in the twelfth century; but the
   influence was still so much in its beginnings that it is better to
   treat it first in connection with the thirteenth century. [68] And so
   there remains only the question as to the "enrichments." Strictly
   speaking, this question also would have to be answered in the negative,
   [69] were it not that in the Berengarian controversy a movement
   presents itself, in which a dogma that had still always been the
   subject of dispute, attained a relatively complete form, and had not
   Anselm set up a doctrine of satisfaction, which, indeed, was a product
   of purely private work, and found few adherents, too, in the period
   that followed, but which brought before the Church a dogmatic problem
   that was hitherto unsolved, nay, had scarcely ever been touched as yet,
   but which was not again to pass out of view. In what follows,
   therefore, we have to treat of these two movements.

   A. The Berengarian Controversy.

   Besides its dogmatic, this controversy [70] has a philosophic [71]
   interest, and an interest also in connection with Church politics. [72]
   The last of these interests may be left quite out of view here; the
   second is closely connected with the first. From the place which the
   dogma of the Eucharist held in the theory and practice of the Church,
   the criticism of it was a criticism of the reigning Church doctrine as
   a whole. When the youthful science, represented and led by Berengar of
   Tours, began at this point, charged the accepted view with error, and
   applied the scientific doctrine of method to the dogma of the
   Eucharist, expression was given to the thought, that there may not be a
   resting satisfied with mere Church tradition, with what is held as
   valid to-day. But this thought was not expressed in the name of a
   negative "illuminism," [73] but, on the contrary rather, that the true
   tradition of the Church might be delivered from the embraces of a bad
   routine, that the spirit of the doctrine might be protected against a
   coarse and superstitious realism, that the logike latreia (reasonable
   service) might be maintained against a barbarian craving for mysteries,
   and that the mystery of faith might not be profaned. But combined with
   this interest, which was by no means merely pretended, there was the
   pleasure in thinking, and the daring reliance on dialectics as on
   "reason" in general. As theologians, Berengar and his followers were
   Augustinians, but, at the same time, Berengar had an enjoyment in
   criticism as such, and a confidence in "science," that were not
   Augustinian.

   Berengar, Director of the Cathedral School in Tours, from about 1040
   Archdeacon in Angers (ob. 1088), had instituted studies on the doctrine
   of the Eucharist, searched through the Church Fathers, occupied himself
   with the first Eucharist controversy, and rejected [74] the doctrine of
   Paschasius, long before a controversy developed itself. In the doctrine
   as it prevailed at the time he saw apostacy from the Church Fathers and
   unreason; for he saw in it only the view, that after the consecration
   bread and wine have disappeared, and in place of them there exist the
   real flesh and blood of Christ in so sensibly palpable a form that they
   are present as pieces (portions) of His bloody body. He was right; so
   the widely prevailing superstition taught; [75] yet Paschasius had
   certainly taken also a more spiritual view of the change, and among the
   authoritative churchmen of that period such a "conversion" was not
   taught by all the more prominent. [76] By means of a letter to
   Lanfranc, Berengar himself opened the controversy. [77] We have his
   doctrine fully stated for us for the first time in his work de sacra
   coena. adv. Lanfrancum (ab. 1073; anything earlier is almost entirely
   lost). His leading idea was to introduce reason into the Church
   doctrine, or, more correctly, to bring to light by means of reason the
   reason that lies in the divine doctrines of the Church. Dialectics, the
   science which had always differentiated, is nowhere more in its proper
   place than where there is a question about two objects, which, in one
   respect, are one, and in another respect are different. Thus the
   two-nature doctrine is very peculiarly its province; and so also is the
   doctrine of the Eucharist, with its earthly elements and its heavenly
   gift. [78] Berengar showed that the doctrine of the bodily
   transmutation was absurd ("ineptia"), and went directly in the face of
   the old traditions, as well as of reason, which we must make use of as
   reasonable beings created in the image of God. [79] He accordingly
   adopted the standpoint of Scotus (Ratramnus), as he understood it. He
   taught that the words are to be understood tropically; but he held this
   interpretation with much greater firmness than his predecessor, and
   gave it an exclusiveness of which his predecessor had not thought;
   Christ is spoken of under many symbols, hence the bread is also a
   symbol; [80] Scripture teaches that, till His return, Christ remains in
   heaven; [81] a piece of bread is not capable of taking into itself the
   body born of the Virgin, and yet it is a question about the whole
   Christ; [82] a destruction of the subject (the elements) involves the
   destruction of all essential attributes of the elements, for concretely
   (in concreto) these cannot be distinguished from the subject itself
   (Nominalist tendency). [83] Yet the tropical view, as he did not stand
   by it, was not equivalent for Berengar to the symbolical. This latter
   view rather he explicitly rejected, in so far as he followed the old
   tradition, and recognised two things in the Eucharist, sign and
   sacrament. The elements become sacrament through consecration, and this
   implies that they now include something objectively holy. A "conversio"
   takes place; but for Berengar this expression has certainly an unusual
   sense. [84] It is meant to suggest that the elements remain what they
   are, but at the same time become the body of Christ. They become in a
   certain respect something different, i.e., there is now added to the
   visible a second element, which is real, but invisible. The consecrated
   elements remain in one respect what they are, but in another respect
   they become the sacraments, i.e., as the visible, temporal, and mutable
   subjects, they become the guarantees (pignora, figuræ, signa) of the
   reception of the whole heavenly Christ by the believer. While the mouth
   therefore receives the "sacrament," the truly genuine Christian
   receives by discernment ("in cognitione"), and into his heart that
   which the sacramental elements represent, namely, Christ as food, the
   power of the heavenly Christ. Hence the enjoyment and the effect of the
   Eucharist are spiritual: the inner man (so it depends on faith, in
   addition to the consecration) receives the true body of Christ, and
   appropriates the death of the crucified Christ through believing
   remembrance). [85]

   Augustine would have had nothing to object to this doctrine of the
   Eucharist, even though some dialectic arguments and devices in it had
   surprised him. But the men of the period were shocked, both at the
   result, and partly also at the course of thought that led to this
   result. At Rome and Vercelli (1050), in Berengar's absence, the
   doctrine was condemned, on the ground of the letter to Lanfranc. Nine
   years later, after it had become artificially mixed up in France with
   ecclesiastico-political questions, but had thereby become for the time
   more tolerable for Rome, and after its author had suffered much from
   slander and imprisonment, Berengar was compelled to subscribe at Rome,
   under Nicolas II., a formula of faith, which made it clear that his
   worst fears with regard to the tyranny of superstition in the Church
   were not exaggerated. [86] Having returned to France, he kept in
   retirement at first; but subsequently he could have no rest. He came to
   the front again with his doctrine, for which he had influential
   supporters in Rome itself, and a new, heated literary controversy was
   the result. During its course the most important writings on both sides
   were produced. Gregory VII. treated the controversy in a dilatory way,
   and with much indulgence towards Berengar, who was personally known to
   him: in all ages Rome has been clever enough not to be hasty in making
   heretics, and a Pope who, in ruling the world, must so often wink at
   things, knows also how to exercise patience and forbearance, especially
   when personal sympathy is not wanting. [87] But in the end Gregory was
   compelled, in order not to shake his own authority, to force Berengar,
   at the Synod of 1079, to recognise the transmutation doctrine. [88] For
   a second time Berengar outwardly submitted; the Pope was satisfied with
   the form; but with this the cause which the broken scholar represented
   became lost.

   The transmutation theory of Paschasius -- the term transubstantiation
   was apparently first used casually by Hildebert of Tours (beginning of
   twelfth century) in his 93rd Sermon (Migne CLXXI., p. 776), and
   therefore already existed [89] -- was further developed by the
   opponents of Berengar. [90] First, the mystery was conceived of still
   more sensuously, at least by some (manducatio infidelium); [91]
   secondly, there was a beginning, though with caution, to apply to dogma
   the "science" that was discredited in the opponent. The crude
   conceptions (which embraced the total conversion) were put aside, and
   an attempt was made to unite the older deliverances of tradition with
   the new transmutation doctrine, as also to adapt the Augustinian
   terminology, by means of dialectic distinctions, to the still coarsely
   realistic view of the object. [92] The struggle of Berengar, therefore,
   did not continue altogether without fruit; but the fruit consisted
   essentially in this, that science was left quite free, because it was
   gradually seen that in face of the gravity of the problems the
   simplicity of faith was powerless. At the Fourth Lateran Council (1215)
   the mediæval doctrine of the Supper was solemnly framed as dogma in the
   famous confession of faith, which, previous to the Tridentine
   confession, was the most influential symbol (after the
   Niceno-Constantinopolitan; see Mansi XXII., p. 982; Hefele V.^2, p. 878
   ff.; and the Corpus juris canonici, where the topic finds a place under
   X. I: de summa trinitate [I. 1]). What is important here is (1) that
   the doctrine of the Eucharist is immediately attached to the confession
   of the Trinity and Incarnation. In this way it is represented even in
   the symbol as having a most intimate relation to these doctrines, as,
   indeed, forming with them a unity; i.e., the state of things was now
   created that was disastrous even for the history of the Reformation:
   the real presence obtained the same value as the Trinity and the
   two-nature doctrine, so that every one was regarded as an
   ecclesiastical anarchist who called it in question. This valuation
   certainly corresponds with the development of the doctrine of the
   Eucharist, inasmuch as the Eucharist appears as the continuously
   present, earthly incorporation of the mysteries of the Trinity and
   Incarnation, but it robs the Gospel of its spiritual character. (2)
   Transubstantiation was now expressly taught; the words run: "moreover
   there is one universal Church of the faithful, outside of which no one
   whatever can be saved, in which Jesus Christ is at once priest and
   sacrifice, whose body and blood are truly (veraciter) contained in the
   sacrifice of the altar under the appearances of bread and wine, the
   bread being transubstantiated into the body, and the wine into the
   blood by divine power, so that for the effecting of the mystery of
   unity (ad perficiendum mysterium unitatis) we receive of His what He
   received of ours (here the conjunction with the Christology is
   manifest). And this sacrament especially (hoc utique sacramentum) no
   one can administer but the priest who has been duly ordained according
   to the Church authority (secundum claves ecclesiæ) which Jesus Christ
   Himself gave to the Apostles and their successors." The symbol then
   immediately continues: "But the sacrament of baptism, which is
   consecrated in water on invoking the undivided Trinity, avails for
   salvation both to infants and adults, by whomsoever it is duly
   administered in the forms of the Church (in forma ecclesiæ). And if
   after receiving baptism any one shall have fallen into sin, he can
   always be restored (reparari) through true penitence." Thus this line
   of development also is completed, and at the same time the related one
   (see Vol. V., p. 325), according to which every Christian must make
   confession of his sins before the parish priest (parochus). It is laid
   down in the twenty-first chapter: "Every believer, of either sex, after
   arriving at the years of discretion, must by himself (solus) faithfully
   confess all his sins, at least once a year, to his own priest, and must
   study to carry out to the best of his ability the repentance enjoined
   upon him, receiving reverently, at least at Easter, the sacrament of
   the Eucharist." The novelty in the symbol -- the direct attachment of
   the Eucharist dogma to the Trinity and Christology -- is the most
   distinctive and boldest act of the Middle Ages. Compared with this
   immense innovation, the addition of the "filioque" weighs very lightly.
   But on the other hand, the symbol certainly shows also very plainly how
   the old dogmatic tradition still dominated everything, for it contains
   nothing of the specific Augustinian-Western propositions about sin,
   original sin, grace, and justification. "Dogma," in the strict sense of
   the word, consists of the Trinity, Christology, the doctrine of the
   Eucharist, the doctrine of Baptism, and of the Sacrament of Penance.
   All else is at the most dogma of the second order. This state of things
   also was of the greatest weight for the history of the Reformation; the
   doctrines of the Trinity, of Christ and of the Sacraments (i.e., the
   doctrine of the three Sacraments, Baptism, Penance, Eucharist)
   constitute Catholic Christianity -- nothing else.

   B. Anselm's Doctrine of Satisfaction, and the Doctrines of Atonement of
   the Theologians of the Twelfth Century. [93]

   Ever since the days when an attempt was made to punish, without
   decimating the Church, the great apostasy occasioned by the Decian
   persecution, the positions were held as valid, that God's mercy is
   unlimited, even as regards the baptised, but that only a satisfactio,
   consisting of legitimate penance (poenitentia legitima), can move the
   offended God to regard the sinner again with favour. Since that time
   these ideas had obtained the widest circulation, [94] united themselves
   at a later period with Germanic ideas, and dominated the whole
   penitential system of the Church. [95] Connected with this system stood
   the conception of "merits," i.e., of such supererogatory acts as
   establish a claim to reward, when no guilt exists to be expiated.
   Through this idea a calculation of the value of particular deeds was
   introduced, and of these calculations the whole ethical system was
   full. Whether an act was obligatory, or abundans, or superabundans,
   whether, under given circumstances, it was compensatory (satisfactory),
   or meritorious, had to be established in each particular case, so that
   each one might know how his account stood with heaven. The Augustinian
   conception of prevenient grace freely bestowed (gratia gratis data
   præveniens), which had been generally accepted, wrought no change on
   this view, but only made it more complicated.

   Yet neither by Gregory the Great, nor by any theologian of the
   Carlovingian period, was this view applied to the work of Christ.
   Frequent reference, it is true, was already made to the "copiousness of
   the value of the mystery of the passion" (pretü copiositas mysterii
   passionis; see the fourth chapter of the Synod of Chiersey); but a
   theory had not been framed, because there was no reflection at all on
   the nature, the specific worth, and the effect of the redemption
   contained in the suffering and death of Christ. The Fathers, Augustine
   included, had handed down nothing certain on this. The only view taken
   by the Greeks was that the reign of death was broken by the cross and
   resurrection of Christ, or that mankind were thereby bought off, or
   cunningly wrested, from the devil. All that they said of the sacrifice
   in the suffering was quite vague. Only Athanasius spoke with noteworthy
   clearness of the penal suffering which Christ took from us and laid
   upon Himself. But, from the days of Paul, all of them testified that
   Christ died for us, and delivered us from the power of the devil. That
   was felt and proclaimed as the great act of redemption. Ambrose and
   Augustine had then emphasised the position that Christ is Mediator as
   man, and had given many instructions about particular points; but the
   question why that Man, who was at the same time God, was obliged to
   suffer and die, was dealt with by pointing to His example, or by
   reciting biblical texts about ransom, sacrifice, and such like, without
   the necessity of the death here coming clearly to view. [96] But
   Augustine certainly had laid the foundation for a new and vigorous
   apprehension of the significance of Christ's work, by emphasising so
   strongly the gravity of sin, and by representing the relation between
   God and man under the scheme of sin and grace.

   At this point Anselm came in. The importance of his doctrine of
   satisfaction, as developed in Book H. of his "Cur deus homo," [97]
   composed as a dialogue, lies in this, that he made use of all the
   factors of the Augustinian theology, so far as they came into
   consideration here, but that at the same time he was the first of all
   to frame a theory, both of the necessity of the appearing of the
   God-man, and of the necessity of His death. This he did by making the
   principles of the practice of penance the fundamental scheme of
   religion in general. [98] The "necessity" was understood by Anselm in
   the sense of the strictest reasonableness, i.e., his aim is to show
   that even if we knew nothing of Christ, and such an One had never
   existed, reason would have to confess that men can only be saved if a
   God-man appears and dies for them. [100] Jews and pagans must be
   constrained to acknowledge this necessity. They, and unbelieving
   Christians, must see that it is unreason to assert that God could also
   have redeemed us by another person (whether man or angel), or that He
   could have redeemed us by a mere determination of His will; [101] they
   must perceive that the mercy of God does not suffer wrong through the
   death on the cross, and that it is not unworthy of God that Christ
   should have stooped to abasement and taken upon Himself the uttermost
   suffering. No doubt it holds good that we first believe and then see.
   [102] But though the attempt may fail -- faith, of course, would remain
   unshaken -- we must advance to the knowledge of what we believe, and in
   this case a perfect reasonable knowledge is possible.

   At the outset Anselm rejects three ideas, one as insufficient, the
   others as erroneous. It is not sufficient to justify redemption through
   the death on the cross by emphasising the "conveniens," i.e., the
   correspondence of the person and work of Christ with the person and
   fall of Adam; that is an asthetic view, which is correct, but which
   proves nothing until the "necessarium" is established. [103] It is
   erroneous to think that a man could have redeemed us; for we should
   then become the servants of him who should have delivered us from
   eternal death. But in that way our original dignity would not be
   restored, in virtue of which we were like the angels and servants of
   God alone. [104] It is erroneous, finally, to think that by redemption
   legal claims of the devil upon us had to be wiped out; for although by
   reason of our sins we have justly come under the devil's power, yet the
   devil does not rule justly, but rather unjustly. He has obtained no
   claim upon us, and over against God he has absolutely no right. [105]
   Before Anselm begins his process of proof, he further endeavours -- the
   arrangement is extremely unskilful -- to refute the objection that the
   suffering and death of a God-man, just because he is man, are without
   effect, because every man is bound to be obedient unto death. He
   rejects this view, which is only apparently supported by passages of
   Scripture that teach that the death of Christ was obligatory, because
   it was fulfilment of the divine will; a sinless man, rather -- and the
   God-man was such -- was only under obligation to observe justitia and
   veritas (righteousness and truth), but not to die, for death follows
   only upon sin. [106] Having now cleared the path for himself, he goes
   on to put the question thus: Assuming that we knew nothing whatever of
   the God?man man and His action, what must take place, if men, who are
   created for blessedness in the world beyond, but who can attain to this
   blessedness only as sinless, have all become sinners? The most natural
   answer is (for it has already been said in I. 4, that it would not
   become God not to carry out His plan): sins must be forgiven. But how
   must that be done? What is foriveness of sin? What range has it? In
   order to answer this question, we must first ask, What is sin? With
   this the development begins. [107]

   Every rational creature owes to God entire subjection to His will. That
   is the only honour which God demands. He who pays it is righteous; he
   who pays it not, sins; sin, indeed, is nothing else than the
   dishonouring of God by withholding from Him His own. [108] This robbery
   God cannot tolerate; He must defend His honour. He must therefore
   demand that man restore it to Him, and, indeed, "for the insult
   inflicted, that he restore more than he took away"; otherwise he
   continues "in culpa" (under guilt). [109] Every sinner, therefore, must
   furnish a satisfaction. [110] God cannot dispense with this; for that
   would be equivalent to the impunity of sin, and would violate the
   divine honour. But the impunity of sin would be equivalent to God's
   ceasing to be the controller of sin (ordinator peccatorum); He would
   let something disorderly pass in His kingdom ("aliquid inordinatum in
   suo regno dimittere.") Right and wrong also would then become the same;
   the latter, indeed, would have the advantage, because, as unrepented of
   and unpunished, it would be subject to no law. No doubt we men are
   enjoined simply to forgive those who sin against us. But that is said
   to us, that we may not encroach upon the prerogative of God: "for it
   belongs to no one but Him to take vengeance." Nor may we appeal against
   this to the omnipotence and goodness of God, and say that all that God
   does is good, even when He simply forgives sin therefore; for God's
   power and goodness are determined by His will ("it is not to be so
   understood that if God wills something improper [inconveniens], it is
   right because He wills it; for it does not follow that if God wills to
   lie, it is right to lie"); hence, as God wills to do nothing wrong or
   disorderly (inordinate), the absolving without penalty of a sinner who
   does not restore to Him what he has robbed Him of, is not within the
   scope of the freedom or the goodness or the will of God. [111] The
   supreme righteousness, therefore, which is nothing else than God
   Himself, requires restitution or -- this turn of thought appears first
   here -- penalty. [112] Even the latter, that is to say, as deprivation
   of salvation (damnation), restores the divine honour, in as much as by
   it "man unwillingly pays back of his own what he took away .. . as man
   by sinning seized what is God's, so God by punishing takes away what is
   man's." [113] Even by penalty the beauty and order of the universe are
   maintained, which must never be shaken (of the honour of God in itself
   it holds good that it cannot be shaken; "for to Himself He is the
   incorruptible and in no way mutable honour. . . . No one can honour or
   dishonour God so far as He is in Himself.") [114] But it is "extremely
   alien to God "that He should abandon His costliest work, the rational
   creature (creatura rationabilis), to complete ruin. [115] But as, on
   the other hand, He cannot associate sinful men with the holy angels,
   satisfaction must come in ("hold this most firmly, because without
   satisfaction, i.e., without spontaneous payment of the debt, God cannot
   allow sin to pass with impunity"). [116] The objection that we are
   directed to pray to God for forgiveness, which would surely be
   unmeaning if only satisfaction were of any avail, is met by saying that
   the prayer for forgiveness is itself a part of the satisfaction. [117]
   Now the satisfaction is subject to the twofold rule, that it must be,
   first, restitution, and secondly, smart-money (Schmerzensgeld). [118]
   But what can man give to God which he was not already required to give
   Him in any case, since entire surrender is included in obligatory
   obedience? "If I owe Him myself and all I can do -- even when I sin
   not, that I do not sin (so there is no thought here of supererogatory
   deeds), I have nothing that I can render back (reddam) for my sin." The
   objection: "if I consider reasons (rationes), I do not see how I can be
   saved, but if I fall back upon my faith, then in Christian faith which
   worketh by love [hope that my salvation is possible," is repelled; for
   here it is just a question of reason. [119] Man can therefore do
   nothing. And how much he would have to do! "Thou hast not yet
   considered of what gravity thy sin is." Even the smallest disobedience
   entails an infinite guilt (even to gain the whole world one may not
   commit the smallest sin) for the guilt is to be measured by the God who
   is despised. [120] Man has therefore to furnish an infinitely great
   satisfaction, since it is already an established rule, that God's
   honour does not permit of man's receiving salvation, "if he does not
   restore to God all he has taken from Rim, so that as God has lost by
   him, He may also recover by him." [121] The incapacity of human nature
   to furnish satisfaction can make no change on this law, which follows
   from the honour of God [122] So therefore there remains only one
   solution, if the "convenientia" (the befitting) requires redemption
   [123] -- namely, the God-man. There must be someone "who shall pay to
   God for the sin of man something greater than all that is, apart from
   God . . .it is necessary, therefore, that he who shall be able to give
   of his own to God something that shall surpass all that is under God,
   shall be greater than all that is not God . . .but there is nothing
   above all that is not God, save God. . .No one, therefore, is able to
   make this satisfaction save God." Again, "nor must that satisfaction be
   made by anyone save man, otherwise man does not satisfy." Conclusion:
   "If, therefore, as is certain (sicut constat), it is necessary that
   that heavenly State be made perfect from men, and this cannot be unless
   there is made the aforesaid satisfaction, which no one can make save
   God, and no one owes save man, it is necessary that the God-man shall
   make it." [124]

   This God-man must possess the two natures unchanged (otherwise he would
   be either only God or only man), unmingled, too (otherwise he would be
   neither God nor man), but also unseparated (otherwise no work having
   unity is effected); therefore he must possess them "entire in one
   person" (integras in una persona). [125] The God must have derived the
   human nature from Adam and Eve, but from a virgin, [126] and he must as
   man have surrendered this nature to death voluntarily. His dying was
   really free, for he was sinless. [127] If the supposed God-man now
   surrenders his life voluntarily to God, the satisfaction sought for is
   obtained. It must be his life; for only this he is not under obligation
   to offer to God; all that he could give of his own, it behoved him in
   some way or other to offer to God. "Let us see if, perhaps, this giving
   of his life, or parting with his soul, or surrender of himself to
   death, is for the honour of God. For God will not require it from him
   as a debt, because, as there shall be no sin in him, he shall not owe
   it to die . . .if man has had a sweet experience in sinning, is it not
   fitting that he should have a hard experience in satisfying? And if he
   has been so easily prevailed upon by the devil to dishonour God by
   sinning that nothing could be easier, is it not just that, in
   satisfying for sin, he should overcome the devil to the honour of God
   with a measure of difficulty that could not be exceeded? Is it not
   becoming (dignum) that as he who by sinning so denied himself to God
   that he could not deny himself in a greater degree, should by
   satisfying so give himself to God that he could not give himself in a
   greater degree? . . .But there is nothing harder or more difficult that
   a man can suffer for the honour of God spontaneously and not of debt
   than death, and in no way can man give himself more fully to God than
   when he surrenders himself to death for His honour." Hence the man
   sought for must be one who does not die "of necessity," because he is
   almighty, nor "of debt," because he is sinless, who therefore can die
   "of free choice because it will be necessary" (ex libera voluntate quia
   necessarium erit.) [128] The worth of such a life as a satisfaction is
   infinite. Because the smallest violation of this life has an infinitely
   negative worth, the voluntary surrender of it has an infinitely
   positive worth. Because sins are as hate-worthy as they are bad, so
   that life also is as love-worthy as it is good. Hence the acceptance of
   the death (acceptio mortis) of such a God-man is an infinite good for
   God (!), which far surpasses the loss by sin. [129] But the giving of
   life (datio vitæ) can only have taken place "to the honour of God;" for
   another spirit and purpose cannot be discovered. To this there is to be
   added, no doubt, the further design of setting us an example, so that
   by no sufferings we might let ourselves be drawn aside from the
   righteousness which is due to God. Others, it is true, have given us
   such an example; but his is the most powerful, for he suffered without
   being obliged to suffer. [130] Once again it is asked, by way of
   objection, whether he was not really obliged, because the creature
   "owes all to God, what he is, and what he knows, and what he can do."
   As the answer, there suddenly appears the doctrine of surplus merit.
   When God leaves us free to offer Him something smaller or greater, a
   reward is the result if we give the greater, "because we give
   spontaneously what is our own." When this is applied to the God-man,
   the conclusion follows that his dying was necessary, because he willed
   it, but at the same time was not necessary, because God did not demand
   it. His death therefore is voluntary. [131] Now at length can the
   long-looked-for solution be given. [132] It follows in a surprising
   form, and, above all, with strange brevity: the God-man acts for
   himself, by no means as the representative of mankind. But the Father
   must recompense him for that. [133] But nothing, again, can be given to
   the Son, since he has all. Yet it would be outrageous to assume that
   the whole action of the Son should remain without effect. Hence it is
   necessary that it should be for the advantage of another, and if that
   is willed by the Son, the Father cannot object, otherwise He would be
   unjust. "But to whom more fittingly (convenientius) shall he impart the
   fruit and recompence of his death than to those for whose salvation, as
   true reason (ratio veritatis) has taught us, he made himself man, and
   to whom, as we have said, he gave in dying the example of dying for
   righteousness' sake? In vain surely shall they be imitators of him, if
   they are not to be partakers of his merit. Or whom shall he more justly
   make heirs of that which is due to him, but which he does not need, and
   of the superabundance of his plenitude (exundatiæ suæ plenitudinis)
   than his own parents and brethren, whom he looks on, burdened in their
   poverty with so many and so great debts, and languishing in the depths
   of misery, that what they owe for their sin may be remitted to them,
   and what, by reason of their sin, they lack, may be given to them?"
   [134] God accordingly now rejects no one who comes to Him in the name
   of this God-man, on condition that he comes as it befits him, i.e.,
   that he so approaches Him, and so lives, as Holy Scripture directs.
   [135] The divine mercy, therefore, has not been made void by the death
   on the cross -- so it would seem when sin and the divine righteousness
   are contemplated -- but it appears rather as inconceivably great, and
   at the same time as in perfect harmony with righteousness. God's word,
   indeed, to the sinner is: "Take mine only-begotten Son and give him for
   thyself," and the Son's word is: "Take me and redeem thyself." [136]
   Only the wicked angels cannot be redeemed. Not as if the "price of His
   death would not be availing through its magnitude for all sins of men
   and angels"; but the condition of the angels (they are not descended
   from one angel, and fell without a tempter) excludes redemption. [137]
   Anselm concludes with the lofty consciousness that "by the solution of
   one question" he has shown to be reasonable "all that is contained in
   the New and Old Testaments." [138]

   Because it really is what Anselm, in the last sentence, has asserted,
   namely, a (new) construction of the whole of dogma from the point of
   view of sin and redemption, and because in this construction the
   disjecta membra of the Augustinian Mediæval view of Christianity were
   for the first time knit together into a unity, this representation
   deserves a searching criticism. Standing on the shoulders of Augustine,
   but eliminating the "patristic," i.e., the Greek elements of his mode
   of thought, Anselm has, by his book, "Cur deus homo," placed himself,
   as distinctively a dogmatic theologian, side by side with the Fathers
   of Greek dogma (Irenæus, Athanasius, and Origen). With the outline
   which John of Damascus had furnished another outline is now associated,
   which certainly, and not to its advantage, is still dependent on the
   old, but yet is evidently dominated by another principle. Anselm's
   representation, however, also deserves special consideration because it
   has given the impulse to permanent treatment of the subject, and
   because it is still regarded in our own day -- and by evangelical
   theologians, too -- as essentially a model.

   First of all, as against misunderstandings, it must be stated what
   Anselm's theory is not, and is not meant to be. It is (1) no doctrine
   of reconciliation in the sense of showing how the opposition of will
   between God and sinful humanity is removed; it is (2) no theory of
   penal suffering, for Christ does not suffer penalty; the point rather
   at which penalty is inflicted is never reached, for God declares
   Himself satisfied with Christ's spontaneous acceptio mortis; just for
   this reason it is (3) no theory of vicarious representation in the
   strict sense of the term, for Christ does not suffer penalty in our
   stead, but rather provides a benefit, the value of which is not
   measured by the greatness of sin and sin's penalty, but by the value of
   His life, and which God accepts, as it weighs more for Him than the
   loss which He has suffered through sin (between sin, therefore, and the
   value of the life of Christ there exists only an external relation;
   both are infinite, but the latter is more infinite; hence it more than
   satisfies God); [139] it is, finally (4), not a theory which guarantees
   to the individual that he really becomes saved; it aims rather at only
   showing for all the possibility of their being saved; whether they
   shall be saved depends "on the measure in which men come to partake of
   so great grace, and on the degree in which they live under it," i.e.,
   on how they fulfil the commandments of holy scripture (II. 19, p. 94).

   From this consideration of what the Anselmic theory is not and does not
   offer, it already appears how inadequate it is. Above all, its
   unevangelical character shows itself in the 4th point. The entire
   ancient world, indeed, and, as Anselm shows, the mediæval world as
   well, rested satisfied with the doctrine of redemption, as
   demonstrating the possibility of the redemption of the individual from
   sin; but as this "possibility" can afford no comfort whatever to any
   distressed conscience, as it only satisfies the understanding, it is a
   worthless substitute for a real doctrine of redemption -- Luther would
   say it is of the devil. If it cannot be shown from the person of Christ
   that we really are redeemed, if the certainty of salvation (certitudo
   salutis) is not derived therefrom, nothing is gained; all, rather, is
   lost, when we rest satisfied with such a doctrine, and append to it, as
   Anselm does, the conclusion, "If thou fulfillest the commands of
   Scripture, then the great provision of the God-man has an effect for
   thee." For Anselm, the question of personal certitude of salvation, the
   fundamental question of religion, is simply not yet raised at all. He
   is an old-world, a mediæval, in a word, a Catholic Christian, inasmuch
   as he is satisfied with having made out that in virtue of Christ's
   provision some certainly from the "mass of perdition" can be saved, and
   in fact shall be saved, because they live piously. But a second point
   is to be noted here. With every effort to express it as strongly as
   possible, the gravity of sin (pondus peccati) is not treated with
   sufficient earnestness if the thought of penalty, and therefore also of
   vicarious penal suffering, is entirely eliminated. In the idea that sin
   can be compensated for by something else than penalty there lies an
   underestimate of its gravity that is extremely objectionable. A
   recognition of the deep proposition that the innocent suffers for the
   guilty, that the penalty lies upon him, that we might have peace, is
   not to be found in the Anselmic theory. It does not appear even in the
   statement, prompted by warm feeling, II. 20: "Accept mine only-begotten
   and give Him for thyself." "Take Me and redeem thyself," for nothing is
   said of a penal suffering (just as little in the equally warm line of
   exposition II. 16, pp. 77 sq.).

   But before entering upon the objections to the theory, let us indicate
   its excellences. These are not small: (1) It must be held as greatly to
   the credit of Anselm that he laid hold of the problem at all, and made
   it the centre for a survey of faith; (2) that he so apprehended it that
   redemption from guilt is the question dealt with (the Greeks had always
   thought primarily of redemption from the consequences of sin, liability
   to death); (3) it is to be specially noted that he conceived of guilt
   exclusively as guilt before God (disobedience), and entirely set aside
   the traditional doctrine (see even Augustine) that in redemption (by
   means of the crucifixion of the God-man) the question is about
   satisfying the devil; [140] (4) that he discarded a merely esthetic, or
   an externally historical, grounding of the death on the Cross (Christ
   did not die because it was prophesied, nor because the accomplishment
   of redemption had to correspond in its particulars with the history of
   Adam and the fall); (5) it is a point of much importance that Anselm
   made earnest efforts to prove the moral necessity of this precise mode
   of redemption. [141] That which he calls "reason" (ratio) is, at least
   in many lines of proof, nothing but the strict moral imperative, and is
   accordingly entirely admissible here, and he expressly refuses to lay
   at the basis of his investigation the conception of an unrestricted
   divine arbitrariness; with deeper insight and more courage than
   Augustine, he rather assumes everywhere that God's omnipotence is in
   inner subjection to His holy will. What, in his judgment, makes it
   possible to reflect rightly on God's arrangements is just our title to
   feel assured that the supreme righteousness and the supreme mercy,
   which He is Himself, can be understood by us as righteousness and
   mercy. Finally (6), according to Anselm, Jesus Christ, in His historic
   person and through His death, is for us the redemption. The grace of
   God is nothing but the redeeming work of Christ, i.e., the thought of
   grace is now for the first time entirely dissociated from that of
   nature and located in history, i.e., is connected solely with the
   person of Christ.

   But contrasted with these excellences there are so many defects that
   this theory is entirely untenable. To a great extent these defects lie
   so much on the surface, and do such violence, equally to reason and to
   morality (not to speak of the attack on the gospel), that if the
   present-day theology stood under normal conditions not a word would
   have to be lost upon them. But as the current theology stands under the
   dominating influence of traditional faith and Romanticism, and discards
   all the criteria of gospel, morality, logic, and culture, when it sees
   the "necessity of the possibility" of the traditional objects of its
   faith in some way justified, some discussion will here be in its right
   place. Besides what has been already noted above, the following things
   fall to be observed:

   First, the theory contains a series of imperfections, or, say
   contradictions; for (1) the necessarium is to be strictly carried
   through, yet at important points Anselm does not get beyond the
   conveniens, above all at the most important point, that it is just to
   men that the merit of Christ is imparted (II. 19, pp. 93 fin.).
   Moreover, that God accepts the death of the God-man for the wrong done
   to Him is not based on strict necessity, for the sin of men, and the
   nature of the satisfaction of Christ, have nothing inwardly in common;
   [142] (2) the satisfaction theory must be brought to a point in a way
   that is foreign to it, that it may be proved to have any effect at all.
   That is to say, the theory itself, strictly taken, only goes so far as
   to show that God's injured honour is vindicated and men take an example
   from the death of Christ to adhere steadfastly to righteousness, even
   under the severest sufferings. But how can they take an example? Will
   the example, then, have the power to incite to earnest imitation? Will
   they not rather go on sinning? Yet the whole provision, according to
   Anselm, avails only for those who regulate their life according to Holy
   Scripture. So the provision will be a failure! Anselm certainly felt
   this, and therefore passed quite beyond his theory by asserting that
   God sees occasion for His rewarding the voluntary action of the
   God-man, and for His conferring this reward on men, by reckoning to
   them as the kinsmen of Christ the merit of Christ, without which they
   shall be quite unable to become imitators of Christ. This turn of
   thought does all honour to Anselm's piety; but it destroys his doctrine
   of satisfaction; for if Christ's suffering establishes merit, it does
   not contain strict reparation; but if it contains satisfaction, it
   establishes no merit. Nor does Anselm speak here of a surplus merit,
   but he suddenly regards the whole work of Christ as merit; but then it
   is not satisfaction. Further, when men suddenly come to be considered
   as kinsmen of Jesus, the question arises as to why this standpoint --
   that Christ is to be regarded as the head of elect humanity -- was not
   asserted at the beginning of the inquiry. (3) The way in which the
   conceptions of the righteousness and honour of God are treated is full
   of contradictions. On the one hand righteousness, it is maintained,
   finds expression in penalty as much as in the positive attainment of
   salvation as an end; on the other hand righteousness requires that this
   end be reached. In keeping with this is the way the conception of
   honour is dealt with; indeed, three conceptions are here presupposed.
   First of all, it must be held entirely impossible for God to receive
   personal wrong; His honour can suffer absolutely no injury (I., 15: "By
   nothing can the honour of God, so far as it is concerned, be increased
   or diminished; since for itself it is the same incorruptible and
   absolutely immutable honour"). Then it is asserted that His honour,
   certainly, can be injured, but that it can likewise be restored, either
   by penalty (damnation of the human race) or by satisfaction. Lastly, it
   is asserted that the honour of God cannot tolerate the destruction of
   His world-plan, which culminates in the salvation of the reasonable
   creature, that, accordingly, God must forego penalty, bring about the
   salvation of the creature, and therefore choose satisfaction. (4) While
   in general the idea is always carried through, that on account of His
   honour God cannot simply pardon men, the turn of thought occurs in c.
   19, p. 41, that God cannot do so on man's account, because a man
   polluted by sin, even though he were restored to paradise, would not be
   as he was before the fall. Yet this important turn of thought is not
   wrought out to a further issue. (5) It is asserted of God that He
   stands above all change of human conditions, and supports all things by
   His holy omnipotence; hence the rule holds good (l.c.): "it is not for
   man to transact with God as an equal with an equal." Yet this rule is
   contravened by the whole exposition, which proceeds on the principle
   (I. 23, p. 47): "Man never should, and never can, receive from God what
   God has proposed to give him, unless he restores to God all that he
   took from Him, so that as God has lost by him, He shall also recover by
   him." This principle places God and man entirely on the same footing as
   injured and injurer. God is wronged as a man is wronged. But if it is
   said, that in point of fact, as moral beings, they would stand on the
   same footing, yet this correct observation must not alter the
   fundamental relationship, that God is the Lord and man His creature.
   (6) The assumption that Christ's death was voluntary, in the sense that
   He could also have declined death, cannot be carried through without
   contradiction, and yet, as Anselm knew very well, everything in his
   theory depends on this point. First of all, Anselm can only set aside
   by clumsy sophisms the Bible passages that assert that death was
   included in the obedience of Christ, and that He drank the cup in
   trembling fulfilment of the will of the Father. Secondly, when the
   subject itself is dealt with, it cannot be proved that the obedience of
   Christ did not extend to the suffering of death, for as it was --
   according to Anselm -- the man Christ that suffered, death is also
   included in what He owed to God, since man, even apart from sin, owes
   himself entirely to God. The action, moreover, which Christ offered up
   when He died "to the honour of God" was not objective; it was personal.
   But -- again according to Anselm -- man is under obligation to direct
   all personal action "to the honour of God." [143]

   Second, the old ecclesiastical material with which Anselm works is not
   adapted to the new purposes for which he employs it. From the time of
   Athanasius, and even earlier, the doctrine of the two natures was so
   understood as to imply that the God-Logos is the subject, and that He
   takes human nature into the unity of His divine being. This idea alone
   suits the purpose which the Greeks had in view, namely, to explain the
   reality of the conquest of death, and the deification of our nature.
   From this as a starting-point, Athanasius developed in detail a
   multitude of points of view, this among the rest, that by His dying --
   which was possible to Him through the human nature -- the God-Logos
   bore the penalty, and expelled death from human nature. But Anselm
   wished to trace back everything to satisfaction, and he adhered
   strictly to the correct theory of Ambrose and Augustine, that it was
   the man Jesus who died, and that it is He therefore who is our
   mediator. At the same time, however, the impossibility of reconciling
   this view with the doctrine of the two natures now at last found
   definite expression in him; for where the subject of the redeeming
   personality is regarded, not as the God-Logos, but as, with Anselm, the
   man, there is a cancelling, not, indeed, of the Godhead of Christ, but
   certainly of the two-nature doctrine. The term, "the Godhead of
   Christ," occurs in Anselm, within the lines of the strict theory, only
   as a determination of the value of the human person in his action.
   [144] Christ appears as the man, whose life has an infinite value. That
   that is something quite different from the second person of the Godhead
   is obvious. [145] When Anselm now continues to use the two-nature
   doctrine as a hallowed tradition, a quite Nestorian diremption of the
   person is the result (see I. 9, 10), such as had regularly occurred in
   the West from the time of Augustine, when there was an attempt to work
   out one's own Christology as a doctrine of redemption, and yet a
   refusal to relinquish that doctrine of natures. But further, the
   two-nature doctrine still appears welcome on this ground also, namely,
   that by means of it every difficulty whatever which the theory of
   redemption offers can be got quit of; for as everything conceivable can
   be distributed between the predicates, "human and divine natures," one
   finds himself herewith equal to any difficulty, and can suppress every
   doubt, and excuse all indolence of thought. Anselm confessed that
   himself in a naïve way (c. 17, p. 85): "What does not answer to the man
   in Christ must be transferred to the God, what does not suit the God
   must be applied to the man." In this way the earnest Greek speculation,
   which always stood for the unity of the God-man, was discarded; and
   thus it continued to be in the West. Among those who to-day interject
   in discussion the "Godhead" of Christ, how many reflect that the term
   obliges them to prove the divine-human unity, and that, if they imagine
   they may disregard this obligation, an Athanasius and the Fathers of
   dogma would despise them as empty talkers or as heretics? These men
   knew full well that the mere term, "the divinity of Christ," affirms
   simply nothing, is heretical, indeed, because the God-manhood must be
   proved. But to those in the West that no longer occurs; for they
   neither can, nor will, prove it, by employing the means of the Greeks;
   nay, they follow quite a different scheme in the doctrine of
   redemption: Christ is the man whose action has an infinite value. If,
   then, the term, "doctrine of two-natures," continues in use, then among
   those who really reflect on Christ as Redeemer it is deprived of its
   meaning through the Western conception of it. Hence it is only used
   still in the service of "conservative interests," or to secure an
   authorised exemption from all energetic reflection on Christ as
   Redeemer by means of the convenient formula; this He did as God, and
   that as man.

   Third, besides what has been set forth up to this point, there is still
   a series of the gravest objections to be urged against the whole
   character of the Anselmic doctrine. Let us only briefly indicate them:
   (1) In many passages, and these, too, the most important, Anselm
   proceeds according to a logic by which already everything can be
   proved. The gravest malpractices of Scholasticism already betray
   themselves in him; the self-restraint of the ancient thinkers, modest
   as was the expression given to it by the Fathers, is wanting to him.
   (2) Everything is conceived of quite abstractly, very much in the way
   in which a clever child thinks and speaks of such things, This theory
   manages to describe the work of redemption by Jesus Christ without
   adducing a single saying of His (what is brought forward does not serve
   to elucidate, but consists in the explaining away of important passages
   of Scripture). Anselm holds it as superfluous to accentuate any one
   personal feature in the picture of Christ; the sinless man with the
   infinitely valuable life is enough. The death of Christ is entirely
   severed from His life-work on earth, and isolated. This God-man need
   not have preached, and founded a kingdom, and gathered disciples; he
   only required to die. (3) There is no reference to the eternal election
   of the Christian community, or the reference is only feeble (see I. 16,
   and in connection with Mary). As the Kingdom of God is not spoken of,
   so neither is the Church, and its eternal existence in the view of God.
   The category of the inner moral necessity of the good and holy even for
   God is consistently confounded with that of reason (ratio), by means of
   which, it is represented, one can constrain even a heathen to believe
   in the God-man, the result being that the mystery of faith is profaned.
   (4) Sin is conceived of certainly as guilt before God; but this guilt
   is not the want of trust (faith) in Him, but is conceived of as a
   personal injury. How any one pleases to deal with personal injuries is
   a matter for himself; on the other hand, the guilt which is want of
   child-like fear and love, and which destroys God's world, must be wiped
   out, whether it be in wrath or in love. Anselm fails to see that. (5)
   And this brings us to the worst thing in Anselm's theory: the
   mythological conception of God as the mighty private man, who is
   incensed at the injury done to His honour and does not forego His wrath
   till He has received an at least adequately great equivalent; the quite
   Gnostic antagonism between justice and goodness, the Father being the
   just one, and the Son the good; the frightful idea (as compared with
   which the views of the lathers and the Gnostics are far to be
   preferred) that mankind are delivered from the wrathful God; [146] the
   illusory performance between Father and Son, while the Son is one with
   the Father; the illusory performance of the Son with Himself, for
   according to Anselm the Son offers Him-self to Himself (II. 18: "filius
   ad honorem suum seipsum sibi obtulit"); [147] the blasphemous idea that
   the Son's giving of life (datio vitæ) is for God, as acceptance of
   death (acceptio mortis), a benefit; the dreadful thought that God is
   superior to man, as having the prerogative of not being able to forgive
   from love, a payment always being needed by Him (I. 12); the vitiated
   conception of our prayer to God for forgiveness, that it is a part of
   our satisfaction, but can never in itself have the effect of
   forgiveness (I. 19: "qui non solvit, frustra dicit: dimitte"). If it is
   now added that, as has been shown above, there is proved by all this
   only the possibility of our being saved, that the thought of the
   penalty of sin is eliminated (and therefore the righteousness of God
   too laxly conceived of), that here no innocent one suffers penalty for
   the guilty, and that, in the effect upon us, only the feeble thought of
   example comes clearly to view, then we must say, that in spite of
   Anselm's good intentions, and in spite of some correct perceptions, no
   theory so bad had ever before his day been given out as ecclesiastical.
   But perhaps no one can frame a better, who isolates the death of Christ
   from His life, and wishes to see in this death something else than the
   consummation of the "service" which He rendered throughout His life.
   [148]

   In its complete form Anselm's theory exercised little influence. The
   conception, which he only touched on, of the "meritoriousness" of the
   work of Christ, very rapidly came to the front, and made his
   satisfaction theory -- which, moreover, conflicted with the Augustinian
   tradition -- without effect. Added to this was the fact that interest
   in the proof of our reconciliation to God was not satisfied by Him. At
   this point Abelard intervened, without giving, certainly, a connected
   and exact development of the doctrine. [149] After rejecting still more
   decidedly than Anselm the relation of the death on the Cross to the
   devil, he sets out from the fundamental thought of the love of God, and
   at the same time makes it clear to himself that sin has separated men
   from God, that it is a question therefore of bringing them back to God,
   and of again imparting to them trust in God. Further, he keeps it
   before him that the fruit of redemption relates to the chosen, with
   regard to whom God's disposition did not first need to be changed.
   Accordingly, the incarnation and death of the Son of God can be
   conceived of only as an act of love, and even the righteousness of God
   must be so defined that it is subordinated to love, or, say, is
   identical with it. It was not required then that Christ should first
   assuage the wrath of God. It is as easy for God to forgive sin as it
   was for Him to bring into existence a sinless man, who united himself
   to Christ. But in order really to win us for Himself, Christ has given
   us the highest proof of love, which kindles our cold hearts and leads
   us back to the trust and love of God. Further (the reflections do not
   stand in a strict order) in this deed of Christ in dying on the Cross
   God beholds us, that is, He forgives us our sins, in so far as He
   reckons to us the merit of Christ, because Christ stands before God as
   the head of humanity; He likewise lets the merit of the perfect
   righteousness of Christ fall to our advantage; for in the obedience of
   Christ God is satisfied. Finally, Christ goes on working continuously
   for us, for inasmuch as He prays for us unceasingly to the Father, it
   is in keeping with the righteousness of God to reckon to us this merit.
   But by Christ's "merit" Abelard never understands "a sum of distinct
   actions; the fulness of love to God dwelling in Christ is His merit."
   "Thus it is in will, not in works, which are common to the good and
   evil, that all merit consists. [150] There is therefore here nothing
   objective and nothing magical. Even the death on the Cross is not
   estimated as an objective deed, but belongs entirely -- as a chief part
   -- to the evidences of the love of Christ which He exhibited from the
   beginning. Christ's merit is His service of love; but love calls forth
   responsive love, and he who loves (because Christ has first loved him)
   has forgiveness of sins granted him, nay, in the interchange of love
   which springs from Christ there lies the forgiveness of sins itself.
   [151]

   Abelard has furnished no strict proof for the necessity of the death on
   the Cross; his propositions, moreover, are inadequate, because he has
   not clearly perceived that that love is the highest, is indeed alone
   effectual, which, by taking the penalty upon itself, reveals at the
   same time the greatness of the absolution and the greatness of the
   cancelled guilt. He did not perceive that the sinner cannot be
   otherwise delivered from guilt than by experiencing and seeing the
   penalty of guilt. But he had too keen a sense of the love of his God,
   and of the oneness of God and Christ, to entertain the Gnostic thought
   that God needs a sacrifice or an equivalent, or that for Him Christ's
   death is a benefit. And he knew himself so intimately united to Christ
   in living fellowship that it was he who first introduced again into the
   doctrine of redemption the apostolic thought of the perpetual
   intercession of Christ for us, and on the other hand saw also in the
   earthly life of Christ, not one proof of love -- the death -- but a
   continuous stream of love, in which the "work" of Christ also, namely
   His " merit," i.e., the operation of His loving will, is included.
   [152]

   The polemic against Abelard directed itself also against his theory of
   redemption; but it was contested essentially from the basis of the
   Augustinian theory of redemption (vanquishment of the claim of the
   devil), while there was no following of Anselm. [153] At the same time
   all were increasingly at one in this, that the point of view of merit
   must be applied, and that Christ must be contemplated as Redeemer in
   the light of His human quality. With this understanding also the
   Lombard drew up his connected account of the opinions of the Fathers in
   his doctrinal compendium. As in the case of Augustine, the "man" (homo)
   in Christ takes the prominent place, as the moral personality chosen
   and sustained by God, and the whole life of Christ is understood from
   this point of view. [154] At the same time, in order to understand the
   peculiar nature of redemption, all points of view were combined that
   were furnished by the past: obedience, redemption from the devil, death
   and penalty, but, above all, the merit of death, then also sacrifice.
   With Augustine, the strict necessity of this precise means (death on
   the Cross) is rejected; with him and the other Fathers, the buying off
   of the devil (including deception) is asserted. With Abelard, the death
   is viewed as a proof of love, which awakens counter love; with him
   Christ is regarded as the representative of humanity before God; with
   Augustine, the necessity for a reconciliation of God through the death
   of Christ is rejected (God loves even His enemies; He has loved us
   beforehand from eternity, and we are reconciled, not with the wrathful,
   but with the loving God); finally, a penal value in the death of Christ
   is asserted, in the sense that by it the eternal penalty is remitted
   (see Athanasius), the temporal penalty in future (after death) falls
   away. On the other hand the Anselmic theory is not mentioned at all.
   [155] The Lombard shows therefore that the patristic tradition still
   continued to be the only subject of doctrine, and that it was only with
   an effort that what was new asserted itself against it. Yet the whole
   undertaking to give a combined and connected view was itself new (on
   which account the Lombard was regarded with much distrust as an
   Abelardian) [156]

   Not till the thirteenth century did the new dogmatic impulses of the
   eleventh and twelfth centuries take their place with equal rights,
   materially, though not formally, alongside the mass of traditional
   patristic tenets. By the latter, which were represented partly by a
   voluminous exegetical tradition, and partly by theological positions no
   longer understood in their original connection, the trivial spirit of
   mediæval theology was fostered, which mingled in a marvellous way with
   its energy and with its juristic acuteness. The statement of the thesis
   in scholastic science was invariably lofty and great; "but by its love
   for details even heaven was dragged down." From the scientific
   standpoint, and from the standpoint of "juristic thinking," we cannot
   find fault, certainly, with this spirit; for does not science require
   that the problems be thought out to their ultimate consequences? The
   error lay simply in the premises, and in the idea that that thinking
   was thinking about religion. But even that idea it was necessary then
   to entertain, for religion was of course contemplation!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] So far as there was at all a single authoritative book here, it
   was Augustine's Enchiridion. But it is characteristic that Abelard, in
   his systematic work, already added the Sacraments to faith and love.

   [68] The doctrine of the sacraments is chiefly thought of here.

   [69] Almost everything that Bach has set forth in the second volume of
   his work on the history of dogma in the Middle Ages, including the
   "history of Adoptianism in the twelfth century" and the "systematic
   polemic against the dialecticians" (p. 390 ff.; Gerhoch against the
   German Adoptians, p. 475 ff.), belongs simply to the history of
   theology, and has no significance for the history of dogma.

   [70] Besides Lessing's well-known work and Vischer, De sacra coena adv.
   Lanfrancum lib. posterior, 1834; also the Acts of the Roman Council
   (Mansi XIX., p. 761 ff.), see Sudendorf, Berengarius, 1850; Schnitzer,
   Berengar v. Tours, sein Leben u. s. Lehre, 1890; Bach I., pp. 364-451;
   Reuter I., p. 91 ff., Dieckhoff, Die Abendmahlslehre im
   Reform.-Zeitalter I., p. 44 ff.

   [71] Here, for the first time, the categories "subjectum," "quod in
   subjecto," "de subjecto," the distinction of "esse" from "secundum quod
   esse," in short, the dialectic manipulations of the notion of substance
   (according to Porphyry, Boethius, etc.) were applied to a dogma in the
   West.

   [72] The outward political side of the controversy has been thoroughly
   treated by Schwane (Studien zur Gesch. des 2. Abendmahlsstreits, 1887,
   see Loofs, Gött. Gel.-Anz., 1888, No. 15), who follows Sudendorf. On
   the antagonism to Berengar, see the accounts of Schnitzer, l.c. p. 246
   ff.

   [73] Reuter's judgment is, I., p. 97: "Thus the second controversy on
   the Eucharist became what the first was not, a struggle as to the
   supreme criteria of religious truth, a conflict of the tendency of
   negative illuminism,' directly with the authoritative ecclesiasticism
   of the time, indirectly with the Christianity of positive revelation."
   This is to me utterly unintelligible. Even the most deeply convinced
   Romish theologian will hesitate to endorse this opinion.

   [74] See on this Reuter I., p. 95, "Paschasius ineptus ille monachus
   Corbeiensis." Berengar is correct in seeing contradictions in
   Paschasius. The book of Ratramnus was then regarded as a work of John
   Scotus, and was condemned as such at Vercelli in 1050.

   [75] The confession of faith which was forced upon him in 1059
   (composed by Cardinal Humbert), also contained the coarse view. Even
   Bach I., p. 366, n. 4, declares the confession "at least
   objectionable." In Lanfranc de corp. et sang. dom. 2 (Migne CL.) the
   words occur: "panem et vinum quæ in altari ponuntur post consecrationem
   non solum sacramentum sed etiam verum corpus et sanguinem J. Christi
   esse et sensualiter, non solum in sacramento sed et in veritate,
   manibus sacerdotum tractari et frangi et fidelium dentibus atteri." The
   most characteristic thing is that those who were quite logical declared
   even the word "sacrament" to be unsatisfactory: "The Eucharist is the
   mystery (sacramentum) in which there is no mystery, but all takes place
   vere et sensualiter." That is the fundamental thought of Berengar's
   opponents. That this was a falling away from tradition stands beyond
   doubt. But the traditional theologians, as is well known, are most
   fanatical, when to the old beaten track which they call tradition, or
   to their fancies, which, from their lack of understanding, they
   surround with the halo of the venerable, there is opposed the truth
   that has the protection of the true tradition.

   [76] The controversy is also so uninspiring, because, as usual, the
   opponents exaggerated. Berengar proceeded as if he had only the view
   against him that parts of the bloody body of Christ are chewed by the
   teeth, while his adversaries asserted that according to him the
   elements were empty symbols. He had at any rate more right on his side
   in his description; yet not only Fulbert (Bach I., p. 365), but some
   also who were later, did not think of a spatial extension of the body
   of Christ in the converted elements.

   [77] See Mansi T. XIX., p. 768.

   [78] Of course the chief arguments of Berengar are derived from
   Scripture and tradition. To them he attaches decisive weight. The
   distinction that already prejudges everything, between the sensible,
   the visible, and the sacrament, the invisible -- Berengar had made it
   the basis of his doctrine and the starting-point of his dialectic, as
   long as he could think -- originates with Augustine. With the dialectic
   there mingle the beginnings of a more independent, a critical view of
   history. Yet Berengar meddles with no decree of any Council. Only, the
   decrees connected with his subject are ridiculed by him.

   [79] See Vischer, p. 600: "maximi plane cordis est, per omnia ad
   dialecticam confugere, quia confugere ad eam ad rationem est confugere,
   quo qui non confugit, cum secundum rationem sit factus ad imaginem dei,
   suum honorem reliquit nec potest renovari de die in diem ad imaginem
   dei."

   [80] 1Berengar compares the description of Christ as a lion, lamb,
   corner-stone.

   [81] P. 199: "constabit, eum qui opinetur, Christi corpus coelo
   devocatum adesse sensualiter in altari, ipsum se dejicere, quod
   vecordium est, dum confirmat se manu frangere, dente atterere Christi
   corpus, quod tamen ipsum negare non possit impossibile esse et
   incorruptibile."

   [82] The last point was for Berengar of the greatest weight. He always
   regards his opponents as assuming that there are "portiunculæ" of the
   body of Christ on the altar, and objects to this, (1) that it is a
   question of the whole body (see pp. 148, 199 f.); (2) that the body of
   Christ is not something "corruptible," which can be touched, broken,
   and bitten. Then, again, the bread is not capable of affording room for
   such a body, and then the "sensualiter" is above all objected to. The
   incorruptibility and uniqueness of the body of Christ are the
   presuppositions of his dialectic. A body so constituted cannot become
   sensible, and it cannot be at the same time in a thousand places. The
   expedient also of supposing a creating-anew of the body of Christ is
   effectively refuted by him; this would involve us in the thought of two
   bodies.

   [83] Here Berengar emphasised the correct logical reflection, "quod in
   subjecto erat superesse quacunque ratione non potest corrupto subjecto"
   (p. 93), i.e., when the substance is destroyed, the essential
   attributes (taste, colour, form) cannot remain behind; or p. 59: "non
   potest res ulla aliquid esse, si desinat ipsum esse." Even Protestant
   historians will take no account of such reasons.

   [84] It most be assumed that it rests on accommodation; for although
   there answers to the sacrament a res sacramenti, which is created by
   the consecration, yet it is certainly not a question of transmutation.
   Nor did the old tradition furnish this term. In substance Berengar is a
   correct Augustinian; hence it is unnecessary to quote further passages.
   The proper expression for what Berengar means would be a divine
   "auctio" in the elements, and so also he has expressed himself, p. 98.
   On the other hand, it is said, p. 125: "per consecrationem altaris
   fiunt panis et vinum sacramenta religionis, non ut desinat esse quæ
   fuerant, sed ut sint quæ erant et in aliud commutentur."

   [85] "Christi corpus totum constat accipi ab interiore homine, fidelium
   corde, non ore" (p. 148). At the same time also a memorial feast:
   "spiritualis comestio, quæ fit in mente."

   [86] v. above p. 47, note 2.

   [87] On the interesting relation of Berengar to the Curia and Gregory
   VII., see Reuter I., p. 116 ff., 120 ff.

   [88] The formula (in Lanfranc, c. 2) was milder than that of 1059, but
   yet sufficiently plain: "Ego Berengarius corde credo et ore confiteor
   panem et vinum quæ ponuntur in altari per mysterium sacræ orationis et
   verba nostri redemptoris substantialiter converta in veram et propriam
   et vivicatricem carnem et sanguinem J. Christi et post consecrationem
   esse verum corpus Christi, quod natum est de virgine . . .et quod sedet
   ad dexteram patris . . .non tantum per signum et virtutem sacramenti
   sed in proprietate naturæ et veritate substantiæ."

   [89] In his two treatises (of date 1157) against the followers of
   Soterichos, in whose opinion the mass was not offered to the Son, but
   only to the Father and Spirit, Nicolas of Methone used the expression
   metastoicheiosis, see Hefele V.2, p. 568. These treatises were
   published by Dimitracopulos in the year 1865 (see Reusch, Theol.
   Lit.-Blatt, 1866, No. 11).

   [90] Yet everything acquired settled form only in the thirteenth
   century: the questions resulting from the new doctrine are innumerable.

   [91] Lanfranc, 1.c. c. 20: even sinners and the unworthy receive the
   true body of Christ. Only in this respect did Lanfranc develop the
   doctrine beyond Paschasius.

   [92] There was an aiming above all at recognising the whole Christ as
   present in the host, at reconciling the Augustinian, as well as the
   older rich and manifold conception of the Eucharist as a whole, with
   the transmutation doctrine, at rationalising the relation of element to
   verum corpus Christi by dialectic distinctions of accident and
   substance, at reconciling the presence of Christ in heaven with the
   sacramental presence, and at not forgetting, too, in these speculations
   the Church as corpus Christi. Note here as specially important the
   treatise de corp. et sang. Christi veritate in eucharistia, by Guitmund
   of Aversa (Migne CXLIX.), who certainly learned from Berengar. For the
   theories of other opponents of Berengar (Lanfranc, Adelmann of Brixen,
   Hugo of Langres, Durandus of Troaune, Alger of Lüttich, Abelard [he
   taught differently from Berengar, see Deutsch, l.c. pp. 401 f., 405
   ff.], Walter of St. Victor, Honorius of Autun, etc.), see in Bach p.
   382 ff. On the German theologians who occupied themselves with the
   doctrine of the Eucharist, see ibid., p. 399 ff. (the Reichersberg
   theologians, Gerhoch, Rupert of Deutz; in the last named there is a
   peculiar, spiritualistic consubstantiation doctrine). Guitmund
   attributed the whole Christ to every particle, and thereby led on to
   the new view, first expressed by Anselm, that the whole Christ is
   container) in one form (ep. IV., 107); "in acceptione sanguinis totum
   Christum deum et hominem et in acceptione corporis similiter totem
   accipimus." In this the dogmatic basis was laid for withholding the
   cup, which afterwards became the rule. There is interest connected with
   the timid attempts that were made to teach also a "certain"
   incorruptibility of the accidents of the converted substances (these
   terms are now used even by the orthodox). Yet appearance witnessed
   against this assumption, and there was not yet resolution enough to
   adopt the doctrine that even here the empirical misleads. That Lutheran
   theologians take sides with Berengar's opponents (Thomasius-Seeberg, p.
   48: "really religious position as opposed to the rationalising
   misinterpretation of this man," cf. Reuter), although their final
   argument was the omnipotence of God, belongs to the peculiarities of
   the Romantic theology of the nineteenth century. Thomasius (p. 49) is
   specially delighted with the timid anticipations of the doctrine of the
   ubiquity of the substance of the body of the heavenly Christ in Alger
   (de sacram. corp. et sang. domini I., 11-16), whereby the difficulties
   which attach to the idea of the creatio of the Eucharistic body are to
   be set aside (Bach. I., p. 389 ff.): "Christ can be corporeally present
   wherever he wills." For the rest (see Lanfranc), there was as yet no
   more declared than that with the body exalted to the right hand of God
   the Eucharistic body is identical, and yet not identical. How necessary
   here, therefore, was the so much despised dialectic of Berengar!

   [96] The necessity resulted, no doubt, when the right of the devil over
   mankind was thought of. Beyond this, it may be said that we have in one
   respect an anticipation of the Anselmic representation in the sermon
   composed about 500 by a contemporary of Faustus of Reji: Why Christ
   redeemed mankind from the power of the devil, not through the use of
   His divine might, but by becoming man, fulfilling the law, suffering
   and dying. (Caspari, Briefe, Abhandlungen und Predigten, 1890, pp. 202
   ff. 411 ff.). The whole view of redemption, it is true, is still given
   here under the scheme of redemption from the devil, but the mode of
   redemption is dominated by the thought that "deus est rationis atque
   justitiæ et auctor et exactor." Something similar is also to be found
   in some homilies of Faustus (see Caspari, 1.c. p. 418 ff.).

   [97] Edit. II., by Fritzsche, 1886.

   [98] Cremer (die Wurzeln des Anselm'schen Satisfactionsbegriff, in den
   Stud. und Krit. 1880, p. 7 ff.) has endeavoured to show that the
   fundamental thesis of Anselm's satisfaction theory (I. 13: "necesse
   est, ut aut ablatus honor solvatur aut poena sequatur.Edit. II., by
   Fritzsche, 1886. I. 15: "necesse est, ut omne peccatum satisfactio aut
   poena sequatur") is of Germanic origin. The correspondence is no doubt
   easily proved, but the Roman law also knows of this alternative in the
   case of private offences, and there can be no doubt that the Church, in
   its ordinances of penance, had acted on the principle, "aut poenitentia
   legitima (satisfactio congrua) aut mors acterna," long ere it learned
   to know Germanic law. In Tertullian, certainly, there still prevails
   another idea, when (de pudic. 2) he says: "omne delictum aut venia
   dispungit aut poena"; but the fatal turn of thought is already
   anticipated, when he forthwith adds: "venia ex castigatione, poena ex
   damnatione." -- Thus I had written in the first edition; since then,
   Cremer has again described his standpoint in the Stud. u. Krit., 1893
   (pp. 316-345). I must adhere to the position that it is not necessary
   for understanding Anselm to have recourse to the Germanic notion of
   satisfaction, since the material in hand, of which we have to take
   account, is quite sufficiently given in the prevailing practice and
   theory of penance. These go back in the West to the time of Cyprian, or
   say of Tertullian (see Wirth, Der Verdienstbegriff bei Tertullian,
   1892; see also Tertullian's notion of "compensatio," cf. Apolog. 50:
   "veniam dei compensatione sanguinis expedire"), and developed
   themselves everywhere in the same way. It may be enough to point to
   Sulpitius Severus (Dial. II. 10), who was certainly not affected by
   Germanic influence: "fornicatio deputatur ad poenam, nisi satisfactione
   purgatur." That is surely clearly enough the Anselmic scheme. (See
   other passages in Karl Müller, Abhandl. f. Weizsäcker, 1892, p. 290 f.:
   God is satisfied with a lesser performance; this appears sometimes as
   mutatio of, sometimes as compensatio for, the eternal penalty.) Nor is
   it advisable here, or in Tertullian, to speak of "compensating penalty"
   ("Ersatzstrafe") as distinct from "compensation for injury"
   ("Schadenersatz"), for these notions cannot at all be strictly kept
   apart everywhere. "The sacrifices that are well-pleasing to God are a
   broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart." From this passage and
   similar ones, from the consensus gentium also, which may very well be
   appealed to here, and finally from the rule, well-known even to the
   Romans, as to every other nation, that private injuries are cancelled
   by indemnifications which restore to the injured party his honour, it
   is quite sufficiently explained, how in the gemitus, lamentationes,
   humiliationes, etc., there should both be recognised mortificationes
   temporales, and also something seen which changes the feeling of the
   angry God and makes Him again gracious. That is compensation for injury
   as regards the honour of God (because voluntary self-humiliation), for
   in the normal relationship one is not obliged in such a way to testify
   his subjection (therefore it is also a "merit" -- i.e., something which
   God gladly sees and prizes -- when in this condition one nevertheless
   offers those performances, and under certain circumstances a saint can
   also offer them for a sinner). But it can also be described as
   compensating penalty, for the satisfaction, it is true, and even the
   Anselmic is no exception, is in no sense endurance of deserved penalty,
   but it is a performance, which to the performer is painful and arduous.
   In Roman public law the poena is certainly the satisfactio -- that has
   not been disputed -- but, so far as I know, in the penitential
   discipline of the ancient Church the satisfactio was never thought of
   purely in the forms of Roman law (against Cremer, p. 316), but was
   always the evasion of penalty by acts which were at once (as
   castigatio) compensating penalties and (as surplus exercise of lowly
   submission to God) compensations for injury. It may be that to the man
   of the ancient world the compensating penalty was more distinctly
   present than the compensation for injury, although all public penal
   procedure has developed itself from compensating performances, and the
   consciousness of this has never disappeared (even "poena" is originally
   "ransom"). But when Cremer asserts: "The term and conception penance'
   (Busse), in the penal law and current language of the Romish Church,
   springs from the satisfactio of German law," that is an error which
   prejudices all his further exposition (see also Loots, Dogmengesch.3,
   p. 273 f.). At the same time it may be held by way of reservation that
   the transfusion of the penance discipline of the Church with Germanic
   ideas strengthened the theory, and gave a casuistic tinge and
   externality to the practice (Weregild, instead of, and in addition to,
   cor humiliatum and lamentationes). So also the peculiar expression
   Anselm gives to the notion "honour" of God is perhaps due to Germanic
   influence, although one must look very closely to discover a shade of
   difference on this point between Anselm's God and the injured and
   wrathful God of Tertullian. Why then (according to Tertullian) is God
   injured by sins? Because the obedience is withheld which is due to His
   commands. When Cremer asserts (p. 329) that in the ancient penance
   discipline, the satisfactio congrua ("congrua" -- that is, determined
   by the penance regulations; the expression can be pointed out already
   in the fourth century) was as much penalty as the mors æterna, that is
   certainly a wonderful statement. When, finally (p. 326), he throws on
   me the burden of proving that the Roman law, in the case of private
   injuries, recognises the alternative: "aut poena aut satisfactio," I
   grant that I expressed myself too strongly, and in a way not incapable
   of being misunderstood. The law, so far as it was publicly administered
   and codified, may no longer recognise this principle; but a jurist like
   Tertullian shows that the scheme must have been a familiar one, and how
   can we think of the settlement of private wrongs at all otherwise than
   by supposing that a satisfactio is rendered to the injured?

   [100] Augustine already propounded the question of the absolute
   necessity of redemption by means of the incarnation and death of the
   Logos, but answered it in the negative. He saw in this means not the
   only, though certainly the worthiest, way.

   [101] I. 1.

   [102] "I. 2: Sicut rectus ordo exigit, ut profunda christianæ fidei
   prius credamus, quam ea præsumamus ratione discutere."

   [103] I. 3, 4: ". . .Multa alia, quæ studiose considerata inenarrabilem
   quandam nostræ redemptionis hoc modo procuratæ pulchritudinem (see
   Augustine) ostendunt . . .sed si non est aliquid solidum super quod
   sedeant, non videntur infidelibus sufficere."

   [104] I. 5,

   [105] I. 6, 7.

   [106] I. 8-10. In the 2nd Book this decisive point is repeatedly
   treated very fully in c. 10, 11 and 16, 18.

   [107] In the course of it (I. 16-18) the Augustinian theologoumenon,
   that the men destined to salvation take the place of the fallen angels,
   fills a large space. But it is in no way connected with the doctrine of
   satisfaction. Anselm differs from Augustine in this, that he thinks
   that the number of saved men is greater than that of the fallen angels;
   from the beginning God had in view the numerus beatorum as consisting
   of angels and men. Otherwise the creation of men would be simply a
   consequence of the fall among the angels, and there would result the
   inconveniens that we men should have to rejoice over this fall. This
   correction of the Augustinian doctrine does all honour to Anselm's
   heart; but as the doctrine has its point in the equally great number of
   the fallen angels and saved men, it is really cancelled by Anselm. Yet
   he was himself not quite sure of his case. See I. 18, p. 37.

   [108] I. 11: "non est aliud peccare quam non reddere deo debitum . . .
   debitum est subjectum esse voluntate deo . . .hæc est justitia sive
   rectitudo voluntatis, quæ justos facit sive rectos corde, i.e.,
   voluntate, hic est solus et totus honor quem debemus deo . . .hunc
   honorem debitum qui deo non reddit, aufert deo quod suum est et deum
   exhonorat, et hoc est peccare."

   [109] I. II: "non sufficit solummodo reddere quod ablatum est, sed pro
   contumelia illata plus debet reddere, quam abstulit, sicut enim qui
   lædit salutem alterius, non sufficit si salutem restituit, nisi pro
   illata doloris injuria recompenset aliquid, ita qui honorem alicujus
   violat, non sufficit honorem reddere, si non secundum exhonorationis
   factam molestiam aliquid, quod placeat illi quem exhonoravit,
   restituit. Hoc quoque attendendum, quod cum aliquis quod injuste
   abstulit solvit, hoc debet dare, quod ab illo non posset exigi, si
   alienum non rapuisset."

   [110] I. 11 fin.

   [111] I. 12.

   [112] I. 13, see above, p. 56, note 3.

   [113] I. 14: "deum impossibile est honorem suum perdere: aut enim
   peccator sponte solvit quod debet aut deus ab invito accipit."

   [114] I. 15.

   [115] In II. 4, it is said indeed (cf. I. 4): "Si nihil pretiosius
   agnoscimr deus fecisse quam rationalem naturam ad gaudendum de se,
   valde alienum est ab eo, ut ullam rationalem naturam penitus perire
   sinat." I. 25, p. 52.

   [116] I. 19.

   [117] I. 19: The Interlocutor says: "Quid est, quod dicimus deo:
   dimitte nobis debita nostra, et omnis gens orat deum quem credit, ut
   dimittat sibi peccata? Si enim solvimus quod debemus, cur oramus ut
   dimittat? Numquid deus injustus est, ut iterum exigat quod solutum est?
   Si autem non solvimus, cur frustra oramus, ut faciat quod, quia non
   convenit, facere non potest?" To this Anselm replies: "Qui non solvit,
   frustra dicit: dimitte; qui autem solvit, supplicat, quoniam hoc ipsum
   pertinet ad solutionem ut supplicet; nam deus nulli quicquam debet, sed
   omnis creatura illi debet; et ideo non expedit homini, ut agat cum deo,
   quemadmodum par cum pari." Unfortunately Anselm has forgotten this last
   thought in his exposition elsewhere.

   [118] See above, p. 60, note 3.

   [119] I. 20.

   [120] See the exposition in I. 21. Because every sin is committed
   contra voluntatem dei, it is greater than the value of the world --
   infinitely great. Further (I. 22), because man in paradise preferred
   the devil to God, it is "contra honorem dei, ut homo reconcilietur illi
   cum calumnia hujus contumeliæ deo irrogatæ, nisi prius honoraverit deum
   vincendo diabolum, sicut inhonoravit ilium victus a diabolo." But how
   can he do that?

   [121] I. 23.

   [122] I. 24.

   [123] I. 4, and the strongest passage, I. 25: "Si deo inconveniens est,
   hominem cum aliqua macula perducere ad hoc, ad quod ilium sine omni
   macula facit, ne aut boni incepti pænitere aut propositum implere non
   posse videatur: multo magis propter eandem inconvenientiam impossibile
   est nullum hominem ad hoc provehi, ad quo factus est." In II. 4, 5, it
   is said, indeed, that while God "nihil facit necessitate, quia nullo
   modo cogitur aut prohibetur facere aliquid," yet an inner self-willed
   necessity exists for God's carrying out His work: "necesse est, ut
   bonitas dei propter immutabilitatem suam perficiat de homine quod
   incepit, quamvis totum sit gratia bonum quod facit."

   [124] II. 6.

   [125] II. 7.

   [126] II. 8: The former, because the descendants of Adam must make
   satisfaction; the latter, because of the four ways in which God can
   create man (from man and woman [the rule], neither from man nor woman
   [Adam], from man alone [Eve], from woman alone), the fourth had not yet
   occurred. But that it must he a virgin, if it was to be a woman, "non
   opus est disputare." Here is a piece of Schoiasticsm in the strictest
   sense of the term, and this kind of proof is continued in the following
   chapter, where it is shown that it had to be the second person of the
   Trinity who became man, because otherwise the predicates in the Trinity
   would have been destroyed, and for other equally cogent reasons ("duo
   nepotes essent in trinitate, quia, si pater incarnatus esset, esset
   nepos parentum virginis per hominem assumptum, et verbum cum nihil
   habeat de homine, nepos tamen esset virginis, quia filii ejus erit
   filius" II. 9). Here, besides, there is a working everywhere with
   "mundius," "honestius," in short, with relative notions.

   [127] The prolix demonstration here in II. 10, 11 and 16 ff. shows that
   Anselm did not understand how to make this point quite "rational."

   [128] II. 11. In II. 12, 13 further allied questions are discussed. The
   God-man was not "miser," although he took the incommoda on himself; he
   was omniscient, because otherwise he would not have been perfectly good
   (!).

   [129] II. 14: "Si omne bonum tam bonum est, quam mala est ejus
   destructio (!), plus est bonum incomparabiliter quam sint ea peccata
   mala, quæ sine æstimatione superat ejus interremptio . . .tantum bonum
   tam amabile potest sufficere ad solvendum quod debetur pro peccatis
   totius mundi, immo plus potest in infinitum (II. 17 fin.: plus in
   infinitum. II. 20: "pretium majus omni debito") . . .si ergo dare vitam
   est mortem accipere (!), sicut datio hujus vitæ prævalet omnibus
   hominum peccatis, ita et acceptio mortis." The question is next
   discussed, whether the death of Christ can be of advantage even to His
   enemies who crucified Him (II. 15: the question is answered
   affirmatively; for they acted in ignorance), then how Christ could be
   sinless (II. 16), for although He was conceived "absque carnalis
   delectationis peccato" -- the sexual appetite is, after Augustine,
   original sin -- yet Mary was not sinless. This question is discussed
   with much prolixity. Anselm was apparently at a loss for a rational
   solution. In the end, though with uncertainty, he offers the
   explanation, that in prospect of the future effect of the work of
   Christ, Mary was purified from her sins before her birth, i.e., God
   purified her. After this the question of the voluntariness of the death
   of Christ is again discussed; for if Mary was only purified in view of
   His death, while He needed a purified mother, it was necessary that He
   should die. This question again occupies a very large space, and is
   only solved by a subtle dialectic, which in the end cannot do without
   the support of the proposition, "ad hoc valuit in Christo diversitas
   naturarum . . .ut quod opus erat fieri ad hominum restaurationem si
   humana non posset natura, faceret divina, et si divinæ minime
   conveniret, exhiberet humana" (II. 17, p. 85).

   [130] This thought is dropped into the course of the discussion, II.
   18.

   [131] II. 18.

   [132] II. 19: "intueamur nunc prout possumus, quanta inde ratione
   sequatur humana salvatio." The Interlocutor: "ad hoc tendit cor meum."

   [133] II. 19: "eum autem qui tantum donum sponte dat deo, sine
   retributione debere esse non judicabis . . .alioquin aut injustus (!)
   videretur esse si nollet, aut impotens si non posset."

   [138] II. 22.

   [139] The theory of a vicarious penal suffering is to he found, along
   with the theory of ransom of men from the devil, in Athanasius, see
   Vol. III. p. 308 of this work.

   [140] Whether indeed what Anselm offered as a substitute was in every
   respect better, or was not rather worse, will appear below.

   [141] A noteworthy passage already in Tertullian (de jejun. 3): "homo
   per eandem materiam causæ deo satisfacere debet, per quam offenderat."

   [142] The keen criticism which the present-day Catholics apply to
   Anselm's theory (see Schwane, pp. 296 ff.) rests, on the contrary, on
   the strong Scotist antipathy to unconditional necessity.

   [143] See Ritschl 1.c. I., pp, 44 f.

   [144] See Ritschl I., pp. 43 f.

   [145] Hence also the feeling in relation to Christ is quite different
   among the Latins from what it is among the Greeks. The latter look for
   the most part to the God in Christ, the former to the man. Ritschl has
   (p. 47) pointed out the remarkable, though by no means solitary,
   passage in Anselm's Meditations (12): "Certe nescio, quia non plene
   comprehendere valeo, unde hoc est, quod longe dulcior es in corde
   diligentis te in eo quad caro es, quam in eo quod verbum: dulcior in
   eo, quod humilis, quam in eo quod sublimis . . . Hæc omnia (the human)
   formant et adaugent magis ac magis exsultationem, fiduciam et
   consolationem, amorem ac desiderium."

   [146] Very correct statement by Bigg, The Christian Platonists of
   Alex., p. 290: "It was reserved for Anselm, centuries afterwards, to
   array the justice against the goodness of God, and thus to complete the
   resemblance of Christianity to its ancient deadly foe" (namely,
   Gnosticism). Only, Gnosticism distinguished between the just God (the
   demiurge) and the good God as two hostile deities. But the old
   patristic theory was that by His death Christ has redeemed men from the
   devil. If we isolate the death from the life of Christ, this is in fact
   the best theory, for it brings no discord into the deity. It was no
   doubt a step of progress on Anselm's part that he wished to carry
   through the thought that God is at the same time holy and merciful. But
   this thought cannot be carried through by means of the death of Christ
   as isolated, and thought of as satisfaction, if this is held as
   satisfaction to God Himself. So it is always better to let the
   satisfaction be paid to the devil, because even on that assumption the
   idea of righteousness is satisfied -- in a mythological way, no doubt
   (the right view would be, that justice must he done to evil, namely by
   penalty) -- without Christ the merciful and God the wrathful being
   brought into conflict, while Christ is nevertheless regarded as Himself
   God. That the latter is an impracticable thought was clearly seen,
   moreover, by Augustine, after he had weighed its possibility. Bigg
   points to de trinit. XIII. 11: "Sed quid est justificati in sanguine
   ipsius? Quæ vis est sanguinis hujus, obsecro, ut in eo justificentur
   credentes? Et quid est reconciliati per mortem filii ejus? Itane vero,
   cum irasceretur nobis deus pater, vidit mortem filii sui pro nobis et
   placatus est nobis?" This cannot be; "for omnia simul et pater et
   filius et amborum spiritus pariter et concorditer operantur." He
   therefore rejects the Anselmic theory in anticipation. This theory can
   only be explained from the fact that the thought of God as the Father
   who is nigh to us had fallen into the background in the Middle Ages,
   and the old view of the Trinity as unity was no longer held. Here too,
   therefore, the ancient traditional dogma was discarded, the term
   Trinity retained.

   [147] In Constantinople the Synods from the year 1156 f. decided, that
   the mass is offered also to the Son, as He is at the same time the
   offerer and the offered, and the Trinity admits of no diremption. See
   Hefele V.2, p. 567.

   [148] That Anselm himself, however, has, in other writings, carried
   through other thoughts with regard to redemption has been shown by
   Ritschl, l.c. I., pp. 46 f., 109. He surrendered himself to the
   certainty of grace even without such calculations, on the other hand
   emphasised more strongly the conception of merit.

   [149] See Ritschl, l.c. I., pp. 48 ff.; Schwane, pp. 304 ff.; Deutsch,
   Abälard, pp. 336 ff.; Seeberg in the "Mittheil. u. Nachricht. f. die
   ev. K. in Russland," 1888, March-April. Also Reuter in his 1st, and
   especially Bach in his 2nd, vol., pp. 68 f., 77 f., 88 ff.

   [150] So a disciple of Abelard, who hit upon his meaning; see Seeberg,
   p. 7, and Deutsch, p. 378 ff.

   [151] I do not transcribe here the passages, for in their isolation
   they do not give a true view. There fall to he considered more
   particularly several passages from the Exposit. ep. Rom. (especially on
   chap. III. 22 ff., V. 12 ff.), from the Sermons V., X., XII., theolog.
   christ. IV., and the Dialogue. How much Abelard's whole Christology and
   doctrine of redemption are dominated by the thought of love and counter
   love, how entirely love is "merit," could not be ascertained from
   separate quotations.

   [152] Deutsch says very correctly, p. 382: "Accordingly the ultimate
   and deepest thought of Abelard is this, that reconciliation rests on
   personal fellowship with Christ. It is He who, by perfectly fulfilling
   the will of God as man, realised the divine destination of humanity, in
   this sense satisfied God, and thereby opened again to mankind the
   closed gates of paradise. He who belongs to Him has through Him the
   forgiveness of sins, and with Him access to God, but at the same time
   also the power of the new life, in which he fulfils the commands of God
   from love; and so far as this fulfilment is still imperfect the
   righteousness of God comes in to complete it." On the other hand Reuter
   (I., p. 243) has given this perverted view of Abelard's doctrine: "For
   one who wrought reconciliation, there was substituted one who
   proclaimed that God was already reconciled [but according to Abelard
   Christ is no "proclaimer," and God is not reconciled, if we are not];
   instead of a passion of the Son, who alone opens again the way to the
   Father [but that is just Abelard's meaning], a martyrdom with
   psychological efficacy was held up to view [the word "psychological" is
   here meant to create an impression of the profane, but we have surely
   only the choice between this and physico-chemical]; instead of change
   of disposition on God's part, change of disposition on man's was spoken
   of." [Is God love or is He of alienated mood? Is it not the penalty for
   man that as a sinner he must think of a God of terror, and can anything
   greater take place in heaven or earth than when a man's feelings are
   revolutionised, i.e., when his fear of a God of terror is transformed
   into trust and love? If it were possible to bring home to the sinner
   the thought of the loving God, in whom he can have confidence, while he
   feels himself guilty, then certainly Christ would have died in vain;
   but that is a contradictio in adjecto.] Even Seeberg, in spite of all
   his efforts to be impartial, has made a nationalistic caricature of
   Abelard's doctrine, and in keeping with this has much bepraised sayings
   of Bernard, some of which are to he found also in Abelard, some of
   which Abelard has happily set aside (the justa potestas diaboli). That
   which we really miss in Abelard -- that Christ bore our penalty -- is
   also wanting in Bernard, and the "example" of Christ is much more
   incautiously emphasised by the latter than by the former, who always
   thinks of the power of love that proceeds from Christ. But Bernard, it
   is alleged, stands much higher than Abelard, because he can give a more
   lyrical expression to the impassioned love to Christ, while Abelard
   thinks only of the doctrine and the example (!), and because, it is
   asserted, something "objective" is to be found in him which is supposed
   to be wanting in Abelard. Even according to Seeberg, indeed, this
   "objective" is quite falsely defined by Bernard, but that is of no
   consequence, if only there is "something" there. When will there be a
   getting rid in Protestantism of this "something," which at best only
   establishes the possibility of redemption; and when will there be a
   distinguishing between a vicarious penal suffering and a satisfaction
   demanded by God?

   [153] See Bach II., pp. 88-122. Besides Bernard, William of St. Thierry
   specially comes into view here.

   [154] Sentent. lib. III., dist. 18, 19.

   [155] Ritschl I., p. 56 f.

   [156] This was not without ground; for apart from the objective
   redemption which consists in deliverance from the fetters of the devil
   (yet even to this a subjective turn is given, see Sentent. III. Dist.
   19 A: "si ergo recte fidei intuitu in ilium respicimus qui pro nobis
   pependit in ligno, a vinculis diaboli solvimur, i.e., a peccatis, et
   ita a diabolo liberamur, ut nec post hanc vitam in nobis inveniat quod
   puniat. Morte quippe sua, uno verissimo sacrificio, quidquid culparum
   erat, unde nos diabolus ad luenda supplicia detinebat, Christus
   exstinxit, ut in hac vita tentando nobis non prævaleat") the Lombard
   knows only of a subjective redemption; l.c. "quo modo a peccatis per
   Christi mortem soluti sumus? Quia per ejus mortem, ut ait apostolus,
   commendatur nobis caritas dei, i.e., apparet eximia et commendabilis
   caritas dei erga nos in hoc, quod filium suum tradidit in mortem pro
   nobis peccatoribus. Exhibita autem tantæ erga nos dilectionis arrha, et
   nos movemur accendimurque ad diligendum deum, qui pro nobis tanta
   fecit, et per hoc justificamur, i.e., soluti a peccatis justi
   efficimur. Mors ergo Christi nos justificat, dum per eam caritas
   excitatur in cordibus nostris." Yet along with this the other turn of
   thought is found: "dicimur quoque et aliter per mortem Christi
   justificati, quia per fidem mortis ejus a peccatis mundamur." But his
   thought is not further followed out; on the contrary, it is said again
   Dist. 19 F: "reconciliati sumus deo, ut ait apostolus, per mortem
   christi. Quod non sic intelligendum est quasi nos sic reconciliaverit
   Christus, ut inciperet amare quos oderat, sicut reconciliatur inimicus
   inimico, ut deinde sint amici qui ante se oderant, sed jam nos
   diligenti deo reconciliati sumus; non enim ex quo ei reconciliati sumus
   per sanguinem filii nos coepit diligere, sed ante mundum, priusquam nos
   aliquid essemus. Quomodo ergo nos diligenti deo sumus reconciliati?
   Propter peccatum cum eo habebamus inimicitias, qui habebat erga nos
   caritatem, etiam cum inimicitias exercebamus adversus eum operando
   iniquitatem. Ita ergo inimici eramus deo, sicut justitiæ sunt inimica
   peccata et ideo dimissis peccatis tales inimicitiæ finiuntur, et
   reconciliamur justo quos ipse justificat. Christus ergo dicitur
   mediator, eo quod medius inter deum et homines ipsos reconciliat deo."
   But here again another thought comes in, when the Lombard immediately
   continues: "reconciliat autem dum offendicula hominum tollit ab oculis
   dei, id est dum peccata delet quibus deus offendebatur et nos inimici
   ejus eramus." The prevading thought of the awakening of counter love,
   which the Lombard took over from Abelard, is already to be found in
   Augustine; see e.g., de catech. rud. 4: "Nulla est major ad amorem
   invitatio, quam prævenire amando, et nimis durus est animus, qui
   dilectionem si nolebat impendere, nolit rependere."

CHAPTER II.

  HISTORY OF DOGMA IN THE PERIOD OF THE MENDICANT ORDERS, TILL THE BEGINNING OF
  THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.

   If in this chapter we again direct our attention in the first instance
   to the history of ecclesiastical piety, of ecclesiastical law and of
   ecclesiastical science, it is less with the view of understanding the
   changes which dogma passed through in this period, than in order to
   show how the conditions under which it stood served to make it ever
   more stable and to protect it from all attack. It must, above all, be
   shown how it was possible that the enormous revolution of the sixteenth
   century -- keeping out of view the Anabaptist movements -- stayed its
   course before the old dogma. This can only be understood, however, when
   we consider what confirmations dogma received from the thirteenth to
   the fifteenth century. These confirmations were a consequence of the
   peculiar history of piety, of ecclesiastical law and of science in this
   period. All of these sought, not for an "unmoved mover" in the
   background -- for dogma was simply no longer a "mover" -- but for an
   immovable basis. Mysticism, the development of ecclesiastical law,
   Nominalist theology -- all of them could only develop themselves on the
   basis of an authoritative dogma, or, say, could only protect themselves
   on that basis against dangerous consequences.

   It is only in the second place that there fall to be considered how far
   the general conditions produced also certain changes in dogma, then how
   far an individual piety developed itself, how from this piety the need
   for individual certainty of salvation arose, and how this need gathered
   itself into a mighty force. Of itself the force was strong enough to
   demand, and to carry out, a revision of the entire ecclesiastical
   tradition. But it will appear in the last Book (see below) that it was
   impeded in its unfolding by the still greater power of a fifteen
   century long development.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. On the History of Piety.

   What was germinating in the twelfth century, the century of the
   Crusades -- namely, the piety of which Bernard was the subject and
   delineator, which derives its power from humility before God and from
   love to the sorely suffering Redeemer -- opened into blossom in the
   holy beggar of Assisi, and "its fragrance filled the world." In Francis
   mediæval piety attained its clearest and most forcible expression. In
   him it uttered itself most simply, and therefore most powerfully and
   most impressively, because its chord -- "humility, love and obedience"
   -- was here struck with the greatest purity, while the quality of tone
   which Francis lent to it was the most melting. [157]

   Humility -- that is entire poverty. The reverence for that which is
   beneath us, which Bernard and his followers proclaimed, admits of no
   other robe than that of perfect poverty and humility. Long ago no
   doubt, nay, on from the beginning, Greek monks had striven after this
   ideal; but in their hands it became a torch, which consumed, along with
   the body, the imagination also, the powers of perception, and the
   wealth of the inner life. It was to be the means of emancipation from
   the body; but often enough it made a wilderness of the spirit. Here, on
   the other hand, it is the imitation of the poor life of Jesus, and
   while it thus acquired a personal ideal, it also developed out of
   itself, in the inexhaustibly fresh imagination of St. Francis, a wealth
   of intuitions from which all provinces of the outer and inner life
   derived profit. A spirited investigator has shown us what effects were
   produced by St. Francis in the field of art. [158] But in all spheres
   of human life, even including that of strict science, the new impulse
   took effect -- the godly fear which gives honour to God alone, the
   living view of Christ, which brought the personal into the foreground,
   the holy simplicity which shed its light into the heart and over the
   world. In the sunny soul of the sacred singer of Assisi, the troubadour
   of God ("joculator domini") and of poverty, the world mirrored itself,
   not as merely the struggle for existence, or the realm of the devil,
   but as the paradise of God with our brothers and sisters, the sun, the
   moon and the stars, the wind and the water, the flowers and the living
   creatures. In poverty, which is nothing else but sister of the humility
   by which the soul becomes like the eye, which sees everything save only
   itself, a new organ was obtained for contemplating God and the world.
   But poverty is not only imitation of the poor life of Jesus, it is
   also, nay pre-eminently, imitation of the apostolic life, the life
   without care, of "the pilgrim preacher and herald of love." The oldest
   rule of St. Francis presented this ideal with the utmost clearness, and
   created the joyous, devout Franciscan "family." [159]

   With the spirit of which poverty and humility are the evidence, love
   must unite itself. Going forth in pairs, the new Apostles must serve in
   lowly love; there is no work for which they must hold themselves too
   feeble; "for the love of Jesus Christ" they must "expose themselves to
   enemies, both visible and invisible"; according to the Sermon on the
   Mount, they must willingly suffer wrong; above all, wherever they come,
   in house and hall, they must render to men the loving service of
   preaching repentance, must deliver the message: "fear ye and honour,
   praise and bless, thank and adore, the Lord God omnipotent in trinity
   and unity . . .be of penitent heart, bring forth fruits meet for
   repentance, for know ye that we shall soon die. Give and it shall be
   given you, forgive and ye shall be forgiven, and if ye forgive not, the
   Lord will not forgive you your trespasses. Blessed are they who die in
   penitence, for they shall be in the Kingdom of Heaven," etc. [160] But
   the power of this love had its source in the example of Christ and of
   His devoted disciple, St. Francis, who reproduced ever more deeply in
   his experience the life and suffering of his Master. More and more his
   feelings became merged in one alone -- in love. This feeling, which in
   him was so strong that it often overpowered him, so that he was forced
   to retire to lonely churches and forests to give it full vent, was love
   to Christ; but it wedded itself ever more closely to unlimited devotion
   to his neighbour, to concern for his spiritual and bodily well-being,
   to warm compassion and self-abasement in the service of his brethren.
   So out of humility and love he made of his life a poem -- he, the
   greatest poet who then lived; for, after fiery conflicts, the sensuous
   element in his ardent nature appeared -- not destroyed, but subdued and
   glorified, nay, transformed into the purest organ of the soul's life.
   [161]

   A great work of home missions was not contemplated by St. Francis, but
   begun; he was not the first to undertake it, but he was the first
   through whom the whole Church derived benefit from it: Christendom has
   certainly the right faith; but it is not what it ought to be. It is
   subject to priests and sacraments; but now the individual must be dealt
   with. He must be laid hold of, and guided to repentance. The gospel
   must be brought home to every man: the world must be again shaken, and
   rescued from its old ways, by a mighty call to repentance: he who has
   tasted the sweetness of the love of Christ will turn with gladness to
   repentance and poverty. Yet it is not for the monks and priests alone
   that there must be concern, but for individual Christians, for the
   laity; they, likewise, must be won for a penitent and holy life. The
   "Brothers of Penitence," of whom St. Francis formed visions, and whom
   he brought into existence, were, in spite of their continuing in family
   life, really ascetics, who were required to maintain strict separation
   from the world and from civic life, and, above all, to take no part in
   military service. The great saint had not yet made terms with the
   world; the later Tertiaries were as little his creation as the later
   Franciscans. [162]

   From the monks to the secular priests, from the secular priests to the
   laity -- this was the course by which Christianity was to be delivered
   from secularity; it is at the same time the history of the awakening of
   religious individualism in the West. And in the measure in which
   religion became, extensively and intensively, more world-renouncing, it
   acquired (paradoxical, it may seem, but intelligible enough) a higher
   social and political importance, penetrated more deeply into the life
   of the people, and developed itself out of the aristocratic form (in
   which, as Roman, it had come to the barbarian nations) into a form that
   was popularly social. [163] The further the monachising proceeded, the
   more did the virtuosi in religion see themselves compelled to engage in
   practical tasks. When the new factor of apostolic life was introduced
   into the ideal of poverty and ascetic self-denial, the ideal acquired
   an enormous immanent power for propagandism, a power such as monachism
   had never before possessed, and which does not belong -- either
   formerly or now -- to its distinctive nature. Where "apostolic life"
   becomes the watchword, there monachism is at once seen to apply itself
   to positive work among the people. In the eleventh and twelfth
   centuries what engaged attention was the great political problem of
   releasing Church from State; the question was, how to break down the
   great forces, the power of the Princes, the power of purely secular
   national bishops, in short, the title to exist of all unpliant
   political factors. At the close of the twelfth, and in the thirteenth
   centuries, there followed immediately upon this undertaking the
   positive evangelising of; and giving ecclesiastical character to, all
   relationships, to the whole of civilisation and the individual life,
   this being done under the dominating idea of the apostolical.
   Monachism, as apostolic life, entered upon this new work as formerly in
   the days of Clugny it entered upon the work of freeing Church from
   State. And how powerfully did religious individualism assert itself in
   Francis, when he ventured to place before himself and his disciples the
   example of the Apostles, and did not hesitate to say to the brothers
   that they could, and should, be what the Apostles once were, and that
   to them everything that Christ had said to the Apostles applied!

   He was not the first who awakened this "apostolic life." We know of
   powerful phenomena in the twelfth century in which the new impulse had
   already found expression. [164] But these older movements, tenaciously
   as they survived (and to some extent survived as Catholic, in spite of
   being condemned), came too early; the clergy were not yet strong and
   matured enough to tolerate them, and, besides, there was lacking to
   them the element of unconditional submission to the Church, or more
   exactly, to the secular clergy, and of renunciation on principle of
   criticism of the Church. [165]

   For this is the third element in the piety of St. Francis -- childlike
   confidence in the Church and unconditional obedience to the secular
   clergy. "Let all the Brethren," so it runs in the Rule of 1209, "be
   Catholics, live and speak as Catholics . . . and let us regard the
   clergy and all religious persons as masters in those things which
   relate to the salvation of the soul, and do not deflect from our
   religion, let us reverence in the Lord both their rank (ordinem) and
   their office and their administration." (See the Rule of 1221, c. 19).
   [166] That a nature like St Francis felt oppressed by nothing external,
   if only free scope was given him for his ideal, [167] that he could
   maintain his inner freedom and pure cheerfulness of soul, even under
   quite other burdens than the Church then imposed, that he must have
   emptied himself of his very essence if he had undertaken to "abolish"
   anything, are things that are manifest. For him, obedience to all
   existing ordinances was as much a need as humility, and never assuredly
   did the shadow of a sceptical reflection as to whether the hierarchy
   was as it should be, or as to whether it should exist at all, fall upon
   the soul of this pure fool. But how could it fail to come about that
   the ideal of poverty and the ideal of obedience should come into
   conflict? We cannot here unfold the history of St. Francis and of the
   Minorite Order. It is well known against what mistrust he had to
   contend on the part of the secular clergy (even the curia), especially
   in France (but even on the part of the older Orders), and how the
   conditions reproduced themselves here which we have observed at the
   establishment of monachism in the end of the fourth, and beginning of
   the fifth, centuries, as well as in connection with the Cluniacensian
   reform in the West. It is well known also that "poverty" was the great
   theme in the history of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; that
   there was as much stubborn and passionate controversy over it as in the
   fourth and fifth centuries over the natures of Christ, and that in this
   controversy as artful and clever formula made their appearance as at
   Chalcedon and Constantinople. For thousands, the controversy about
   poverty was a controversy about the gospel itself. By this conflict the
   formulæ of the old dogmatic were little or in no way touched; but they,
   so to speak, sank into the ground. The question about the nature of the
   gospel was narrowed down to a practical question about life-conduct.
   Even when we keep out of view the pedantic mode of treatment, the way
   of stating the question appears to us strangely inadequate. Yet
   "poverty," certainly, was only the final expression for the whole sum
   of the virtues involved in imitating Christ. What the watchword
   "poverty" denoted was an immense step of advance from dead faith, and
   from a barren service of ceremonies and works to spiritual freedom in
   religion, and to an earnest personal Christianity. The new Order soon
   broke up into different sections. In the one principal section, the
   last to submit, it certainly wrought invaluable results in the first
   generations of its existence. Its preaching kindled an earnest
   Christian life, indeed in many regions it was the first thing that
   produced an individual Christianity at all among the laity -- so was it
   in Germany. Yet as everything was brought by it into closest connection
   with the confessional, the sacraments and the Pope, as all greater
   freedom was repressed as sectarianism, or crushed out -- just by the
   Mendicant Orders -- only an inferior kind of existence was allowed to
   this individual piety of the laity. For what the Minorites were obliged
   to sacrifice to the hierarchy -- it was nothing less than the chief
   part of their original ideal, only the shadow remaining -- they, so to
   speak, indemnified their conscience by the unparalleled energy with
   which they served the Church in its plans for ruling the world, and won
   for it the interest and allegiance of the laity. Here, at this final
   stage, therefore, the enemy the Church had in her own midst was once
   more vanquished; the enormous force of world-forsaking Christianity,
   which threatened the political supremacy of the Church, became visibly
   her servant; the "exempted" Order became, along with the Order of
   Preachers, her surest support.

   But in other sections the obedience was not powerful enough to control
   that force. [168] "Poverty" turned itself against the rich and worldly
   Church, and when there was to be threatening and forced silence, it
   threw off restraint. It called upon the Church to serve; it united
   itself with the old apocalyptic ideas, that had already been long
   exercising their power in secret; it adopted the critical attitude of
   the "Lombard Poor"; it joined hands readily with the new social, and
   even the new territorial, ideas, the conceptions that were taking shape
   of the inherent rights of nations and individuals, of States and
   Princes. [169] While it declared the Church to be Babylon, and
   hierarchy Anti-Christ, it was not fastidious about its partnership. It
   left the dogmatic of the Church unassailed; but against the Church
   itself it declared war, an undertaking so full of contradiction that it
   was only possible in the Middle Ages, the period of contradictions and
   illusions; for did not this Church possess in its system of dogma the
   surest and most definite title for its existence? Only in one branch
   (the Fraticelli) did the contradiction become so radical that the
   fences dividing from the heretical sects (Apostolic Brethren, Beghards)
   became frail.

   From these last-mentioned sections nothing permanent developed itself.
   [170] . The importance for universal history of the vast movement of
   the Mendicant Orders is not to be seen at all in new doctrines or
   institutions, though these were not entirely wanting, but lies rather
   in the religious awakening that was produced by them during a period of
   150 or -- if a time of slackened effort on the part of the Orders is
   overlooked -- of 300 years. "The individual began to reflect on the
   saving truths of the Christian religion, to enter himself into a
   personal relation to them." That is the highest significance of the
   Mendicant Order movement. In this sense the Orders were a prior stage
   of the Reformation. But when religion passed into the circles of the
   laity, and independent religious life was awakened there, it was a
   natural result that redoubled vigilance should be exercised lest the
   old dogma should be injured. So long as dogma is in the hands of
   priests and theologians, it can maintain a certain freedom; this is
   here natural to it, indeed. But as soon as the laity become
   thoughtfully interested in ecclesiastical Christianity, dogma becomes
   extraordinarily sensitive. Those who are entrusted with the care of the
   religio publica must--as the Mendicant Orders did -- guard it with
   jealousy, if the result of the general interest is not to be a general
   running wild of religious speculation. The criterion of what is firmly
   fixed ecclesiastically must everywhere be applied without hesitation,
   especially if the Church practice of the present is to be corrected. On
   the other hand, the ecclesiastically pious laymen themselves demand
   that the dogma shall continue as a rocher de bronze, and they feel
   every movement or alteration of it to be an injury to their personal
   Christianity. This was the situation that was always becoming more
   firmly established in the three centuries before the Reformation. The
   larger the number grew of those who sought to become really familiar
   with religion, the larger became also the number of sectaries of all
   kinds; but the more inviolable also did dogma appear to the
   ecclesiastically faithful, and the greater were the efforts of the
   hierarchy to put down all "heresy." Besides, dogma had come from the
   beginning, and indeed chiefly, to the mediæval nations, as a series of
   legal ordinances. This character it must retain, all the more if the
   spiritual life had a more vigorous and manifold development; otherwise
   the unity of the Church was lost. There must at least be an imperative
   demand for fides implicita, i.e., for respectful obedience. Thus the
   awakening, which in Germany seems to have gone on continually
   increasing from the middle of the thirteenth century, contributed to
   maintain the unalterable character of dogma. Ideally dogma had always
   been immutable; but now to the reality of this unchangeable thing there
   attached itself a profoundly practical interest.

   The history of piety in the centuries immediately preceding the
   Reformation consists of a series of sermons on repentance and of
   revivals, of reforms with a view to a deepening of spiritual life that
   was to extend through the whole of Christendom. Only in its leading
   points have we to take a survey of it. What comes first under our
   notice here is the alliance of the Mendicant Orders with Mysticism.

   By Mysticism, as has been explained above, there is to be understood
   nothing but theological piety (contemplation), having a reflex aim,
   modelled on Augustine and the Areopagite, and fertilised (though not
   thoroughly) by Bernardine devotion to Christ. That this theology should
   have been found congenial to the temper of the Mendicant Monks, as soon
   as they at all took to do with theology, is easily understood.
   Bonaventura, Albertus, and Thomas Aquinas were the greatest Mystics,
   not although, but because, they were theologians and Mendicant Monks.
   [171] . The same is true of David of Augsburg and Theodoric of
   Freiburg. Widely-extended investigations have been instituted with the
   view of classifying the Mystics, and it has been thought possible to
   distinguish between a Scholastic, a Romanic, and a German, a Catholic,
   an Evangelical, and a Pantheistic Mysticism. But at bottom the
   distinctions are without importance. Mysticism is always the same;
   above all there are no national or confessional distinctions in it. The
   differences never have to do with its essence, but only either with the
   degree, the way and the energy with which it is applied, or with its
   being predominantly directed upon the intellect or upon the will. Even
   as regards this last point it is only a question of difference of
   degree, and, at the same time, this last-mentioned distinction shows
   again very plainly the complete alliance of Mysticism with objective
   theology; for it is from this alliance that distinction springs.
   Mysticism is Catholic piety in general, so far as this piety is not
   merely ecclesiastical obedience, that is, fides implicita Just for that
   reason Mysticism is not one form among others of pre-reformation piety
   -- perhaps the latent evangelical -- but is the Catholic expression of
   individual piety in general. The Reformation element that is ascribed
   to it lies here simply in this, that Mysticism, i.e., Catholic piety,
   when developed in a particular direction, is led to the discernment of
   the inherent responsibility of the soul, of which no authority can
   again deprive it; and that it is thereby, at the same time, brought
   face to face with the question of the certitudo salutis (assurance of
   salvation), a question which can never again pass out of its view till
   it is solved in the act of faith. But where that question is
   determined, Mysticism points beyond itself; for the entire scheme of
   thought in which it moves always admits only of a perpetually
   increasing approach to the Deity, and never allows the constant feeling
   of a sure possession to arise. That, as a Christian, one must always be
   growing, was rightly discerned by the Catholic piety; but it never
   arrived at a clear and peaceful vision of the truth, that this growth
   can, and must, have its sure and inalienable basis in firm confidence
   in the God of grace, that is, in salvation. As for Catholic
   Christianity to-day, the Evangelical faith, described as "trust-faith"
   ("Fiduzglaube"), is a stumbling-block and foolishness, so also before
   the tribunal of Mediæval Mysticism it was a thing of which there was no
   understanding. For these Mystics, who framed and saw through so many
   sacred paradoxes, there was one paradox that remained hidden, namely,
   that in the spiritual life one can only become what he already is in
   faith. Only where they arrived at the discernment of this can they be
   described as precursors of the Reformation.

   If Mysticism is withdrawn from the Catholic Church and set down as
   "Protestant," then Catholicism is emptied of its character, and
   evangelical faith becomes deteriorated. Is there then to be no living
   and individual Catholic piety? But where should we have to seek it, if
   not in Mysticism? In the three centuries before the Reformation, where
   can we find even a single manifestation of truly religious life that
   had not its source in "Mysticism"? Or is Mysticism to be denied to
   Catholicism, because the latter requires, above everything else,
   devotion to the Church and the Sacraments, and because the history of
   Mysticism is the history of continual conflicts between it and
   sacramental and authoritative ecclesiasticism? But when did it become
   permissible to regard such conflicts as showing that one of the two
   factors is illegitimate? Is there not a conflict also between the
   unquestionably Catholic ideal of asceticism, and the equally
   unquestionable Catholic ideal of world supremacy? Are the great Mystics
   not the great Saints of the Church? Or shall it be held, against all
   that appears, that this Church cannot produce and tolerate independent
   piety within its own lines? Now, no Evangelical Christian, certainly,
   would ever think of confounding his delight in the warm spiritual life
   which Catholic Christianity exhibits in the centuries before the
   Reformation [172] with full approval of it, if -- one must,
   unfortunately, add it -- he had made clear to himself what evangelical
   faith is. The inability to fight one's way to such faith produces the
   craving for Mysticism which is then, as one is of course a Protestant,
   claimed for Protestantism. The fondness, it is true, for "German"
   Mysticism has received a severe check from records that have shown that
   if one is enthusiastic about Master Eckhart, etc., and derives
   edification from him, one must be still more enthusiastic about St.
   Thomas, or about the Areopagite and Augustine. But still more powerful
   checks will be needed if a view of history is to be got quit of, which
   seems the proper one to all fragmentary natures that deal in a
   dilettante way with religion, theology and philosophy -- a Mystic that
   does not become a Catholic is a dilettante. For one, what is of value
   in the Mystics is their "individualism," as if everything were already
   implied under this form; for another, it is their feeling, no matter
   what the "feeling" is for; for a third, it is the pantheistic
   metaphysic, which, without much trouble, can be abstracted from
   Mysticism; for a fourth, it is their ascetic views and their resolution
   of Christology into the Ecce Homo, or into the endless series of men
   travailing in birth with the Christ; for a fifth, it is the light of
   "illuminism" (Aufklärung) which broke forth from Mysticism. What
   historian, with clear vision, will be able to pass by these fruits of
   Mysticism without sympathy, or with amused indifference? What Christian
   will not draw with heart-felt delight from the spring of fresh
   intuitions which flows forth here? Who, as an investigator of history,
   will not readily acknowledge that an Evangelical Reformation was as
   impossible about the year 1200 as it was prepared for about the year
   1500? But if Protestantism is not at some time yet, so far as it means
   anything at all, to become entirely Mystical, it will never be possible
   to make Mysticism Protestant without flying in the face of history and
   Catholicism. [173]

   In the three pre-Reformation centuries, the individual Catholic piety,
   which we call Mysticism, had in it only the difference represented by
   varieties. It was rooted in the Neoplatonic-Augustinian view of the
   first and last things, as this has been described above, Vol. V. p. 106
   f.: God and the soul, the soul and its God , the one and the many, God
   and the creature. The soul that has departed from God must return to
   Him by purification, illumination, and essential unification; it must
   be "unformed," "formed," and "transfigured" ("entbildet," "bildet,"
   "überbildet"). With their more definite and richer vision of the
   inwardly experienced, Mediæval Saints spoke of the retirement of the
   soul within itself, of the contemplation of the outer world as a work
   of God, of the poverty and humility to which the soul must dispose
   itself, of conversion and return to God, and the school of suffering.
   But they also described the whole process in the most exact way. It
   begins with longing; there follows the renunciation of the creaturely,
   but also of al self-righteousness and all self-conceit. That is the
   purification of the soul for true Christian poverty. What the Church
   offers in the shape of means -- the Sacraments -- must be used; but all
   things must be taken up into the inner life. It is as signs of the love
   of God that they must be contemplated. And as formerly in Neoplatonism
   (cf. also Origen, and again the Areopagite) everything sensible on
   which the lustre of a sacred tradition rested, was highly esteemed as a
   sign of the eternal, and, therefore, as a means of spiritual
   exaltation, so by this piety also, sacred signs were not discarded, but
   were multiplied and increased. As the more recent investigations have
   shown us, [174] in the centuries before the Reformation a growing value
   was attached, not only to the Sacraments, but to crosses, amulets,
   relics, holy places, helpers of the needy, saints, etc. As long as what
   the soul seeks is not the rock of assurance, but means for inciting to
   piety, it will create for itself a thousand holy things. It is,
   therefore, an extremely superficial view that regards the most inward
   Mysticism and the service of idols as contradictory. The opposite view,
   rather, is correct; such piety seeks for holy signs, and clings to
   them. It can at the same time hold redemption by Christ as the supreme,
   all-embracing proof of the love of God; [175] but the sovereignty of
   Christ has not dawned upon it, because it really regards the supreme
   proof of love as the means by which the possibility of individual
   salvation is given, that is, the impulse towards imitation is
   strengthened. Just as little does the inward purification conflict with
   the sacramental, as mediated by the sacrament of penance. The Mystics
   rather, with dwindling exceptions, always directed attention, not to
   contrition merely, but to the whole confessional, and to perfect
   repentance, that is, to the sacrament of penance. After purification,
   there follows illumination. Here the Bernardine direction now comes in:
   there must be a being formed in Christ, and after Christ's image. In
   one's own experience, Christ's life of poverty and His suffering
   humanity must be reproduced, with a view to attaining to his Deity. It
   is well known how, in this direction, the tenderest training of the
   soul is combined with a distressingly sensuous presentation of the
   sufferings of the "man" Jesus. The following of Christ that is prompted
   by compassion, the imitation of Him that has its spring in love --
   these are required to a degree that can be reached only by long
   practice, and by the most anxious straining of every thought. Not
   unfrequently, this imitation then becomes changed into the idea that
   one must become a Christ one's self, must travail anew in birth with
   Christ. There were nuns, indeed, who fancied that they bore Christ in
   their womb. The highly-trained imagination, and theory, had equal parts
   in the production of this idea. The former -- inasmuch as it actually
   experienced what it passionately contemplated; the latter -- inasmuch
   as in the Neoplatonic-Augustinian tradition there was contained that
   idea of God and the spiritual creature, according to which the
   appearance of the Logos in Christ was only a special case in a long
   series; with Him the indwelling of God in man took its beginning; and,
   besides this, all love of God is something so sovereign that it does
   not admit of the intermingling of a third in the relation to which it
   gives life. But, on the other hand, this view of Christ as the first in
   a series stood in agreement again with the view of His death as an
   extraordinary event that is the basis of reconciliation with God; for,
   as this piety sacrifices no outward visible sign, so it surrenders also
   no part of the sacred history; only, it allows no weight to it at the
   highest stage. Yet, at countless times in the case of the most
   distinguished Mystics, as already in the case of St. Bernard, it is
   just at the highest stages of religious feeling that confidence in
   Christ asserts itself; for, as they derived everything from divine
   grace -- especially where the theology of St. Thomas exercised its
   influence -- so this grace is discerned in the Christ who is our
   righteousness. Further, there was added here the trinitarian
   speculation, as it was developed from the thought of love. Thus the
   piety shown by Richard of St. Victor in the earlier period, by
   Bonaventura and others in the later, was able to attach itself most
   intimately to this intractable dogma of the Trinity, and also to the
   other dogma of the Incarnation. The infinite love must be contemplated
   in the Mystery of the Trinity, and the highest point of the spirit's
   enlightenment is reached when in prayer, in knowledge, and in vision,
   man becomes absorbed in the great mystery of the union of deity and
   humanity, and contemplates the indifference of opposites (indifferentia
   oppositorum), seeing how the Creator and the creature, the lofty and
   the lowly, the being and the not-being coalesce in one. From all these
   speculations, in which the old formulas are placed in the light of
   omnipotent love, in which the boldest and most complex theology is
   finally led back to the All-One, and converted into feeling, there
   resulted an intense deepening of inner life. This inner life was again
   discovered, and there was given to it the place of central command. But
   it found much richer expression still than in the days of Neoplatonism;
   for, in those centuries before the Reformation, in conjunction with the
   most frightful self-torturing, nay in the midst of them (think of St.
   Elizabeth), and in conjunction with whimsical or insane ideas, the
   elevating power of suffering, and the purifying influence of pain, were
   proved by experience and preached. What an ennobling of feeling, and
   what a deepening of the life of the soul issued from this -- a
   Renaissance before and alongside of the Renaissance -- cannot be
   described. One must read the writings in poetry and prose, for example
   the verses of Jacopone, [176] or the treatises and sermons of the
   German Mystics, to see how even the language here underwent a
   regeneration. A lyric poetry that awakens a response in us exists only
   from the thirteenth century, and what force the Latin and German
   tongues are capable of developing in describing the inner life we have
   been taught by the Mendicant Monks. From the discernment that lowliness
   and poverty, scorn and contempt, shame and misery, suffering and death,
   are aids to the saint's progress, from the contemplation of the Man
   Jesus, from compassion, and pain, and humility, there sprang for
   Western Christianity, in the age of the Mendicant Monks, that inner
   elevation and that enrichment of feeling and of moral sensibility which
   was the condition for all that was to grow up in the time that
   followed. One speaks of the Renaissance and the Reformation, and
   comprehends in these words, taken together, the basis of our
   present-day culture; but both have a strong common root in the
   elevation of religious and æsthetic feeling in the period of the
   Mendicant Monks.

   But the Catholic character of this elevation shows itself most plainly
   in this, that with repentance, faith, and love to Christ, the process
   is not concluded: man must become entirely nothing; he must pass out of
   himself, in order, finally, to be merged into the Godhead. There is
   meant by this, certainly, the highest spiritual freedom also (see, e.g,
   the "Deutsche Theologie"); but as the freedom is enfolded in the
   metaphysical thought that God is all and the individual nothing,
   freedom can only be conceived of as absorption into the deity. He alone
   can experience this union with God who has followed the way of the
   Church, and has been an imitator of Christ. But how can the command be
   given to adhere to the historical, when all the powers of the
   imagination have been let loose, and it has been declared the organ for
   coalescing with the Godhead. The Church Mystics made earnest attempts
   to check the pantheistic, "extravagant," wild-growing piety; but they
   themselves frequently were at least incautious with their final
   directions, nay, to these the ardent application was wanting, so long
   as they had still respect to something that lay outside of God and the
   soul (even the Trinity here was felt to be something disturbing; the
   God with whom the soul has to do at this supreme height of exaltation
   is the solitary One). Thomas himself, "the normal dogmatic theologian,"
   gave the strongest impulse to this restoration of the most extravagant
   Mysticism. He was followed by Eckhart and others. [177] According to
   Thomas, the soul can already here on earth so receive God into itself
   that it enjoys in the fullest sense the vision (visio) of His essence.
   It itself already dwells in heaven. The earthly, that still clings to
   it, is, as it were, as unsubstantial as the earthly in the consecrated
   elements. But if the soul is capable, through rapture (per raptum), of
   such a flight from its nothingness to God, if God can enter into its
   innermost depth, then -- here is the necessary inversion of view -- the
   soul itself includes, in its innermost being, a deeply hidden divine
   element. Pantheism is transformed into self-deification. The divine is
   at bottom the capacity of the soul to abstract and emancipate itself
   from all that is phenomenal; it is the pure feeling of spiritual
   freedom and exaltedness above all that is and can be thought. In this
   feeling, which arises as an act of grace, and is only guarded by this
   co-efficient in its mood from the pride of self-assertion, the soul has
   the sense of being one with the divine Being, who, in the Catholic
   view, is Himself best described by negative definitions. In these
   negative definitions the Mediæval Mystics went much further than
   Augustine and the Areopagite. [178] We must go back to Valentinus and
   Basilides, to the Bu'thos (abyss), to the Sige' (silence) and the Ouk
   on theo's (the God that is not), to find the fitting parallels to the
   "Abysmal Substance" ("Abgründlichen Substanz"), the "Waste Deity"
   ("Wüsten Gottheit"), the "Silent Silence" ("Stillen Stillheit"). In
   this hot forcing-house of thought, religion was not really matured, but
   the Mediæval man had his sense of self-importance awakened. In the
   Thomist Mysticism, which, of course, always insists on principle that
   the essential distinction between God and man must be recognised, both
   the whole process and the supreme attainment are intellectually
   conditioned. Knowledge is the means of reaching spiritual freedom, and
   the highest state attained is nothing but the natural result of the
   absolute knowledge given in vision. Here Thomas and his disciples
   adhere strictly to Augustine, who also admitted no progress in
   religious life without advancing knowledge, and for whom the highest
   fellowship with God had also no other content than that of the visio
   dei, i.e., of essential knowledge. The contemplation that rises to
   intuition suffers thereby no qualitative change; for intuition is
   simply that form of knowledge in which every medium has fallen away, in
   which the subject, having become wholly intellect, apprehends the
   purely spiritual object, and so, also, as there is no longer any
   hindering restriction, coalesces with it. Yet in this conception of the
   contemplated end there was presupposed the Anselmic conviction, that
   all objects of faith here below can be made rational, so that the whole
   ascent to the Supreme end can take place through the intellect. Where
   this conviction, however, became uncertain, then, if the final end of
   union to God was to be held as attainable in this world, it could no
   longer be contemplated as enjoyment of God and eternal life through the
   intellect. But this latter idea was unsatisfactory also for this
   reason, that the Thomists had to admit that the end thus described
   could always be reached only per raptum, i.e., intermittently and
   seldom. Hence we see how, after the appearance of Duns Scotus, and
   after the development of Nominalism, the end is otherwise described.
   The confidence in the rationality of the objects of faith threatens to
   disappear, on the other hand the religious impulse towards constant
   supreme fellowship with God grows stronger -- therefore the enjoyment
   of God and eternal life came to be placed in the will, which, in
   general, indeed, had increased attention directed to it in Nominalist
   science. [179] Salvation consists in union of will with God, in the
   rest which the creaturely will finds in the will of God, that is, in
   surrender and repose. That this way of viewing things likewise found an
   eccentric expression was unavoidable from the monastic character of all
   Catholic piety. Yet a very marked advance was certainly made here,
   which directly prepared the way for the Reformation; for, first, piety
   was now delivered from intermixture with those speculative
   monstrosities, which really served only to stupefy simple devout
   feeling (of course the speculative philosophers will always prefer
   Thomas to Duns); second, a way was indicated by which the soul might
   attain to the feeling of constant fellowship with God. This
   "Nominalist" Mysticism tended more and more to supplant the Thornist in
   the 15th century. [180] One must give up his own will to the will of
   God. The Nominalists themselves, certainly, failed to see clearly where
   the divine will is to be sought for, and what it is, and just on that
   account much wild growth still developed itself even here. But only
   within Nominalist piety could the question about assurance of salvation
   (certitudo salutis) arise, because there was no longer a building upon
   the intellect, because the pointing to bare authority was bound, in the
   course of time, to be felt unsatisfactory, and because the problem was
   correctly stated, as being the question, namely, about the power that
   is capable of breaking self-will and leading the will to God. [181]

   This revival of piety from the thirteenth century to the fifteenth
   would not be perfectly described were not a fact, at the same time,
   strongly emphasised, which, on first view, seems very paradoxical,
   namely, the revival of a life of practical activity in the service of
   one's neighbour. We should think that where Catholic piety, i.e.,
   Mysticism, flourished, monastic contemplation and asceticism would
   repress everything else. [182] In point of fact, there was a weighty
   problem for that piety here. Yet the way in which it was solved shows
   again most distinctly that in the Mendicant Order movement we have to
   do with a reformation of the Church. This movement strengthened,
   theoretically, the old Catholic position, that the contemplative life
   is higher than the practical. But as it presents itself in St. Francis
   as a movement born of love, so also from the first, as "imitation of
   the poor life of Jesus," and as "Apostolic life," it recognised in
   loving activity the highest sphere for its exercise. In this way the
   old Monasticism was superseded, which rendered services of love only to
   the hierarchy, the princes and the papal policy, but otherwise retired
   within itself, and felt service to a poor brother to be a work of
   supererogation. It was the Mendicant Orders and their theologians who
   first gave a conspicuous place again to the command, "Love thy
   neighbour as thyself." They praised the contemplative life; they still
   continued always to maintain the distinction between it and the
   practical; but they drew this distinction in such a way that one living
   in contemplation (that is, the monk) was, nevertheless, required to
   serve his neighbour with all his powers, while the Christian occupied
   with the affairs of life, was never justified in leaving out of account
   concern for his brother. Thus there came to exist between the
   contemplative and active lives a wide neutral province, so to speak,
   which belonged to both, to the former as well as to the latter -- the
   province of self-denying love. The love of God on the part of monk and
   layman could prove its existence only in the love of one's neighbour.
   Hence it is to be understood how enthusiastic Mystics used expressions
   that sound like an exaltation of the active life above the
   contemplative; what they had in their mind was unfeigned brotherly
   love, mercy, gentleness, the spirit that returns good for evil, and
   active ministration to need. Neither their "intellectualism" nor their
   "quietism" hindered them in their powerful preaching of mercy, but
   rather strengthened them in it; for they would no longer recognise any
   monachism, or any service of God, that disregarded the service of one's
   neighbour. The obligation to make one's self every man's servant in
   love was first plainly asserted again by Francis, and after him it was
   repeatedly enforced as the highest attainment of Christian life by
   Thomas and Bonaventura, by Eckhart, Suso, Tauler, Thomas à Kempis, and
   all the hundred active witnesses to Christian piety in the centuries
   before the Reformation. [183] The simple relation of man to man,
   sanctified by the Christian command of love and by the peace of God,
   issued forth from all the traditional corporations and castes of the
   Middle Ages, and set itself to break them up. Here, also, the advent of
   a new age, in which, certainly, only a few blossoms developed into
   fruit, was brought about by the history of piety. But this piety,
   although it always continued to call more loudly for reform in the
   affairs of the Church, still remained under the ban of the idea that
   God gives grace in the measure in which a man progresses in love. How
   this state of things was to be remedied, no one had any inkling.

   In what precedes it has already been indicated several times that,
   while maintaining the line of distinction, the Mendicant Orders brought
   about inwardly (to some extent even outwardly) a mutual approximation
   of monks and laity. The activity of the former among the people on the
   one hand, and the awakening of a strong religious life among the laity
   on the other, brought them together. But it was in general the
   characteristic of the period under review, that the laity always came
   more to the front, and in the fifteenth century they took their place
   in their free religious associations alongside the monks in theirs,
   though, no doubt, as a rule, there was dependence on the monastic
   unions. The period from 1046 to 1200 was the period of the monachising
   of the priests; that from 1200 to 1500 brought the monachising of the
   laity (notice, also, the participation of women in the Mystic and
   charitable movements); but the latter process was not carried out
   without a deeply penetrating alteration of Monachism, and it is to be
   observed that the charitable element was here determinative. When, in
   spite of earnest reforms, the Mendicant Orders were now, nevertheless,
   unable (from the end of the fourteenth century) fully to recover the
   position and confidence they had once enjoyed, the free Christian
   associations came quite into the foreground. But they secured, if I see
   aright, a large measure of influence only on German soil. What they did
   for the German was done for the Romanic peoples, naturally more mobile,
   but less susceptible of abiding impressions, by the great Preachers of
   Repentance, of whom there was no lack among them at any period, from
   the time of Francis to that of Savonarola, and who, along with their
   preaching of repentance, knew also how to stir national and political
   feeling. But it was only the Anglo-Saxons and the Czechs, hitherto kept
   in subjection and poverty by other nations, who understood, at this
   period, how to derive from the Franciscan doctrine of poverty a
   politico-national and an ecclesiastical programme, and among whom a
   great movement took place, in which the rise to independent piety
   united itself with a national rise and emancipation. In both countries
   the result, certainly, did not correspond with the first steps. In
   England, the movement ran its course comparatively quickly, and in
   Bohemia deeper religious motives were unable to hold their ground
   alongside the national and political aims imperiously asserting
   themselves, and at first, at least, were overborne by motives of an
   ecclesiastical, a social revolutionary, and an anti-hierarchical
   character, though afterwards the religious element wrought its way to
   the front again.

   Any one, therefore, wishing to describe the stages in the history of
   piety during this period, must begin, by way of introduction, with a
   view of the Lyonnese, Lombard and Catholic "Poor." Then follows the
   establishment of the Mendicant Orders, who, by developing the principle
   of poverty, the apostolic life and repentance, as well as by preaching
   love (caritas) raise monachism to its highest point, and free it from
   its restrictions, but at the same time impart to it a most powerful
   influence upon the lay world. The Church succeeds in taking this
   movement into its service, in creating by means of it an interest in
   Church institutions among the aspiring lay Christianity, and in placing
   a check upon heresy. The Mendicant Orders made themselves masters of
   all the forces of the Church; above all, they developed more deeply the
   individual Mystic piety, by grasping more firmly its old fundamental
   elements, poverty and obedience, adding to these love, and gave it a
   powerful force of attraction, which united itself to the aspiring
   individualism and trained it. By urgent preaching of repentance, which
   pointed to future judgment, even the widest circles were stirred, and
   the new movement settled down, in part, into monk-like associations
   (the third Order). But the principle of "poverty" embraced not only an
   ascetically religious, but also a social and anti-hierarchical, nay,
   even a political ideal, for the neutral state could be regarded as the
   power that had to deprive the Church of her property, or, in the event
   of her being recalcitrant, to execute judgment upon her. The new
   movement united itself therefore with the apocalyptic ideas, which, in
   spite of Augustine, had never died out in the West, and which had
   received a new development from Joachim and his following. [184] Partly
   within the Order, and partly beyond it, an apocalyptic socio-political
   excitement grew up, asserting itself in a hundred different ways. Its
   relative justification over against the rich worldly hierarchy was
   furnished by the wide hold which it everywhere secured for itself: it
   made its appearance in all lands, and it continued to exist, always
   again gathering new strength, till far on in the period of the
   Reformation. In the second half of the thirteenth century the Mendicant
   Orders reached, at least in the Romanic lands, their highest point of
   influence. From that time they began to decline: after the close of the
   century the movement as a whole was broken up and distributed among the
   efforts of individual men. The great struggle about poverty in the age
   of John XXII. had, so far as it was religious, only a limited
   importance. In Germany, on the other hand, there began, from the end of
   the thirteenth century, the "German" Mystic movement, i.e., the
   introduction of the impassioned individual piety of the monastic
   theologians into the circles of the laity. For a century and more, the
   work of bringing about an inward conversion of the laity in Germany was
   carried on, and it was quite specially by Mendicant monks, chiefly
   Dominican, that this service was rendered. (David of Augsburg,
   Theodoric of Freiburg, Master Eckhart, Tauler, Merswin, the "Friends of
   God," Suso, Henry of Nördlingen, Margaret Ebner, Ruysbroek, etc.)

   While in the Romanic lands the Mendicant Orders grew weaker, and in
   Germany the religious life, still through their influence partly,
   slowly advanced, the world-ruling Church pursued a course of complete
   self-abandonment at Avignon, and seemed to have the deliberate wish to
   subject the ecclesiastical fidelity of the already imperilled piety to
   the severest test. Nay, how firmly the papacy and the Church as an
   institution still held together souls and the world is shown by the
   confusions and complaints which, when the great schism ensued, became
   still more numerous. Under the impression produced by frightful
   elemental calamities, the apocalyptic, anti-hierarchical ideas became
   the real danger, especially as even Mendicant monks were regarded as
   enemies of the papacy. But only in England did a great movement at that
   time result. The law of God, poverty, the Augustinian theology -- these
   were the dominant ideas under which Wyclif undertook his Catholic
   reform and preached to the reigning Church judgment and repentance -- a
   second Francis, of more understanding but less resolute, more cautious
   but less free. Beyond England at first no similar movement was anywhere
   to be traced; but it was everywhere apparent that the world had entered
   upon a religious age, in which the multiplicity of aspirations
   testified that the dissolution of what existed at the time was felt to
   be the signal for a new construction -- the ridicule and frivolity of
   some Italian poets and novelists of an inferior order have no claim
   whatever to be considered. In its greatest representatives, the
   Renaissance, especially the German, which was much more important in
   the realm of thought than the Italian, felt that it had outgrown
   neither the Catholic Church nor the Christian religion. What was really
   breaking up was mediæval society, mediæval institutions, the mediæval
   world. [185] So far as the Church was interwoven with this last, nay,
   constituted the chief part of it, and in this form had hitherto been
   held as holy -- a state of things on which the Mendicant Orders had
   been able to work no change -- the crisis was already prepared. But
   there was no proclaiming of separation from the Church; there was a
   seeking for means for politically reforming it (this almost alone was
   the question at the Reform Councils), and monachism also took itself
   seriously to task. [186] From the end of the fourteenth century till
   the time of the Reformation there was a continuous succession of
   efficient reforms in the older Orders and in the younger, of course on
   the basis already laid. If the signs do not mislead, the Mendicant
   Orders in particular rose higher again in the course of the fifteenth
   century and gained an always increasing influence on popular circles,
   in the Romanic lands through the occasional appearing of preachers of
   repentance, in Germany through earnest, steady work. But it is
   certainly unmistakable that all this did not yet give satisfaction and
   rest. The proof of this lies -- apart from other sectarian agitations
   -- in the fact that the Wyclifite movement, which in literary form had
   crept in among the Czechs, who were already deeply infected with
   apocalyptic excitement and Franciscan fanaticism, could strike its
   roots so deeply in Bohemia under Huss, and could occasion so terrible a
   revolution, a revolution that shook the half of Germany. From the
   confused intermingling of "religious, social, national,
   Joachim-apocalyptic, chiliastic, specifically Wyclifite and Waldensian
   tendencies, thoughts, hopes and dreams," individuals gathered out what
   appealed to them. All shades were represented, from the wild warriors
   of God, who inflicted judgment with fire and sword on the Church and on
   all despisers of divine law, to the quiet brothers, who really judged
   the Church as hardly, and clung to as utopian hopes regarding the
   adjustment of human relationships, but who were willing to wait in
   patience and quietness. In the fifteenth century the currents of all
   foregoing attempts at reform flowed together; they could converge into
   one channel; for all of them sprang originally from one source -- the
   doctrine of poverty, wedded to apocalyptic and to certain Augustinian
   thoughts, that is, Catholicism. "Silent and soft is poverty's step,"
   Jacopone had once sung in his wonderful hymn. That was truly no
   prophecy of the future.

   Even after the papacy, by an unparalleled diplomacy, had released
   itself from the oppressive requirements of the Reform Councils, when
   the nations were defrauded of the sure prospect of a reform of the
   Church, when the Popes, with their great undertaking of securing a
   sovereign state, descended to the lowest depths of degradation and
   spoke of reform with scorn, piety as a rule did not lose faith in the
   Church, but only in her representation at the time, and in her corrupt
   order. It is a mistake to conclude from the contempt for priests and
   for lazy monks to the existence of an evangelical spirit. There can
   express itself in such contempt the purest and most obedient Catholic
   piety. This piety displayed in the second half of the fifteenth century
   a strength of vigorous impulse, in some measure even a power, greater
   than ever before. And it remained immovably the old piety. It attracted
   the laity more powerfully; it became richer in good works and in the
   spirit of love; it united clergy and laity in common religious
   undertakings; it wrought for the deepening and strengthening of the
   inner life. But just on these grounds it attached higher value to
   outward signs, sought for them, increased their number, and gave itself
   up to them. One may detect in this something of unrest, of
   dissatisfaction; but we must not forget that this is just what belongs
   to Catholic piety. This piety seeks, not for a basis of rock, but for
   means of help, and even where it is most inward, and seems to have
   bidden farewell to everything external, it must confess that, openly or
   secretly, it still uses the narcotics and stimulants.

   An enormous revolution, ever again retarded, was preparing in the
   fifteenth century. But this revolution threatened institutions,
   political and ecclesiastical; threatened the Church, not its gospel,
   the new dogma-like doctrines, not the old dogma. That a reformation of
   piety in the sense of faith was preparing, is suggested by nothing
   whatever that is historically apprehensible; for the most radical
   opponents, and the most faithful supporters, of the dominant Church,
   were at one in this, that the forces for a reform of the ecclesiastical
   life were bound up in Augustine and Francis. The Church doctrines that
   became the subject of controversy were really no Church doctrines as
   yet; [187] and then again -- even the most radical Church programme had
   its strong roots, and its justifying title, in elements of the vulgar
   Church doctrine. Thus dogma remained substantially unassailed. How
   could anyone imagine, in the age of Nominalism, that the salvation by
   reform must come from doctrine, so long as the authority of the
   dogmatic tradition remained untouched? And yet, certainly, it would be
   a very childish view that would regard the Reformation as something
   absolutely new, because no direct preparatory stages of it can be
   pointed out. Individualism, the force of personal life, the
   irresistible demands for a reconstruction of civil life and social
   order, the needs of a piety always growing more restless, the distrust
   of the hierarchy, the rising consciousness of personal responsibility
   and craving for personal certainty, the conviction that Christ is in
   His Church, and yet that He is not in ecclesiasticism -- all these
   things could not have reached the ends contemplated by them without a
   Reformation, which, to outward view, appeared less radical than the
   programme of the devastating and burning Hussites, but in reality left
   that programme far behind it. And the piety, i.e., the ecclesiastical
   faith itself, had, among the manifold elements it included, the new
   element implanted within it, in the shape of words of Christ and
   doctrines of Paul, in the life displayed by every Christian who,
   through trust in the grace of God in Christ, had found inward
   deliverance from the law of grace-dispensations and merit, and from the
   law of the letter.

   Under a theology that had degenerated into a tangled brake, from the
   hundreds of new religious-ecclesiastical institutions, societies, and
   brotherhoods, from the countless forms in which the sacred was embodied
   and sought after, from the sermons and the devotional literature of all
   kinds, there was to be heard one call, distinct and ever more distinct
   -- the call to vigorous religious life, to practical Christianity, to
   the religion that is really religion. " Say unto my soul, I am thy
   salvation" -- this prayer of Augustine was the hidden force of the
   unrest among the nations, especially the Germanic, in the fifteenth
   century. Dogmatically expressed: there was a seeking for a sure
   doctrine of salvation; but one knew not himself what he sought for. The
   uncertain and hesitating questions got only uncertain and hesitating
   answers. Even at the present day we cannot escape the charm that clings
   just to such questions and answers; for they let us see into the living
   movement of the heart; but he for whom religion has become so serious a
   matter that he seeks, not for charms, but for nourishment, will not be
   inclined to exchange Luther's Smaller Catechism and his hymns for all
   the wealth, beauty, and freshness of the German devotional literature
   of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. [188]

   by M. L., 1895 R. Mariano, Francesco d'Assisi e alcuni dei suoi più
   recenti biografi. Napoli, 1896. Mariano brings a sharp, and in many
   respects well-deserved, criticism to hear on the work of Sabatier,
   which is captivatingly written and instructive, but, after the style of
   Renan, mingles confusedly past and present, religion and poetry.
   Mariano has made a substantial contribution to the estimation of St.
   Francis, by correcting the partly rhetorical, partly material,
   exaggerations of Sabatier. An excellent lecture, taking a survey of all
   the principal points, has been published recently by Hegler "Franciskus
   von Assisi und die Gründung des Franciskanerordens" (Zeitschr. f.
   Theol. u. K. 6 Bd. p. 395 ff.

   [162] See Müller, pp. 117-144. An excellent description of the aim of
   St. Francis in Werner (Duns Scotus, p. 2): "The original designs of the
   order founded by St. Francis were the restoring of the original
   Christian Apostolate, with its poverty and renunciation of the world,
   that through the force of this restoration there might be restored to
   the Church itself the apostolic spirit; the awakening in Christian
   souls everywhere of a striving after holiness and perfection; the
   keeping the example of a direct following of Christ before the eyes of
   the world as a continuous living spectacle; the comforting of all the
   suffering and wretched with the consolation of Christian mercy; and, by
   self-sacrificing devotion, the becoming all things to those spiritually
   abandoned and physically destitute."

   [163] Cf. Thode, l.c. p. 521 f.: "The beggar of Assisi is the
   representative of the third estate, the great lower mass of the people,
   in their combined upward striving towards a position self-sustained and
   independent; but at the same time also the representative of each
   individual out of this mass, as he becomes conscious of himself, and of
   his rights in relation to God and to the world. With him, and in him,
   mediæval humanity experiences the full power of the emotional force
   that dwells in each individual, and this inner experience brings with
   it a first knowledge of one's own being which emancipates itself from
   dogmatic general conceptions."

   [164] See the history of sects in the twelfth century, especially the
   Waldensian, cf. Müller, Die Waldenser und ihre einzelnen Gruppen bis
   zum Anfang des 14. Jahrhunderts (1886), and the older fundamental work
   of Dieckhoff. The ground-thought of the Waldensian movement is
   unquestionably "to imitate the apostles, and therefore to observe
   literally the instructions which the Lord gave to his wandering
   disciples in the missionary address, Matth. to. The undertaking,
   therefore, displays everywhere the same features as, thirty years
   later, the similar attempt of Francis in its initial stages:
   distribution of all property among the poor and renunciation of all
   further possessions, according to Matth. 19, 21, 29; then, the
   apostolic preaching, in constant itineracy, and the particulars as to
   apostolic garb and methods of travelling. They go two and two, without
   shoes, only sandals of wood on their feet, in simple woollen garments,
   without money. They move from place to place, seek shelter and support
   among those to whom they preach the gospel -- for the workman is worthy
   of his hire -- and despise all settled life and private householding,
   in imitation of the Son of man, who had not where to lay His head." The
   Waldensians seem to have exercised an influence on St. Francis; but as
   to how, and by what means, nothing is known. On this account it will
   always be possible to believe in an entire independence, in a
   resemblance merely in fact; but this is not probable, especially as
   relations have been ascertained between St. Francis and Southern
   France.

   [165] The "Poor" were already excommunicated by Lucius III. (1184). On
   their spread in Northern Italy, where they had precursors in the Order
   of the Humiliates, but were only brought into existence by Waldes, on
   the relation of the Lyonnese Poor to those of Lombardy, and on the
   breach between the latter and Waldes, see Muller, 1.c. pp. 11-65. The
   view that the efficacy of the Sacraments depends on the worthiness of
   the celebrator -- a revolutionary principle under then existing
   conditions -- appeared again among the Poor of Lombardy before 1211 Of
   itself the view was fitted to sever entirely the connection with the
   ancient Church, and was perhaps one of the causes of the ultimate
   breach between the Lyonnese and Lombard poor. The former were not so
   sharply opposed to the Roman Church as the latter. They did not regard
   it as Antichrist, but included it rather in the great community of the
   baptised, and recognised its administration of the Sacraments. But they
   made it a grave reproach against the Roman Church that its hierarchy
   exercised apostolic powers without adopting the apostolic life of
   poverty and homelessness (see the demand of the Didache regarding the
   qualities of apostles and prophets). They did not contest the full
   authority of the duly ordained bishops, who derived their dignity from
   the apostles; but they looked upon it as a deadly sin that they refused
   to live as did the apostles. A certain wavering in their attitude
   towards the Roman Church was the result. The judicial and legislative
   authority of the hierarchy was certainly disputed, or at least held as
   needing restriction. But as the "Brothers" did not organise into
   communities the "Friends" (the "believers") won over by them, but
   rather left them in the old relationships, the position of the reigning
   Church towards the Brothers and their adherents was much more definite
   and decided than was their position towards it. The French kinsmen of
   the Waldensians were not a new evangelical community, based on the idea
   of the universal priesthood, but "the sect itself is nothing but a
   hierarchy, which, founded on the thought of the apostolic life and the
   demand for a special ethical perfection, places itself alongside the
   Roman hierarchy, that, in an organisation which partakes at least of
   the fundamental forms of the latter, it may carry on preaching,
   dispense sacramental penance, and in its own innermost seclusion
   celebrate the Eucharist. So little is there the idea of the universal
   priesthood that the laity do not belong at all to the sect, membership
   being conferred rather only by consecration to one of the three
   hierarchical grades." (See Müller, p. 93 ff. and cf., as a parallel,
   the way in which the Irvingites now carry on their propaganda, and
   relate themselves to the communitas baptizatorum). Nor was the old
   traditional Church doctrine assailed by the Waldensians. They diverged
   only in respect of certain doctrines which bore upon practice, and
   which, besides, had not yet been formulated. Thus they rejected
   purgatory, and disapproved therefore of the Church practice that was
   connected with the idea of it (i.e., of all institutions that were
   meant to extend their influence into the world beyond). The rejection
   of oaths, of service in war, of civil jurisdiction, of all shedding of
   blood, seemed to them, as to so many mediæval sects, simply to follow
   from the Sermon on the Mount. On the other hand, the branch in Lombardy
   (which carried on a propaganda in Germany) took up a much more radical
   attitude towards the Roman Church (see Müller, p. 100 ff.) Although in
   what was cardinal it adhered to the standpoint of the French group of
   the stock (close communion, but only of men and women living
   apostolically; administration of the sacrament of penance; instruction
   of the "Friends" by preaching), it nevertheless saw in the Roman Church
   only apostasy, which at a subsequent time it traced to the benefactions
   of Constantine (cf. the Spirituales). This Church appeared to them
   accordingly as the synagogue of evil-doers and as the whore, its
   priests and monks as Scribes and Pharisees, its members as the lost.
   And so all regulations, orders, sacraments, and acts of this Church
   were to be rejected. Everything without exception, above all, the Pope
   and the mass, then also all legal regulations for worship fell under
   the adverse judgment. We can therefore gather testimonies here to the
   full for the "evangelical" character of these Lombards, who rejected
   all ecclesiastical differences of rank within the Christian community,
   all pomp, riches, lights, incense, holy water, processions,
   pilgrimages, vestments, ceremonies, etc., and in place of these
   required support of the poor, who would have nothing to do with the
   worship of Mary and the saints, who disbelieved as much in miracles of
   saints as in relics, who -- at least originally -- rejected the entire
   sacramental system of the Church, and both limited the number of
   sacraments and only recognised their validity on condition that the
   priest was free from mortal sin. But from the beginning onwards this
   attitude towards the reigning Church was really in many respects only
   "academic," for the great mass of the "Friends," i.e., of adherents, by
   no means actually so judged the Roman Church, but remained within the
   sacramental bonds. Further, the extremely defective vindication of this
   radical opposition on the part of the Brethren themselves shows that it
   was more the result of the breach forced upon them from without, or,
   say, of the doctrine of poverty, than the product of a religious
   criticism dealing with what was essential. Finally, this view is
   confirmed by the circumstance that from the beginning the Brethren left
   themselves, as can be proved, a convenient alternative, by means of
   which they might be able to recognise the celebration of the sacraments
   by one guilty of mortal sin (they said that in that case the worthy
   Christian receives directly from the lord in the dispensation of
   sacramental grace). Moreover, in the time following they approached
   always more closely to the Church and its sacramental celebration,
   partly on practical grounds (to avoid detection), partly because
   confidence in their own "apostolic" powers always became feebler, and
   the Catholic orders were viewed with longing and with greater trust.
   The whole movement, therefore, was at bottom not dogmatic. It was on
   the one hand -- if we would draw the conclusions without hesitation --
   too radical to play a part in the history of dogma (Christianity is the
   apostolic life), on the other hand too conservative, as it set aside
   absolutely nothing that was Catholic with good conscience and clear
   insight. It is a phenomenon in the history of Catholic piety, though it
   may be worth considering in connection with the history of dogma that
   the whole hierarchico-sacramental apparatus of the Church was called in
   question. Had the movement come a generation later, the Church would no
   doubt have found means for incorporating it into itself, as it did the
   Franciscan. Such an attempt was even made with the "Catholic Poor" of
   the converted Durandus of Huesca, formerly a French Waldensian
   (acknowledged by Innocent III. a year before St. Francis stood before
   him), and of the converted Lombard, Bernhard Primus, also one of the
   "Poor"; but there was no more success in leading the whole movement
   back to the channel of the Church by means of such approved Poor ones
   (Müller, p. 16 ff.) Only in the Mendicant Orders did the powerful
   counter-movement become organised and permanent (cf. Miller's excellent
   directions for finding the connection between the approvals of the
   Societies of Durandus, Dominic, and Francis (Waldenser, p. 65 ff.);
   also the same author's Anfänge des Minoritenordens (pp. 43, 69 f.), and
   the perhaps anti-Waldensian passage on the Rule of 1209 (p. 187):
   "Nulla penitus mulier ab aliquo fratre recipiatur ad obedientiam"). The
   Mendicant Orders naturally, particularly that of Dominic, set
   themselves in opposition, not only to the unsanctioned "Poor," but to
   sectarianism as a whole. On this latter there is no reason to enter in
   the history of dogma, for however high its importance may have to be
   estimated in connection with Church politics and social life, and
   however clearly it indicates that piety felt itself straightened within
   the tyrannical structure of the Roman Church and among its priests and
   ceremonies, it is equally certain that the mediæval sects continued
   entirely without influence as regards the development of dogma. It
   cannot even be said that they prepared the way for the Reformation; for
   the loosening which, to some extent, they brought about, was no prior
   condition of that movement. In the controversies rather which prevailed
   between the Roman Church and the dualistic (or pantheistic) sects, the
   Reformation placed itself entirely on the side of the former. What
   prepared the way for the Reformation in the domain of theology (keeping
   out of view the development of the ideas of the State and of natural
   rights) was always only the revived Augustinianism and the subjectivity
   of mysticism allied with it. As long, therefore, as it is regarded as
   expedient that the history of dogma should not be treated as history of
   culture, or as universal history, attention must be withdrawn from such
   phenomena as the Cathari, Albigenses, etc.

   [166] But in the year 1210, and later, Francis would not be induced to
   connect himself with an already existing Order, or to conform to the
   older Monachism, and in this obstinacy towards the Pope and the
   cardinals he showed that he knew the greatness of his cause.

   [167] This was not done indeed, and it led to sore distress on Francis'
   part; yet Sabatier seems to me to have exaggerated this strain in
   relationship (see Mariano, and especially Hegler); the Cardinal to whom
   the movement was chiefly due also did the most to make it political.
   The relation of St. Francis to the Curia and to the Church politicians,
   or rather the relation of these to him, still needs a thorough
   investigation. Excellent discussions in Hegler, l.c. 436 ff.

   [168] Of course many personal elements entered also, such as we can
   study in the most interesting of the earlier Franciscans, Elias of
   Cortona.

   [169] See the writings of Joh. de Oliva and Ubertino de Casale (both
   were under the influence of the writings of Joachim of Fiore). The view
   of history friendly to the State as against the Secularised Church
   appears already in the middle of the thirteenth century (and even among
   the Dominicans): see Voelter in the Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. IV., H. 3. On
   the "Spirituales," and the "Fraticelli" (the latter are not to be
   identified with the former), as well as on the conflicts in the time of
   John XXII. and Louis of Bavaria, see Ehrle in the Archiv. f. Litt.-u.
   K.-Gesch. des Mittelalters, Vol. I. and II., Müller, Kampf Ludwig's des
   Bayern 1879 f., the same author in the Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. VI., part
   1, Gudenatz, Michael von Cesena, 1876.

   [170] At a later time Hussism incorporated and wrought over a great
   part of the Fianciscan and Joachimic-Franciscan elements (see Müller,
   Bericht uber den gegenwärtigen Stand der Forschung auf dem Gebiet der
   vorreformatorischen Zeit, in den Vorträgen der theol. Conferenz zu
   Giessen 1887 S. 44), and as it spread widely, even beyond Bohemia,
   among the lower orders it prepared the way for the great Baptist
   movement and the social revolutions of the sixteenth century. Yet
   creations of a lasting kind appeared here as little as permanent
   influences on the Church generally. But from the point of view of
   Church history and the history of culture, the study of the powerful
   movement, essentially one throughout, which began with Joachimism and
   culminated with the Hussites and Baptists, is of the deepest interest.
   Like the "Illuminism" (Aufklärung) in the eighteenth century, and the
   Romantic ideas in the nineteenth, Joachimism spread over Europe in the
   thirteenth century, not as a new system of dogma, but as a new mode of
   viewing history and the highest problems, comforting to the seriously
   disposed, because it flattered them; cf., e.g., the Chronicle of
   Salimbene (Michael, Salimbene und seine Chronik., Innsbruck 1889).
   Strange that this movement should have begun in the hills of Calabria,
   the most out-of-the-way district of Southern Europe! It is still too
   little studied, while it certainly belongs to a period more open to our
   inspection than any in which prophetism played a part. Where prophets
   appear and are welcomed, fabrications are the immediate sequel. But the
   history of Joachimism is the typical history of all prophetism. Of the
   way in which it succeeds in adjusting itself in the world, Salimbene
   also furnishes some beautiful examples.

   [171] Herrmann remarks very correctly (Verkehr des Christen mit Gott I.
   Aufl., p. 100): "The (present day) lovers of Mysticism present on a
   diminished scale the same spectacle as the great Schoolmen; they seek
   repose from the work of their faith in Mystic piety."

   [172] Herrmann (Verkehr des Christen mit Gott 3 Aufl., p. 21) justly
   emphasises the following also: "We must confess to ourselves that if we
   Evangelicals think we have another kind of religion, we are in any case
   still far from having reached the thoroughness of culture which
   Catholicism possesses in that Mysticism . . .it is a wonderfully
   perfect expression of a particular kind of religion. The speculations
   of Catholic Mysticism are of ancient date. Apart from Neoplatonism, it
   has little peculiar to it in this respect. But in the capacity to make
   personal life the subject of observation and delineation, it represents
   a height of attainment which Protestantism has not yet reached."

   [173] The right conception of Mysticism as Catholic piety has been
   taught -- in opposition to Ullmann's "Reformers before the Reformation"
   -- by Ritschl (Rechtfert. und Versöhn. vol. I., Geschichte des
   Pietismus, vols. I.-III. Theologie und Metaphysik) who has also given
   hints for further investigation (connection of the Mystics with the
   Anabaptists, Hussites, etc.). He has been followed by a large number of
   more recent investigators. Besides the works named above, p. 25, among
   which those of Denifle are epoch-making, as having shown that Master
   Eckhart is, in his Latin writings, entirely dependent on Thomas, and
   even in other respects owes his best to him (Archiv f. Litt.-und
   K.-Gesch. des Mittelalters II., pp. 417-640; preparatory work had
   already been done here by Bach in his monograph on Eckhart), see
   Lasson, Meister Eckhart, 1866, also the more recent works on Tauler and
   the Friends of God (Denifle), Pfeiffer's edition of the German Mystics
   (2 vols., 1845-57), Suso's Works, edited by Denifle (1877), still
   further, Ritschl in the Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch. IV., p. 337 ff.,
   Strauch, Marg. Ebner und Heinrich v. Nördlingen, 1882. On the earliest
   German Mystics see Preger, Vorarbeiten z. einer Gesch. der deutschen
   Mystik (Ztschr, f. die hist. Theol. 1869, and several essays in the
   Abhandl. der hist. Klasse d. bayer. Akad. d. Wissensch., which, along
   with his comprehensive history of Mysticism, are rich sources of
   material). On Ruysbroek cf. Engelhardt, Rich. v. St. Victor und R.
   1838; on Thomas à Kempis "de imitatione Christi" the literature is
   voluminous, cf. Hirsche, Prolegomena z. einer neuen Ausg. 2 vols.
   1873-83, the same author on the Brothers of the Common Life in the R.-E
   2. In general: Denifle, Das geistliche Leben. Blumenlese aus den
   deutschen Mystikern und Gottesfreunden. 3. Aufl. 1880, A very full
   delineation of Mysticism is also given in Thomasius-Seeberg, D.-Gesch.
   2 Aufl. II. 1 pp. 261 ff., cf. also Seeberg, Ein Kampf um jenseitiges
   Leben. Lebensbild eines mittelalterlichen Frommen., 1889. I give no
   extracts from the writings of the German Mediæval Mystics, because I
   should like to avoid even seeming to countenance the error that they
   expressed anything one cannot read in Origen, Plotinus, the Areopagite,
   Augustine, Erigena, Bernard and Thomas, or that they represented
   religious progress, while in respect of intrinsic Christian worth,
   their tractates really stand for the most part lower than the writings
   of Augustine and Bernard. The importance of those works rests in this,
   that they were written in German, and that they were intended for the
   laity. They are therefore of inestimable value within the history of
   the German church and dogma. But in general history we may, and must,
   content ourselves with a characterisation. Whether, perhaps, they
   represent a considerable advance in the history of epistemology and
   metaphysic, is a question I do not trust myself to answer, nor does it
   fall to he considered here. As to the idea of regeneration, which is
   strongly emphasised in many Mystic writings, we must take in connection
   with it the silence on forgiveness of sins, that we may see how even
   this idea stood under the ban of intellectualism. The "clarification."
   which the Mysticism of the fourteenth century underwent in the
   fifteenth certainly related very specially to that aggressive
   intellectualism, so that the piety which expresses itself, for example,
   in the famous book de imitatione Christi (Thomas à Kempis) may he
   described as essentially Bernardine without Neoplatonic admixture, but
   yet only as Bernardine. A new, powerful element of joy in God, who
   forgives sin, and bestows faith, is sought for in vain.

   [174] See the works of Gothein, Kolde, Kawerau, Haupt, and above all v.
   Bezold (Gesch. der deutschen Reformation) on the inner state of
   Catholicism at the close of the fifteenth century. Succinct accounts in
   Lenz, Martin Luther, 1883 (introduction) and Karl Müller, Bericht uber
   den gegenwärtigen Stand, etc., 1887.

   [175] There are several Mystics of the fourteenth century who, in many
   passages of their devotional writings, find their sole ground of
   comfort, as definitely as St. Bernard, in the sufferings of Christ.

   [176] See Schlüter u. Storck, Ausgewählte Gedichte Jacopone's, 1864.
   Thode, l.c. pp. 398 ff.

   [177] Although, shortly before his death, Eckhart had retracted
   everything unecclesiastical in his writings, two years after his death
   a process was instituted against him, i.e., twenty-eight of his
   propositions were condemned, partly as heretical, and partly as open to
   suspicion (Bull of John XXII., 1329). On this condemnation, and on the
   relation of Suso to Eckhart, see Denifle in the Archiv. f. L.-u. K.-G.
   des Mittelalters II. and Seeberg, Ein Kampf um jenseitiges Leben. 1889,
   p. 137 ff. Even Suso could not quite escape the reproach of polluting
   the land with heretical filth. It was always the Ultra's, who, by
   making an appeal to them, brought discredit upon the "Church" Mystics.

   [178] Cf. especially Eckhart and Suso.

   [179] To this distinction between the Thomist and the Quietist
   (Nominalist) Mysticism Ritschl was the first to point, see Gesch. des
   Pietismus I., p. 467 ff., and Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch. IV., p. 337 ff.;
   also already in the first vol. of Rechtfertig. u. Versöhn.-Lehre.

   [180] About 1500 it seems to have gained the ascendency; cf. the
   attitude of Staupitz and Thomas Münzer. Even the "German Theology," of
   which Luther was so fond, is quietistic.

   [181] In the section on the history of theology the characteristics and
   significance of Nominalism will receive a still further illustration.
   Meanwhile, however, let it be noted here, that by its "positiveness,"
   based on mere authority, Nominalism purchased its truer insight into
   the nature of religion at a heavy cost. Here Anselm and Thomas
   undoubtedly hold a higher position; but these men were hindered by
   their intellectualism from doing justice to the Christian religion as a
   historic magnitude and force. What I have set forth in these pages (p.
   97 ff.) has been keenly assailed by Lasson and Raffaele Mariano.
   Plainly enough they put before me the alternative of irreligious
   criticism or blind faith (Köhlerglauben), when on their side they claim
   for the Thomist Mysticism that it is the only form of religion in which
   faith and thought, history and religious independence, are reconciled.
   It must be the endeavour of each of us to find something in his own
   way. What we have ultimately to do with here is the great problem as to
   what history and the person of Christ are in religion, and then there
   is the other problem also as to whether religion is contemplation or
   something more serious. That the end to which our striving is directed
   is the same -- the seeking, finding, and keeping hold of God -- may be
   confidently granted on both sides. But my opponents have an easier
   position than I have: they can prove -- and I recognise this proof --
   that the piety that culminates in Mysticism and the old ecclesiastical
   dogma hang together, and they can at the same time let the question
   rest as to what reality of fact answers to the dogma. That is to say,
   the dogma renders them the best services, just when they are at liberty
   to contemplate it as a mobile and elastic magnitude, which hovers
   between the poles of an inferior actuality and that "highest," which
   can never have been actual as earthly: out of the darkness there is a
   pressing forward to the light; luminous clouds show the path! But I
   seek in the dogma itself of the Christian Church for something
   concrete, namely the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the Lord. The tradition
   which the dogma represents is treated with more respect when it is
   criticised and sifted, than when one takes it as it is, in order
   ultimately to bid it a secret farewell, i.e., to substitute for it
   something quite different -- namely the idea.

   [182] On the relation of Metaphysic to Asceticism, or, say, of
   Mysticism to Asceticism, see the dissertation of Bender in the Archiv.
   f. Gesch. der Philos. vol. 6, pp. 1 ff., 208 ff., 301 ff.

   [183] With Eckhart the direction originated to let even ecstacy go,
   though it should be as great as that of Paul, if one can help a poor
   man even with a sop.

   [184] See Wadstein, Die eschatologische Ideengruppe in den

   with the ideas about the devil, they exercised a very strong influence.

   Certainly there was opposition also to some old traditional doctrines

   [188] What is here said applies also to Gothic architecture. It is
   certainly the greatest, most perfect, and most harmonious product of
   architectural art since the time of the Greek temple; indeed, it is the
   only style that is all-pervasive, and that embraces all in unity, as
   the Greek temple style does. In itself it proves that the mediæval
   period at its highest point of attainment possessed a harmonious
   culture which of its kind was perfect. But just on that account the
   Gothic is the style of mediæval Catholic Christianity, the style of
   Mysticism and Scholasticism. It awakens exactly the feelings, emotions,
   and sensations of awe which the Catholic piety, of which it is born,
   seeks to produce; just on that account also it is of Romanic origin,
   and the history of its spread is simply a parallel to the history of
   the spread of Romanic piety. Perhaps the deepest thing that can be said
   about the Gothic, about its ineffable charm and its æsthetic
   impressiveness -- though at the same time it suggests the inevitable
   reaction of Protestant piety against it -- has been put into words by
   Goethe in his Wahlverwandschaften (Hempel's edition, XV., pp. 143, 137,
   173): " . . .She sat down in one of the seats (in a Gothic chapel), and
   it seemed to her, as she looked up and around, as if she was, and yet
   was not, as if she realised her identity and yet realised it not, as if
   all this that was before her was to vanish from her and she from
   herself, and only when the sun passed from the hitherto very brightly
   illumined (stained glass) window did she awake." "From all figures
   there looks forth only the purest existence; all must be pronounced, if
   not noble, at least good. Cheerful collectedness, ready recognition of
   something above us to be reverenced, quiet self-devotion in love and
   expectant waiting, are expressed in all faces, in all attitudes. The
   aged man with the bald head, the boy with the curly locks, the
   sprightly youth, the grave-minded man, the glorified saint, the
   hovering angel, all seem to know the bliss of an innocent satisfaction,
   of a devout expectancy. The commonest thing that happens has a touch of
   heavenly life about it, and an act of divine service seems perfectly
   adapted to every nature. For such a religion most men look as for a
   vanished golden age, a lost paradise." But on the other hand: "As for
   myself, this mutual approximation and intermingling of the sacred and
   the sensuous is certainly not to my liking; I am not pleased when
   people set apart and consecrate and adorn certain special places, that
   thereby alone they may foster and maintain the feeling of piety. No
   surroundings, not even the commonest, should disturb the feeling in us
   of the divine, which can accompany us everywhere, and make every place
   a consecrated temple. I would like to see an important religious
   service held in the saloon, where people usually take food, gather for
   social intercourse, and enjoy themselves with games and dancing. The
   highest, the most excellent thing, in man is formless, and we must
   guard against giving it shape in anything save noble deeds."

   2. On the History of Ecclesiastical Law. -- The Doctrine of the Church.

   "In the fifty years that elapsed between the appearing of the Gratian
   book of laws (which contains, besides the Isodorian, numerous forgeries
   of the Gregorian Deusdedit, Anselm and Cardinal Gregorius) and the
   pontificate of Innocent III., the papal system achieved for itself
   complete supremacy. In the Roman Courts justice was dispensed according
   to Gratian's law, in Bologna the teaching was regulated thereby, even
   the Emperor Frederick I. already had his son, Henry VI., instructed in
   the Decretum and in Roman law. The whole decretal legislation from 1159
   to 1320 was framed on the basis of Gratian, and presupposes him. The
   same holds good of the dogmatic of Thomas in the relative material,
   while the scholastic dogmatic in general was made entirely dependent in
   questions of Church constitution on the favourite science of the clergy
   at the time, namely, jurisprudence, as it had been drawn up by Gratian,
   Raymund, and the other collectors of decretals. The theory, as well as
   the texts and proofs relating thereto, were derived by the theologians
   from these collections of laws." [189] With regard to the nature of the
   Church, while the Augustinian definition was firmly retained, that the
   Church is the community of believers or of the predestinated, the idea
   was always gaining a fuller acceptance that the hierarchy is the
   Church, and that the Pope, as successor of Peter, and episcopus
   universalis, unites in himself all the powers of the Church. The German
   Kings themselves were in great part to blame for this development, for
   while they, and, above all, the Hohenstaufens, led the struggle for the
   rights of the State against the papacy, they left the latter to its own
   irresponsible action in the ecclesiastical domain. Only when it was now
   too late did Frederick II. point out in his address to the Kings of the
   Franks and Angles (ad reges Francorum et Anglorum) that the hierarchy
   must be restored by an inner reform to its original poverty and
   humility. [190] In its development to autocratic supremacy within the
   Church and the Churches, a check was put upon the papacy from the
   beginning of the fourteenth century only from France. [191]

   We cannot be required to show here what particular conclusions were
   drawn by the Popes and their friends from the idea of the Church as a
   civil organism of law in the thirteenth century and in the first half
   of the fourteenth, and in what measure these conclusions were
   practically carried out. The leading thoughts were the following: (1)
   The hierarchical organisation is essential to the Church, and in all
   respects the Christianity of the laity is dependent on the mediation of
   the priests ("properly ordained"), who alone can perform ecclesiastical
   acts. When we pass from Cyprian to Gregory I., from the latter to
   Pseudoisidore and Gregory VII., we might conclude on superficial
   consideration that the principle just stated had long been
   determinative. But when we enter into detail, and take into account the
   ecclesiastical legislation from the time of Innocent III., we observe
   how much was still wanting to a strict application of it in theory and
   practice till the end of the twelfth century. Only from the time of the
   fourth Lateran Council was full effect given to it, expressly in
   opposition to the Catharist and Waldensian parties. [192] (2) The
   sacramental and judicial powers of the priests are independent of their
   personal worthiness. This also was an old principle; but after having
   been long latent, it was now strongly emphasised, asserted in
   opposition to all "heretical" parties, and so turned to account that by
   it the hierarchy protected themselves against all demand for reform,
   and, above all, evaded the appeal to resume the apostolic life. Whoever
   returned from the "heretical" parties to the bosom of the Church was
   required to declare that he recognised the celebration of Sacraments by
   sinful priests. [193] (3) The Church is a visible community with a
   constitution given to it by Christ (even as such it is the body of
   Christ [corpus Christi]); as a visible, constituted community it has a
   double power, namely, the potestas spiritualis and the potestas
   temporalis (spiritual and temporal power). Through both is it, as it
   shall endure till the end of the world, superior to the transitory
   states, which are subordinate to it. To it, therefore, must all states
   and all individuals be obedient de necessitate salutis (as a necessary
   condition of salvation); nay, the power of the Church extends itself
   even to heretics [194] and heathen. [195] Even these principles [196]
   have their root in the Augustinian doctrine of the Church; [197] but
   from the logical expression and thorough-going application which they
   received between 1050 and 1300, they present the appearance of an
   unheard-of innovation. They obtained their complete formulation from
   Boniface VIII.; [198] but long before him the Popes acted according to
   these principles. The worst consequence was not the undervaluing, [199]
   repression and serious deterioration of civic life (here, on the
   contrary, there can be discerned also many salutary effects in the
   interests of popular freedom), but the inevitable profanation of
   religion, inasmuch as all its aims and benefits were perverted and
   falsified through the light being foreign to them in which they
   presented themselves from the standpoint of Church law; and obedience
   to an external human institution, that was subject to all errors of
   human passion and sin, was raised to the first condition of Christian
   life. "It was this Church on which there fell that heaviest
   responsibility that has ever been incurred in history: by all violent
   means it applied as pure truth a doctrine that was vitiated and
   distorted to serve its omnipotence, and under the feeling of its
   inviolability abandoned itself to the gravest immorality; in order to
   maintain itself in such a position, it struck deadly blows at the
   spirit and conscience of the nations, and drove many of the more highly
   gifted, who had secretly withdrawn from it, into the arms of unbelief
   and embitterment." [200]

   (4) To the Church has been given, by Christ, a strictly monarchical
   constitution in His representative, the successor of Peter, the Roman
   Bishop. Not only is all that is valid with regard to the hierarchy
   valid in the first instance of the Pope, but to him all powers are
   committed, and the other members of the hierarchy are only chosen in
   partem solicitudinis (for purposes of oversight). He is the episcopus
   universalis (universal bishop); to him belong, therefore, both swords,
   and as every Christian can attain salvation only in the Church, as the
   Church, however, is the hierarchy, and the hierarchy the Pope, it
   follows that de necessitate salutis all the world must be subject to
   the Pope. In numerous letters these principles had already been
   maintained by Gregory VII. in a way that could not be out-vied (cf.
   also the so-called dictatus Gregorii). Yet in his case everything
   appears as the outflow of a powerful dominating personality, which, in
   a terrible conflict, grasps at the extremest measures. In the period
   that followed, however, his principles were not only expressed, but
   were effectively applied, and, at the same time, as the result of a
   marvellous series of forgeries, were believingly accepted even by those
   who felt obliged to combat the papacy. At the time when the papacy saw
   itself confronted with a weak imperial power in the West, and with a
   still weaker Latin Empire in the East, this view of things established
   itself (from the time of Innocent III. onward) in the souls and minds
   of men. So far as I know, Thomas was the first to state the position
   roundly in the formula: "(ostenditur etiam), quod subesse Romano
   pontifici sit de necessitate salutis" (it is also shown that to be
   subject to the Roman pontiff is essential to salvation). [201] Then the
   whole theory was summed up in a form not to be surpassed in the Bull
   "Unam sanctam" of Boniface (1302), after the Popes for a whole century
   had strictly followed it in hundreds of small and great questions
   (questions of Church policy, of civil policy, of diocesan
   administration, etc.), and were in a position for daring to disregard
   all protests. [202] The setting up of strict monarchical power and the
   destruction of the old Church constitution is represented in three
   stages by Pseudo Isidore, Gratian, and the Mendicant Orders; for the
   latter, through the special rights which they received, completely
   broke up the local powers (bishops, presbyteries, parish priests), and
   were subject entirely to papal direction. [203] All the premises from
   which there necessarily followed the infallibility of the Pope had been
   brought together; they were strictly developed, too, by Thomas, after
   new forgeries had been added. [204] Nevertheless, though the doctrine
   had long been recognised, that through a special divine protection the
   Roman Church could not entirely fall from faith, and was the divinely
   appointed refuge for doctrinal purity and doctrinal unity, beyond the
   groups that stood under the influence of the Dominican Order, the
   doctrine of infallibility did not command acceptance. The history of
   the Popes was still too well known; even in the canonical law-book
   there were contradictory elements, and [205] Popes as great as Innocent
   III. admitted the possibility of a Pope falling into sin in matters of
   faith, and, in that case, acknowledged the competency of the judgment
   of the entire Church. [206] It was thus possible that at the University
   of Paris a decided opposition should establish itself, which led, e.g.,
   to the Pope being charged with heresy in connection with a doctrine of
   John XXII. The indefiniteness in which many Church doctrines (and
   theories of practice, e.g., in regard to ordination) still stood, and
   the hesitating attitude which the Popes assumed towards them, also
   prevented the dogmatic authority of the papacy from being taken as
   absolute. [207] Although the falsification of history, by the
   publication of historic accounts that painted over in an incredible way
   the great conflict between the papacy and the Empire, reached its
   climax about 1300, [208] and the principles of the Thomist policy [209]
   always received a fuller adoption, the decisive question of the
   infallibility remained unsolved. From about the year 1340, indeed, the
   literature in which the papal system was delineated in the most
   extravagant way, [210] ceased entirely to be produced. Only after 120
   years did it reappear, when it was a question of rescuing and asserting
   the old claims of the papacy against the Council of Bâsle. It was then
   that Cardinal Torquemada wrote that defence of the papal system, [211]
   which, resting on a strict Thomistic foundation, was still regarded at
   the period of the Reformation as the most important achievement of the
   papal party. But from the middle of the fifteenth century the papal
   system, as a whole, was again gathering power, after the storm of the
   Councils had been happily exorcised by the brilliant but crafty policy
   of Eugene IV. Only the French nation maintained what ground of freedom
   was already won in opposition to the Pope (Bourges 1438). The other
   nations returned, through the Concordats, to their old dependence on
   the Autocrat in Rome; [212] indeed, they were, to some extent, betrayed
   just by their own local rulers, inasmuch as these men saw it to be of
   advantage in hastening their attainment to full princely power to take
   shares with the Pope in the Church of the country. [213] This fate
   overtook, in the end, even the French national Church (through the
   concordat of Dec. 1516), and yet in such a way that the king obtained
   the chief share of the power over it. While, as the fifteenth century
   passed into the sixteenth, the Popes were indulging wildly in war,
   luxury, and the grossest simony, Cajetan and Jacobazzi wrought out the
   strictest papal theory, the former including in it the doctrine of
   infallibility. [214] The hopes of the nations in the Council were
   quenched, the old tyranny was again set up; it was complained, indeed,
   that the ecclesiastical despotism was worse than that of the Turks,
   but, nevertheless, men submitted to the inevitable. About the year 1500
   the complaints were perhaps more bitter than at any other time; but the
   falling away was slight, the taking of steps less frequent. Heresy
   seemed to have become rarer and tamer than in the thirteenth and
   fourteenth centuries, especially after the Hussite movement had
   exhausted itself. The "heretics" -- so it appeared -- had really become
   the "silent in the land," who shunned an open breach with the Church;
   their piety appeared less aggressive. "It was pretty generally felt
   that it had happened to the Church with the Reformation, as formerly it
   had happened to the King of Rome with the Sibylline books; after the
   seed of corruption sown by the Curia had, for fifty years, borne a much
   larger harvest, and the Church itself made no more effort to save it,
   the Reformation had to be purchased at a much heavier price and with
   still smaller prospect of success." [215] The Lateran Council at the
   beginning of the sixteenth century, which treated with scorn all wishes
   of the nations and promulgated the papal theory in the strictest sense,
   [216] as if there had never been councils at Constance and Basle, was
   tacitly recognised. But it was the lull before the storm -- a storm
   which the Pope had yet to experience, who had entered upon his office
   with the words: "Volo, ut pontificatu isto quam maxime perfruamur." (It
   is my wish that we may enjoy the pontificate in the largest measure
   possible.) [217]

   Before the time of Thomas theology took no part in this imposing
   development of the papal theory; even after him the share taken by it
   was small. The development was directed by jurisprudence, which founded
   simply on external, mostly forged, historic testimonies, and drew its
   conclusions with dialectic art. The meagre share of theology is to be
   explained on two grounds. First, Rome alone had a real interest in the
   whole theory; but in Rome theology never flourished, either in
   antiquity or in the Middle Ages. There was practical concern in Rome
   neither with Scripture exposition nor with the dogmatic works of the
   Fathers. Whoever wished to study theology went to France. For the
   Curia, only the student of law was of any account; from the time of
   Innocent IV. a school of law existed in Rome; the great majority of the
   Cardinals were well-equipped jurists, not theologians, and the greatest
   Popes of the Middle Ages, Alexander III., Innocents III. and IV.,
   Boniface VIII., etc., came to the papal chair as highly-esteemed legal
   scholars. [218] When it was now much too late, men with clear vision,
   like Roger Bacon, or pious patriots, like Dante, saw that the ruin of
   the Church was due to the decretals, which were studied in place of the
   Church Fathers and Scripture. The former, in particular, demanded very
   loudly that the Church should be delivered from the secularised Church
   law which was poisoning it. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
   there were complaints constantly made about the papacy, and about the
   corrupted Church law ("Jurists bad Christians") as being the real
   source of all evil. It was the spirit of ancient Rome that had settled
   down on the Mediæval spirit, that Roman spirit of jurisprudence, which
   had now, however, degenerated into a spirit of tyranny, and used as its
   means audacious forgeries. But the slight share of theology in the
   development of the hierarchical conception of the Church is to be
   explained not merely from the lack of theology, but, second, from the
   fortunate incapacity of theology (till past the middle of the
   thirteenth century) to lower itself to this notion of the Church.
   Anyone who reflected as a theologian on the Church, instituted
   researches into the works of the Church fathers, especially Augustine.
   But here the spiritual conception of the Church (i.e., the Church as
   corpus Christi [body of Christ], as multitudo fidelium [multitude of
   the faithful], as universitas Christianorum [entire mass of
   Christians]) came so clearly to view that for the time it riveted
   reflection, and there was failure to force one's way with any
   confidence to the hierarchical, not to speak of the papal, conception,
   or it was only touched on. This explains how all the great theologians
   before Thomas, from Anselm onwards, even those of Gregorian tendency,
   achieved as theologians very little in promoting the development of the
   hierarchical conception of the Church. They taught and wrote like
   Augustine, indeed they still remained behind him in precise definition
   of the Church as an external society. [219] Theology did nothing for
   the development and establishment of the papal system till far on in
   the thirteenth century, and it may here be said at once in its honour,
   that with a single, and that even not a perfect, exception (Thomas), it
   did only half work in the time that followed, leaving the most to be
   done by the Post-Tridentine theology. [220] So far as I know, there is
   nothing to be found in the theological writings of the Schoolmen in the
   shape of rounded off formulæ for, nothing of strictly systematic
   exposition of, the conception of the Church (as in the case of the
   doctrine of the Sacraments). On the other hand, both in Hugo St.
   Victor, and in the later Schoolmen also, not a few fundamental lines of
   proof with regard to the notion of the Church can be pointed to which
   were directly and without change taken over by the "heretical" parties,
   and by men like Wyclif. [221] What most simply explains this is that
   the patristic, and especially the Augustinian, expositions still
   determined theology. Yet it is not to be denied, that from the middle
   of the thirteenth century theology took a certain share in developing
   the conception of the Church. It was just the Mendicant Monks -- to the
   shame of St. Francis -- who, even as theologians, began to be
   enthusiastic for the papal theory, after there had been conferred upon
   them such excessive privileges as could only be held legal if the Pope
   was really the Lord of the Church. There was added to this, that in the
   thirteenth century, in the course of the negotiations with the Greeks,
   theology saw that it had to face the task of ingratiating them into the
   papal system also. It was in connection with this task that there was
   awakened the interest theology took in the hierarchical conception of
   the Church which formed the presupposition of the papal system, [222]
   and the great thinker, Thomas Aquinas, now developed at once the
   hierarchical and papal theory, together with a bold theory of the
   state. [223] But he was far from surrendering, at the same time, the
   spiritual conception of the Church, or -- as was done in the
   Post-Tridentine period -- from correcting it throughout by means of the
   hierarchical. With all his logical consistency in the development of
   the papal system, he certainly did not derive the powers of the bishops
   and priests entirely from the papal; in his "Summa" he still works to a
   great extent with the notion of the "Ecclesia" as having the force of a
   central conception, and in doing so has no thought of monarchy. For him
   it is no figure of speech that the individual bishop "is called
   specially the bridegroom of the Church as also Christ" (specialiter
   sponsus ecclesiæ dicitur sicut et Christus). [224] But, so far as the
   influence of Thomas extended, the result was unquestionably a mingling
   of jurisprudence and theology in this department and the acclimatising
   of the hierarchico-papal notion of the Church. [225] Yet his influence
   must not be over-rated. The Franciscan (Nominalist) dogmatic took
   little to do, so far as I know, with this development of the conception
   of the Church. Even at the beginning of the Reformation, the whole
   hierarchical and papal theory had no sure position in dogmatic -- it
   was Romish decretal law. But it had attained more than a place in
   dogmatic. From about 1450 it was again energetically acted upon from
   rome, and the opposition to it appeared no longer so powerful as a
   century before. [226]

   This opposition we have still to review. Here it is to be observed,
   above everything else, that the imperfect public development of the
   conception of the Church was a matter of little importance, because in
   the doctrine of the Sacraments all was already acquired as a sure
   possession which could be expected from a formulation of the conception
   of the Church in hierarchical interests. From this, again, it followed
   still further, that the opposition to the hierarchical papal notion of
   the Church necessarily continued -- in spite of all fostering --
   without danger, so long as the doctrine of the Sacraments was not
   objected to. But the latter again rested on the peculiar view of
   salvation, as the sanctification that leads to the visio dei, as active
   holiness (measured by the standard of the law of God). Here we must go
   back to an earlier point. [227] .

   Augustine combined the old Catholic notion of salvation, as the visio
   et fruitio dei (vision and enjoyment of God), with the doctrine of
   predestination on the one hand and with the doctrine of the regnum
   Christi (kingdom of Christ) and the process of justification on the
   other. As contrasted with the Greek view, both combinations were new;
   but the union of the idea of salvation with the process of
   justification and sanctification was easily effected, because this
   process was taken as regulated entirely by the Sacraments, while the
   Sacraments, as the Greek development shows, formed the necessary
   correlate to the idea of salvation. If in salvation, that is to say,
   the supramundane condition in which one is to find himself is mainly
   emphasised, then there answer to the production of this condition,
   means that operate as holy natural forces. When Augustine conceived of
   these natural forces as forces of love working for righteousness, a
   very great step of progress was taken; but no difference was made
   thereby in the general scheme, since love was regarded as infused. But
   certainly he made it possible that there should also be given to the
   whole process a very decided tendency towards morality -- which had
   dropped out of the Greek view as held within the lines of dogma. The
   forces of love, that is to say, bring it about that here on earth the
   law of Christ, which is summed up in the commandment to love, can be
   fulfilled. In this way there arises from the forces of love, which are
   transmitted through the Sacraments as channels, the kingdom of Christ,
   in which righteousness reigns according to the example and law of
   Christ. The Sacraments have therefore the double effect, that of
   preparing for, and conducting gradually to the visio et fruitio dei,
   and that of producing on earth the Church in which the law of Christ
   reigns and by which the "bene vivere" (right-living) is produced. By
   the latter of these two views the position of the State is determined
   -- as the bene vivere is its end, it must submit itself to the
   sacramental institution. But by the whole idea the priesthood as the
   teaching and sanctifying corporation is legitimised; for the
   administration of the Sacraments is tied to a particular order, whom
   Christ has appointed, and this order, at the same time, is alone
   empowered to interpret the law of Christ with binding authority. To
   them, therefore, there must be subjection.

   This whole view, which, certainly, had not received a clear and precise
   expression from Augustine, obtained clearness and precision in the
   period that followed -- less through the labours of the theologians
   than by the force of the resolute Roman policy. Because this policy
   aimed, above all, at monarchy in the Church, it had, as the result of
   its victorious exercise, brought out clearly for the first time, and at
   the same time created, the general hierarchical conditions requisite
   for the existence of such a monarchy. Yet, in spite of many forgeries,
   it could not bring it about that the factor of hierarchical gradation,
   comparatively insignificant from a dogmatic point of view, but
   extremely important from the point of view of practice, should obtain
   the support of an imposing tradition; for from Augustine and the
   Fathers in general it was as good as absent. But still further,
   Augustine, as we have noted above, combined with the dogma of salvation
   as the visio dei the doctrine of predestination, and developed from the
   latter a doctrine of the Church that held a neutral relation to
   hierarchy and sacrament. No doubt it can easily be shown that the
   predestinarian and the sacramental hierarchical notions of the Church
   are not necessarily mutually exclusive, nay, that in a certain sense
   they require each other, inasmuch as the individual's uncertainty of
   his own election, affirmed by Augustine, necessarily forces him to make
   a diligent use of all the means furnished by the Church, and the
   explanation very naturally occurs that God effectuates the fulfilment
   of the predestinating decree only through the empirical Church with its
   Sacraments. But Augustine himself did not assert that; and although in
   the time that came after, this mode of adjusting things came to be very
   much in favour, yet, as there was no allowing the doctrine of
   predestination to drop out, there was involved in this doctrine an
   element that threatened, like an overhanging mass of rock, to destroy
   the existence of the structure beneath. Finally, Augustine had no doubt
   carried on a victorious conflict with Donatism; but there was still one
   point at which it was not easy to deny entirely the correctness of the
   Donatist thesis, and that was the sacrament of penance. It could
   certainly be made credible that baptism, the Lord's supper,
   confirmation, ordination were valid, even when an unworthy priest
   dispensed them; but how was such a man to be able to sit in judgment
   upon the holy and the unholy, to apply the law of Christ, to bind and
   loose, if the load rested on himself of ignorance of sin? It was surely
   more than paradoxical, it was an inconceivable thought, that the blind
   should be able to judge aright as to light and darkness. Was
   excommunication by such a man to be held valid before God? Was his
   absolution to have force? There was no doubt an escape sought for here,
   also, by saying that it is Christ who binds and looses, not the priest,
   who is only a minister; but when flagrant unrighteousness was practised
   by the priest, when such cases increased in number, what was then to be
   done? [228]

   In a way indicating the greatest acuteness, Thomas combined the
   predestinarian (spiritual) and the hierarchical conceptions of the
   Church, and tried to eliminate the points from which a "heretical"
   conception could develop itself; but it is apparent from what has been
   stated that one could accept substantially the Augustinian-Thomist
   notion of the Church with its premises (doctrines of salvation and the
   Sacraments), and yet, when tested by the claims which the Mediæval
   Church set up at the time of its greatest power, could become
   "heretical," in the event, namely, of his either (1) contesting the
   hierarchical gradation of the priestly order; or (2) giving to the
   religious idea of the Church implied in the thought of predestination a
   place superior to the conception of the empirical Church; or (3)
   applying to the priests, and thereby to the authorities of the Church,
   the test of the law of God, before admitting their right to exercise,
   as holding the keys, the power of binding and loosing.

   Certainly during the whole of the Middle Ages there were sects who
   attacked the Catholic notion of the Church at the root; but however
   important they may be for the history of culture, they play no part in
   the history of dogma; for as their opposition, as a rule, developed
   itself from dualistic or pantheistic premises (surviving effects of old
   Gnostic or Manichæan views), they stood outside of ordinary
   Christendom, and, while no doubt affecting many individual members
   within it, had no influence on Church doctrine. [229] On the other
   hand, it may be asserted that all the movements which are described as
   "reformations anticipating the Reformation," and which for a time
   resisted not unsuccessfully the introduction of the Romish conception
   of the Church, set out from the Augustinian conception of the Church,
   but took exception to the development of this conception, from the
   three points that have been defined above. Now whether we look at the
   Waldensian, the Lombard, the Apocalyptico-Joachimic, the Franciscan
   opposition to the new conception of the Church, whether at that of the
   Empire or the Councils, of Wyclif or Huss, or even, indeed, at the
   humanist, we have always the same spectacle. On the first view the
   opposition seems radical, nay, expressly antagonistic. Angry curses --
   Anti-Christ, Babylon, Church of the devil, priests of the devil, etc.
   -- catch the ear everywhere. But if we look a little more closely, the
   opposition is really much tamer. That fundamental Catholic conception
   of the Church, as a sacramental institution, is not objected to,
   because the fundamental conception of salvation and of blessedness
   remains unassailed. Although all hierarchical gradation may be
   rejected, the conception of the hierarchical priesthood is allowed to
   stand; although the Church may be conceived of as the community of the
   predestinated, every Christian must place himself under the influence
   of the Sacraments dispensed by the Church, and must use them most
   diligently, for by means of these his election is effected; although
   the sacramental acts of unworthy priests may be invalid, still priests
   are needed, but they must live according to the law of Christ; although
   the Church as the community of the predestinated may be known only to
   God, yet the empirical Church is the true Church, if the apostolic life
   prevails in it, and a true empirical Church of the kind is absolutely
   necessary, and can be restored by reforms; although, finally, all
   secular rights may have to be denied to the Pope and the priesthood,
   yet secular right in general is something that has gradually to
   disappear. The criticism of the Romish conception of the Church is
   therefore entirely a criticism from within.

   The criticism must not on that account be under-estimated; it certainly
   accomplished great things; in it the spiritual and moral gained
   supremacy over the legal and empirical, and Luther was fortunate when
   he came to know Huss's doctrine of the Church. Yet we must not be
   deceived by this as to the fact that the conception of the Church held
   by all the opposing parties was only a form of the Augustinian
   conception of the Church, modified by the Waldensian-Franciscan ideal
   of the apostolic life (according to the law of Christ). The ways in
   which the elements were mingled in the programmes of the opposition
   parties were very different; at one time the predestinarian element
   preponderated, at another time an apocalyptic-legal, at another the
   Franciscan, at another the biblical (the lex Christi), at another they
   were all present in equipoise. Especially on the ground that these
   opposition parties, starting from the doctrine of predestination,
   enforced the conception of the "invisible Church," and applied the
   standard of Scripture to everything, they are praised as evangelical.
   But attention has very rightly been drawn of late to the fact [230]
   that they by no means renounced the conception of an empirical, true
   Church, a conception to which they were driven by individual
   uncertainty about election, and that their stand-point on the ground of
   Scripture is the Catholic-legal, as it had been adopted by Augustine,
   Bernard, and Francis.

   Under such circumstances it is enough to delineate in a few of their
   features the conceptions of the Church held by the several parties. The
   Waldensians contested neither the Catholic cultus nor the Sacraments
   and the hierarchical constitution in themselves, but they protested (1)
   as against a mortal sin, against the Catholic clergy exercising the
   rights of the successors of the Apostles without adopting the apostolic
   life; and (2) against the comprehensive power of government on the part
   of the Pope and the bishops, hence against the Romish hierarchy with
   its graded ranks. But the French Waldensians did not, nevertheless,
   contest the validity of the Sacraments dispensed by unworthy priests,
   though this certainly was done by those of Lombardy. [231] Among the
   Waldensians, then, the conception of the law of Christ, as set forth in
   Scripture and as prescribing to the priests the apostolic life, rises
   above all other marks of the Church (among those in Italy the Donatist
   element developed itself from this). The same applies to a part of the
   Franciscans, who passed over to the opposition. In the sharp polemic
   against Rome on the part of the Joachimites, the apocalyptic element
   takes its place side by side with the legal: clergy and hierarchy are
   judged from the standpoint of emancipated monachism and of the
   approaching end of time. [232] No wonder that just this view gained
   favour with not a few Franciscans, that it extended itself to far in
   the North among all sections of the people, [233] and that it came to
   take up a friendly (Ghibelline) attitude towards the State. As thus
   modified it freed itself up to a certain point from the wild
   apocalyptic elements, and passed over to be merged in the imperialist
   opposition. Here also they were again Franciscans who passed over also,
   and to some extent, indeed, conducted the resistance to the papal power
   (Occam). In this opposition the dispute was by no means about the
   Church as a sacramental institution and as a priesthood, but simply
   about the legitimacy of the hierarchical gradation of rank (including
   the Pope, whose divine appointment Occam contested), and about the
   governing powers of the hierarchy, which were denied. But these powers
   were denied on the ground of the Franciscan view, that the Church
   admits of no secular constitution, and that the hierarchy must be poor
   and without rights. The assigning of the entire legal sphere to the
   State was at bottom an expression of contempt for that sphere, not
   indeed on the part of all literary opponents of the papacy in the
   fourteenth century, but yet on the part of not a few of them. [234] The
   imperialist opposition was dissolved by that of the Councils. Reform of
   the Church in its head and members was the watchword -- but the
   professors of Paris, who, like the German professors in the fifth and
   sixth decades of the present century, gave themselves up to the
   illusion that they sat at the loom of history, understood by this
   reform merely a national-liberal reform of the ecclesiastical
   constitution (after the pattern of the constitution of the University
   of Paris), the restriction of the tyrannical and speculative papal
   rights, the giving to the Council supremacy over the papacy, [235] and
   the liberating of the national Churches from papal oppression, with a
   view to their possessing independence, either perfect or relative. The
   importance of these ideas from the point of view of ecclesiastical
   policy, and the sympathy we must extend to the idealism of these
   professors, must not lead to our being deceived as to the futility of
   their efforts for reform, which were supported by the approval of
   peoples and princes. They attacked at the root the Gregorian
   (Pseudo-Isidorian) development of the ecclesiastical constitution and
   of the papacy; but they did not say to themselves, that this
   development must always again repeat itself if the root, the doctrines
   of the Sacraments and of the priesthood, be left untouched. But how
   could these doctrines be assailed when there was agreement with the
   Curialists in the view taken of salvation and of the law of Christ? In
   face of the actual condition of things, which had developed throughout
   many centuries in the Church, the idea that the Church's disorders
   could be healed by paralysing the papal system of finance, and
   declaring the Council the divinely instituted court of appeal in the
   Church, was a Utopia, the realisation of which during a few decades was
   only apparent. It is somewhat touching to observe with what tenacity in
   the fifteenth, and beginning of the sixteenth, centuries, men clung to
   the hope that a Council could heal the hurt of Israel, and deliver the
   Church from the tyranny of the Pope. The healing indeed came, but in a
   way in which it was not expected, while it was certainly the only
   healing which a Council could permanently bestow -- it came at the
   Councils of Trent and the Vatican. [236]

   Even before the beginning of the great opposition movement of the
   Councils against the papal system, the most important mediæval effort
   towards reform had been initiated -- the Wyclifite, which continued
   itself in the Hussite. In spite of wild extravagances, the movement
   under Wyclif and Huss, in which many of the earlier lines of effort
   converged, must be regarded as the ripest development of mediæval
   reform-agitation. Yet it will appear, that while doing much in the way
   of loosening and preparing, it gave expression to no Reformation
   thought; it, too, confined itself to the ground that was
   Augustinian-Franciscan, with which there was associated only a powerful
   national element. Yet to Wyclif's theory, which Huss simply
   transcribed, [237] a high value is to be attached, as being the only
   coherent theological theory which the Middle Ages opposed to the
   Thomist. All the other mediæval opponents of the Romish Church system
   work with mere measuring-lines or with fragments.

   When we look at what Wyclif and Huss challenged or rejected, we might
   suppose that here a radical criticism of the Catholic conception of the
   Church was carried through, and a new idea of the Church presented.
   Everything must be determined by Holy Scripture; the practice in regard
   to worship and the Sacraments is everywhere represented as perverted
   and as encumbered by the traditions of men; the doctrine of indulgence,
   the practice of auricular confession, the doctrine of
   transubstantiation (Wyclif), the manducatio infidelium (communicating
   of unbelievers), the priests' absolute power of the keys, are as
   zealously opposed as the worship of saints, images, and relics, private
   masses, and the many sacramentalia. For the worship of God there are
   demanded plainness, simplicity, and intelligibility; the people must
   receive what will be inwardly and spiritually edifying (hence the
   preference for the vernacular). [238] With the thorough reform of
   worship and of sacrament celebration there must be a corresponding
   reform of the hierarchy. Here also there must be a reverting to the
   original simplicity. The papacy, as it existed, was regarded as a part
   of Anti-Christ, and this was not less true of the secularised Mendicant
   Monk system (as Lechler has shown, it was only towards the end of his
   life that Wyclif entered upon a vigorous conflict with both; his
   original attitude towards the Mendicant Monks was more friendly). The
   Pope, who contravenes the law of Christ, is the Anti-Christ, and in the
   controversial treatise "de Christo et suo adversario Anti-Christo," it
   is proved that in twelve matters the Pope has apostatised from the law
   and doctrine of Christ. The head of the Church is Christ, not the Pope;
   only through Constantine has the latter, as the bishop of Rome, become
   great. Therefore the Roman bishop must return to a life of apostolic
   service. He is not the direct and proximate vicar of Christ, but is a
   servant of Christ, as are the other bishops as well. The entire
   priestly order exists to serve in humility and love; the State alone
   has to rule. The indispensable condition of priestly service is
   imitation of the suffering man Jesus. If a priest disregards this and
   serves sin, he is no priest, and all his sacred acts are in vain.

   But behind all these positions, which were for the most part already
   made familiar by older reform parties, there lies a distinctly defined
   conception of the Church, which is not new, however, but is rather only
   a variety of the Thomist. Wyclif's conception of the Church can be
   wholly derived from the Augustinian (influence on Wyclif of Thomas of
   Bradwardine, the Augustinian), when the peculiar national and political
   conditions are kept in view under which he stood, [239] and also the
   impression which the Franciscan ideal -- even to the length of
   communism indeed -- made upon him. Huss stood under quite similar
   conditions, and could therefore simply adopt Wyclifism.

   Wyclif sets out from the Augustinian definition of the Church as the
   entire sum of the predestinated in heaven and on earth. To this Church
   the merely præsciti (foreknown) do not belong; they do not belong to it
   even at the time when they are righteous; while, on the other hand,
   every predestinated one is a member of it, even if at the time he is
   still not under grace, or, say, is a heathen or Jew. No one can say of
   himself without special revelation (revelatio specialis) that he
   belongs to this Church. This momentous proposition, which dominates the
   whole of the further discussion, is a clear proof that Wyclif and Huss
   stood on Catholic ground, i.e., that the significance of faith was
   entirely ignored. As a fact, the definition of the Church as
   congregatio fidelium was a mere title; for, as we shall immediately
   see, faith was not what is decisive; it comes to view rather within the
   conception of the Church as merely an empirical mark (equivalent to
   community of the baptized). Further, as it is an established fact that
   no one can be certain of his election -- for how can one surrender
   himself here on earth to the constant feeling of felicity which springs
   from the vision and enjoyment of God after all other feelings have been
   quenched? how is it possible to attain to this state of heart even now?
   -- then there is either no mark at all by which the existence of the
   Church may be determined, or we may rest assured that the Church of
   Christ exists where the legacy of Christ is in force -- the Sacraments
   and the law of Christ. The latter, not the former, is the opinion of
   Wyclif and Huss. The true Church of Christ is where the law of Christ
   reigns, [240] i.e., the law of love, humility, and poverty, which means
   the apostolic life in imitation of Christ, and where, accordingly, the
   Sacraments also, which prepare for the life beyond, are administered in
   the Spirit of Christ. The predestination doctrine is not brought into
   service therefore with the view of making room for faith over against
   the Sacraments, or in order to construct a purely invisible Church --
   what interest would Wyclif and Huss have then had in the reform of the
   empirical Church? [241] -- but it is brought into service that it may
   be possible to oppose the claims of the hierarchy as godless
   pretensions and to set up the law of Christ as the true nota ecclesiæ
   catholica. For from what has been shown it follows that there can be no
   rights in the Church which do not Originate from the acknowledged
   supremacy of the law of Christ. The question is entirely one of
   establishing this law. A leap is taken over faith. The important matter
   is fides caritate formata (faith deriving form from love), i.e.,
   caritas, i.e., the law of the Sermon on the Mount (consilia). [242]
   What is contested is not only the hierarchical gradation, but the
   alleged independent right of the clergy to represent the Church and
   administer the means of grace without observing the law of Christ.
   [243] How can such a right exist, if the Church is nothing but the
   community of the predestinated, and as such can have no other mark save
   the law of Christ? How, again, can acts of priests be valid, when the
   presupposition of all action in the Church, and for the Church, is
   lacking to them -- obedience to the law of Christ? But this law has its
   quintessence in the Sermon on the Mount and in the example of the poor
   life of Jesus; nevertheless (this feature is genuinely Augustinian) the
   whole of Scripture is at the same time the law of Christ. This standard
   then must be applied to all ecclesiastical practice. And yet in its
   application, which of course must become entirely arbitrary as soon as
   the attempt is really made to follow the thousand directions literally,
   everything is to be subordinated to the law of love that ministers in
   poverty and -- to the reigning dogma. With the exception of the
   transubstantiation doctrine, which Wyclif alone objected to, both
   Reformers left dogma entirely untouched, nay, they strengthened it.
   What they aimed at reforming, and did reform, were the ordinances
   relating to worship and Sacraments, which had originated in the
   immediately preceding centuries, and were justly felt by them to be
   restrictions on the full and direct efficacy of word and Sacrament. At
   the same time they did not renounce the view that the numerus
   predestinatorum (number of the predestinated) may find its earthly
   embodiment in a true, empirical Church. It certainly could not but come
   about, that in the Hussite movement, when once the watchword had again
   been emphatically given forth that everything must be reformed
   according to the law of holy Scripture, there should be introduced into
   the Church the disorder and terror connected with Old Testament
   socialist and apocalyptic ideas; but such things seldom last beyond the
   third generation, nor did they last longer then. There was a falling
   back upon patience, and the once aggressive enthusiasm became changed
   into silent mistrust and reserve.

   How this Wyclifite conception of the Church, which really came into
   conflict with the Romish only about the Pope and the sacrament of
   penance, and arose from an over-straining of the good Catholic
   principle of the lex Christi (law of Christ), can be called
   evangelical, is difficult to understand. Equally with Thomas's
   conception of the Church it leaves faith aside, as Luther understood
   it; and it has as its presuppositions, in addition to the
   predestinarian doctrine, the Catholic conception of salvation, the
   Catholic conception of the Sacraments, and the Catholic ideal of
   poverty. It puts an end to the priests who govern the world; but it
   does not put an end to the priests who dispense the Sacraments, who
   expound the law of God, and who alone -- by the apostolic life --
   perfectly fulfil it. Will these world-ruling priests not return, if it
   must really be the highest interest of man to prepare himself for the
   life beyond by means of the Sacraments, seeing that that life is not
   attainable by faith alone, and a clear, certain and perfect faith does
   not fall to the lot of every man? [244] But however certain it is that
   this question can only be answered in the affirmative (as long as the
   Sacraments play the chief part in the Church, the priest will be a man
   of power on earth, and as long as the letter of scripture is regarded
   as the law of Christ, the official interpreters will be the ruling
   authorities in the Church) it is equally certain that the Wyclifite
   conception of the Church represented a great advance. The attempt was
   here made to separate the religious from the secular; moreover, the
   value of the law of Christ, as something spiritual, was placed on a
   level with the value of the Sacraments, nay, the efficacy of all
   ecclesiastical acts was derived from inward Christian disposition; the
   whole "objective" right of a hierarchy in the Church was shaken; [245]
   Christians were most urgently reminded that the gospel has to do with
   life. And this did not take place outside theology, as if these were
   personally-formed notions, but on the ground and in the name of the
   truly ecclesiastical theology.

   About the year 1500 Hussitism, as a great movement, had run its course.
   But it exerted an incalculable influence: it loosened the hold of the
   hierarchical papal conception of the Church on the hearts and minds of
   men, and helped to prepare the way for the great revolution. No doubt
   at the beginning of the Reformation the greatest vagueness of view
   prevailed among the really pious in the land: there was no wish to part
   with the Pope, but episcopalist (conciliar) and Waldensian-Hussite
   ideas were widely disseminated. [246] A distinct settlement was
   necessary: either the establishment of the papal system, or a new view
   of the Church that should be able to furnish a firm basis for the
   numerous and heavy assaults upon that system. The empirico-monarchical
   conception of the Church was challenged by the Episcopalists, the
   juristic by Wyclif and Huss -- in this lies the chief importance of
   these men. But for the juristic conception they substituted a
   moralistic. From the latter the former will always develop itself
   again. What was lacking was the conception of a Church to which one
   belongs through living faith. The mere criticising of the hierarchy,
   however much courage that might imply, was not all that was needed. Nor
   was it enough that the legal ordinances of the Church should be traced
   back to their moral conditions. For having done this Wyclif and Huss
   cannot be too highly praised. But it must not be forgotten that the
   Church of Christ has to take the criteria for judging what she is from
   Romans V.-VIII. One thing, however, and for our purposes the most
   important, will be made apparent from this whole review, namely, that
   the manifold development of the conception of the Church in this
   period, so far from threatening the old dogma, gave it an always firmer
   lodgment -- not, indeed, as a living authority, but as a basis and
   boundary line. Where would the Waldensians and the Hussites, with their
   appeals to the lex Christi, to Scripture and the Apocalypse, have
   arrived at, if they had not been held fast by the quiet but powerful
   force of the ancient dogma?

   But at this point we may extend our observations still a step further.
   Is it the case, then, that the so-called "Reformers before the
   Reformation" were the only reformers before the Reformation, or is it
   not apparent rather that this designation has only a proper meaning
   when it is applied, not to any one phenomenon in the Medieval Church,
   but to the Mediæval Church as a whole? For the highest level of
   observation, there lies between the Christianity of the Ancient Church
   and the Christianity of the Reformation, the Christianity of the Middle
   Ages as the intermediate stage, i.e., as the Pre-Reformation. None of
   its leading tendencies can be dispensed with in the picture, not even
   the hierarchical. The very conception of the Church shows that. For
   those opposing the "Pre-Reformers" represented with their Church ideal
   the certainty that Christ has left behind Him on earth a kingdom, in
   which He, as the exalted One, is present, and the holiness of which
   does not depend on the moral goodness of its members, but on the grace
   which God gives them. This thought they no doubt disfigured and
   secularised, yet it must not be said that it had value for them only in
   its disfigured form. No, even it was for many really an expression of
   Christian piety. They thought of the living and reigning Christ when
   they thought of the Pope and his power, of the bishops and the Church,
   who reduced the whole world to their rule. In this form their faith was
   a necessary complement to the individualistic Christianity of the
   Mystics, and the Reformation with its thesis of the holy community and
   the kingdom of God, which have Christ in their midst, connected itself
   directly with the Catholic thoughts of Augustine and the Middle Ages,
   after it had learned from Paul and Augustine to judge spiritual things
   spiritually.

   temporalem potestatem spirituali subici potestati, nam cum dicat
   apostolus (there follows Rom. XIII. 1) . . .non ordinatæ essent, nisi
   gladius esset sub gladio (the spiritual power trancends in dignity and
   nobility all earthly power as much as the spiritual the earthly). Nam
   veritate testante spiritualis potestas terrenam potestatem instituere"
   (is it literally institute? or institute in the sense of religious
   consecration ? or instruct? In view of the immediately following
   "judicare," and of the sentence of Hugo St. Victor, which is here the
   source, the first meaning is the most probable; Finke [Rom.
   Quartalschrift 4. Supplementheft, 1896, p. 40] is inclined to adopt the
   second) "habet et judicare, si bona non fuerit (there follows Jerem. I.
   10). Ergo si deviat terrena potestas, judicabitur a potestate
   spirituali, sed si deviat spiritualis minor, a suo superiori, si vero
   suprema, a solo deo, non ab homine poterit judicari, testante apostolo
   (1 Cor. II. 25). Est autem hæc auctoritas, etsi data sit homini et
   exerceatur per hominem, non humana sed potius divina, ore divino Petro
   data sibique suisque successoribus in ipso quem confessus fuit petra
   firmata, dicente domino ipsi Petro (Matt. XVI. 19). Quicunque igitur
   huic potestati a deo sic ordinatæ resistit, dei ordinationi resistit,
   nisi duo sicut Manichæus fingat esse principia, quod falsum et
   hæreticum judicamus, quia testante Mose non in principiis sed in
   principio coelum deus creavit et terram. Porro subesse Romano pontifici
   omni humanæ creaturæ declaramus, dicimus, definimus [et pronuntiamus]
   omnino esse de necessitate salutis." As can be understood, the Bull at
   the present day gives trouble to not a few Catholics, and the attempt
   is made to strip it to some extent of its dogmatic authoritative
   character, or to find help in interpretation. A collection of the more
   important papal pronouncements from the time between Gregory VII. and
   Alexander VI. is given by Mirbt, Quellen z. Gesch. des Papstthums,
   1895, p. 47 f.

   [203] Janus, p. 166: "Ready everywhere to interpose and take action as
   agents of the papacy, entirely independent of the bishops, and of
   higher authority than the secular priests and the local clergy, they
   really formed churches within the Church, laboured for the honour and
   aggrandisement of their orders, and for the power of the Pope, on which
   their privileged position rested."

   [204] There are specially to be considered here the Pseudocyrillian
   passages; see the valuable inquiry by Reusch, Die Fälschungen in dem.
   Tractat des Thomas v. Aquin gegen die Griechen, Abhandl. d. k. bay.
   Akad. der Wissensch. III., Cl. 18, Bd. 3 Abth., 1889. On Thomas as the
   normal theologian for the doctrine of infallibility, see Langen, Das
   Vatic. Dogma, 3 Thl., p. 99 ff.; Leitner, Der hl. Thomas über das
   unfehlbare Lehramt des Papstes, 1872, Delitzsch, Lehrsystem der
   römischen K., I., p. 194 ff. Thomas, Summa Sec. Sec. qu. 11 art. 2:
   "Sic ergo aliqui doctores videntur dissensisse vel circa ea quorum
   nihil interest ad fidem utrum sic vel aliter teneatur, vel etiam in
   quibusdam ad fidem pertinentibus, quæ nondum erant per ecclesiam
   determinata. Postquam autem essent auctoritate universalis ecclesiæ
   determinata, si quis tali ordinationi pertinaciter repugnaret,
   hæreticus censeretur. Quæ quidem auctoritas principaliter residet in
   summa pontifce." Sec. Sec. qu. 1 art. 10 ("utrum ad summum pontificem
   pertineat fidei symbolum ordinare?"). Here, as usual, the thesis is
   first denied, then follows: "editio symboli facta est in synodo
   generali, sed hujusmodi synodus auctoritate solius summi pontificis
   potest congregari. Ergo editio symboli ad auctoritatem summi pontificis
   pertinet." Further: "Nova editio symboli necessaria est ad vitandum
   insurgentes errores. Ad illius ergo auctoritatem pertinet editio
   symboli, ad cujus auctoritatem pertinet finaliter determinare ea quæ
   sunt fidei, ut ab omnibus inconcussa fide teneantur. Hoc autem pertinet
   ad auctoritatem summi pontificis, ad quem majores et difficiliores
   ecclesiæ quæstiones referuntur (there follows a passage from the
   decretals). Unde et dominus (Luke XXII. 32) Petro dixit, quem summum
   pontificem constituit: ego pro te rogavi, etc. Et hujus ratio est: quia
   una fides debet esse totius ecclesiæ secundum illud I Cor. I. 10: Id
   ipsum dicatis omnes, et non sint in vobis schismata. Quod servari non
   posset nisi quæstio exorta determinetur per eum, qui toti ecclesiæ
   præest, ut sic ejus sententia a tota ecclesia firmiter teneatur, et
   ideo ad solam auctoritatem summi pontificis pertinet nova editio
   symboli, sicut et omnia alia quæ pertinent ad totam ecclesiam, ut
   congregare synodum generalem et alia hujusmodi." The tenet, that to
   every Pope there belongs personal holiness (Gregory VII.), was no
   longer reasserted, because, as Döllinger (Janus, p. 168) supposes, the
   danger existed of arguing from the defective holiness of a Pope to the
   illegality of his decisions.

   [210] The most extreme works are those of Augustinus Triumphus, Summa
   de ecclesiast. potest. (ob. 1328) and of the Franciscan Alvarus
   Pelagius, De planctu ecclesiæ (ob. 1352). From the Summa de potestate
   eccl. of the former, and from the work de planctu ecclesia of the
   latter, Gieseler II., 3, 2 Aufl., p. 42 ff. and 101 ff., gives full
   extracts, which show that the glorification of the Pope could not be
   carried further in the nineteenth century. Augustinus asserted
   generally: "Nulla lex populo christiano est danda, nisi ipsius papæ
   auctoritate;" for only the papal power is immediately from God, and it
   embraces the jurisdictio et cura totius mundi. Alvarus carried the
   identifying of Christ with the Pope to the point of blasphemy, and at
   the same time declared the Pope to be the rightful possessor of the
   imperium Romanum from the days of Peter. At bottom, both distinguish
   the Pope from God only by saying that to the earthly "dominus deus
   noster papa" (see Finke, l.c., p. 44 ff.; observe that I have placed
   the word "earthly" before the expression, which indicates the trope
   here employed, so far as there is one), adoration is due only
   "ministerialiter." (Finke, l.c., pp. 40-44, has objected to this last
   sentence, and believes he has refuted it from the source, Augustinus
   Triumphus. That, according to Augustinus, there belongs to the Pope the
   servitus summa [i.e., the Latreia, full divine worship] I have not
   asserted. But certainly Augustinus teaches that the Pope possesses
   participative and exercises ministerialiter the summa potestas [the
   dominatio, the divine power of rule]; in accordance with this therefore
   must the dulia also he defined which belongs to the Pope. Instead of
   the somewhat short expression "ministerialiter," which it would be
   better not to use, I should have said: "The adoration" belongs in the
   way in which it is due to him who shares in the divine power of rule,
   and exercises it as an instrument of God.)

   his Summa de ecclesia and the Apparatus super decreto unionis Græcorum.

   [212] Rome, however, always understood these concordata as acts of
   grace, by which only the party admitted to partnership was bound. Even
   at an earlier time this view was maintained by Roman canonists, and was
   deduced from the supreme lordship of the Pope over all men.

   [213] Think of the development of the territorial-prince system in the
   fifteenth century. Great rulers (Emperor Frederick III.) and small
   literally vied with each other, till far on in the sixteenth century,
   in injuring the independence of their national churches. The local
   princes derived a passing, but the Pope the permanent, advantage.

   [214] In the period of conflict between the Popes and the Councils the
   question about the infallibility of the Pope in matters of faith had
   retired into the background. At the Union Council at Florence it was
   not mentioned. Even Torquemada admitted the possibility of a Pope
   falling into a heresy; from this, however, he did not conclude that the
   council was superior to him, for a heretical Pope was ipso facto
   deposed by God. This impracticable, imbecile assumption was first
   rejected by Cajetan, who reverted to the doctrine of Thomas, which was
   based on fictitious passages from the Fathers, while he added himself a
   new falsification by suppressing the proposition laid down at
   Constance: "error est, si per Romanam ecclesiam intelligat universalem
   aut concilium generale." With him also originated the famous
   proposition, that the Catholic Church is the born hand-maid of the
   Pope.

   [215] Janus, p. 365.

   [216] The Pope, it is said in the Bull "Pastor acternus," has the
   "auctoritas super omnia concilia"; he alone may convene, transfer, and
   dissolve them.

   [217] On the handing down of this saying, see Janus, p. 381, n. 407.

   [218] See Döllinger, Ueber das Studium der deutschen Geschichte (Akad.
   Vorträge II., pp. 407 ff., 418 f.

   [219] See Hugo of St. Victor, de Sacr. II., p. II., c. 2 sq. In his
   Sentences the Lombard made no mention whatever of the papacy! So far as
   others dealt with the Church at all, even the firmness of Cyprian in
   apprehending the hierarchical notion of the Church was not reached.
   Numerous proofs in Langen, Das Vaticanische Dogma, 2. Theil. If Hugo
   differs from the other earlier theologians in entering more fully into
   a description of the Church, this has a connection with his interest in
   the Sacraments. What he says about the hierarchy and the Pope falls
   behind the Gregorian ideas, and therefore does nothing to advance them.
   Even about the relation of the Church (the Pope) to the State he has
   still evangelical ideas. And yet here, as elsewhere also, he must be
   held as in many respects the precursor of Thomas.

   [220] It is amazing that in Thomasius-Seeberg (p. 196) the sentence:
   "As in general, so also with regard to the Church, Scholasticism set
   itself the task of proving that what exists ought to exist," is
   followed at once by the other: "It must be emphasised here first of
   all, that Scholasticism does not know of a dogma of the Church."

   [221] The agreement of the "heretics" with the fundamental Catholic
   notion of the Church was not unfrequently substantiated by their
   Catholic opponents. These men were still naïve enough to hold the
   conception of the Church as societas unitatis fidei as their own basis;
   see correct statement by Gottschick (Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch. VIII., p.
   348 f. ).

   [222] The Council of Lyons in 1274 was of epoch-making importance here.
   The vigorous re-awakening of interest in the theoretic statement and
   proof of the papal system in the middle of the fifteenth century
   likewise finds an explanation in the transactions with the Greeks. In
   this way the relation of the Greeks to the West came to be of sinister
   omen. There was a wish to win them for the papacy, and this became the
   occasion for developing "scientifically" for the first time -- mostly
   by means of forgeries -- the papal theory!

   [223] Thomas develops the chief attributes of the Pope (summus
   pontifex, caput ecclesiæ, cura ecclesiæ universalis, plenitudo
   potestatis, potestas determinandi novum symbolum). The discussions on
   the distribution of hierarchical power may here be left aside (on the
   development of the notion of the Church as a monarchy Aristotle's
   influence was at work). We have only to note how entirely the second
   conception of the Church, i.e., the hierarchical, is dominated by the
   doctrine of the Sacraments. The particulars of the Thomist conception
   of the Church were not dogma in his day, but they afterwards became the
   norm for dogmatic construction. That Thomas, moreover, does not place
   the hierarchical notion of the Church side by side with the spiritual
   without indicating a relation has been shown by Gottschick, l.c. pp.
   347-357. Yet it must not be forgotten that such tenets as those of
   Augustine regarding the Church (taken in connection with predestinarian
   grace) continued to exercise their own influence even when they were
   subordinated to alien thoughts. Thomas (Explanation of the Apostolic
   Symbol; see also "Summa" III., qu. 8) begins by representing the Church
   as a religious community (congregatio fidelium, corpus mysticum) whose
   head is Christ. But while so describing it -- as the community of those
   who are united to Christ by the love that proceeds from God -- he at
   the same time accentuates the moral character of the community, as an
   entire whole ruled by the divine law, which embraces the earth, heaven,
   and purgatory, and which has its end in the vision and enjoyment of
   God. In more precisely defining the compass of the Church, Thomas's
   process of proof is affected by all the uncertainties which we already
   observed in Augustine, and which were due to regard on the one hand to
   predestinarian grace (in accordance with which all particulars are
   determined), and on the other hand to the empirical circumstances. Even
   the reprobi, according to him, are in the Church de potentia, that is
   to say, so long as they stand under the influence of the virtus Christi
   or still through their free will hold a connection with him. Now, so
   far as the Church imparts to the individual the love of God, and
   thereby sanctification, it is an external community like the state, is
   discernible by external marks, is defined by an external limit
   (excommunication) and requires the hierarchical organisation; for this
   last is the presupposition of sacramental celebration. If, until
   felicity is reached, the life of the individual as a believer proceeds
   by stages of faith (i.e., of holding true upon authority) and is
   regulated by the several sacraments which contain the saving grace,
   this implies that it is of the essence of the Church that it is the
   authority on doctrine and the administrator of the Sacraments. But this
   it can only be as a community with a strictly legal and hierarchical
   organisation. In this way the second conception of the Church is
   brought by Thomas into closest connection with the first, and
   Gottschick (p. 353) is quite correct in further pointing out that
   "faith in the objective sense is part of the commands of the law by
   which (see above) the Church must be guided." The Church as a legal
   authority on doctrine, and as a priestly sacramental institution, is
   therefore the "exclusive organ by which the Ilead of the Church,
   Christ, forms its members." One sees then that a very spiritual
   conception of the Church, nay, even the predestinarian, can be brought
   into combination with the empirico-hierarchical (Summa III., qu. 64,
   art. 2: "per sacramenta dicitur esse fabricata ecclesia Christi.") As
   salvation is a mystery that cannot be experienced, i.e., as a certainty
   regarding its possession can never be reached, inasmuch as it consists
   of forces that mysteriously operate in the human sphere that is
   inaccessible to reflection, nothing remains but simply to surrender
   one's self to the sacramental saving institution, which, again,
   involves the graded priesthood. In this way the authority of the clergy
   necessarily became absolute, and the spiritual (predestinarian) notion
   of the Church, so far from correcting, necessarily aided this advance
   of view. Hence follows the tenet of the infallibility of the Church,
   which was bound to issue in the infallibility of the Pope; for some
   kind of rock to build on must be sought for and found. If this does not
   lie in an overmastering certainty which the subject-matter itself
   brings with it, inasmuch as it transforms the absoluteness of the moral
   imperative into the absolute certainty of the grace of God in Christ,
   it must be given in something external. This external thing, certainly,
   the infallibility of the priesthood in teaching and administering the
   Sacraments, can never guarantee to the individual the possession of
   salvation, but only its possibility.

   [224] Summa, III. suppl. qu. 40 art. 4 fin.

   [225] The attitude to the State was involved in the position that only
   the priest is able rightly to teach the law of God, but that even the
   States have no other task than to care for the salvation of the souls
   of their subjects by promoting the virtus that corresponds to the law
   of God.

   [226] No good Catholic Christian doubted that in spiritual things the
   clergy were the divinely-appointed superiors of the laity, that this
   power proceeded from the right of the priests to celebrate the
   Sacraments, that the Pope was the real possessor of this power, and was
   far superior to all secular authority. The question, however, as to the
   Pope's power to rule was certainly a subject of controversy.

   [227] A full understanding of the Catholic conception of the Church can
   only be reached by starting from the conception of the Sacraments,
   which, as has been observed, is dependent on the view taken of
   salvation. But from this point of view it can also be said that the
   Catholic notion of the Church forms the necessary supplement to the
   imperfect idea of faith. That which is lacking to faith, taken in the
   Catholic sense, namely, the certitudo salutis, is supplied by the
   doctrinal authority of the Church on the one side and by the
   Sacramental Church institution on the other, and yet in such a way that
   it is obtained only approximately.

   [228] Let it be distinctly noted here that it was just the strict papal
   system that had widely given rise in the period of the great conflicts
   (eleventh and twelfth centuries) to the greatest uncertainty about
   ordinations, seeing that the Popes cancelled without hesitation
   "simonistic" orders, and likewise orders of the imperial bishops, nay,
   even ordinations at which a single simonist had been present. Innocent
   II., indeed, at the second Lateran Council, pronounced invalid all
   ordinations of the schismatics, i.e., of the bishops who adhered to
   Pope Anaclete II. ("From him whom he hath ordained we take away the
   orders" [evacuamus et irritas esse consemus]; the curialist theologians
   are disposed to see in this only a suspension of the exercise of
   office; Hefele, Concil. Gesch. V.2, p. 438 f., leaves the passage
   unexplained; Friedrich [in his edition of Janus, 2 Aufl., pp. 143, 456]
   holds to the cancelling of the orders.) Thus it was the Popes who were
   the instructors of those sects that spread the greatest uncertainty as
   to the most important Catholic question, the question regarding the
   validity of orders. At the time of the Schism it was laid down by the
   papal Secretary, Coluccio Salutato, that as all Church power emanates
   from the Pope, and as a wrongly elected Pope has himself no power, such
   an one can give none; consequently the bishops and priests ordained
   since the death of Gregory XI. were incompetent to dispense the
   Sacraments. If, accordingly, says Coluccio, a believer adores the
   Eucharist that has been consecrated by a bishop ordained in the Schism,
   he worships an idol (in a letter to Jost of Moravia in Martene, Thes.
   Anecd. II., p. 1159, quoted by Janus, p. 318).

   [229] There are referred to here sects like the Catharists and
   Albigenses, "Patarenes," "Bulgarians," as also the adherents of
   Amalrich of Bena, the Ortliebists (allied to the Waldensians), the sect
   of the New Spirit, the sect of the Free Spirit, and many similar
   movements; see Hahn, Gesch. der Ketzer ins Mittelalter, 3 Bdd., Reuter,
   Aufklärung Bd. II., the different works of Ch. Schmidt, Jundt, Preger,
   Haupt; Staude, Urspr. d. Katharer (Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. V. I);
   Döllinger, Beiträge z. Sectengesch. des Mittelalters, 1890.

   [230] See Gottschick in the dissertation cited above and K. Müller,
   Bericht, etc., p. 37 f.

   [231] See above, p. 90, and Müller, Waldesier, p. 93 ff. and passim.

   [232] See Reuter., 1.c. II., p. 191 if., and Archiv. f. Litt.-und
   K.-Gesch. des Mittelalters I., p. 105 ff.

   [233] In greater numbers than before protocols of processes against
   heretics have been published in recent years; see Wattenbach in the
   Sitzungsberichten der Berliner Academie, 1886, IV., and Döllinger,
   l.c., Bd. 2. We can very easily understand how, above all, the charge
   was brought against the heretics that they did away with the
   Sacraments.

   [234] Besides Occam, Marsilius of Padua and John of Jandun are
   specially to he named here; cf. Riezler, Die lit. Widersacher der
   Päpste z. Z. Ludwig's des Bayern, 1874, K. Müller, der Kampf Ludwig's
   d. B. mit der röm. Curie, 2 Bdd., 1879 f., Friedberg, Die Grenzen
   zwischen Staat und Kirche, 1882, the same author, Die mittelalterlichen
   Lehren über d. Verh. v. St. u. K., 1874 Dorner, Das Verhältniss von K.
   u. St. nach Occam (Stud. u. Krit. 1885, IV.). How powerfully the idea
   of the State asserted itself in the fourteenth century (cf. even Dante
   earlier) is well known.

   [235] Cf. the famous decrees of the fourth and fifth Sessions of the
   Council of Constance: "Every legally-convened oecumenical Council
   representing the Church has its authority directly from Christ, and in
   matters of faith, in the settlement of disputes and the reformation of
   the Church in its head and members, every one, even the Pope, is
   subject to it." Even the cardinals did not venture to refuse their
   assent. The Thomist conception of the Church was as yet no dogma; by
   the decisions of Constance it was tacitly -- unfortunately only tacitly
   -- described as error; but at the Council, so far as is known, no voice
   was raised on its behalf, and though Martin V. took his stand at the
   beginning on the newly acquired ground, it was only for a minute. That
   the Council of Bâsle, on an understanding with the Pope, gave a fresh
   declaration of the decrees of Constance, is well known. But thereafter
   Eugene IV. himself, and wisely, brought about the breach. On the
   Council of Constance we shall shortly be able to judge much better than
   before, when the great publication of Finke, Acta concilii
   Constanciensis will be before us, of which the first volume (Acten z.
   Vorgeschichte) has already appeared (1896).

   [236] On the conception of the Church held by the Paris theologians and
   their friends -- they thought of themselves, not without reason, as
   restoring the old Catholic view, yet under quite changed circumstances
   the old thing became a new -- see Schwab, Gerson, 1858, Tschackert,
   d'Ailly, 1877, Hartwig, Henricus de Langenstein, 1858, Brockhaus,
   Nicolai Cusani de concilii univ. potest. sentent., 1867. Also the works
   on Clemange and the Italian and Spanish Episcopalists. In particular
   matters the representatives of the conciliar ideas, at that time and
   later, widely diverged from each other, and more especially, each one
   defined differently the relation of the Pope to the Council and to the
   Church: there were some who held the papacy to be entirely superfluous,
   and some who only wished for it, so to speak, a slight letting of
   blood. The great majority interfered in no way with its existence, but
   aimed merely at purifying and restricting it; see the good review of
   the Episcopal system in Delitzsch, Lehrsystem der rom. K., p. 165 ff.
   Janus, p. 314 ff. No doubt it only needs to be recalled here that the
   Episcopal system arose from the frightful trouble created by the
   Schism, when the Italians wished to wrest back the papacy from the
   French. The termination of the Schism was a real, but it was also the
   only permanent, result of the Councils. Yet it must not be overlooked
   that in the definitions of the Church which the Episcopalists had
   furnished, Reformation elements were included, though these certainly
   were derived almost entirely from Augustine; for Augustine reiterated
   the position that the keys are given, not to an individual, but to the
   Church, and in his dogmatic expositions he always subordinated the
   constitutional to the spiritual unity of the Church.

   [237] Wyclif's works are only now being made fully accessible; cf. the
   Trialogues edited by Lechler, the controversial writings published by
   Buddensieg, and especially the treatise de ecclesia edited by Loserth
   (Wyclif Society from 1882). Monographs by Lechler, 2 vols., 1872 (and
   in Herzog's R.-E.) and by Buddensieg, 1885. The discovery that Huss
   simply, and to a large extent verbally, adopted the Wyclifite doctrine,
   we owe to Loserth (Hus und Wiclif, 1884), see also the same author's
   Introduction to the treatise de ecclesia. The results of Gottschick's
   discussion of Huss's doctrine of the Church (Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch.
   VIII., p. 345 ff.) apply therefore throughout to Wyclif. I do not
   venture an opinion as to how far Wesel and Wessel were influenced by
   Huss. Savonarola continued the opposition of the Mendicant Monks in the
   old style.

   [238] The translation of the Bible was a great achievement of Wyclif;
   but it must not be forgotten that the Church also of the fifteenth
   century concerned itself with Bible translation, as more recent
   investigations have shown.

   [239] This has been observed especially by Buddensieg, l.c. In dealing
   with Wyclif, as with all the opposition movements from the thirteenth
   century to the fifteenth, the great national economical revolution in
   Europe must be remembered. At the same time the Anglo-Saxon type in
   Wyclif, as contrasted with the Romanic, must not be overlooked.

   [240] "Lex Christi" and "lex evangelica" were the terms constantly
   applied to the contents of the New Testament even by the Reformers of
   the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, see Otto Clemen, Pupper von
   Goch (Leipzig, 1896), p. 120 ff.; but at the same time it is in some
   way to hold good that that law is a "lex perfectæ libertatis."

   [241] See Gottschick, 1.c., p. 360 ff.

   [242] See Ritschl, Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung, 2 ed. I., p. 134.

   [243] Huss adhered firmly to the Catholic distinction between clergy
   and laity. Wyclif regarded laymen called directly by Christ as capable
   of priestly acts. But that a direct appointment by Christ is valid
   could scarcely be contested even by a Romish opponent of Wyclif. The
   only question, therefore, must be as to whether such an appointment can
   be established. Hence the assertion that Wyclif and Huss opposed the
   universal priesthood to the priestly order is incorrect.

   [244] See Gottschtck, l.c., p. 364 f.: "Huss has no other view of
   salvation than the ordinary Catholic one. Man's goal is union with God
   through visio dei and the love dependent thereon. There is preparation
   on earth for this by means of faith and the meritorious fulfilment of
   the law of love. By faith is understood throughout the theoretic assent
   to a quantum of doctrines; there suffices for a good part of this
   quantum the fides implicita. Faith having value only as fides caritate
   formata, it follows that the chief matter is fulfilment of the law. But
   the qualification for this is dependent on the infusion of grace on the
   ground of the merit of Christ, a grace whereby sin is abolished. And
   Huss never mentions any other way in which this takes place than by
   preaching and the Sacraments, more particularly baptism and the
   Eucharist or the sacrifice of the mass." Cf. the passages quoted by
   Gottschick, l.c., from the treatise de ecclesia, among which those upon
   fides implicita are specially instructive. I. 38: "Christianus debet
   fidem aliqualiter cognoscere." 62: "Quantum oporteat fidelem de
   necessitate salutis explicite credere, non est meum pro nunc discutere,
   cum deus omnipotens suos electos secundum gradum fidei multiplicem ad
   se trahit." 259: "Quicunque habuerit fidem caritate formatam . . .in
   communi sufficit cum virtute perseverantiæ ad salutem. . . . Non exigit
   deus, ut omnes filii sui sint continue pro viatione sua in actu
   cogitanti particulari de qualibet fidei particula (so always
   quantitatively estimated), sed satis est, quod post posita desidia
   habeant fidem in habitu formatam." Wyclif had a similar opinion ("omnia
   sacramenta sensibilia rite administrata [but for this there is
   requisite also, and above all, the priest who lives like the apostles]
   habent efficaciam salutarem").

   [245] The Council of Constance contested the Wyclifite-Hussite
   propositions that were adverse to the Pope, as also the exclusive
   definition of the Church as universitas prædestinatorum.

   [246] Besides the works on the history of the spread of Hussitism
   (especially von Bezold, Zur Gesch. des Husitenthums 1874, and the
   Studies of Haupt), see the works of Keller, which, however, must be
   used with caution.

   3. On the History of Ecclesiastical Science.

   In connection with the history of piety we have been already obliged to
   enter upon the history of theology; for piety and theology are most
   intimately related in the Middle Ages. In the former chapter also (p.
   23 ff.) a sketch of the history of science till the close of the
   twelfth century has been given. From the immense amount of material in
   the thirteenth to the fifteenth century only some cardinal points shall
   be brought more prominently to view. [247]

   The great advancement of mediæval science from the beginning of the
   thirteenth century was occasioned (1) by the immense triumph of the
   Church and the papacy under Innocent III. and his successors; (2) by
   the intensification of piety in consequence of the Mendicant Orders
   movement; [248] (3) by the enrichment and extension of general culture,
   which was partly a consequence of inner developments, and partly arose
   from contact with the East, in Palestine, Constantinople, and Spain.
   [249] Here the acquaintance, now obtained for the first time, with the
   true Aristotle, the teacher of logic, physics, ethics, and politics,
   became of supreme importance. His philosophy, understood as dogmatism,
   [250] was hailed as a gospel, or at least as the necessary introduction
   to one ("præcursor Christi in naturalibus") and through him the science
   of the thirteenth century received an almost incalculable amount of
   material, and, above all, impulses to master the material.

   The two new forces of commanding importance in the period, the
   Mendicant Orders [251] and Aristotle, had first to achieve a position
   for themselves. At the beginning they met with hostility from the old
   Orders, and from the teachers and universities that were in alliance
   with them. An attitude of self-defence was assumed towards both. The
   new Aristotelianism, indeed, came under ecclesiastical proscription,
   and there was a wish to exclude theologians of the Mendicant Orders
   from university chairs. There were always some, too, who still were
   influenced by the attacks in general on the scientific-dialectic
   theology, which had been made by such men as John of Salisbury and
   Walter of St. Victor. [252] But the new movement asserted itself with
   an irresistible energy, and the opposition was silenced.

   Yet this was only possible because the new factors really furnished
   nothing new, but completed the triumph of the Church over everything
   spiritual. The new Aristotle, as he was understood, taught the theory
   of knowledge, metaphysics and politics, which admitted of a surer
   vindication of dogma against such opposition as had formerly appeared,
   e.g., in William of Champeaux and Roscellin, and offered a defence
   against the dangers both of an eccentric realism and of an empirical
   mode of thought. If it is permissible, nay necessary, to conceive of
   the universals on the one hand, as the archetypes that express the
   cosmos of ideas in the thought of God, then they exist ante rem (before
   the thing); if on the other hand they must be regarded as simply
   realised in things (categories and forms) then they are in re (in the
   thing); if, finally, it is undeniable that it is only by the
   observation of things that they are obtained, that accordingly the
   intellect derives them from experience, then they are post rem (after
   the thing). In this way it was possible to apply to every dogma the
   epistemological mode of view which seemed best fitted to defend it. The
   "qualified" realism, which could assume the most different forms, and
   which had been already represented by Abelard, certainly more in a
   spirit of sceptical reserve than with a view to speculative
   construction, became dominant in the thirteenth century. But what was
   of most importance was that the great theologians who developed it
   showed even greater energy than their predecessors in subordinating the
   whole structure of thought to the principle that all things are to be
   understood by tracing them back to God.

   But the tracing back to God was equivalent to subjecting all knowledge
   to the authority of the Church. The same science which displayed an
   astonishing energy of thought, and through such scholars as Thomas made
   a really important advance upon antiquity in the ethical and political
   sciences, appeared in many respects still more fettered than the
   science of the eleventh and twelfth centuries; for in its view, not
   only the old dogma ("articuli fidei"), but the entire department of
   ecclesiastical practice, the principles of which were traced back to
   the articuli fidei, was absolutely authoritative, and it proceeded much
   more frankly than before on the principle that in particular questions
   every instance of authority had as much weight as a deliberate
   reflection of the understanding.

   It was only in the thirteenth century -- and by the theologians of the
   Mendicant Orders -- that the whole existing structure of
   ecclesiasticism was theologically vindicated, and its newest and most
   questionable parts, as well as the oldest and most important, declared
   inviolate by "science"; it was only in the thirteenth century that
   there was introduced that complete interblending of faith on authority
   and of science which means that at one and the same level there is a
   working at one time with the "credo," at another time with the
   "intelligo"; such interblending is not yet found in Anselm, for
   example. Certainly it was still theoretically held that theology,
   resting on revelation, is a (speculative) science. [253] ^. But it was
   not held as required, nor even as possible, to rear on the basis of
   faith a purely rational structure: there was rather an alternating
   between authority and reason; they were regarded as parallel methods
   which one employed. The object in view indeed continued to be the
   knowledge that culminates in the visio dei; but there was no longer the
   wish always to eliminate more fully as knowledge advanced the element
   of faith (authority) in order to retain at the last pure knowledge; at
   all stages, rather, the element of authority was held as justifiable
   and necessary. Nay, there was now the conviction that there are two
   provinces, that of natural theology, and that of specific (revealed).
   The two, certainly, are thought of as being in closest harmony; but yet
   the conviction has been obtained that there are things known, and
   these, too, the most important, which belong simply to revealed
   theology, and which can be interrelated certainly, but not identified
   with natural theology. Natural theology, moreover, must subordinate
   itself to revealed, for theology has its foundation in revelation. In
   point of fact, however, the dogmatic theologian alternated between
   reason and revelation, and his structure derived its style from the
   former; for in particular questions the content of revelation is not
   derived solely from the thought of redemption -- however truly this, as
   the visio dei, may be the contemplated end -- but is set forth also in
   a thousand isolated portions, which are nothing else than heterogeneous
   fragments of a real or supposed knowledge of the world. It was the
   effect of holding that very conception of the goal of redemption as
   visio dei that the view of the content of revelation threatened to
   become broken up into an incalculable number of things known, and, in
   spite of the still retained title, acquired the character of a natural
   knowledge of supernatural things. Accordingly there was now introduced
   also the idea of articuli mixti, i.e., of such elements of knowledge as
   are given both in a natural way and by revelation, only in the latter
   way, however, in perfection. What appeared outlined already in
   Tertullian (see Vol. V. c. ii.) as the distinctive character of Western
   theology, now came to its fullest development.

   From the newly-discovered Aristotle the scholars derived courage to
   advance from the compilation of mere "sentences" to the rearing of
   entire doctrinal systems. The imposing form of the Church also, with
   the unfolding of its uniform power, may have been a co-operating
   influence here; for the Scholasticism of the thirteenth century
   presents the same spectacle in the sphere of knowledge, which the
   Church of which it is the servant presents in the sphere of human life
   generally. In the one sphere as in the other everything is to be
   reduced to subjection; in the one as in the other everything is to be
   brought into a harmonious system; in the one as in the other the
   position is held, tacitly or expressly, that the Church is Christ, and
   Christ is the Church. Thus the theological science of the thirteenth
   century can be described as the submitting to dialectic-systematic
   revision of ecclesiastical dogma and ecclesiastical practice, with the
   view of unfolding them in a system having unity and comprehending all
   that in the highest sense is worthy of being known, with the view of
   proving them, and so of reducing to the service of the Church all the
   forces of the understanding and the whole product of science. But most
   intimately connected with this end is the other, namely, the
   theologian's attaining in this way to the visio (fruitio) dei; these
   two ends, indeed, are mutually involved, for all knowledge of Church
   doctrine and of Church practice is knowledge of God -- this was taught
   by the Church itself. Now, if the gradual knowledge of God is the only
   means whereby the individual can attain to salvation (visio dei), then
   in theology the objective and subjective aims simply coincide; one
   serves the Church in serving himself, and the converse is equally true.
   The great Schoolmen by no means felt that they wrought as slaves,
   labouring under compulsion for their masters. The only end indeed that
   was clearly before them was their own advancement in the knowledge of
   God; but, standing as faithful sons within the Church, to which all
   power was given in heaven and on earth, their speculations necessarily
   served, with more or less of intention on their part, to glorify the
   Church's power and give a divine character to all that it did. And yet
   how many things did they come to know, the truth of which is entirely
   independent of the truth of Church theory and practice; how necessary
   and how helpful was even this period in the general history of science
   and theology; and how many seeds were sown broadcast by the great
   Schoolmen, of the development of which they did not allow themselves to
   dream! Never yet in the world's history was any science quite fruitless
   which served God with true devotion. Theology has at any time become a
   hindrance, only when it has lost faith in itself or become vacillating.
   We shall see that this was verified also in medieval theology.

   For all that has been stated up to this point applies only to the
   pre-Scotist Scholasticism; it applies above all to Thomas. He
   exercised, moreover, an enduring influence on the period that followed,
   and his influence is still at work at the present day. His predecessors
   and contemporaries have passed out of view in him. The Thomist science,
   as embodied above all in the "Summa," is characterised by the following
   things: (1) by the conviction that religion and theology are
   essentially of a speculative (not practical) nature, that they must
   therefore be imparted and appropriated spiritually, that it is possible
   so to appropriate them, and that ultimately no conflict can arise
   between reason and revelation; (2) by strict adherence to
   Augustinianism, and in particular to the Augustinian doctrines of God,
   predestination, sin and grace, [254] but on the other hand by
   contesting on principle Averrhoism; (3) by a thoroughly minute
   acquaintance with Aristotle, and by a comprehensive and strenuous
   application of the Aristotelian philosophy, so far as Augustinianism
   admitted in any way of this (under the conception of God the
   Areopagitic-Augustinian view is only slightly limited); (4) by a bold
   vindication of the highest ecclesiastical claims by means of an
   ingenious theory of the State, and a wonderfully observant study of the
   empirical tendencies of the papal ecclesiastical and sacramental
   system. Aristotle the politician and Augustine the theologian, two
   enemies, became allies in Thomas; in that consists the importance of
   Thomas in the world's history. While he is a theologian and an
   Augustinian, he is still always an absolute thinker full of confidence;
   and yet it must not be overlooked that in him there are already
   recognisable the seeds of the destruction of the absolute theology.
   Although hidden, arbitrary and relative elements have already found a
   place for themselves in him. It is still his aim to express all things
   in the firm and sure categories of the majesty of the deity whose
   pervasive power controls all things, and to prove the strict necessity
   of all theological deliverances: the Christian religion is believed in
   and demonstrated from principles; but yet at not a few points the
   strength failed, and the thinker was obliged to fall back upon the
   authority which supports the probable, although he understood how to
   maintain for the whole the impression of absolute validity. [255]

   But was this strict necessity of any service at all to the Church?
   Should the Church not rather have been gratified, when the
   understanding perceived its incapacity to follow up the decisions of
   authority, and therefore abandoned further effort? To this question the
   reply must not be absolutely affirmative, but still less must it be
   negative. The Church, as it then already was, and as it still is
   to-day, needs both things; it is indispensable to it that its articuli
   fidei and modes of practice be also proved, and their rationality
   brought to view; but it is still more needful to it that there be a
   blind surrender to its authority.

   In this respect there was still obviously too little done by Thomas. In
   him, the determination of the relation of ratio to auctoritas is,
   indeed, marked by a quite special amount of confusion, the claims of
   faith (as faith on authority) and of knowledge receive no elucidation
   whatever, not to speak of reconciliation, and he stated not a few
   propositions in which there was a complete surrender to authority, that
   "faith" might not be deprived of its "merit" (see the sentence quoted
   above: "Sacred doctrine, however, uses human reason also, not indeed
   for proving faith, for through this the merit of faith would be lost"
   [Utitur tamen sacra doctrina etiam ratione humana, non quidem ad
   probandam fidem, quia per hoc tolleretur meritum fidei]). Yet his real
   interest in theology is still the same as that of Augustine. Theology
   is cognition of God in the strict sense; the necessity, which is
   accentuated in God, must also pervade the whole cognition of Him. The
   articuli fidei, and all results of world-knowledge, must be merged in
   the unity of this knowledge which truly liberates the soul and leads it
   back to God. At bottom the imposing and complicated system is extremely
   simple. Just as the perfect Gothic Cathedral, from its exhibiting what
   is really an organic style, expresses a single architectural thought,
   and subordinates all to this, even making all practical needs of
   worship serviceable to it, so this structure of thought, although all
   ecclesiastical doctrines are submissively and faithfully taken account
   of, still proclaims the one thought, that the soul has had its origin
   in God, and returns to Him through Christ, and even the
   Augustinian-Areopagite turn given to this thought, that God is all in
   all, is not denied by Thomas.

   But this attitude is dangerous. There will always be a fresh
   development from it of the "Spurious Mysticism," as the Catholics call
   it, in which the subject is eager to go his own way, and avoids
   complete dependence upon the Church. Nevertheless, the course of
   scientific development came to be helpful to the Church, and we may
   almost say that the Church here gathered figs of thistles. The
   assiduous study of Aristotle, and the keener perception gained through
   philosophy and observation, weakened the confidence of the theologians
   regarding the rationality and strict necessity of the revealed articles
   of faith. They began to forego revising them by means of reason, and
   subordinating them as component parts of a system to a uniform thought.
   Their scientific sense was strengthened, and when they now turned to
   the revealed tenets, they found in them, not necessity, but
   arbitrariness. Moreover, the further they advanced in psychology and
   secular science and discovered what cognition really is, the more
   sceptical they became towards the "general": "latet dolus in
   generalibus" (deception lurks under general conceptions). They began to
   part with their inward interest in the general, and their faith in it.
   The "idea," which is to be regarded as "substance," and the "necessity"
   of the general, disappeared for them; they lost confidence in the
   knowledge that knows everything. The particular, in its concrete
   expression, acquired interest for them: will rules the world, the will
   of God and the will of the individual, not an incomprehensible
   substance, or a universal intellect that is the product of
   construction. This immense revolution is represented in mediæval
   science by Duns Scotus, the acutest scholastic thinker; [256] but only
   with Occam did it attain completion.

   We should expect that the result of this revolution would have been
   either a protest against the Church doctrine, or an attempt to test it
   by its foundations, and to subject it to critical reconstruction. But
   it was 200 years before these results followed, in Socinianism on the
   one hand, and in the Reformation theology on the other. What happened
   at first was quite different: there was a strengthening of the
   authority of the Church, and, along with full submission to it, a
   laying to its account of responsibility for the articles of faith and
   for the principles of its practice. [257] What was once supported by
   reason in league with authority must now be supported by the latter
   alone. Yet this conversion of things was felt to be by no means an act
   of despair, but to be an obviously required act of obedience to the
   Church, so complete was the supremacy of the latter over the souls of
   men, even though at the time it might be in the deepest debasement.

   When Nominalism obtained supremacy in theology and in the Church, the
   ground was prepared for the threefold development of doctrine in the
   future: Post-Tridentine Catholicism, Protestantism and Socinianism are
   to be understood from this point of view. [258]

   Nominalism exhibits on one side a number of outstanding excellences: it
   had come to see that religion is something different from knowledge and
   philosophy; it had also discovered the importance of the concrete as
   compared with hollow abstractions, and to its perception of this it
   gave brilliant expression, [259] e.g, in psychology; through
   recognising the importance of will, and giving prominence to this
   factor even in God, it strongly accentuated the personality of God, and
   so prepared the way for the suppression of that Areopagite theology,
   from which the danger always arose of its causing the world and the
   reasonable creature to disappear in God; [260] finally, by placing
   restrictions on speculation it brought out more clearly the
   positiveness of historic religion. But this progress in discernment was
   dearly purchased by two heavy sacrifices: first, with the surrender of
   the assurance that an absolute accordant knowledge could be attained,
   there was also surrendered the assurance of the categorical imperative,
   of the strict necessity of the moral in God, and of the moral law; and
   secondly, among the historic magnitudes to which it submitted itself,
   it included the Church with its entire apparatus -- the commands of the
   religious and moral are arbitrary, but the commands of the Church are
   absolute. The haven of rest amidst the doubts and uncertainties of the
   understanding and of the soul is the authority of the Church.

   Neither the latter nor the former was, strictly speaking, an
   innovation. [261] Through the institution of penance an uncertainty
   about the moral had for long become widely diffused: it was only a
   question of expressing in theory what had for centuries been the
   fundamental thought in practice -- the sovereign right of casuistry.
   [262] Moreover, the contradictory mode of procedure, which the great
   Schoolmen (Thomas at the head of them), in obedience to the spirit of
   jurisprudence, applied to each particular dogma and each ethical
   position, necessarily had the effect of shaking the conviction that
   there is something absolutely valid. If, as any page of Thomas will
   suggest, from two to twelve grounds can be adduced for every heresy and
   for many immoral assertions -- if, e.g., there are a dozen grounds on
   which it may be alleged that simplex fornicatio is no mortal sin
   (Thomas), how can the belief be firmly maintained in face of this that
   it must nevertheless be regarded as such?

   From the conflict between yes and no will there always result certainty
   on behalf of the answer which the dogmatic theologian prefers? How can
   certainty be reckoned on at all, so long as there is still one ground
   only for the counter position, and so long as the one ground cannot be
   shown which alone is valid? Nominalism only continued here what Realism
   had begun; it merely did still more in the way of differentiating and
   distinguishing; it extended the recognised method of the acute advocate
   to ever new fields, to the doctrine of God, to the doctrines of
   creation and providence, to the holiness and the honour of God, to sin
   and reconciliation, and it always came to the conclusions, (1) that all
   is relative and arbitrary -- but even in Thomas's dogmatic already much
   that is very important in the doctrine of religion is only
   "conveniens"; (2) that the doctrines of revealed religion conflict with
   natural theology, with the thought of the understanding about God and
   the world (doctrine of double truth). Finally, when Nominalism taught
   that, since belief (credere) and understanding (intelligere) cannot be
   reconciled, there must be a blind surrender to the authority of the
   Church, and that it is just in this blind obedience that both the
   nature, and also the merit, of faith consist, here also it only wrought
   out fully a general Catholic theorem; for Tertullian had as little
   doubt as Thomas that all faith begins with submission. Though
   afterwards -- from the time of Augustine -- many considerations had
   been adduced for modifying the original theorem and changing faith into
   inward assent and love, nevertheless the old position remained the
   same, that faith is originally obedience, and that in this it has its
   initial merit. But if it is obedience, then it is fides implicita,
   i.e., submission is enough. When the later Nominalism declared with
   increasing distinctness the sufficiency of fides implicita, or laid it
   at the foundation of its theological reflections, because many truths
   of faith, taken in general, or as dealt with by individuals, do not
   admit of being accepted in any other way, it only gave to an old
   Catholic thought a thoroughly logical expression; [263] for the danger
   of transforming religion into an ecclesiastical regime was at no time
   absent from Western Catholicism. [264]

   What has already been briefly hinted at above may be distinctly stated
   here -- the problem was the elimination of Augustinianism from the
   ecclesiastical doctrine. The whole turning from Realism to Nominalism
   can be represented theologically under this heading. Augustine falls
   and Aristotle rises -- ostensibly not in theology indeed, but only in
   the field of world-knowledge, yet as a fact in theology as well; for no
   one can keep metaphysics and theology entirely asunder, and the
   theological doctrines of the Nominalists prove that, while they have
   reverently called a halt before the old dogmas, after having shown them
   irrational, on the other hand they have revised in a new-fashioned way
   the circle of the new, and really living, doctrines (Sacraments,
   appropriation of salvation). This work directed itself against
   Augustine, in its directing itself against Thomas.

   We have frequently pointed out already, that the history of Church
   doctrine in the West was a much disguised history of struggle against
   Augustine. His spirit and his piety undoubtedly rose far above the
   average of ecclesiasticism, and the new discoveries which he made were
   in many ways inconvenient to the Church as an ecclesiastical
   institution, and did not harmonise with its tendencies. No doubt the
   Church had accepted Augustinianism, but with the secret reservation
   that it was to be moulded by its own mode of thought. We have seen to
   what extent there was success in that in the period that ends, and in
   the period that begins, with Gregory the Great. Gottschalk already
   experienced what it costs in Catholicism to represent Augustinianism.
   In the time that followed there was developed in the sacramental and
   penance systems a practice and mode of thought that was always the more
   plainly in conflict with Augustinianism; all the more important was the
   fact that the Dominican Order, and especially Thomas, sought to
   rejuvenate the theology of Augustine. Duns Scotus and the Nominalist
   theology directed themselves in the first instance against Augustine's
   philosophy of religion, against those doctrines of the first and last
   things, which gravitated so strongly to pantheism. But in controverting
   these doctrines, and shaking confidence in the doctrine of God as the
   All-One, they also shook confidence, for themselves and others, in the
   Augustinian doctrines of grace and sin, which certainly had the closest
   connection with his doctrine of God. These Nominalists, who (following
   Duns Scotus) always insisted that reason relates to the realm of the
   worldly, and that in spiritual things there must simply be a following
   the traditional authority of revelation, that the understanding,
   therefore, must be left out of play, really wrought in a most vigorous
   way, and with the utmost use of the "understanding," within the lines
   of the Church doctrine. Under certain circumstances "not to speculate"
   leads also to a metaphysic, or at least does not hinder a traditional
   speculation from being corrected and transformed in many of its
   details, and so also in its entire cast. At any rate this principle did
   not prevent the Nominalist theologians from revising the existing dogma
   under the protection of authority. But not only did this work now
   acquire an entirely external, formalistic character, but there were
   also introduced into everything the principles of an arbitrary
   morality, of the "conveniens" too, the expedient and the relative. One
   might say, that the principles of a cosmopolitan diplomacy in matters
   of religion and morals were applied to objective religion and to
   subjective religious life. God is not quite so strict, and not quite so
   holy, as He might be imagined to be; sin is not quite so bad as it
   appears to be to the very tender conscience; guilt is not immeasurably
   great; redemption by Christ, taken as a whole, and in its parts, is
   very serviceable, but not really necessary; faith does not require to
   be full surrender, and even of love a certain amount is really enough.
   That is the "Aristotelianism" of the Nominalistic Schoolmen, which
   Luther declared to be the root of all mischief in the Church; but that
   is also the "Aristotelianism" which must be most welcome to the
   hierarchy; for here they hold the key of the position, seeing that they
   determine how strict God is, how heinous sin is, etc. That at the same
   time they neither can nor will part entirely with Augustinianism
   (Thomism) was remarked above. But they determine where it is to come
   in, and they showed that they watched jealously the extent to which it
   was applied.

   In the Pelagianism and Probabilism of Nominalism there lies the express
   apostasy from Augustinianism. [265] But just because the apostasy was
   so manifest, there could not fail to be a certain reaction -- though
   certainly no longer a strong one -- in the Church. Not only did the
   Dominican Order, in their defending the theology of their great
   teacher, Thomas, persistently defend Augustine also (though not, as a
   rule, in the most important points), but men also appeared in the
   fourteenth and fifteenth centuries who observed the Pelagian tendency
   of Nominalism, and strenuously resisted it in the spirit of Augustine.
   [266] Here Bradwardine must first be mentioned (ob. 1349) who placed
   the entire Augustine, together with the predestination doctrine, in
   strong opposition to the Pelagian tendency of the period. [267] On him
   Wyclif was dependent as a theologian, and as Huss took all his
   theological thoughts from Wyclif, and introduced them into Bohemia and
   Germany, Bradwardine is really to be signalized as the theologian who
   gave the impulse to the Augustinian reactions that accompanied the
   history of the Church till the time of Staupitz and Luther, and that
   prepared the way for the Reformation. In the fifteenth century the men
   were numerous, and some of them influential too, who, standing on the
   shoulders of Augustine, set themselves in opposition to Pelagianism.
   But they neither overthrew, nor wished to overthrow, the strong basis
   of the Nominalist doctrine, the authority of the Church. Moreover,
   Augustinianism exercised an influence in many ways on the reform
   parties and sects; but as no new theology resulted, so also all these
   efforts led to no Reformation. The Augustinians still allowed a wide
   scope to the fides implicita and the Sacraments, because even they
   believed in the idol of Church authority. The reigning theology
   remained unshaken so long as it was not assailed at the root. Even
   attacks so energetic as those of Wesel and Wessel passed without
   general effect. [268] But the fact is unmistakable, that in the course
   of the fifteenth century the Nominalist Scholasticism fell steadily
   into disrepute. While the period revelled in new, fresh impressions and
   perceptions, that theological art became always more formalistic, and
   its barren industry was always the more keenly felt. While the
   rediscovered Platonism was being absorbed with delight, that art still
   lived under the impulses of the Aristotle who had arisen 250 years
   before. The spirit of the Renaissance and of Humanism was in its
   innermost nature alien to the old Scholasticism; for it had no wish for
   formulæ, syllogisms, and authorities; it wished neither the darkness
   nor the illumination of the "Aristotelian" Scholasticism, but was eager
   for life, that can be reproduced in feeling, and for perceptions that
   elevate above the common world and the common art of living. [269] For
   the poets and humanists -- though not for all, yet certainly for the
   most of them -- the ecclesiastical theology, as represented in the
   Scholastic labours of the Schoolmen, was like stagnant, filthy water.
   But still there was always the endeavour to find the redeemers in
   antiquity. Plato, at length the true Plato, was discovered, revered and
   deified. It was not by chance that the Platonic reaction coincided with
   the Augustinian in the fifteenth century; for the two great spirits of
   ancient times had an elective affinity -- Plato's Dialogues and
   Augustine's Confessions are not incapable of being united. The
   influence of Plato and Augustine guided all the movements in the fields
   of science and theology in the fifteenth century that rose against a
   Scholasticism which, in spite of its rich perceptions, had become
   fossilised and hollow, and had lost touch with the needs of the inner
   life and of the present time. The reflection of the Germans was more
   serious than that of the Italians and French. In the last third of the
   fifteenth century Germany took the lead in thought and scholarship. The
   Romanic nations did not produce in the fifteenth century a man like
   Nicolas of Cusa. [270] Nicolas was the precursor and leader of all the
   distinguished men who, in the following century, starting from the
   Platonic view of the world, brought so strong and fresh a current of
   real illuminism into the world. Though fantastical in many ways and
   even greatly interested in magic and ghosts, some of them at once
   discoverers and charlatans, these men laid, nevertheless, the basis for
   the scientific (even experimental) observation of nature, and were the
   restorers of scientific thought. Assurance of the unity of all things
   and the bold flight of imagination -- both of which had been lost by
   scholastic wisdom -- made the new science possible. This science by no
   means arose because Nominalism, or the philosophy of the great student
   of nature, Aristotle, as it was then treated, was always growing more
   empirical, and gradually developed itself into exact science, but a new
   spirit passed over the withered leaves of Scholasticism, scattered them
   boldly to the four winds, and derived confidence and power for
   gathering out of nature and history their secrets, from the living
   speculations of Plato that grasp the whole man, from the original
   historic sources now discovered, and from converse with the living
   reality.

   By theology little advantage, certainly, was derived from this in the
   fifteenth century. The Italian Humanists, the fathers of this European
   movement, practically took nothing to do with it -- at the most they
   instituted some historical investigations, with the view of annoying
   the priests and monks (Laurentius Valla: favours from Constantine,
   origin of the Apostolic Symbol, writings of the Areopagite) -- and even
   the Germans made no real contributions to progress. [271] One could
   help all other sciences by going back upon antiquity, but not theology.
   What it could learn from Plato and the Neoplatonists it had learned
   long before. When men like Nicolas of Cusa sought to release it from
   the embraces of the Schoolmen, they themselves knew of no better form
   for it than that which had been given to it by Augustine and Mystics
   like Eckhart. But trial had been made of this form of long time. Just
   because it appeared unsatisfactory, and there was an unwillingness any
   longer to breathe in this fine fog, there had been, in course of time,
   a passing over to Nominalism. Now, there must be a reverting to the
   beginning -- though it might be better understood. Another prescription
   was not offered. Theology seemed doomed to move helplessly in a circle;
   fundamentally it remained as it was; for the iron ecclesiastical
   authority remained. Then came the help, not from Aristotle, nor even
   from Plato and Augustine, but from the conscience of a Mendicant Monk.

   But what the Renaissance and Humanism did indirectly for theology [272]
   must not be ignored. While it was not really demolished by them, and
   still much less re-shaped, yet for the future re-shaping they certainly
   rendered most valuable services. The sources of history were gradually
   disclosed for it also, and the Humanist Erasmus not only laid the
   foundation of textual criticism of the New Testament and scientific
   patrology, but carried them at once to a high state of perfection. From
   a taste for the original, criticism grew up. What had died out in the
   Church with Origen, nay, in some measure even before Origen, or what --
   keeping out of view a few Antiochians -- had never really developed
   themselves strongly, namely, historic sense and historic exegesis,
   developed themselves now. The Reformation was to reap the benefit of
   them; but by the Reformation also they were soon to be swallowed up
   again. For the history of theology, and of dogmas, in the strictest
   sense of the term, Humanism was otherwise quite unfruitful. Theology
   was put aside by it with a respectful recognition, or with an air of
   cool superiority, or with saucy ridicule. Scarcely anyone approached it
   with serious criticism. Erasmus aimed at giving it a humanistic
   ennoblement and freeing it from restrictions. When the Reformation
   dawned, he pronounced, among other things, the controversy about
   indulgences to be a monks' quarrel, or a delightful dilemma for causing
   stir among the parsons. When things then grew serious and a decision
   had to be made, it became apparent that the Franciscan ideal, in
   peculiar combination with antique reserve and humanistic worldliness,
   with silent hatred of dogma and Church, and external submission, had a
   stronger hold on many aspiring souls than a liking for the gospel.
   [273] The scholar, besides, would not let himself be disturbed by the
   din of the "Lutheran rogues." Theological doctrine was held to be
   something indifferent: "Quieta non movere" -- (let things that are at
   rest not bestirred) -- or, at least, only in the form of a learned
   passage of arms. The avenger was at the door; the following 150 years
   showed the terrified scholars to a frightful extent that theology will
   not be mocked.

   4. The Moulding of Dogma in Scholasticism.

   In the Scholasticism of the thirteenth century the Latin Church
   attained what the Greek Church attained in the eighth century -- a
   uniform systematic exhibition of its faith. This exhibition had as its
   presuppositions, first, Holy Scripture and the articuli fidei, as these
   had been formulated at the Councils; second, Augustinianism; third, the
   ecclesiastical (papal) decisions and the whole development of
   ecclesiasticism from the ninth century; fourth, the Aristotelian
   philosophy.

   We have shown in the third and fourth chapters of Vol. V. how the old
   scheme of Christian doctrine had undergone a trenchant modification at
   the hands of Augustine, but how, in its ultimate basis -- as regards
   the final aim of religion and theology -- it did not lose its
   recognised validity, its form, rather, having only become more
   complicated. While Augustine described the influences of grace that
   operate in the Sacraments as the influences of love, he allowed the old
   view of the Sacraments to remain, namely, that they prepare for, and
   help to secure, the enjoyment of God. But he at the same time gave the
   most powerful impetus to a dual development of piety and ecclesiastical
   doctrine; for the forces of love that operate in the Sacraments
   establish also the "kingdom of righteousness" on earth, produce in this
   way the life in love that corresponds with the "law of Christ," and
   qualify the individual for those good works which establish merit
   before God and create a claim for salvation.

   In this last turn of thought Augustine had subordinated (by means of
   the intermediate idea, "nostra merita dei munera" [our merits gifts of
   God]), his new view of divine grace as a gratia gratis data (grace
   freely given) to the old, chiefly Western, view of religion, as a
   combination of law, performance, and reward, and in the period that
   followed this subordinating process always continued to be carried
   further. Grace (in the form of the Sacraments) and merit (law and
   performance) are the two centres of the curve in the mediæval
   conception of Christianity. But this curve is entirely embedded in
   faith in the Church; for since to the Church (as was not doubted) the
   Sacraments, and the power of the keys dependent on them, were
   entrusted, the Church was not merely the authority for the whole
   combination, but was in a very real sense the continued working of
   Christ Himself, and the body of Christ, which is enhypostatically
   united to Him. In this sense mediæval theology is science of the Church
   (Ecclesiastik), although it had not much to say about the Church. But
   on the other hand, at least till Nominalism triumphed, this theology
   never lost sight of the fundamental Augustinian aim: "Deum et animam
   scire cupio. Nihilne plus? Nihil omnino" (I desire to know God and the
   soul. Nothing more ? No, nothing whatever), i.e., it never discarded
   the view that in all theology what is aimed at ultimately is
   exclusively the cognition of God and of the relation of the individual
   soul to Him. [274] It was the intermingling of theology as
   ecclesiasticism with theology as nourishment for the soul that produced
   within mediæval theology its internal discords, and lent to it its
   charm. From this intermingling also there is to be explained the
   twofold end here set before the Christian religion, although to the
   theologians only one of the ends was consciously present: religion and
   theology must on the one hand lead the individual to salvation (visio
   dei or surrender of the will), but it must on the other hand build up
   on earth the kingdom of virtue and righteousness, which is the
   empirical Church, and bring all powers into subjection to this kingdom.
   [275]

   Augustine utilised in quite a new way the articuli fidei; for him they
   are no longer faith itself; but, re-shaping them in many ways, he
   builds up faith by means of them. Yet their authority was not thereby
   shaken, but in a certain way was still further increased, inasmuch as
   the external authority became greater in the degree in which the
   internal -- that faith identified itself exclusively with them --
   became less. This was exactly how things continued to move on in the
   Middle Ages. It was solely the articles of faith of ecclesiastical
   antiquity that were, in the strict sense, dogmas. Only the doctrine of
   transubstantiation succeeded in winning for itself equal dignity with
   the old dogmas, [276] by the quid pro quo that it is implied in the
   doctrine of the incarnation. When in this way the doctrine of
   transubstantiation took its place side by side with the old dogmas,
   everything really was gained; for by this link of attachment the whole
   sacramental system might be drawn up to the higher level of absolute
   Christian doctrine. This, too, afterwards took place, although, prior
   to the Council of Trent, the distinction was never made in detail
   between what belongs to dogma and what is simply a portion of theology,
   and even after the Council of Trent the Church wisely avoided the
   distinction. It is thus explained how, about the year 1500, no one
   except the most decided papists could affirm how far the province of
   necessary faith in the Church really extended.

   The task of Scholasticism, so far as it was dogmatic theology, was a
   threefold one. Following Augustine, it had to shape the old articuli
   fidei so that they would adjust themselves to the elliptic line drawn
   round the sacrament and merit; it had to revise the doctrine of the
   Sacraments, which had come to it from Augustine in an extremely
   imperfect form; [277] and it had to gather from observation the
   principles of present-day Church practice, and to bring these into
   accord, on the one hand with the articuli fidei, raised to the level of
   theology, and with the doctrine of the Sacraments, and on the other
   hand with Augustinianism. This task became more complicated from the
   fact that the Schoolmen -- at least the earlier -- uniformly combined
   dogmatics with philosophy of religion, and thus introduced into the
   former all the questions of metaphysics, as rising out of the general
   state of knowledge at the time. But this great task was really
   faithfully carried out by mediæval theology. That theology fulfilled
   the claims that were made upon it; indeed, there has probably never
   been a period in history when, after hard labour, theology stood so
   securely in command of the situation, i.e., of its age, as then. At the
   same time it knew how to maintain for itself until the fifteenth
   century the impression of a certain roundedness and unity, and yet left
   room, as the contrast between the Franciscan and Dominican dogmatists
   shows, for different modes of development. Yet on the other hand it
   must not be denied that the opinion here expressed by no means applies
   when we deal with the relation between piety and theology. In the case
   of Thomas, it is true, the claims of the latter and former still
   coincide, although not so perfectly as in the Greek Church at the time
   of the Cappadocians and of Cyril. But from the close of the thirteenth
   century piety and theology manifestly held an increasingly strained
   relation to each other. The former recognised itself always less
   clearly in the latter. They were one, it is true, in their ultimate
   ground (finis religionis, authority of the Church); even the most
   devoted piety was not really able to free itself from these bonds. But
   starting from the common basis, theology unfolded a tendency to treat
   the holy as something authoritative, external and made easy by the
   Church, and this tendency piety viewed with growing suspicion and
   annoyance. In the doctrines of the Sacraments and of grace, as
   Scholasticism gave fuller shape to them -- developing germs which were
   not wanting even in Thomas -- the strain between theology and piety
   reached clearest expression. The Augustinian reactions from the middle
   of the fourteenth century, at one time noisy in their course, at
   another time moving on silently and steadily, were the result of this
   strain. The official theology of the fifteenth century must be
   recognised only in a relative way as the expression of the true
   Catholic piety of the period. This applies even to Tridentine
   Catholicism, and holds true to the present day. The doctrine, as it is,
   is not the sphere in which vital Catholic faith lives. But because its
   foundations are also the foundations of this faith, the faith lets
   itself in the end be satisfied with this doctrine.

   As we have not to do with the philosophy of religion, we must confine
   ourselves in what follows to describing the scholastic revision of the
   old articuli fidei, the scholastic doctrine of the Sacraments, and the
   scholastic discussion of Augustinianism as related to the new Church
   principles, which led finally to an entire dissolution of the Pauline
   Augustinian doctrine. With regard to the first of these points the
   statement can be quite brief, seeing that in the revision of the old
   articuli fidei theological doctrines were dealt with which, as
   scientifically unfolded, never acquired a universal dogmatic
   importance, and seeing that this revision leads over at many points
   into the philosophy of religion.

   A. The Revision of the Traditional Articuli Fidei.

   1. The article "de deo" (on God) was the fundamental and cardinal
   article. [278] In the strictly realistic Scholasticism the Areopagitic
   Augustinian conception of God was held as valid: God as the absolute
   substance. Where this conception was adhered to, its absolute necessity
   for thought was also asserted (Anselm's ontological proof, [279] ) and
   a high value was ascribed to the proofs for God. Through the
   acquaintance with Aristotle, however, the Areopagite conception of God
   was restricted, which had developed itself in Scotus Erigena, Amalrich
   of Bena and David of Dinanto, as well as among the adherents of the
   Averrhoistic Aristotelianism, into pantheism. The cosmological proofs,
   to which preference was more and more given, [280] led also to a
   stricter distinguishing between God and the creature, and Thomas
   himself, although the Areopagite Augustinian conception of God is still
   for him fundamental, stoutly combated pantheism. [281] Following
   Anselm, Thomas also linked the conception of God as the absolute
   substance with that of self-conscious thought, adopted, still further,
   from Aristotle the definition of God as actus purus, and thus gave the
   conception a more living and personal shape. But he had at the same
   time the very deepest interest in emphasising absolute sufficiency and
   necessity in God; for only the necessary can be known with certainty;
   but it is on certain knowledge that salvation, i.e., the visio dei,
   depends. Thomas accordingly now conceived of God, not only as necessary
   being, but also as an end for Himself, so that the world, which He
   creates in goodness, is entirely subordinated to His own purpose, a
   purpose which could realise itself indeed even without the world. [282]
   Yet Duns already combated (against Richard of St. Victor, see also
   Anselm, Monolog.,) the notion of a necessary existence due to itself,
   and thereby really abandoned all proofs of God: [283] the infinite is
   not cognisable by demonstration, and hence can only be believed in on
   authority. Occam made as energetic an attack on the "primum movens
   immobile" (prime immovable mover) and likewise fell back on authority.
   But with the impossibility of demonstrating the infinite, and of giving
   life by speculation to the notion of the "necessarium ex se ipso,"
   there disappeared also for Nominalism the conception of the necessity
   of the inner determinedness of the infinite Being, of whom authority
   taught. God is not summum esse (supreme being) and summa intelligentia
   (supreme intelligence) in the sense in which intelligence belongs to
   the creature, but He is, as measured by the understanding of the
   creature, the unlimited almighty will, the cause of the world, a cause,
   however, which could operate quite otherwise from the way in which it
   does. God is thus the absolutely free will, who simply wills because He
   wills to, i.e., a cognisable ground of the will does not exist. From
   this point of view the doctrine of God becomes as uncertain as, above
   all, the doctrine of grace. Occam went so far as to declare monotheism
   to be only more probable than polytheism; for what can be strictly
   proved is either only the notion of a single supreme Being, but not His
   existence, or the existence of relatively supreme beings, but not the
   one-ness. Accordingly the attributes of God were quite differently
   treated in the Thomist and in the Scotist schools. In the former they
   were strictly derived from a necessary principle, but only to be
   cancelled again in the end, as identical in the one substance, in the
   latter they were relatively determined; in the former -- in accordance
   with the thesis of the summum esse -- a virtual existence of God in the
   world was assumed, and in the last analysis there was no distinguishing
   between the existence of God for Himself and His existence for the
   world, in the latter -- as the world is a free product of God's will,
   entirely disjoined from God -- only an ideal presence of God is taught.
   As can easily be seen, the contrast is ultimately determined by
   different ideas of the position of man and of religion. For the
   Thomists, the idea is that of dependence on God Himself, who
   comprehends and sustains all things, for the Scotists the idea is that
   of independence in relation to God. It certainly meant an important
   advance upon Thomas when God was strictly conceived of by Duns as will
   and person, and was distinguished from the world; but this advance
   becomes at once a serious disadvantage when we can no longer depend
   upon this God, because we are not permitted to think of Him as acting
   according to the highest categories of moral necessity, [284] and when,
   accordingly, the rule holds, that the goodness of the creature consists
   in surrender to the will of God, of which the motives are inscrutable,
   while its content is clearly given in revelation (so Duns). [285] The
   view that contemplates God as also arbitrariness, because He is will,
   becomes ultimately involved in the same difficulties as the view that
   contemplates Him as the all-determining substance, for in both cases
   His essence is shrouded in darkness. But the narrow way that leads to a
   sure and comforting knowledge of God, the way of faith in God as the
   Father of Jesus Christ, the Schoolmen would not follow. Therefore their
   whole doctrine of God, whether it be of a Thomist or of a Scotist cast,
   cannot be used in dogmatic. For on this point dogmatic must keep to its
   own field of knowledge, namely, the historic Christ, and must not fear
   the reproach of "blind faith" ("Kahlerglaubens," collier's faith,) if
   it is blind faith that God can be felt and known only from personal
   life -- and, in a way that awakens conviction, only from the personal
   life of Christ. This does not exclude the truth that Thomistic
   Mysticism can warmly stir the fancy, and gently delude the
   understanding as to the baselessness of speculation. How far, as
   regards the conception of God, mediæval thought in Nominalism had
   drifted from the thought which had once given theological fixity in the
   Church to the articulus de deo, can best be seen when we compare the
   doctrine of God of Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, or John of Damascus with
   that of Duns or Occam. [286] But the whole of dogmatic is dependent on
   the conception of God; for that conception determines both the view of
   salvation and the view of reconciliation. [287] Finally, it must be
   pointed out, that mediæval theology strongly emphasises the conception
   of God as judge, though this conception was not introduced by it into
   speculations as to the nature of God.

   2. Stormy debates on the right way of understanding, and the right way
   of mentally representing the doctrine of the Trinity, [288] had already
   run their course, when the Mendicant Orders made their appearance in
   science. The bold attempts to make the mystery more intelligible,
   whether by approximating to tritheism (Roscellin), [289] or by passing
   over to Modalism (Abelard), were rejected in the period of Anselm and
   Bernard (against Gilbert). [290] Where Augustine's treatise De
   trinitate was studied and followed, a fine Modalism introduced itself
   everywhere, [291] and it was easy for any one who wished to convict
   another of heresy to bring the reproach of Sabellianism against his
   opponent who was influenced by Augustine. Even the Lombard was charged
   with giving too much independence to the divina essentia, and with thus
   teaching a quaternity, or a species of Sabellianism. [292] The lesson
   derived in the thirteenth century from these experiences was to guard
   the trinitarian dogma by a still greater mustering of terminological
   distincions than Augustine had recourse to. The exposition of the
   doctrine of the Trinity continued to be the high school of logic and
   dialectic. In Thomism the doctrine still had a relation to the idea of
   the world, in so far as the hypostasis of the Son was not sharply
   marked off from the world-idea in God. Thomism was also necessarily
   obliged to retain its leaning to Modalism, as the conception of God did
   not at bottom admit of the assumption of distinctions in God, but
   reduced the distinctions to relations, which themselves again had to be
   neutralised. The Scotist School, on the other hand, kept the persons
   sharply asunder. But this school, especially in its later period, could
   equally well have defended, or yielded submission to, the quaternity,
   or any other doctrine of God whatever. But before this the whole
   doctrine had already come to be a mere problem of the schools, having
   no relation to living faith. The respect that was paid to it as the
   fundamental dogma of the Church was in flagrant contrast with the
   incapacity to raise it in theological discussion above the level of a
   logical mystery. Like Augustine in his day, the mediæval theologians
   let it be seen that they would not have set up this dogma if it had not
   come to them by tradition, and the decree of the Lateran Council (see
   page 182, note 7,) which places behind the persons a "res non generans
   neque genita nec procedens" (a thing not begetting nor begotten nor
   proceeding) really transforms the persons into mere modalities kat'
   epinoian (existing for thought), or into inner processes in God. Or is
   it still a doctrine of the Trinity, when the immanent thinking and the
   immanent willing in God are defined and objectified as generare and
   spirare (begetting and breathing)? But in Nominalism the treatment of
   this dogma grew no better. The Thomist School was certainly still
   regulated by a concrete thought, when it sought to make the Trinity
   more intelligible by means of analogies; for according to these the
   finite world, and especially the rational creature, show traces of the
   divine nature and the divine attributes. But this idea Scotism had set
   aside, emphasising the threefold personality as revealed fact. Its
   "subtle investigations," even Schwane confesses, [293] "went astray too
   much into a region of formalism, and came to be a playing with
   notions."

   3. The doctrine of the eternity of the world [294] was universally
   combated, and the creation from nothing adhered to as an article of
   faith. But only the Post-Thomist Schoolmen expressed the temporality of
   the world, and creation out of nothing, in strict formulæ. Although
   Thomas rejected the pantheism of the Neoplatonic-Erigenistic mode of
   thought, there are still to be found in him traces of the idea that
   creation is the actualising of the divine ideas, that is, their passing
   into the creaturely form of subsistence. Further, he holds, on the
   basis of the Areopagite conception of God, that all that is has its
   existence "by participating in him who alone exists through himself"
   (participatione ejus, qui solum per se ipsum est). But both thoughts
   obscure the conception of creation. [295] Hence it is characteristic of
   Thomas, who elsewhere, as a rule, finds strict necessity, that he
   refrains from showing that the world's having a beginning is a doctrine
   necessary for thought; Summa., P. I., Q. 46, Art. 2: "It is to be
   asserted that the world's not having always existed is held by faith
   alone, and cannot be proved demonstratively: as was asserted also above
   regarding the mystery of the Trinity . . .that the world had a
   beginning is credible, but not demonstrable or knowable. And it is
   useful to consider this, in case perhaps some one, presuming to
   demonstrate what is of faith, should adduce reasons that are not
   necessary, thus giving occasion for ridicule to infidels, who might
   think that on the ground of such reasons we believe what is of faith."
   If only Thomas had always taken to heart these splendid words, which,
   moreover, were directed against Bonaventura and Albertus Magnus, who
   undertook to prove the beginning of the world in time a doctrine of
   reason! Duns Scotus and his school naturally followed Thomas here, in
   so far as they held the temporality of the world as guaranteed simply
   by the authority of faith. [296] Yet the view of Albertus certainly
   survived at the same time in the Church. The purpose of the creation of
   the world was taken by all the Schoolmen to be the exhibition of the
   love (bonitas) of God, which seeks to communicate itself to other
   beings. Even Thomas, correcting the Areopagite conception of God,
   declared the creation of the world no longer a necessary, but only a
   contingent, means, whereby God fulfils His personal end. Yet he
   certainly represented the personal end of God, which is freely realised
   in creation, as the supreme thought: "divina bonitas est finis rerum
   omnium" [297] (the divine love is the end of all things), i.e., God's
   willing His own blessedness embraces all movements whatever of that
   which exists, His willing it by means of creation of the world is His
   free will; but as He has so willed to create, the end of the creature
   is entirely included in the divine end ; the creature has no end of its
   own, but realises the divine end, which is itself nothing but the
   actualising of the love (bonitas). In this way the pantheistic acosmism
   is certainly not quite banished, while on the other hand, in the thesis
   of Thomas, that God necessarily conceived from eternity the idea of the
   world, because this idea coincides with His knowledge and so also with
   His being, the pancosmistic conception of God is not definitely
   excluded. In the Scotist school, the personal end of God and the end of
   the creature are sharply disconnected. [298] As regards divine
   providence, from the time of Anselm and Abelard onwards, all the
   questions were again treated which were formerly dealt with by Origen;
   but from the time of Thomas they were added to in an extraordinary
   degree, so that quite new terminology was here created. [299] To the
   question whether this world is the best, Thomas gave a negative answer,
   after Anselm had answered it in the affirmative; yet even Thomas thinks
   this universe cannot be better; God, however, could have created other
   things, which would have been still better. [300] As a consequence of
   his fundamental view, Thomas assumes that God directs all things
   immediately; yet the greater the independence was that was attributed
   to the world, the stronger became the opposition to this thesis. In the
   theodicy, moreover, which was vigorously revised in the thirteenth
   century in opposition to the dualistic sects, Thomas attached himself
   more closely to Augustine. He did not shrink from the thought that God
   produces "quasi per accidens" (as it were accidentally) the
   corruptiones rerum (corruption in things); for the "perfection of
   things in the universe requires that there shall be not only
   incorruptible, but also corruptible entities" ("perfectio rerum
   universitatis requirit, ut non solum sint entia incorruptibilia, sed
   etiam corruptibilia"); but from this it follows that the perfectio
   universi requires beings that can fall from the good, "ex quo sequitur
   ea interdum deficere" (from which it follows that they are sometimes
   defective). [301] In these doctrines, too, greater caution came to be
   exercised, as the distinction came to be more sharply drawn between
   God, and the creature as endowed with its own volitional movement.
   [302]

   4. The history of Christology was similar to that of the doctrine of
   the Trinity. In the twelfth century there was still much keen
   discussion with regard to the former, as the satisfaction was not
   general with the Greek scheme that had been framed in opposition to
   Adoptianism (Abelard's Nestorian Christology was a protest against the
   doctrine of John of Damascus and of Alcuin, and continued to extend its
   influence). [303] Even the Lombard, although, with Alcuin, he denies
   that the Logos assumed a human person, [304] still gravitated --
   certainly in a very peculiar way -- to a Nestorian thought, in so far
   as he denied, in the interest of the immutability of God, that by the
   incarnation God "became" something, the humanity rather being for him
   only like a garment. [305] But against this doctrine, described as
   Nihilianism, and adopted by the dialecticians (Christ was, as man, non
   aliquid [not something]), a strong opposition was raised in the period
   of Alexander III., especially by German scholars (Gerhoch); there was
   asserted, in opposition to it, the most complete and real
   interpenetration of deity and humanity in Christ (see Alcuin), and the
   Lombard's doctrine was even publicly described as dangerous. [306] With
   this "nota" against "Nihilianism," the doctrine of the two natures came
   to the great Schoolmen, and the problem of the "hypostatic union" now
   became as much the field of contest for the acutest thought as the
   problem of the Trinity. [307] At the same time the view all took of the
   communicatio idiomatum implied that the thought must be excluded of a
   human person as existing for himself in Christ. But here, also, there
   resulted important differences between the Thomists and Scotists; for
   Thomas made the greatest effort to give such predominance to the divine
   factor that the human became merely something passive and accidental;
   as he was influenced by the Areopagite, he continued also, in a very
   real way, the Greek Monophysite Christology; nor was there wanting to
   him the Areopagite background, that the Logos entered into just the
   same relation to human nature as a whole, into which he entered with
   the human nature of Jesus. Against this Scotus made an effort, in a
   very modest way, and with a profusion of confusingly complicated
   terminology, to save something more of the humanity of Christ. But in
   return for this, he has to hear the verdict of modern Catholic
   theologians of dogma, that "he won for himself no laurels; that what he
   did, rather, in this field, with his critical censures (of the Angelic
   Doctor) was mostly a fiasco." [308] His effort to attribute existence
   even to the human individual nature of Christ was disapproved. His mild
   attempts, likewise, were repudiated to fix certain limits to the human
   knowledge of Christ, and to deduce the sinlessness of the human will of
   Jesus, not from the hypostatic union, but from the "plenissima fruitio
   quam habuit Christus" (fullest enjoyment that Christ had), i.e., from
   his perfect surrender of will. [309] On this field Thomism continued
   victorious. The Scotists did not succeed in securing the recognition of
   a special mode of being for the individual human nature of Christ.
   [310]

   The victory of the Monophysite doctrine of Christ concealed under the
   Chalcedonian formulæ, [311] was all the more surprising from no
   practical religious use whatever being made of it, the real interest in
   Christ finding expression rather, on the one hand, in the idea of the
   poor life of Jesus and the Ecce homo, on the other hand, in the
   doctrines of reconciliation and of the Sacraments. [312] But it is only
   apparently that the doctrine of reconciliation has the Greek
   Christology, together with the doctrine of the two natures, as its
   presupposition. This has been shown already above in connection with
   the reconciliation doctrine of Anselm, Abelard, and the Lombard. [313]
   It still remains to us here to specify concisely the thoughts of the
   later Schoolmen on the work of Christ. [314]

   The Lombard had brought the merit of Christ into the foreground, and at
   the same time had given expression to all possible thoughts about
   redemption by Christ -- the Anselmic theory excepted -- and had
   attached himself closely to Augustine and Abelard ("reconciliati sumus
   deo diligenti nos" [we are reconciled to God, who loves us]). The
   modification in the thirteenth century consisted now in this, that, in
   opposition to Abelard, and with a certain adherence to Anselm,
   objective redemption (in its bearing upon God) was brought into the
   foreground, but at the same time, the point of view of merit, which
   Anselm had only suggested, was strongly emphasised. This turn of things
   appears already in Alexander of Hales and Albertus; but Thomas was the
   first to furnish a full, strictly-thought-out doctrine of redemption.
   Certainly even he alternates between the points of view, which is
   always a sign that the point of view is not firmly got hold of; for,
   where the sufficient reason is wanting, reasons tend to accumulate. But
   the sufficient reason was really wanting to Thomas; for P. III., Q. 46,
   Art. 1-3, the necessity of the death of Christ is explicitly rejected
   -- God could also have simply remitted sin in the exercise of His free
   will, -- the chosen way of deliverance by the death of Christ
   (liberatio per mortem Christi) is only the most fitting, because, by
   it, more and greater things are imparted to us than if we were redeemed
   solely by the will of God (sola voluntate dei).

   There were three points of view especially which Thomas applied. First,
   he stated (Q. 46) a large number of arguments that were intended to
   prove that the death of Christ, with all the circumstances of His
   suffering, was the most fitting means of redemption. Within the lines
   of this idea many points of view are already suggested that deal with
   the facts. But above all the infinite pain which He endured is taken
   into account. His suffering (during His whole life and in death) is
   represented as being the sum of all conceivable suffering, in the sense
   too of its being His own pain and the pain of sympathy on account of
   our sin. Here justice is done to the Abelardian-Augustinian tradition,
   viz., that the suffering of Christ, the Mediatorial Man, is redemptive,
   inasmuch as it brings God's love home to our hearts, becomes an example
   to us, recalls us from sin, and stirs as a motive responsive love. But
   on the other hand, the convenientius (more fitting) in an objective
   sense is also already brought out here, inasmuch as the death of Christ
   was the most fitting means for winning for men the gratia justificans
   (justifying grace) and the gloria beatitudinis (glory of beatitude).
   [315]

   In Q. 408, new points of view are now introduced under the heading "de
   modo passionis Christi quantum ad effectum" (on the mode of Christ's
   suffering as regards its effect). The hypothetical character here
   passes into the rear behind the necessary result of the suffering. But
   the whole inquiry is dominated by the fundamental thought: "Christus
   non est passus secundum divinitatem, sed secundum carnem," (Christ did
   not suffer as to His divinity, but as to His flesh), with which the
   divinity associated itself. Here the death of Christ is placed under
   the points of view of merit (Art. 1), satisfaction (Art. 2), sacrifice
   (Art. 3), redemption (Arts. 4 and 5), and "efficientia" (Art. 6). This
   is succeeded, in Quest. 49, by an inquiry as to how far the death of
   Christ has freed us from sin (Art. 1), from the power of the devil
   (Art. 2), and from liability to penalty (a reatu poenæ) (Art. 3), and
   again, as to whether by it we are reconciled to God (Art. 4), whether
   by it entrance to heaven is secured for us (Art. 5), and whether by it
   Christ was exalted (Art. 6). Among these points of view there stand out
   prominently (secondly) that of satisfaction and (thirdly) that of merit
   as specially important.

   The conception of satisfaction is obtained by taking (against Anselm)
   in the strictest sense the voluntariness of Christ's sufferings, and
   then defining this voluntary suffering according to the particular
   rule, that satisfaction always consists in a gift for which the party
   injured has more love than he has hatred for the injury. This is shown
   in the suffering of Christ, which is described (see above) as not only
   suffering in death but suffering in life, [316] and which has its value
   in the divine-human life of the Mediator. Just on that account the
   satisfactio is not only sufficient but superabundans; [317] i.e., it is
   not only æqualis omnibus peccatis humani generis (equal to all the sins
   of the human race), but positively in excess of them. In this way an
   idea is obtained which, though apparently unobjectionable and worthy,
   was to give occasion to the most unhappy speculations. A vicarious
   penal suffering, in the strict sense of the terms, is not recognised
   even by Thomas, because on the whole question he allowed only a limited
   range to the justitia dei. [318] Still, some lines of exposition in
   Quest. 49 touch on that thought. [319]

   With regard to merit, a distinct idea is to be got under this term as
   to how far Christ's suffering really profits individuals. It is a
   circumstance of value that Thomas sets aside, and ceases to employ, the
   Greek thought which dominates his doctrine of the person of Christ,
   namely, that the humanity of Christ is in itself human nature in
   general. With this mechanical idea of the matter he was not satisfied.
   Here also we see that between his doctrine of the person of Christ, and
   his doctrine of His work, there is quite a chasm. Only once [320] does
   he touch on the thought that God is reconciled because He has now found
   the good in human nature. Elsewhere he has quite a different view, with
   which indeed he crowns his discussion (Q. 48, 1), and of which as his
   discussion proceeds he never loses sight. It is the view hinted at by
   Anselm, that by His voluntary suffering Christ merited exaltation (Q.
   49, 6), that the exaltation, however, cannot be conferred upon Him, but
   passes over from Him to the Church of which He is the Head. [321] The
   fulness with which Thomas stated and repeated this thought is a
   guarantee that for him it was an extremely valuable one. It has also
   been expressed by him thus (Q. 48, Art. 2): "The head and the members
   are, as it were, one mystical person, and thus the satisfaction of
   Christ belongs to all believers, just as to His own members" (caput et
   membra sunt quasi una persona mystica, et ideo satisfactio Christi ad
   omnes fideles pertinet, sicut ad sua membra). Here, finally, the
   conception of the faithful (fideles) also (as the ecclesia) is
   introduced into the question about the effect and bearings of
   redemption; but only in the 1st Art. of Quest. 49 has Thomas come to
   deal more closely with faith -- simply however to pass over at once to
   love: "It must be affirmed that by faith also there is applied to us
   the passion of Christ, with a view to its fruit being seen, according
   to the passage Rom. 3: Whom God hath set forth as a propitiator through
   faith, etc.' But the faith by which we are cleansed from sin is not
   fides informis, (unformed faith), which can exist even along with sin,
   but is fides formata per caritatem (faith deriving form from love), so
   that in this way the passion of Christ is applied to us, not
   intellectually merely, but also effectually." ("Dicendum quod etiam per
   fidem applicatur nobis passio Christi ad percipiendum fructum ipsius,
   secundum illud Rom. 3: Quem proposuit deus propitiatorem per fidem,
   etc.' Fides autem per quam a peccato mundamur non est fides informis,
   quæ potest esse etiam cum peccato, sed est fides formata per caritatem,
   ut sic passio Christi nobis applicetur, non solum quantum ad
   intellectum, sed etiam quantum ad effectum.")

   When we review the exposition given by Thomas, we cannot escape the
   impression created by confusion (multa, non multum, [many things, not
   much]). The wavering between the hypothetical and the necessary modes
   of view, between objective and subjective redemption, further, between
   the different points of view of redemption, and finally, between a
   satisfactio superabundans and the assertion that for the sins after
   baptism we have to supplement the work of Christ, prevents any distinct
   impression arising. It was only a natural course of development when
   Duns Scotus went on to reduce everything entirely to the relative. It
   is what always happens when an attempt is made to find a surer hold for
   the actual in what is assumed to be the metaphysically necessary; this
   actual presents itself in the end only as the possible, and so, very
   soon also, as the irrational. No one thought of the moral necessity of
   penalty.

   Duns Scotus draws the true logical conclusion from the theory of
   satisfaction (as distinguished from the idea of vicarious penal
   suffering), by tracing everything to the "acceptatio" of God. All
   satisfaction and all merit obtain their worth from the arbitrary
   estimation of the receiver. Hence the value of Christ's death was as
   high as God chose to rate it. But in the strict sense of the term
   infinity cannot at all be spoken of here ; for (1) sin itself is not
   infinite, seeing that it is committed by finite beings (it is, at the
   most, quasi infinite, when it is measured, that is to say, though this
   is not necessary, by the injury done to the infinite God); (2) the
   merit of Christ is not infinite, for He suffered in His human (finite)
   nature [322] ; (3) in no sense is an infinite merit needed, because God
   can estimate any merit as highly as He pleases; for nothing is
   meritorious in itself, because nothing is good in itself, but the
   sovereign divine will declares what it wills to be good and
   meritorious. And so Duns has not hesitated to assert that an angel, or
   even a purus homo who should have remained free from original sin and
   been endowed with grace, could have redeemed us. It is a question
   merely of receiving the first impulse; the rest every man must acquire
   for himself together with grace. Grace must only raise him, so to
   speak, above the point at which he is dead. Of course, Duns made the
   further effort to show the conveniens of the death of the God-man, and
   here he works out essentially the same thoughts as Thomas. But this no
   more belongs, strictly speaking, to dogmatic. For dogmatic, it is
   enough if it is proved that in virtue of His arbitrary will God has
   destined a particular number to salvation; that in virtue of the same
   arbitrary will He already determined before the creation of the world,
   that the election should be carried out through the suffering of the
   God-man; and that He now completes this plan by accepting the merit of
   the God-man, imparting the gratia prima to the elect, and then
   expecting the rest from their personal efforts. Here the reason at
   bottom for Christ's having died is its having been prophesied (see
   Justin), and it was prophesied because God so decreed it. Everything
   "infinite" -- which is surely the expression for what is divine and
   alone of its kind -- is here cleared away; as a fact, human action
   would have been enough here, for nothing is necessary in the moral
   sense, and nowhere does there appear more than a quasi-infinity. [323]
   This theory, the product of thought on the uncontrollable,
   predestinating arbitrariness of God (and on legal righteousness),
   stands side by side with an explicit doctrine of two natures! [324] But
   it is quite distinctly irreligious in this respect, that it confines
   the work of Christ to the procuring of that "gratia prima" (primary
   grace), which is nothing but the creating of a kind of possibility, in
   order that man may himself take concern for the reality of his
   redemption. [325]

   By Scotus it was brought about that this doctrine also became severed
   from faith, and was entirely transformed into a dialectic problem. In
   this lies the disintegration of dogma through Scotism. The doctrine of
   the Trinity, Christology, and the doctrine of redemption, were now
   happily withdrawn from the domain of the inwardly necessary, comforting
   faith that saves. Thus it continued to be in the Nominalist school.
   Only in the one particular, which, however, was constantly brought
   under the category of the conveniens -- namely, that the love of God
   shown in the death of Christ becomes a motive to reciprocal love -- did
   there survive a meagre remnant of an inspiring thought. While in the
   fourteenth century the Scotist theory of satisfactio secundum
   acceptationem (satisfaction on the ground of acceptance) gained always
   more adherents, was here and there carried even to the point of
   blasphemy by the formalism of dialectic, and had an influence even on
   the Thomists, traces are not wanting in the fifteenth century that more
   serious reflection, dealing with the essence of the matter, had begun
   to return. This had undoubtedly a connection with the revival of
   Augustinianism, perhaps also with a renewed study of St. Bernard, and
   it is to be met with more in the practical religious, than in the
   systematic expositions; indeed, in the former the thought of Christ's
   having borne the penalty of guilt in the interests of the righteousness
   of God seems never to have entirely disappeared. Ritschl points to
   Gerson. [326] "Gerson declares sin to be the crime of high treason, and
   finds God's righteousness so great that in mercy He surrenders His
   innocent Son to penalty, evidences, in this way, the harmony between
   His righteousness and His mercy, and removes sin on condition that the
   sinner unites himself to Christ by faith, i.e., by obedience and
   imitation. [327] In the Nominalist school the same view is still to be
   met with in Gabriel Biel. [328] In the end, even John Wessel comes back
   to it." But Ritschl is inclined to think that the idea of the penal
   value of Christ's death, which, from the time of Athanasius, had ever
   again appeared sporadically in the Church, did not pass from Biel and
   Wessel to the Reformers. [329]

   B. The Scholastic Doctrine of the Sacraments. [330]

   The uncertainty of the Schoolmen regarding the doctrine of redemption,
   and the fact that the treatment of it could be as easily relegated by
   them to the School as the doctrines of the Trinity and of the natures
   in Christ, are explained from the circumstance, that in the doctrine of
   the Sacraments it was definitely set forth what faith in the divine
   grace in Christ needed. In the Sacraments this grace is exhibited, and
   in the Sacrament of the Eucharist particularly it is clearly and
   intelligibly traced back -- through the doctrine of transubstantiation
   -- to the in-carnation and death of Christ. That was enough. Those
   facts now form merely the presuppositions; faith lives in the
   contemplation and enjoyment of the Sacraments. But the Sacraments are
   committed to the Church, and are administered by the hierarchy (as
   servants, priests, and as judges). Thus the connection with Christ,
   which is effected only through the Sacraments, is at the same time
   mediated by the Church. Christ and the Church indeed are really made
   one, in so far as the same Church which administers the Sacraments is
   also, as the mystical body of Christ, so to speak, one mystical person
   with Him. This is the fundamental thought of Mediæval Catholicism,
   which was adhered to even by the majority of those who opposed
   themselves to the ruling hierarchy.

   The Schoolmen's doctrine of the Sacraments has its root in that of
   Augustine; but it goes far beyond it (formally and materially). Above
   all, there was not merely a passing out of view in the Middle Ages of
   the connection between verbum and sacramentum, on which Augustine had
   laid such stress, but the verbum disappeared entirely behind the
   sacramental sign. The conception became still more magical, and
   consequently more objectionable. On the other hand, it cannot be denied
   that in its seven Sacraments Catholicism created a very efficient and
   impressive institution of an educational kind, the service of which,
   however, for the individual, did not consist in giving him certainty of
   salvation, but in training him as a member of the Church. And yet the
   mediæval doctrine of the Sacraments must be regarded, at least in its
   Thomist form, as the logical development of the Old Catholic
   fundamental view; for the definition of grace given by Thomas (P. III.,
   Q. 62, Art. 1): "grace is nothing else than the communicated likeness
   of the divine nature, according to the passage II Pet. I: he hath given
   to us great and precious promises, that we may be partakers of the
   divine nature" (gratia nihil est aliud quam participata similitudo
   divinæ naturae secundum illud, II Pet. I: Magna nobis et pretiosa
   promissa donavit, ut divina simus consortes natura), allows of no other
   form of grace than the magical sacramental. Augustine's view, which,
   however, does not at bottom contradict the one just stated, is here
   thrust aside, and only comes under consideration so far as a link with
   it is found in the "participata similitudo divine naturae"
   (communicated likeness of the divine nature). Hence the further
   suppression of the verbum, to which even Augustine, though he has the
   merit of having taken account of it, had not done full justice.

   A strictly developed doctrine of the Sacraments could not exist, so
   long as the number of the Sacraments was not definitely fixed. But on
   this point, as antiquity had handed down nothing certain, the greatest
   vacillation prevailed for centuries, so difficult was it to determine
   anything which had not already been determined by the tradition of
   ancient times. The doctrine of the Sacraments was accordingly developed
   under the disadvantage of not knowing for certain to what sacred acts
   the general conceptions were to be applied. Still, theology had already
   wrought for long with the number seven, before the number was
   officially recognised by the Church.

   The number seven developed itself in the following way: As sacred acts
   in a pre-eminent sense, there had been handed down from ecclesiastical
   antiquity only baptism and the Eucharist, but baptism included the
   Chrisma (anointing). This last could be counted separately or not. At
   the same time, there was an indefinite group of sacred acts which were
   enumerated quite variously (the reckoning of the Areopagite was not
   determinative). Bernard, e.g., speaks of many Sacraments, and himself
   mentions ten. [331] Even Hugo of St. Victor gives quite a special place
   to baptism and the Eucharist. Yet it was just he who contributed to a
   widening of the conception. By him, [332] as well as by Abelard, [333]
   there are reckoned as the sacramenta majora or spiritualia baptism, the
   Eucharist, confirmation, unction [334] and marriage. [335] How this
   combination arose is unknown. It continued to exist, however, in the
   school of Abelard, i.e., there was no reduction again made, only
   additions followed. Robert Pullus may have exercised an influence here,
   [336] who in his Sentences counts along with the other three
   Sacraments, not unction and marriage, but confession [337] and
   ordination. [338] From the combination of these reckonings the number
   seven as applied to the Sacraments may have arisen. [339] No doubt the
   sacred number also gave fixity to this particular enumeration. [340] It
   is first found in the Sentence Book of Alexander III., when he was
   still Master Roland, [341] and then in the Lombard. [342] The latter
   however represents it, not as a recognised tenet, but as his own view,
   without specially emphasising it. The vacillation continued to exist
   even in the period that followed. The decrees of the great Councils of
   1179 and 1215 imply that there was still nothing fixed as to the number
   of the Sacraments. But the great Schoolmen of the thirteenth century,
   who followed the Lombard, all accepted seven as the number of the
   Sacraments, and although special stress was laid by them on baptism and
   particularly the Eucharist, which was described, e.g., by Thomas as the
   most potent of all the Sacraments ("potissimum inter alia sacramenta
   sacramentum,") [343] they already made some attempt to vindicate the
   number on internal grounds. [344] For the first time at Florence (1439)
   was there a definite ecclesiastical declaration made as to seven being
   the number of the Sacraments. [345]

   The technical revision of the conception of the sacrament begins with
   Hugo of St. Victor. He sets out from the Augustinian definition: "sign
   of a sacred thing" ("visible form of invisible grace"), but it appears
   to him unsatisfactory, because too wide. He adds to it two things:
   first, that the sacrament must have a natural resemblance to the sacred
   thing which it represents; second, that it is also the vehicle of this
   sacred thing, and communicates it to the receiver of the sign. Hence
   (de sacram, Christ. fid. I. 9, 2): "A sacrament is a corporeal or
   material element set forth sensibly to view, representing by
   resemblance, signifying by institution, and containing by consecration
   some invisible and spiritual grace" (sacramentum est corporale vel
   materiale elementum foris sensibiliter propositum ex similitudine
   repræsentans, ex institutione significans et ex sanctificatione
   continens aliquam invisibilem et spiritalem gratiam), or (Summa tract.
   IV. 1): "a sacrament is a visible form of invisible grace conveyed in
   it, i.e., which the sacrament itself conveys, for it is not only the
   sign of a sacred thing, but also its efficacious operation"
   (sacramentum est visibilis forma invisibilis gratiæ in eo collatæ, quam
   scil. confert ipsum sacramentum, non enim est solummodo sacræ rei
   signum sed etiam efficacia). The sacrament has, further, the similitudo
   from nature, the significatio from institution, the efficacia through
   the consecrating word of the priest, or the first from the Creator, the
   second from Christ, [346] and the third from the dispenser (!). This
   German "Mystic" was therefore the first to give fixed form to the
   mischievous definition which so sadly externalised the sacrament and
   eliminated the word. The Augustinian distinction between the sacrament
   and the saving benefit in the sacrament (res sacramenti or res cujus
   sacramentum est) Hugo retained.

   Hugo's definition passed over to the Lombard, and was never again set
   aside in the Church. By it the Sacraments, in the stricter sense of the
   term, were raised above the field of the "sacramentalia": the
   Sacraments are not merely signs; they are vehicles and "causes" of
   sanctification. The Lombard defines thus (Sent. IV., Dist. 1 B): "That
   is properly called a sacrament which is a sign of the grace of God, and
   a form of invisible grace in such a way that it bears the image
   thereof, and exists as a cause (et causa existat). Sacraments,
   therefore, are instituted for the purpose, not merely of signifying,
   but also of sanctifying. For things that are merely instituted for the
   sake of signifying are only signs and not sacraments, as were the
   carnal sacrifices and ceremonial observances of the old law." But,
   further, Sacraments are ";signa data" (signs given, not "natural"
   signs), in the sense, namely, that they rest on free divine
   institution. The Lombard differs, accordingly, from Hugo in his
   regarding as necessary, not a corporeal or material element, but only
   some kind of sign, which may therefore consist also in an act; and also
   in his not saying that the Sacraments contain grace, but only -- with
   greater caution -- that they effect it causally.

   In general, this definition of the Lombard lies at the foundation of
   the later definitions. But the more firmly it came to be held that the
   number of the Sacraments was seven, the more distinctly was the
   difficulty felt of applying the definition given to all the Sacraments
   individually. Hence it is not to be wondered at that the Nominalist
   theologians abstained more and more from giving a general definition
   that dealt with the essence [347] .

   Thomas begins (III., Q. 60) his statement of the doctrine of the
   Sacraments with the words: "After consideration of those things which
   relate to the mysteries of the incarnate Word, there are to be
   considered the Sacraments of the Church, which have efficacy from the
   incarnate Word Himself" [348] By these terms, the unguarded definition
   of Hugo is set aside. He then proceeds, down to Quest. 65, to state the
   general doctrine of the Sacraments. Here it is worthy of note that
   Thomas, going still further than the Lombard, modifies the cruder
   conception of Hugo ("continet"). Indeed, he will not accept, without
   guarding clauses, the "causa existit" of the Lombard. He rejects,
   certainly, the opinion of Bernard and others, that God only works
   "adhibitis sacramentis" (with employment of sacraments). This would not
   lead beyond an interpretation of them as signs; but he then shows that
   it can be said of the Sacraments that "in some way" (per aliquem modum)
   they "cause grace." The "causa principalis" of grace, rather, is God,
   who works as the fire does by its warmth, that is, communicates in
   grace His own nature. The Sacraments are the "causa instrumentalis";
   but this latter cause "does not act by virtue of its own form, but only
   through the impulse it receives from the principal agent" (non agit per
   virtutem suæ formæ, sed solum per motum quo movetur a principali
   agente). "Hence the effect does not derive its character from the
   instrument, but from the principal agent; as a couch does not derive
   its character from the axe, but from the design which is in the mind of
   the artificer (unde effectus non assimilatur instrumento sed principali
   agenti; sicut lectus non assimilatur securi, sed arti, quæ est in mente
   artificis). And in this way the Sacraments of the new law cause grace,
   for they are applied to men by divine appointment (ex divina
   ordinatione) for the purpose of causing grace in them (ad gratiam in
   eis causandam). . . . It is to be asserted that the causa principalis
   cannot properly be called the sign of an effect that may be hidden
   (effectus licet occulti), though the cause itself is sensible and
   manifest; but the causa instrumentalis, if it be manifest, can be
   called the sign of a hidden effect, because (eo quod) it is not only
   cause, but also in a certain way (quodammodo) effect, in so far as it
   is set in motion (movetur) by the principal agent. And according to
   this, the Sacraments of the new law are at the same time causes and
   signs, and hence it is that it is commonly said of them, that they
   effect what they symbolise (efficiunt quod figurant)." The "causæ et
   signa" is in the style of Old Catholic thought; but the opposition of a
   spiritual to a coarse Mysticism is quite specially apparent here. In
   the period that followed, the loosening of grace from sacrament, in the
   sense of regarding the latter as merely associated with the former, was
   carried still further, but not because a more spiritual view was
   advocated (as by Thomas), or because weight was laid on the "word,"
   [349] but because the conception of God, which indeed exercised its
   influence even upon Thomas, only in another way, allowed only of a
   conjunction by virtue of divine arbitrariness. [350] Bonaventura
   already had denied, both that the Sacraments contain grace
   substantially (substantialiter), and that they effect it causally
   (causaliter); God has not bound His grace to the Sacraments, but has
   appointed by decree ("ex decreto") that it shall be derived "per
   sacramenta" from the supreme physician, Christ. In this direction
   Scotus went further. He defines the Sacrament [351] as "a sensible
   sign, which efficaciously signifies, by divine appointment, the grace
   of God, or the gracious effect of God, and is ordained for the
   salvation of man the pilgrim" (signum sensibile, gratiam dei vel
   effectum dei gratuitum ex institutione divina efficaciter significans,
   ordinatum ad salutem hominis viatoris). But the ambiguous formula,
   which he employs elsewhere also, "significans efficaciter effectum dei
   gratuitum" (signifying efficaciously the gracious effect of God),
   really means that God's grace works side by side with the Sacraments;
   for the cause of grace is exclusively the divine will, while this cause
   is represented by the Sacrament, in the Sacrament's accompanying it
   (concomitatur). There does not lie in the Sacraments an "intrinsic
   supernatural virtue," [352] but (in Sentent. IV., Dist. 1, Q. 5) "the
   receiving of the Sacrament is an appointment binding in order to the
   effect which the Sacrament signifies (dispositio necessitans ad
   effectum signatum per sacramentum), not, indeed, through some intrinsic
   form, . . . but only per assistentiam dei (through the aid of God), who
   causes that effect, not of absolute necessity, but by a necessity that
   has regard to the power ordained (necessitate respiciente ad potentiam
   ordinatam). For God has made the appointment universal (disposuit
   universaliter), and has certified to the Church (but how ?) [353] that
   on him who receives such a Sacrament, He will confer the signified
   effect." The same doctrine was taught by Occam and Biel. [354] But this
   view is directly counter to that of Thomas, who had asserted that in
   the Sacrament itself there is inwardly present "a virtue for producing
   the sacramental effect" (virtus ad inducendum sacramentalem effectum).
   The Nominalist thesis wanted inward stability; for it is quite
   formalistic, and leaves the concrete nature of the gracious effect out
   of account. This point being reached, a threefold development was
   possible; either that there should be a turning back to the Old
   Catholic realism of Thomas (Biel already entered upon this course, and
   later Catholicism followed him), or that the Sacraments should be
   conceived of strictly as signs (thus many mediæval sects and Zwingli),
   or that the content of the gracious will of God should be defined anew,
   namely, as the word of the gospel, and it should be shown that this
   word forms also the content of the Sacrament, that the two therefore
   coincide. Of one thing, at any rate, there can be no doubt, viz., that
   the motive of the so-called "evangelical" opposition on the part of
   many sects and "Earlier Reformers" to the reigning view of the
   Sacraments, is to be sought for in logical Nominalism, that at bottom
   the opposition directed itself therefore against the Thom ist practice.
   The "word," so far as my knowledge goes, was not seen to be the content
   of the Sacrament and of the divine will.

   Now there was still an almost countless number of questions of detail
   regarding the Sacraments, [355] in answering which the Thomists and
   Scotists were, as usual, of different opinions. First of all, Thomas
   (following Augustine) distinguished sharply between the Sacraments of
   the old and new Covenants. The former only prefigured grace, the latter
   cause it. But already Bonaventura, and after him Scotus, were of
   opinion that certain Old Testament institutions (circumcision) were
   real Sacraments. Yet Bonaventura also made the distinction, that only
   the New Testament Sacraments are efficacious per se (the Old Testament
   only "per accidens," that is, by means of the added faith!!), [356]
   while Scotus declared circumcision to be a Sacrament efficacious ex
   opere operato ("by effect of Christ's passion"). But at the Council of
   Florence Thomas's view was approved: [357] "the Sacraments of the new
   law differ much from the Sacraments of the old law. For the earlier did
   not cause grace, but only prefigured a grace to be given through the
   passion of Christ, while those which we have both contain grace, and
   convey it to those who worthily receive" (complete return to the
   position of Hugo and Thomas).

   In what follows the chief points of the Thomist doctrine are stated,
   since that doctrine finally became dominant:

   Generically (in genere) the Sacraments as a whole are necessary to
   salvation, but specifically (in specie) this applies, in the strictest
   sense, only to baptism. The other Sacraments partly come under the rule
   "non defectus sed contemptus damnat" (not omission but contempt
   condemns), and they are partly necessary only under particular
   circumstances (orders, marriage, extreme unction, even the Sacrament of
   Penance). But the perplexity showing itself here appears still greater
   when the Sacraments are considered in their effects. It is here seen,
   that is to say, that according to the Augustinian distinction of
   sacramentum and res sacramenti all would require to have a threefold
   effect, namely, first, a significative (sacramentum); second, a neutral
   (as compared with the real saving benefit of grace) or preparatory
   (sacramentum et res) -- Augustine called this character, and compared
   it with the corporalis nota militiæ (corporal mark of military
   service); and, third, a saving effect (res sacramenti). Now, this
   distinction Thomas also followed. He shows that those who are set apart
   to the service of God must, first of all, have a certain stamp
   impressed on them, as in the case of soldiers. Through this process of
   stamping a certain capacity is imparted, i.e., for receptio et traditio
   cultus dei (receiving and administering the worship of God); hence the
   character is the "character Christi." This character is not implanted
   in the essentia (essence), but in the potentia (powers) of the soul,
   and as participatio sacerdotii Christi (participation in the priesthood
   of Christ) is engraven on the soul "indelibly," and hence cannot be
   repeated. Yet all Sacraments do not impart such a character, but only
   those which qualify the man "ad recipiendum vel tradendum ea quæ sunt
   divini cultus" (for receiving and dispensing those things which pertain
   to divine worship), and this holds good of baptism, confirmation, and
   orders. The objection, that surely all Sacraments make man a "partaker
   of the priesthood of Christ," and so, must impart a character, is
   obviated by the ingenious distinction between that formula and the
   other: "deputari ad agendum aliquid vel recipiendum quod pertineat ad
   cultum sacerdotii Christi" (deputed to do something or receive
   something that pertains to the worship connected with the priesthood of
   Christ) (baptism, orders, confirmation). [358] So also if the serious
   objection is urged that "in any Sacrament of the new law there is
   something that is only res, and something that is only sacramentum, and
   something that is res and sacramentum," and that therefore in every
   Sacrament a character is to be assumed, since this character is just
   res and sacramentum, the objection is got quit of by saying that that
   which is at the same time res and sacramentum does not require always
   to be a character. [359] This whole theory was sanctioned at Florence
   (1. c.): "Among the Sacraments there are three which indelibly impress
   on the soul character, that is, a certain spiritual sign distinct from
   the rest (a cæteris); hence they are not repeated in the same person.
   But the remaining four do not impress character and admit of
   repetition."

   The question, "What is a Sacrament?" [360] is answered as follows: it
   is (1) a sign; (2) not any sign whatever of a sacred thing (quodvis rei
   sacræ signum), but such a sign of a sacred thing as makes man holy; (3)
   this "making holy" (sanctificare) is to be looked at under three
   aspects: " the cause of our sanctification is the passion of Christ,
   the form of sanctification consists in grace and virtues, the ultimate
   end (finis) is life eternal." Hence now the complete definition: "A
   sacrament is a sign commemorative of what went before (rememorativum
   ejus quod præcessit), viz., the passion of Christ, and representative
   (demonstrativum) of what is effected in us by the passion of Christ,
   viz., grace, and anticipatory, that is, predictive (prognosticum, i.e.,
   prænuntiativum) of future glory"; (4) the sacrament must always be a
   "res sensibilis," for it corresponds with the nature of man that he
   should attain to the knowledge of intelligible, through sensible,
   things; (5) these sensible signs must be "res determinate," that is,
   God must have selected and appointed these things: " in the use of
   Sacraments two things can be considered, viz., divine worship and the
   sanctification of man, of which the first pertains to men viewed in
   their relation to God (pertinet ad homines per comparationem ad deum),
   the second, on the other hand, pertains to God viewed in His relation
   to man; but it does not belong to anyone to determine what is in the
   power of another, but only what is in his own power"; hence "in the
   Sacraments of the new law, by which men are sanctified, it is necessary
   to use things appointed by divine institution (ex divina institutione
   determinatis)"; (6) it is very fitting that "words" also are used in
   connection with the Sacraments, because the Sacraments are thereby in a
   certain way conformed (quodammodo conformantur) to the incarnate Word,
   and can thus symbolise the sacred things more plainly; [361] and,
   moreover (7) "verba determinata" are necessary, just as "res sensibiles
   determinatæ" are necessary, nay, they are necessary even in a higher
   degree; hence he who utters sacramental words in a corrupt form, if
   this is done designedly (qui corrupte profert verba sacramentalia, si
   hoc ex industria facit), does not show that he intends to do what the
   Church does, and thus the sacrament is not seen to be perfectly
   celebrated (non videtur perfici sacramentum); nay, even an
   unintentional lapsus linguæ, which destroys the sense of the words
   (e.g, if one says, "in nomine matris") hinders the Sacrament from
   becoming perfect; likewise (8) every addition or subtraction annuls the
   Sacrament, if made with the intention of introducing another rite than
   that of the Church. Further, the res sensibiles are described as being
   the materia, the words as the forma (Aristotelian) of the Sacrament.
   [362]

   To the question as to the necessity of the Sacraments, [363] it is
   replied (1) that they are necessary on three grounds, (a) from the
   constitution of human nature (ex conditione humanæ naturæ; man must be
   led through the corporeal to the intelligible); (b) from the state of
   man (ex statu hominis; "medicinal remedy against the disease of sin");
   (c) from a tendency in human action (ex studio actionis humanæ; man
   clings to the sensible, and it would be too hard to sever him entirely
   from it). To the objection, again, that the passion of Christ is surely
   sufficient in itself for salvation, the answer is given, that the
   Sacraments are not useless, "because they work in the power of Christ's
   suffering, and the passion of Christ is somehow [364] applied to men by
   the Sacraments" (quia operantur in virtute passionis Christi, et passio
   Christi quodammodo applicatur hominibus per sacramenta); (2) in the
   state of innocence man neither required the Sacraments as a remedy for
   sin (pro remedio peccati), nor for perfecting the soul (pro perfectione
   animæ); (3) in the state of sin before Christ certain Sacraments were
   necessary "by which man might confess his faith concerning the future
   advent of the Saviour" (quibus homo fidem suam protestaretur de futuro
   salvatoris adventu); (4) in the Christian state Sacraments are
   necessary, "which represent those things which took place before in
   Christ" (quæ significant ea quæ præcesserunt in Christo). By this
   change in the Sacraments the unchangeableness of God is not affected,
   who, like a good father in a home, "gives different precepts to His
   family to suit different times" ("pro temporum varietate diversa
   præcepta familiæ suæ proponit"). The fathers were redeemed "by faith in
   the Christ who was to come," we are redeemed "by faith in the Christ
   who has now been born and has suffered"; what they had to do with were
   Sacraments "that corresponded with grace that had to be foreshadowed"
   (quæ fuerunt congrua gratiæ præfigurandæ), what we have to do with are
   "Sacraments that correspond with grace that has to be shown as present"
   (sacramenta congrua gratiæ præsentialiter demonstrandæ). [365]

   To the question as to the effect of the Sacraments [366] it is replied,
   that we must distinguish between "grace" and "character." The latter
   has already been treated above; we have also learned to know the view
   of Thomas (p. 206) on the Sacraments as "instrumental causes" in
   addition to the "principal cause" (God). But Thomas has given more
   precise definitions as to the effect. First, it is laid down (Art. 2)
   that sacramental grace adds something beyond the "grace of virtues and
   gifts," namely, "a certain divine help for securing the end of the
   Sacrament" (quoddam divinum auxilium ad consequendum sacramenti finem).
   [367] Second, the proposition "sacramenta signant et continent
   (causant) gratiam" (the Sacraments signify and contain [cause] grace)
   is more exactly explained (Art. 3). Third, it is shown that, as there
   is contained in the Sacraments (Art. 4), and that, too, "in verbis et
   rebus" (in words and things), "a certain instrumental virtue for
   conveying grace (which is the effect of the Sacrament) that is
   proportioned to the instruments" (quædam instrumentalis virtus ad
   inducendam gratiam, quæ est sacramenti effectus, proportionata
   instrumento), this virtue originates "from the benediction of Christ
   and the application of it by the minister to sacramental use," and is
   to be traced back to the "principal agent." Fourth, the relation of
   sacramental grace to the passion of Christ is more precisely defined
   (Art. 5): "The principal cause of grace is God Himself, in relation to
   whom the humanity of Christ is, so to speak, a conjoined instrument (ad
   quem comparatur humanitas Christi sicut instrumentum conjunctum) (as
   e.g., the hand is a conjoined instrument), while the Sacrament is, as
   it were, a separate instrument (e.g., like a stick). And thus it is
   necessary that saving virtue be derived for the Sacraments from the
   divinity of Christ through His humanity (et ideo oportet, quod virtus
   salutifera a divinitate Christi per ejus humanitatem in ipsa sacramenta
   derivetur). But sacramental grace appears to be appointed (ordinari)
   for two things especially, viz., for the removal of the defects of past
   sins, in so far as they pass away as acts (transeunt actu) and remain
   as guilt (remanent reatu), and again for the perfecting of the soul in
   those things which pertain to the worship of God according to the
   religion of the Christian life. But it is manifest from what has been
   said above, that Christ has wrought for us, chiefly by His passion, a
   deliverance from our sins that is not only meritorious and sufficient
   but also satisfactory (quod Christus liberavit nos a peccatis nostris,
   præcipue per suam passionem non solum sufficienter et meritorie sed
   etiam satisfactorie). In like manner also He initiated by His passion
   the ritual (ritum) of the Christian religion, yielding Himself up as an
   offering and sacrifice to God (offerens se ipsum oblationem et hostiam
   deo), as it is declared in Ephes. V. Whence it is manifest that the
   Sacraments of the Church have their efficacy principally from the
   passion of Christ, of which the virtue is in some way united
   (copulatur) to us through receiving the Sacraments, as a sign of which
   (in cujus signum) there flowed from Christ as He hung upon the Cross
   water and blood, of which the one relates to baptism, the other to the
   eucharist, which are the most potent (potissima) Sacraments." [368]

   To the question as to the "causa sacramentorum" (whether per
   auctoritatem or per ministerium) the reply is as follows: [369] (1) as
   the "inner effect" of the Sacraments is justification, it appears as if
   this effect could be produced only by God; but by way of administering
   ("per modum ministri") man also (the priest) can be the " instrumental
   cause " of the effect. Whether he is more or less good does not come
   into account here; the effect of the Sacrament remains always the same,
   nay, even as regards the "annexa," the priest's prayers, it makes no
   difference what the character of the priest is; for they are offered
   "ex parte ecclesiæ" (on the part of the Church), not on the part of an
   individual person. (2) God alone is the "institutor sacramentorum,"
   from whom alone also their "virtus" proceeds. Hence it follows: "those
   things which are done in the Sacraments by appointment of men (per
   homines instituta) are not necessary to the sacrament (de necessitate
   sac.), but have to do with a certain solemn observance of it (pertinent
   ad quandam solemnitatem) . . . but those things which are necessary to
   the Sacraments are instituted by Christ Himself, who is God and man.
   And although all things are not handed down in Scripture, yet the
   Church has these things from a well-known (familiari) tradition of the
   Apostles, as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. XI.: The rest will I set in
   order when I come." [370] To the objection that the Apostles acted as
   God's representatives ("vicem dei") on earth, and therefore might also
   be institutors of Sacraments, it is replied, that they were certainly
   not allowed to set up another Church, and so also "it was not lawful
   for them to institute other Sacraments, (for) it is by Sacraments that
   the Church of Christ is declared to be formed (fabricata)." (3) It is
   laid down that the authority in the Sacraments belongs to Christ as
   God, but that He as man " had the power of the chief ministry or
   pre-eminence and works meritoriously and effectually (potestatem
   ministerii principalis habuit seu excellentiæ et operatur meritorie et
   efficienter)." (4) It is shown that Christ could convey this "power of
   ministering" (not the "authority") to other servants, viz., "by giving
   them such fulness of grace that their merit would operate for rendering
   the Sacraments effectual (operaretur ad sacramentorum effectus), that
   the Sacraments would be consecrated on the invocation of their names
   (ut ad invocationem nominorum ipsorum sanctificarentur sacramenta), and
   that they would themselves be able to institute Sacraments and, without
   the ritual of the Sacraments, be able to convey by their power alone
   the effect of the Sacraments (ut ipsi possent sacramenta instituere et
   sine ritu sacramentorum effectum sacramentorum conferre solo imperio)."
   But this "potestas excellentiæ" He has not conveyed to the servants, in
   order to avoid the "inconveniens," that is, that there might not be
   many heads in the Church; "if He had nevertheless communicated it, He
   would Himself have been the head in the principal sense, and they only
   in a secondary (ipse esset caput principaliter, alii vero secundario)."
   (5) It is shown that the Sacraments can be validly celebrated even by
   bad servants, as these act only instrumentally, and "the instrument
   does not work by its own form or virtue, but by the virtue of him by
   whom it is moved (non agit secundum propriam formam aut virtutem sed
   secundum virtutem ejus a quo movetur); " but of course (6) bad servants
   commit a mortal sin when they celebrate the Sacraments, though the sin
   does not extend to the receiver, "who does not communicate with the sin
   of the bad minister, but with the Church." (7) The "intention" and
   "faith" of the minister are treated (in Art. 8 and 9). The former he
   must necessarily have, [371] but not the latter: "as it is not required
   for the perfection of the Sacrament that the minister have love (sit in
   caritate), but sinners also can dispense Sacraments, so his faith is
   not required for the perfection of the Sacrament, but an unbeliever can
   dispense the true Sacrament, provided other things are present which
   are necessary to a Sacrament." Thus even heretics can dispense the
   Sacraments, that is, "sacramentum," not "res sacramenti"; for the
   "power of administering sacraments pertains to spiritual character,
   which is indelible (he confers, but sins in conferring)."

   These doctrines of Thomas, from which a regard to faith (fides) is
   obviously lacking, [372] and which altogether pass very rapidly over
   the question as to the conditions of saving reception of the
   Sacraments, underwent afterwards great modification from the time of
   Scotus onwards. [373] In many points, moreover, the Thomist theses were
   novelties, and hence were not forthwith received. Thus Thomas was the
   first to assert the origination of all Sacraments by Christ. Hugo [374]
   and the Lombard were frank enough to trace several Sacraments, not to
   Him, but to the Apostles, or to the pre-Christian Era (marriage), and
   were satisfied with saying that all Sacraments are now administered in
   the power of Christ (in potestate Christi). Only with Alexander of
   Hales begins a more exact investigation of the origin of the
   Sacraments. But till the time of Thomas we still find much uncertainty.
   It had been usual to fall back on the general assertion of their divine
   origin, or a "certain" institution by Christ was taught, [375] while in
   the case of the different Sacraments very different hypotheses,
   attributable to embarrassment, were adopted. But there always continued
   to be some (on to the sixteenth century) who traced back individual
   Sacraments simply to apostolic institution. [376]

   In addition to the problem as to how far the effect is bound to the
   Sacrament (see above), the chief questions in the period that followed
   were those as to the "minister sacramenti" and as to the conditions of
   saving reception. There was certainly agreement on the points, that
   there are Sacraments whose minister is not designated in the
   institution by Christ, and that we must distinguish between Sacraments
   which only a baptised Christian, a priest, or a bishop can duly
   celebrate; yet in making the application to each separate Sacrament,
   and in defining the relations of the minister and the receiver to the
   Sacrament, great controversies prevailed (is the priest who blesses the
   marriage, or are the parties to be married, the minister of the
   Sacrament of Marriage? In regard to the Eucharist, also, and other
   Sacraments, old ideas still continued to exercise their influence, and
   that not always in the case of declared heretics merely; further, as to
   confirmation there was doubt whether the exclusive power of the bishops
   rested on divine or on ecclesiastical appointment, while in connection
   with this there arose again the whole of the old dispute as to whether
   presbyters and bishops were originally identical, etc., etc.).

   The controversy as to the conditions of saving reception penetrated
   more deeply; for here it was necessary to show in what relation the two
   poles of the Romish view of Christianity were to be placed, whether the
   factor of merit was to have predominance over the factor of sacrament
   or vice-versa. The development in Nominalist theology was such that
   merit always asserted its superiority more decidedly, and the
   conditions accordingly were always more laxly conceived of, while at
   the same time the view taken of the depreciated effects of the
   Sacraments became always more magical. From this as a starting-point
   (namely, the conditions), which Thomas had merely touched on, the whole
   doctrine of the Sacraments really became a subject of controversy
   again, or received a fresh revision. [377] The chief points are the
   following:

   1. Alexander of Hales and Thomas had not indeed derived from all
   Sacraments a character, but they had asserted of all that they exercise
   an influence that is independent of the subjective condition of the
   receiver. But Scotus and those coming later denied this in the case of
   penance and extreme unction, teaching that these Sacraments remain
   without any effect if they are received without the requisite
   disposition.

   2. In the earlier period it was held that for the unworthy recipient
   the virtue of the Sacraments becomes deleterious in its effect. This
   the Nominalists denied. In the worthy disposition and in the character,
   they saw on the contrary, as already existing, a positive dispositio ad
   gratiam, and declared accordingly that in the case of the unworthy the
   saving effect ex opere operato is not realised, [378] while the
   "wrath-effect" is not produced by the Sacrament, but arises from the
   sin of the receiver, and hence is not ex opere operato, but ex opere
   operante.

   That a "disposition" belongs to the saving reception was therefore the
   general opinion; but as to why it was necessary there was difference of
   view. Some saw in the disposition, not the positive condition of
   sacramental grace, but only the conditio sine qua non, i.e., the
   disposition is not considered as worthiness; the Sacraments, rather, of
   the new covenant, as distinguished from those of the old, in which the
   fides was requisite (hence opus operans), work ex opere operato. [379]
   This implied the exclusion, not of the necessity of the dispositio, but
   certainly of its causal significance. In entire contrast with this view
   stands the other, which, however, was represented only by a few, that
   the Sacraments can only mediate grace when inner contrition and faith
   are present, so that all saving grace is solely the result of penitent
   disposition and of faith; but these as inner motives (interiores motus)
   are wrought by God, so that on that ground we must not assume a
   justification ex opere operante; the Sacraments now declare this inner
   act of God, make man sure as to the reception of grace, and strengthen
   the belief that the reception transmits the effectual grace to the
   whole man and makes him the possessor of it. This view comes very near
   the evangelical one of the sixteenth century; but it differs from it in
   this, that the idea of grace is still always the Catholic, as
   participation in the divine nature, and that accordingly faith is
   really held as only something preliminary, that is, it is not yet seen
   that the "motus fiduciæ in deum" (trustful impulse God-wards) is the
   form and the essence of grace itself. Further, it is to be observed
   that this view has been expressed clearly and plainly by no Schoolman.
   [380] According to the third view, which constantly gained more
   adherents, and always came to be more laxly expressed, the saving grace
   is a product of the Sacrament and of contrite faith, so that the
   Sacrament in itself merely raises the soul above the point at which it
   is dead and plants a seed which develops to saving effect only by the
   co-operation of contrition and faith. Here first the question now came
   to be of importance as to what the nature was of this contrition and
   this faith, or as to what the state of soul must be which puts the
   receiver into the position for letting the sacramental grace attain to
   its full effect. To begin with it was generally answered here, with
   Augustine, that the receiver must not "obicem contrariæ cogitationis
   opponere" (oppose a barrier of adverse thought.) But what is this
   "obex" [381] or this "impedimentum"? It was replied that the receiver
   must not receive the Sacrament "cum fictione" (insincerely). But when
   is he a hypocrite? The earlier theologians required a "bonus motus
   interior," that is, a really pious spirit that longs for grace,
   contrition, and faith, and so, since every "bonus motus" is in a
   certain way meritorious, certain merits. The "barrier" is here
   therefore the lack of such a positive good disposition. So it was
   taught by the Lombard, Alexander, Thomas, [382] and a large number of
   theologians, and they further laid it down that, as all merit is
   rewarded, the reception of the Sacrament results in a twofold grace,
   namely (1) ex opere operato, (2) but also ex opere operante; the latter
   is different from the sacramental grace, but is always added to it (ex
   merito, on account of the disposition, and greater or less, according
   to the measure of the disposition). Here already, then, merit is
   introduced in a hazardous way. Yet the later theologians (among the
   earlier, Albertus) required only the absence of an undevout
   disposition; what is held by them as a barrier is simply the presence
   of a "motus contrarius malus," i.e., contempt of the Sacrament,
   positive unbelief, or an unforgiven mortal sin. [383] They said that
   the dignity of the New Testament Sacraments consists just in this, that
   they presuppose no positive disposition, while such disposition is to
   be presupposed in the case of all other grace. Hence Scotus defines:
   "for the first reception of grace (the non-sacramental) there is
   required some kind of merit (aliquis modus meritorius) de congruo; but
   for the second (the sacramental) nothing is required save a reception
   of baptism that is voluntary and without insincerity (sine fictione),
   i.e., with the intention of receiving what the Church confers, and
   without mortal sin in act or will (sine actu vel voluntate peccati
   mortaiis), so that in the first there is required some intrinsic work
   in some way accepted as meritum de congruo, in the second there is only
   required an external work (opus exterius), with putting away of inner
   hindrance (cum amotione interioris impedimenti)." One sees that here
   the doctrine of the Sacraments is already quite drawn into the
   (Pelagian) doctrine of justification, and subordinated to it, while
   apparently the power of the Sacrament is increased, seeing that it is
   to be held as effectual even where a tabula rasa exists. Yet with the
   increased power there contrasts the really small saving effect, which
   passes, rather, into the "acceptance of the merits of man." Between
   these two views there was still a third, which certainly stands quite
   near the last mentioned, frequently coalesced with it, and was
   afterwards to become the predominant one; it is neither satisfied with
   the absence of the "malus motus," nor does it require the "bonus
   motus," but it demands that a "certain" sorrow shall precede the
   reception of the Sacrament, which does not require to spring from the
   highest motives, but may arise from lower, e.g., from fear of
   punishment or something similar. This "sorrow" is described as
   attritio, [384] and it is said of it that, if there is earnest
   striving, the Sacrament can raise it to contritio. But others now went
   still further and taught that the Sacrament changes attritio into
   contritio ex opere operato. According to this extremely widely diffused
   view, the man can be saved who lets himself stand in dread of hell,
   even though otherwise all inner connection with the Christian religion
   is wanting to him; he must only assiduously use the Sacrament of
   Penance, in the opinion that it can protect him against hell. Yet even
   this "opinion" does not need to be a sure faith; he may only hold the
   effect of the Sacrament as not impossible; "attrition, when the
   Sacrament is added, is made sufficient by the power of the keys"
   (attritio superveniente sacramento virtute clavium efficitur
   sufficiens). [385]

   A quite magical view of the Sacraments here competes in a pernicious
   way with that doctrine of "merit," according to which God of His good
   pleasure (per acceptationem) takes as complete what is only a
   beginning, and indeed is not even a beginning, since the motives of
   those "meritorious" acts may be religiously neutral. In connection with
   the doctrine of justification we shall return to this worst point,
   which dominated the whole practical and theoretical system of
   Catholicism at the beginning of the Reformation period. [386] But
   certainly it is clear here already, that to hush up rather than to give
   comfort was the effect of a doctrine of the Sacraments having this form
   and issue. This doctrine was originally framed on the exalted idea of
   the "participatio divinæ naturæ," and it still continues to betray its
   basis in the first stages of its construction. But it ends in
   confirming the man of common spirit in his low-type morality and feeble
   piety. The earnest Catholic may not apply these final conclusions to
   himself; he may confine himself to the original thesis, which is not
   forbidden to him, but for the careless, the Church has prepared a broad
   road and opened a wide gate. In a relative way it may work much good
   with this; for its system is derived from listening to life; it gives
   pedagogic direction on the question as to how one who is not quite
   thoughtless, who is not perfectly stolid, who is not entirely sunk in
   earthly enjoyment, can be aided, and introduced into a better society,
   with better modes of life. But as soon as we consider that it is the
   Christian religion we have to do with here, that religion of earnest
   spirit and comforting power, this structure of opus operatum, attritio
   and meritum is seen to be a mockery of all that is sacred. [387]

   The individual Sacraments. (1) Baptism. [388] This Sacrament [389] is
   the medicine for the consequences of the Fall, and lays the basis of
   the new life; it has therefore a negative and a positive effect. [390]
   The former, in which the "grace" already appears as "most perfect,
   [391] relates to original sin. In so far as this consists in guilt,
   penalty, and concupiscence, baptism abolishes all these with the entire
   sin; i.e., the guilt (guilt of original sin and of the previously
   committed sinful deeds without exception) [392] is blotted out, the
   penalty remitted (and that means the eternal penalty totally, the
   temporal penalty likewise, so far as it consists in poenæ determinatæ;
   but so far as it finds expression in the penal evils of the earthly
   life, it remains), and the concupiscence is controlled. The last point
   is new, as only in Scholasticism is a clear distinction drawn between
   sinful and innocent concupiscence. The meaning is this, that through
   sin sinful concupiscence has come into existence as disorder of the
   lower impulses, or as dominion of these over the higher impulses and
   over the province of human action, whereby a fomes peccati (slumbering
   fire of sin), ever continuing, and working with a certain necessity,
   has developed itself. Baptism, now, has the effect of so rectifying the
   disorder of the passions, and moderating the "fomes peccati," that man
   is now in a position for resisting, or for keeping within appointed
   limits, the concupiscence, which is involved in his earthly nature, and
   is therefore in itself innocent. This view of the natural life, which
   is not a religious one, will occupy us again in the next section (under
   C). Here it is enough to note that, in order to give expression to the
   absoluteness of the negative baptismal influence as an effectual one,
   the conception of an innocent concupiscence was admitted. [393] The
   positive effect of baptism is summed up under the term, "sacramentum
   regenerationis." But while here there was in general no occasion to
   pass beyond the old ecclesiastical conception (even the special
   connection of baptism with faith is still always emphasised), yet
   misgivings arose on two points. Is the positive grace in baptism
   "perfectissima," and do the children receive this grace as perfectly as
   baptised adults? Although in general it was declared that baptism is
   the sacrament of justification, and that through it the baptised person
   receives the gratia operans and cooperans, provided he does not already
   possess it (in which case there is only an increasing), yet, from the
   time of Nominalism especially, baptism was in point of fact held to be
   only the sacrament of initiation for justification. [394] Hence there
   was an increased willingness to assume in the case of children the
   perfect application of baptismal grace, [395] while it was held at an
   earlier period, that to children there is perfectly communicated only
   purification from original sin, the positive grace being only infused
   into them afterwards at successive times. [396] As regards the faith of
   children, there was no fixed opinion; the majority seem to have held
   that the faith of the Church (or of the sponsors) intervenes here
   vicariously, and that thereby the saving effect is made possible. [397]
   Thus baptism only lays the foundation for the process of justification,
   or it implants it "in habitu," but not "in actu" (that Mary was thought
   of as an exception to this was a matter of course on the Catholic view;
   for to her nothing could be given by baptism which she had not already
   possessed before baptism). [398]

   Baptism is absolutely necessary (baptism with blood a substitute),
   conveys a character, cannot be repeated, is valid when it is performed
   with water (materia) and with the words of institution (forma), [399]
   and is regularly dispensed by the priest. Yet in an emergency a deacon,
   and even a layman, can baptise. The considerations regarding the
   sacramentalia which accompanied baptism do not belong to the history of
   dogma; [400] just as little do the secondary consequences of baptism,
   as, e.g., spiritual affinity, etc.

   As the Church had to contend, especially from the thirteenth century
   onwards, against sects and schools who, on different grounds (as a rule
   out of opposition to the prevailing sacramental system, here and there
   also from opposition to the sacramental system in general), disputed
   the rightfulness of infant baptism, or who denied the necessity of
   baptism altogether, an apologetic, polemical discussion of the
   Sacrament of Baptism was necessary. Yet there was never nearly so much
   fulness of statement here as in the account given of the Sacrament of
   the Eucharist. [401]

   2. Confirmation. [402] This Sacrament obtained its independent
   existence simply through Western practice, inasmuch as only the bishop
   [403] could administer it. Hence it naturally resulted, that it became
   dissociated from baptism, which, however, forms its presupposition,
   [404] and with which it shares the quality, that it conveys a
   character, and therefore cannot be repeated. The material is the
   Chrisma consecrated by the bishop, the form the sacramental words:
   "consigno te, etc." The effect, which, of course, as additional to that
   of baptism, either cannot be definitely expressed, or restricts the
   importance of the baptismal communication of grace, is power (robur)
   for growth, strength for conflict with enemies of the faith (military),
   the gifts of the Holy Spirit, or even -- as a portion of the process of
   justification -- the gratia gratum faciens (grace that renders
   well-pleasing). [405] Doubts about this Sacrament, which, according to
   Thomas, "etiam a non jejunis dari vel accipi potest" [406] (can be
   given or received even by those not fasting), never disappeared; Wyclif
   again gave emphatic expression to them; for a reliable proof from
   tradition could not be obtained. [407] In the last resort Thomas is
   unable otherwise to defend the "conveniens" in the ritual than by the
   sentence: [408] "it must be firmly held that the ordinances of the
   Church are directed according to the wisdom of Christ. And for this
   reason it ought to be certain that the ritual which the Church observes
   in this and in other Sacraments is fitting" (firmiter tenendum est,
   quod ordinationes ecclesiæ dirigantur secundum sapientiam Christi. Et
   propter hoc certum esse debet, ritus quod ecclesia observat in hoc et
   in aliis sacramentis esse convenientes). If we assume, not the
   dogmatic, but the practical pedagogic point of view, we cannot deny the
   serviceableness of this observance, especially when taken along with
   infant baptism, both as regards the plebs Christiana, and as regards
   the bishop, who in this way comes close to every member of his diocese.
   [409]

   3. The Eucharist. [410] At the beginning of the thirteenth century,
   after the conflicts in the eleventh, and many uncertainties in the
   twelfth, the doctrine of transubstantiation, together with what was
   derived from it, or coheres with it, was substantially settled. The
   Lateran Council (see above, p. 53) of the year 1215 had brought the
   development to a conclusion, and had given to the Sacrament the highest
   conceivable place, as was shown by the deliverance regarding it being
   introduced into the Symbol. [411] But the "heretical" opposition had
   made the deliverance necessary. This opposition never became silent;
   nay, in the circles of the Church theology itself, there were set forth
   in later times views of transubstantiation, that, strictly speaking,
   had the effect of cancelling it.

   Here, also, it was Thomas whose view of the Sacrament became classic in
   Catholicism. The modifications which Nominalism allowed itself to adopt
   disappeared; the doctrine of Thomas remained. Thomas put an end to the
   uncertainties still betrayed by the Lombard at some points, [412] and
   he applied in perfected form to the Sacrament the dialectic mode of
   treatment which had once occasioned so much offence. He could dispose
   of the Sacrament with confidence, for he was a Realist, and Duns Scotus
   could do so likewise (in some respects in a still more perfect form),
   because he also readily adopted a realistic theory of knowledge. But
   this confidence thereafter received a check; for it is only in a forced
   way, if at all, that the Nominalist mode of thought can come to terms
   with transubstantiation. It must either let it drop, or declare it an
   intensified miracle, by which two impossible things become actual.

   In the Sacrament of the Supper and the doctrine regarding it, the
   Church gave expression to everything that it highly prized -- its
   dogma, its mystical relation to Christ, the fellowship of believers,
   the priest, the sacrifice, the miraculous power which God had given to
   His Church, the satisfaction of the sensuous impulse in piety, etc.,
   only not the faith which seeks for certainty and to which certainty is
   given. This appears very plainly from the description of the effects of
   the Eucharist as a Sacrament and as a sacrifice. The Sacrament was
   universally reverenced as the chiefest Sacrament, the sun among the
   Sacraments, etc., because here res and sacramentum coincide (the matter
   becomes itself Christ), because the incarnation and the death on the
   Cross are represented as operative in it, or are repeated in it, and
   because it embraces the past, the present, and the future. Yet the
   effects, which are summed up under the term nourishment of the
   spiritual life of the soul, and are detailed as incorporation into
   Christ, incorporation into the Church, communion of the members with
   each other, forgiveness of venial sins, perseverance in faith,
   strengthening of human weakness, refreshment, foretaste and
   fore-celebration of the heavenly blessedness, anticipation of eternal
   fellowship with God, etc., do not attain to the effect of the Sacrament
   of Penance. Just as little is specific importance attached to the
   Eucharist as a sacrifice; under this term, indeed, personal merit
   rather is strongly asserted. In the sacrifice of the Mass one testifies
   his obedience to God; like every sacrifice it is a performance which
   can claim a reward. Thus all effects here are at the same time
   dependent on the receiver. These effects appear to be estimated most
   highly; the sacrifice of the Mass, indeed, is a constant repetition of
   the death on the Cross; but this constant repetition has respect only
   to daily sins, to penal evils and bodily need. It extends, no doubt, in
   its effect, beyond the earthly life -- in practice, the bearing of the
   sacrifice of the Mass on the penalties in purgatory was almost its most
   important bearing -- yet there are also other means, which are really
   not less effectual than the Masses. [413]

   The materia of the Sacrament is wheaten [414] bread and wine. [415] The
   appropriateness of these, and, in particular, of this double form, is
   dealt with very minutely. The very ancient symbolic idea of the many
   grains which become one bread also reappears in the Schoolmen. [416]
   The forma is the words of consecration, which are spoken in the name of
   Christ (not in the name of the minister). [417] In connection
   therewith, Bonaventura explains the "hoc" as denoting the bread, Thomas
   as denoting the accidents of the bread ("hoc sub his specibus
   contentum," i.e., that which is here presented is not bread, but my
   body). But the forma is not only an appeal to God (Bonaventura, Duns)
   that He will accomplish the transubstantiation, but an effectual power,
   as soon as the priest has the intention to work the mystery. [418]

   But the difficult question was now this, How is the transubstantiation
   to be thought of? [419] Here there was, first, a rejection already by
   the Lombard of the idea of a new-creation of the body of Christ, for
   Christ's body already exists; but, second, the opinion was also
   rejected by him that Christ makes the bread and wine into His body, so
   that they become the Sacrament, whether by assumptio or by
   consubstantiality; there must be believed in rather a conversio of such
   a kind that the substances of the elements pass into the substances of
   the body of Christ, while the accidents remain behind without a
   subject. [420] What happens to the substance of the elements, whether
   it breaks up and is destroyed, the Lombard declared that he did not
   know. Alexander of Hales distinctly rejects consubstantiality and
   destruction, and speaks of a "passing over." But he at once adds, that
   after the change, the whole Christ is present, inasmuch as the human
   soul and the deity of Christ always are concomitantly (per
   concomitantiam) where His flesh is. The continuance of the accidents
   without a subject he pronounced a miracle. [421] Bonaventura attached
   weight to the conversio taking place both as regards the materia and
   the forma of the bread (it would otherwise be imperfect); yet we must
   not understand by the former the materia prima (matter as the potency
   [potentia] of all material substances). [422] With regard to the first
   Eucharist celebration -- the treatment of which is the hardest crux of
   the whole theory -- it was universally held, indeed, that Christ
   partook of Himself in eating (as an example, and with a view to the
   enjoyment of love, not with a view to being perfected), but while Hales
   thought that Christ partook then already of His glorified body,
   Bonaventura taught (Thomas following him) that Christ partook of His
   mortal body, which, however, as Eucharistic was already present
   "impassibiliter" (in impassible form). All of them thought of the
   parallels in creation and incarnation, and sought to explain the
   mystery from these. Thomas now submitted to a final treatment the
   accidents, which, as the subject is wanting to them after the
   conversio, are maintained in existence by God as the first cause (causa
   prima) [423] But at the same time, following Bonaventura, he laid the
   foundation for an extremely complicated doctrine of the form of all
   matter, which was afterwards spun out by Duns and the Nominalists. As
   the bread, that is to say, is changed as regards the material and the
   form, both changes must be demonstrated in the transubstantiated
   result. But as the soul of Christ (form) only appears present
   concomitantly (per concomitantiam), the body of Christ must have a form
   for itself. [424] Thus Thomas is led to the idea of a "form of
   corporeity" (forma corporeitatis), which is identical neither with the
   soul nor with the outer shape, but appears as the ground of the
   qualities of the body. Further, in accordance with this, Thomas
   conceives of the conversio as a passing over in the strict sense of the
   term (no destruction = annihilatio of the elements). [425] The miracle
   is identical with a miracle of creation in so far as in the case of
   both the two states are not united by a common subject (substance); for
   the continued existence of the accidents is no real bond. Duns pursued
   this line further, and came to the adoption of a plurality of forms in
   matter. He required this assumption, as he assailed St. Thomas with
   reflections arising from the hypothesis, that the Eucharist was
   conceivably celebrated during the time when Christ lay in the grave.
   The Thomist doctrine was not framed to meet this case, as it assumed a
   forma substantialis for the living body. Hence, according to Thomas,
   only an imperfect transubstantiation would then have taken place --
   that is, a transubstantiation only into the material of the dead body.
   Duns himself appealed more confidently to the divine omnipotence,
   placed in the foreground the general possibility that God can transform
   everything (even the material into the spiritual, and vice versa),
   affirmed the existence of a matter without quality which is capable of
   everything, and came very close to the view, that in transubstantiation
   one substance is annihilated and another is introduced. Above all,
   however, his thesis, that God Himself, as if on the ground of a
   contract, always works the conversio, so that the words of consecration
   only form the occasion, influenced all the Nominalists afterwards. But
   by a logical process there then followed also upon this view a
   modification of the way of understanding transubstantiation, in the
   direction of impanation and consubstantiality. For it became natural to
   assume, that if the divine working only accompanies the words of the
   priest (that is, the forma sacramenti), it only accompanies, also, the
   elements (the materia; a "moral" conjunction by the free will of
   Christ). This doctrine was first suggested as possible, and then
   asserted as possible. But when once the idea of the conversio was
   separated by a logical distinction into two acts -- into annihilation,
   and entrance of the body of Christ into the place of the annihilated
   subject -- the first act could also drop out. The miracle only becomes
   the greater when substance stands side by side with substance. At the
   same time the signal was now given for investigations into space in its
   relation to substance, investigations which, from the time of Scotus
   onwards, did not continue without fruit for the doctrine of space.
   Human thought does not advance without receiving a determining impulse
   from the practical sphere: from the doctrine of God there grew up the
   doctrines of thought and of will; from the doctrine of the Trinity, the
   doctrine of the Kosmos; from the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, the
   doctrine of space. If the question as to the relation of the body of
   Christ to the elements already led to inquiries into space, still
   greater was the impulse in that direction as soon as the question arose
   as to how the eucharistic body is related to the glorified body of
   Christ in heaven. The thorny discussions on this subject do not belong
   to dogma strictly speaking. As new-creation was excluded, the question
   was as to the presence in the Sacrament of the body that is already in
   heaven. And again, as the body as a whole appears at the same time in
   each of the independent particles of the consecrated bread, a
   space-less presence had necessarily to be taught. This Thomas began to
   do; [426] but it was only the Nominalists who treated the question as
   virtuosi (especially Occam), though they did not come definitely to the
   doctrine of the ubiquity of the body of Christ. On the other hand, it
   was they, especially John of Paris and Occam, who anticipated the
   Lutheran doctrine of the real presence in the bread. [427] An energetic
   opponent of the doctrine of transubstantiation was Wyclif (but even he
   did not get clearly beyond impanation, and if he was incensed by the
   idolatry that was practised with the host, yet it was by grounds of
   reason [the absurdity of accidents without substance] that he was moved
   to opposition.) [428] By him not a few (but not Huss) [429] were
   constrained to renounce the monstrous doctrine, and in the fifteenth
   century the opposition to it is met with not infrequently. [430] Yet it
   remained the reigning view; the hostility of declared heretics could
   only be in its favour. [431]

   The consequences of the transubstantiation doctrine were manifold, and
   of radical importance; the following may be mentioned:

   (1) The discontinuance of child communion. [432]

   (2) The augmentation of the dignity of the priests, by whom daily
   Christ was magically produced and offered up.

   (3) The withholding of the cup. From the time of the Lombard it was a
   settled belief that the whole Christ is contained in each species, and
   that meant, too (according to the doctrine developed especially by
   Thomas), [433] Christ concomitantly (per concomitantiam) in His body
   and soul as well as in His divinity. But that being so, it was
   permissible, safer indeed (that the wine might not be spilt, and the
   Sacrament thereby profaned), and, with a view to increasing the dignity
   of the priest, "conveniens," that the layman should receive only in the
   form of the bread (sub specie panis), while the priest drank the cup in
   the name of all. [434] At Constance this became fixed.

   (4) The adoration of the elevated host (elevation is represented as
   having been already adopted in opposition to Berengar), the procession
   of the host, and the feast of Corpus Christi (1264. 1311): for the body
   of Christ is, of course, not present merely at the moment of enjoyment,
   but, when once produced by consecration, remains until the accidents
   are dissolved. [435] Against this idolatry there arose in the
   fourteenth and fifteenth centuries much opposition, which, however,
   continued to be lacking in vigour.

   It was already pointed out above that as regards the idea of the
   Eucharist as a sacrifice, the Lombard was still influenced by the old
   ecclesiastical motive of recordatio (remembrance). But from
   ecclesiastical antiquity there was certainly taken over also the idea
   of the repetition of the sacrificial death of Christ (Gregory I.), and
   on the basis of the doctrine of transubstantiation this idea now
   necessarily became firmly established. The Roman Canon of the Mass,
   which did not originally contain the idea of the bloodless repetition
   of the death of Christ, and still bears traces to-day of not having
   contained it, has in its most recent portions the new idea. At the
   Lateran Council in 1215 the idea is presupposed, and brief note is
   taken of it, [436] and the Schoolmen, although they do not here give
   elaborated doctrines, have no other thought than that the priest offers
   the body of the Lord. [437] The Eucharist as a sacrifice, as it formed
   the central part of divine service, was for the people much more
   important than the Sacrament. Although, in strict theory, there were
   connected with it only slender results (see above), yet misdirected
   piety made this observance entirely its own, and saw in it its real
   defence in life and in death. The mischief of low masses and masses for
   souls was as much the consequence of violent importunity on the part of
   the laity for as many masses as possible, as of priestly
   self-importance; for in the Mass the priest, who is here not a minister
   but an originator (autor), appears in a very real sense as the mediator
   between God and men, and, as priest of the body of Christ (sacerdos
   corporis Christi), his dignity comes most distinctly to view. The Mass
   was assailed as unbiblical by Wyclif. On the part of others also
   opposition arose in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries against the
   low masses and masses for souls, which, however, was directed, as a
   rule, only against the abuse (abusus).

   4. Penance. [438] Although in theory baptism and the Eucharist were
   placed together and emphasised as the two principal Sacraments, yet, as
   a fact, the two chief closely connected Sacraments were baptism and
   penance ("second plank after ship-wreck" [secunda tabula post
   naufragium] -- so first Tertullian, after him many teachers). But
   inasmuch as baptism is only administered once, while the Sacrament of
   Penance is administered repeatedly, and as almost every baptised person
   comes to be in a position for requiring this latter Sacrament, for
   which no other can be substituted, this Sacrament became practically
   the most important means of grace. Now, as the Church had completely
   saturated this Sacrament with its hierarchical spirit, and at the same
   time attached to it its enfeebled doctrines of sin, grace, and merit,
   the most important means of grace thus became subordinated to the
   meaner ecclesiastical tendencies. [439]

   The hierarchical practice, which the laity themselves demanded as a
   security for grace, preceded the theory by many centuries. In respect
   of theory there was a special shyness on this point, and an adhering to
   the evangelical line of thought, that the genuine contrition of the
   Christian is in itself "sacramental" (see above). [440] In spite of the
   attempts of Hugo to define the Sacrament of Penance in a stricter
   ecclesiastical sense (the priest effects forgiveness; but Hugo still
   demands, on the other side, the perfect contritio), [441] the Lombard
   as the disciple of Abelard, and Master Roland, too, [442] adhered to
   the old ecclesiastical theory. [443] Gratian placed the old and new
   views side by side, without coming to a decision himself. [444]

   The Lateran Council of 1215 laid here also the basis of a fixed
   doctrine. This doctrine appears in perfected form, not yet in Alexander
   of Hales, but certainly in Thomas. Thomas shows first (in Q. 84) that
   penance is a Sacrament. In the 1st Art. he starts the objections that
   there are no corporeal things (corporales res) present, that penance is
   not dispensed "by ministers of Christ," but is inwardly wrought by God,
   and, finally, that we cannot distinguish between sacramentum, res, and
   res and sacramentum. But he sets aside these objections by pointing to
   the visible acts of the penitent and of the absolving priest, and by
   recognising in the former, which are completed by the latter, the
   materia sacramenti. In the 2nd Art. he shows that these acts are the
   materia proxima (proximate material), while the sins "to be detested
   and destroyed" (peccata detestenda et destruenda) are the materia
   remain (remote material). In the 3rd Art. there follows the fatal proof
   that the words, "I absolve thee" (ego te absolvo) are the form (forma)
   of the Sacrament, for "this Sacrament receives its full effect from
   those things which are spoken by the priest " (hoc sacramentum
   perficitur per ea quæ sunt ex parte sacerdotis); but these words of the
   priest are by appointment of Christ (Matt. 16). Since the Sacraments
   "effect what they represent" (efficiunt quod figurant), it is not
   enough in the sacramental absolution to say, "May God have mercy on
   thee" (misereatur tui deus); "yet such language is also premised in the
   sacramental absolution, that the effect of the Sacrament may not be
   hindered on the side of the penitent" (præmittitur tamen etiam in
   sacramentali absolutione talis oratio, ne impediatur effectus
   sacramenti ex parte pænitentis). The general rule that God alone
   forgives sin is not violated by the priest's absolution, for the
   priests are "authorised ministers" (this is a makeshift). In Art. 4 the
   laying on of the hand at confession is dealt with (it is not necessary,
   as what is contemplated is forgiveness of sins, not the obtaining of
   positive grace). In Art. 5 the necessity of sacramental penance for
   anyone guilty of mortal sin is shown: "the salvation of the sinner --
   that is, that his sin be removed from him -- is not possible without
   the Sacrament of Penance, in which there operates the virtue of
   Christ's passion, through absolution of the priest together with the
   work of the penitent, who co-operates with grace for the destruction of
   sin." To this there is further added: "When once anyone has fallen into
   sin (ex quo aliquis peccatum incurrit), love, faith, and mercy do not
   deliver the man from sin without penitence (as if they could exist at
   all without penitence!); for love requires that a man grieve for the
   offence committed against his friend, and that a man be anxious to
   satisfy his friend; faith also requires that he seek to be justified
   from his sins through the virtue of the passion of Christ, which
   operates in the Sacraments of the Church; rightly directed mercy
   (misericordia ordinata) also requires that a man find a remedy in his
   repenting for the misery into which his sin has plunged him (ut homo
   subveniat pænitendo suæ miseriæ, quam per peccatum incurrit)" (but the
   necessity of sacramental penance has not thus been proved). In Art. 6
   it is shown that penance is "the second plank after shipwreck." In Art.
   8 it is explained that the "pænitentia" does not need to last till the
   end of life, but only "for a time determined by the measure of the sin"
   (ad determinatum tempus pro mensura peccati); yet "penitence is
   twofold, viz., internal and external. That is internal penitence in
   which one grieves over sin committed, and such penitence ought to last
   till the close of life. . . . That is external penitence in which one
   shows external signs of grief, and verbally (verbo tenus) confesses his
   sins to the priest who absolves him, and makes satisfaction according
   to the priest's judgment (juxta ejus arbitrium satisfacit); and such
   penitence does not need to continue till the end of life, but only for
   a time determined by the measure of the sin." In Art. 9 it is shown
   that a penitence continuous in act (continua secundum actum) is
   impossible, but that a penitence continuous in habit (secundum habitum)
   is obligatory. In Art. 10 it is proved that sacramental penance can be
   repeated; love can be lost through free will; but God's mercy seeks
   always to restore it. In Q. 85 there now follows a minute inquiry into
   penance as "virtue," and in Q. 86 the effect of penance is dealt with
   "as regards the remission of mortal sins" (quoad mortalium peccatorum
   remissionem). Here it is explained in Art. 4 that with the forgiveness
   of guilt and the cancelling of eternal penalty all the "penal
   liability" (reatus poenæ) is not blotted out ("potest remanere"). If
   sin, that is to say, is departure from God as the supreme good, and "a
   perverse turning to mutable good" (conversio inordinata ad commutabile
   bonum), then there follows from the former eternal, from the latter
   temporal guilt and penalty. Now, although penance takes the eternal
   guilt and penalty, as well as the temporal guilt, entirely away, yet
   the temporal penalty may remain; for "in baptism a man attains to
   (consequitur) a remission of his whole penal guilt (reatus totius
   poenæ), but in penance he attains to the virtue of the passion of
   Christ according to the measure of his own acts (secundum modum
   propriorum actuum) (this, then, is the ultimate ground of the strange
   and objectionable view) which are the material of penance (qui sunt
   materia pænitentiæ); and so it is not always by the first act of
   penance, by which blame (culpa) is remitted, that liability to the
   whole penalty is cancelled, but by all the acts of penance when
   completed" (et ideo non statim per primum actum pænitentiae quo
   remittitur culpa, solvitur reatus totius poenæ, sed completis omnibus
   pænitentiæ actibus). [445] In Q. 87, in which the forgiveness of venial
   sins through penance is treated, it is shown that to one guilty of
   mortal sin no venial sins are forgiven, so long as the mortal sin is
   not blotted out (Art. 4). With Q. 90 begins the inquiry into the "parts
   of penance."

   As all these thoughts of Thomas were no doubt already common property
   in his day, so they continued also to be among the Schoolmen. The
   necessity of priestly absolution, hence also confession before the
   priest, and, still further, the idea of the effectual action of the
   priest in the Sacrament, were settled matters. [446] The inner
   contrition was certainly regarded as res and sacramentum (the res
   sacramenti is the forgiveness of sins, the Sacrament is the external
   acts of the penitent and the priests, see Thomas III., Q. 84, Art. 1);
   but it is not enough, and just because it is not yet enough, the
   perverse opinion could easily creep in ex contrario, that perfect
   contrition is, indeed, essential to non-sacramental penitence, but that
   in the case of sacramental penitence the addition of the Sacrament
   completes the imperfect contrition. This opinion not merely crept in,
   it became actually dominant. But in the definition of the particular
   parts of penance (partes pænitentiæ) a general perversion of the worst
   kind made its appearance, of which the seeds, indeed, are to be found
   already in Thomas. [447]

   With respect to contrition, no other thought was entertained till the
   thirteenth century (see above, p. 221 ff.) than that what is alone of
   account before God is a perfect penitent disposition, i.e., a
   disposition prompted by love. [448] Contrition as an inner spirit and
   habit was magnified as an essential Christian virtue, and as "virtue"
   received elaborate treatment. [449] But it was already pointed out by
   Alexander of Hales that God has made entrance into the Church easier
   for man, [450] and he distinguishes attritio (timor servilis [servile
   fear]) from contritio. This distinction Thomas adopted. He explains,
   however: "attrition, as is declared by all, is not a virtuous activity"
   (attritio, ut ab omnibus dicitur, non est actus virtutis). Yet he then
   defines it in the same article as "in spiritual matters a certain
   displeasure over sins committed, which, however, is not perfect, but is
   an approach to perfect contrition" (in spiritualibus quædum
   displicentia de peccatis commissis, sed non perfecta, [quæ est]
   accessus ad perfectam contritionem). [451] Prior to him Bonaventura had
   already said: [452] "For the Sacrament of Penance it is not necessary
   that he who comes to it has love, or an inclination to love that is
   sufficient when judged by the standard of truth, provided it be
   sufficient when judged by the standard of probability; but this
   disposition is attritio, which, by reason of superadded confession and
   absolution of the priest, frequently so receives form from grace
   (formatur per gratiam), that it becomes contritio, or that contritio
   follows upon it." This thought Thomas did not adopt; he tacitly
   rejected it rather, and expressed himself altogether with strictness
   and earnestness regarding contritio and its necessity in Q. 1-5. Yet
   the considerations suggested by Alexander of Hales [453] and
   Bonaventura continued to have their influence. It was especially Scotus
   who secured currency for the view, that attrition, in itself
   inadequate, is sufficient for the reception of the Sacrament of
   Penance, since the Sacrament itself makes the sorrow perfect by
   "infusion of grace." [454] On this point the decrees of Trent adopted
   -- though, indeed, only conditionally -- the side of the Scotists.
   [455]

   The theologian on confession (before the priest) is Thomas, the Lombard
   having previously, as Catholic scholars express it, thrown obscurity
   over the connection between confession and the Sacrament, and over the
   necessity of the former, an obscurity not yet entirely removed even by
   Halesius. [456] In Q. 6 (P. III. Suppl.) Thomas has dealt at length
   with the necessity of confession. In Art. 1 its absolute necessity is
   proved from the nature of the case; [457] in Art. 2 it is shown that
   confession is divinely enjoined (juris divini); in 3 it is pointed out
   that though, according to divine law, only those guilty of mortal sin
   are obliged to confess, yet according to positive law all Christians
   must confess at least once a year; [458] in Art. 4 it is laid down that
   one may not confess sins of which he does not know himself to be
   guilty; in 5 it is declared that it is not necessary to salvation (de
   necessitate salutis) to confess sins at once, but that delay is not
   without danger, and that a regard to Church regulations (times of
   confession) is advisable; finally in 6 it is proved that a dispensation
   exempting from confession (for ever) can on no account whatever be
   given; even the Pope can as little be exempted from confession as he
   can declare that a man can be saved without baptism. [459]

   Q. 7 treats of the "quidditas confessionis," i.e., of its nature, as
   "disclosure of the latent disease in the hope of pardon" (aperitio
   latentis morbi spe veniæ); and also as an " exercise of virtue" (actus
   virtutis) [460] and as an "exercise of the virtue of penitence" (actus
   virtutis pænitentiæ). Q. 8 is specially important, for it develops the
   doctrine as to the administrator ("minister") of confession. Here it is
   at once said in Art. 1: "The grace that is conferred in the Sacraments
   descends from the head to the members, and so he only is the minister
   of the Sacraments in which grace is given, who has a ministry in
   connection with the true body of Christ (qui habet ministerium super
   corpus Christi verum), which belongs only to the priest who is able to
   consecrate the Eucharist, and therefore as in the Sacrament of Penance
   grace is conferred, the priest only is minister of this Sacrament, and
   therefore to him only must be made the sacramental confession
   (sacramentalis confessio) which ought to be made to the minister of the
   Church." But in Art. 2 it is conceded, that "in case of necessity a
   layman supplies the place of the priest, so that it is possible to make
   confession to him" (in necessitate etiam laicus vicem sacerdotis
   supplet, ut ei confessio fieri possit). [461] The necessity of
   confessing venial sins to the priest is denied (Art. 3), and this view
   continued to be held, as even Duns assented to it. Confession must take
   place before the Parochus (priest of the parish); only by authority of
   one of higher rank ("ex superioris privilegio") and in case of death
   ("in casu mortis") (Art. 4-6) may this be departed from. In Q. 9, on
   the "quality of confession," Art. 2, which treats of the "integrity of
   the confession," [462] and Art. 3, which forbids confession "through
   another or in writing," are specially important. [463] Q. 10 deals with
   the effect of confession, and 11 with the reticence of the minister,
   which is very strongly accentuated ("God covers the sin of him who
   surrenders himself in penitence; hence this also should be indicated in
   the Sacrament of Penance (hoc oportet in sacramento pænitentiæ
   significari), and thus it is of the essence of the Sacrament (de
   necessitate sacramenti), that one conceal confession, and he sins as a
   violator of the Sacraments who reveals confession" (et tanquam violator
   sacramenti peccat, qui confessionem revelat).

   These definitions of Thomas underwent, indeed, many modifications in
   the Scotist School, but in substance they became permanent.

   Confession is made before the priest; it is followed by absolution. We
   have already pointed out how much time elapsed before the new ideas
   became currently accepted, (1) that confession must be made to the
   priest, [464] (2) that the priest confers absolution as proceeding from
   himself (in the exercise of divine authority) [465] and as effectual
   (Matth. 16, John 20). The power of absolution, which is given to every
   priest, appears complicated because it is connected with the power of
   jurisdiction (in its application), which, as is well known, was graded.
   Here also Thomas was the first to furnish the theory; for even for
   Halesius and Bonaventura there are still points of uncertainty, which
   were due to the continued influence of the older view. In the Summa P.
   III., Suppl. Q. 17-24, Thomas has developed the doctrine of the power
   of the keys (potestas clavium), and has shown that the priest's
   absolution is the "causa instrumentalis" (in a physical sense) of the
   forgiveness of sin. But in the Scotist School, which in general relaxed
   the connection between the Sacrament and the res sacramenti, only a
   moral communication, through absolution, of forgiveness of sin was
   assumed, the priest being held as moving God by means of his absolution
   to fulfil his "covenant." The priests' power of jurisdiction has also
   been dealt with by Thomas, and from his time it was always treated in
   connection with the theory of absolution, although it leads in a quite
   different direction, is really calculated indeed to weaken confidence
   in the power of every priest to absolve. It was asserted, that is to
   say, by the majority, though not by all, that the power of jurisdiction
   is also ex jure divino (by divine authority), and that the restrictions
   therefore on the permissible conferring of absolution were not merely
   ecclesiastical regulations, but had divine right. But in the Middle
   Ages there had by this time developed itself an immense system of
   special permissions, reservations, etc., which had their basis in
   arbitrary decisions of the Popes. The position, though vigorously
   contested, continued to be held as valid, that ecclesiastical superiors
   "in conveying judicial power in foro interno can by reservation make
   any kind of restrictions in respect of duration, place, and object."
   Was it not inevitable that by such procedure, in dealing with which it
   was impossible for the layman to find his way, confusion and
   uncertainty should arise about the Sacrament? [466]

   Absolution is preceded by the appointment of satisfactio, if such has
   not already been made. Here the priest acts as a skilled physician
   (medicus peritus) and impartial judge (judex aequus). The practice of
   satisfactions (Church-penances) is very old (see vol. v., p. 268 f.,
   324 ff.), the giving it a mechanical form and the over-estimation of it
   -- by putting it alongside contritio as a part of penance -- are in
   theory comparatively new. The idea is now this, that satisfactio, as a
   portion of the Sacrament of Penance, is the necessary manifestation of
   sorrow through works that are fitted to furnish a certain satisfaction
   to the injured God (and thereby become the occasion also for limiting
   the temporal penalties). In baptism there is forgiveness of the sin,
   along with the penalty, without any satisfaction; but God requires from
   the baptised person a certain satisfaction -- although both before and
   now the merit of Christ is the decisive thing -- partly because the man
   can render a certain satisfaction, partly because it serves to make him
   better, and is fitted to protect him against further sins. But this
   satisfaction is only of real value when it is rendered in a state of
   grace (caritas). Hence the man guilty of mortal sin must first be
   absolved, that he may then furnish the satisfaction which is required
   of him, and which he has promised to render prior to absolution. But
   there is a certain value also in works that are not performed in a
   state of grace (caritas); even they are not without their weight as
   satisfactions, and can abridge the temporal penalties of sin. The
   satisfying works are especially prayer, fasting, and alms; for they
   deliver man from his natural disposition. But the Schoolmen also
   justified the practice that originated in the wilder times of the
   Germanic Church, according to which satisfaction can, under certain
   circumstances, be rendered by others, because Christians are united to
   one another as members of one body. And this leads us to the subject of
   indulgences. [467]

   Indulgences. The doctrine of indulgence stands inwardly in closest
   relation to the doctrine of attritio; outwardly it appears as a
   consequence of the doctrine of satisfactio. [468] Theoretically it has
   nothing to do with the reatus culpæ (moral culpability) and the reatus
   poenæ æternæ (liability to eternal death); in practice there not only
   arose, in the Middle Ages, serious irregularities, which the Catholics
   (see the Council of Trent) admit, but these irregularities still
   continue, and nothing is done to check the over-estimation of
   indulgences. [469]

   Scholasticism found indulgences already in existence, a great increase
   of them having taken place especially in the period of the Crusades. It
   simply framed its theory according to the practice. If the doctrine of
   satisfaction was already an extremely arbitrary one, which, in spite of
   all saving clauses, necessarily endangered the importance of
   repentance, the doctrine of indulgence became arbitrariness
   intensified, and exercised an extremely ruinous influence on religion
   and morality. The practice and theory of indulgences can, no doubt, be
   idealised, nay, it is possible indeed to justify, in a certain way, the
   idealised practice. [470] Were that not possible it would be incredible
   that so many earnest Christians have defended indulgences. But the
   scholastic theology by no means idealised them.

   The practice of indulgences has its root in the commutations. The
   exchange of more arduous for easier penitential acts was called
   indulgence. [471] The penance performances were here taken into
   consideration in their significance for the expiation of the temporal
   penalties of sin. The heaviest temporal penalties for sin were those of
   purgatory: for the earthly penalties for sin were, on the one hand, as
   experience taught, unavoidable, and on the other hand, even though one
   thought of year-long penances, they were of no weight as compared with
   the long and painful penalties in purgatory. It was a refined practice
   of the Church, which had gradually developed itself, to comfort men in
   an easy way about hell by means of grace (Sacrament of Penance), and,
   on the other hand, to terrify them by means of purgatory. Was this
   purgatory, then, not also a hell? But how skilfully was the whole idea
   derived from studying the moral feelings of the homines attriti (men
   practising attrition)! [472] They did not really believe in hell,
   because the gravity of sin had not been disclosed to them, and because,
   accordingly, they were not to be constrained to a life in God. Hence
   the Church shut up hell by means of the Sacrament of Penance. But that
   at some period in the future it would, for a long time, go very badly
   with them, and that one day they must expiate all their sins, -- that
   they believed. Therefore the Church opened purgatory. [473] That this
   purgatory could be made less severe or briefer, these homines attriti
   were also very ready to believe; for they lived, all of them, in the
   thought that good performances simply compensate for delinquencies, and
   even the "gallows contrition" is not so enduring as to constrain men to
   practise serious repentance -- even in the sense of steady self-denial
   and heroic action. Hence the Church discloses indulgences. In them she
   shows to the man of lower type her real power; for the magic of the
   Sacrament of Penance has certainly not yet given him complete rest. He
   has a remnant of the moral feeling that something must be done on his
   part in order that forgiveness may become credible and sure. "Faith"
   and "contrition" he neither can nor will practise, but something he
   will willingly do. Here the Church now intervenes, and says to him that
   his poor performance can be converted and transformed by the power of
   the Church into something so lofty that by means of it the penalties of
   sin in purgatory are abolished. The man wishes to know no more. What
   has still to happen can cause him little concern, and the Church itself
   says to him that if he is well provided with the Sacrament of Penance,
   what follows will not affect him. [474] Attritio, sacramentum
   pænitentiæ, indulgentia, -- these form the Catholic triad. What was to
   be done for the indulgence was the only burdensome thing here; but even
   this was made very easy. Thus the indulgence became a caricature
   (persiflage) of Christianity as the religion of redemption through
   Christ.

   The theory of the Schoolmen is as follows: After there had been
   uncertainty till far on in the thirteenth century as to whether the
   indulgences did not relate merely to the ecclesiastical penalties
   imposed by the priest, Thomas laid it down that they apply in general
   to the liability to temporal penalty (reatus temporalis poenæ) ("on
   earth and in purgatory"). The righteousness of God demands that no sin
   shall remain "inordinate" (inordinata), and that man shall also perform
   what he can perform. He is obliged, accordingly, even as absolved, to
   discharge the temporal penalties of sin. But what the merit of Christ
   does not do of itself and directly, inasmuch as in the Sacrament it
   cancels only the reatus culpæ et poenæ, it does outwith the Sacrament
   as merit. Christ, that is to say, has done more by His suffering than
   was required for redemption, and even many saints have acquired for
   themselves merit which God's grace rewards. This surplus merit
   (thesaurus operum supererogatoriorum [treasury of supererogatory
   works]) must necessarily fall to the benefit of the Church as the body
   of Christ, since neither Christ nor the saints can derive further
   advantage from it. But alongside the Sacrament of Penance it cannot
   have another effect than to moderate, abridge, or cancel the temporal
   penalties of sin. It can be applied only to those who, in penitent
   spirit, have been absolved after making confession, and it is
   administered in the first instance by the Pope as the head of the
   Church. Yet by him a partial power of ad-ministration can be conveyed
   to others. The regular mode of making the application is by requiring
   for the indulgence a comparatively very small performance
   ("eleemosynae," i.e., penance money.) [475]

   Now this theory -- keeping practice quite out of view -- still admitted
   in detail of very different modifications (nuances). It could also be
   conceived of more strictly or more laxly. In particular, the demand
   that one must be in a contrite frame of mind could be lowered to an
   extraordinary degree. [476] But not only did that happen; the practice,
   as has already been indicated, struck out on quite different paths.
   With more or less of design, it left the question in obscurity as to
   what really was cancelled by the indulgence (see the ambiguous
   expression "for the salvation of the soul," and others similar); it
   substituted for the demand for true sorrow and honest resolution to
   reform a reference to the Sacrament of Penance, or it was quite silent
   upon the demand; it gave to the indulgence an interpretation in which
   the power of the Church and the priest thrust aside the theoretic basis
   of the merit of Christ, and, finally, it encouraged the shocking folly
   of believing that, by the means of religion, man can provide himself
   with temporal advantages, and that beyond this, the spirit and power of
   religion are summed up in warding off just punishments. With all this
   there is still unmentioned the ruinous effect that must have been
   produced by the frequently shameful use of the indulgence money, and by
   the whole speculative system of the Curia. The Sacrament of Penance
   culminated unfortunately in these indulgences, and without incurring
   the charge of deriding, one may state concisely the final word of this
   system thus: Every man who surrenders himself to the Catholic Church,
   and who, for some reason, is not quite satisfied with the inner state
   of his heart, can secure salvation and deliverance from all eternal and
   temporal penalties -- if he acts with shrewdness and finds a skilful
   priest. [477]

   Against this theory there not only was a reaction on the part of the
   re-invigorated or Augustinian Thomism, in the shape of a strong
   insistence on the moral and religious requirements for the reception of
   indulgences, but -- keeping the sects out of view -- there also arose
   in the fourteenth century a radical opposition, which had likewise an
   Augustinian (and biblical) basis. Against no other ecclesiastical
   practice and theory did Wyclif assume so determined an attitude as
   against indulgences. He saw in them nothing but arbitrariness, which
   had only forced its way in of recent times; the Bible knew nothing of
   indulgences, which encroached upon the prerogative of God, and were
   therefore positively blasphemous. He also saw clearly the mischief of
   indulgences in hindering obedience to the law of Christ; still he did
   not frame a satisfactory theory as to how a distressed conscience can
   be comforted. For him, and for his scholar Huss, the perniciousness of
   indulgences lies simply in their unbiblical character, in the
   pretensions of the hierarchy (the Pope), and in the corruption of
   morals. But indulgences cannot be rooted out by merely quickening
   conscience and contending against priestly power. [478]

   Not less strenuous than the opposition of Wyclif and Huss to the
   indulgences were the attacks of Wesel and Wessel. Both likewise wrote
   from the standpoint of Augustine against the indulgences. They too
   described the theory as unbiblical and as unsupported by any tradition,
   and used as weapons for overthrowing it the sole efficiency of God, the
   majesty of the divine penal righteousness and the gratia gratis data
   (caritas infusa). The punishments which God decrees man cannot avert;
   only the penalties of positive law, or the ecclesiastical penalties,
   can the Pope remit. God infuses His grace without merit (sine merito),
   but only in the case of those who are perfectly disposed for it. At the
   same time Wesel relaxes the connection between sacrament and
   communication of grace (nominalistically: "propter pactum institutum
   cum sacerdotibus" [on account of an agreement instituted with the
   priests]). At bottom there is no distinction between his doctrine of
   the Sacrament and the vulgar one. He is merely unable, from feeling
   more decidedly the majesty of God, to draw the conclusions from the
   indulgences, which, along with others, he calls "piæ fraudes." [479]
   The Church, in spite of these forms of opposition, went on its way.
   [480]

   5. Extreme unction. [481] Only from Thomas's time was it asserted that
   Christ Himself instituted this Sacrament, while the Apostle James (5,
   14) only proclaimed it. The Materia is oil blessed by the bishop, while
   the episcopal consecration was declared "conveniens" by Thomas on the
   same ground as in the case of confirmation (expression of the higher
   power of the bishop with respect to the "mystical body of Christ," see
   above, p. 231, note; hence the Pope can also give power to ordinary
   priests to consecrate). The "form" is a deprecatory prayer (the
   indicative form can at the most be added). The administrator is any
   priest. The Sacrament can be repeated. [482] The receivers are those
   under fatal illness and the dying. The purpose (res sacramenti) is the
   remission of sins (remissio peccatorum), but only of venial sins, or
   the cleansing away of the remains of sin, or occasionally (per
   accidens), that is, if no hindrance exists, the full forgiveness of
   sins. [483] Therefore the Sacrament is also defined as "completion" of
   the Sacrament of Penance, though it remains quite dark why and how far
   this Sacrament needs completion. Here also, as in the case of
   confirmation, we have to do, not with a Sacrament that is the product
   of a dogmatic theory, but with an observance, the value of which is
   raised so high on grounds of expediency, [484] while theoretically it
   is rated very low. Even bodily healing is expected, if it please God,
   from this Sacrament.

   6. Priestly ordination. [485] In connection with this Sacrament the
   general sacramental theory can be maintained, if at all, only by
   artifice, because the hierarchical interest created it, and introduced
   it into the sacramental system of grace simply with a view to
   self-glorification. The "form" is the words "accipe potestatem
   offerendi" (receive the power of offering); the "material" cannot be
   pointed out to the senses with certainty; but Thomas here made a virtue
   of necessity, and the others followed him; from the very uncertainty
   the hierarchical nature of the Sacrament is proved. [486] One thought
   of the vessels or symbols by which the hierarchical functions were
   represented (Thomas), another of the laying on of hands. The former was
   asserted by Eugene IV. in the Bull "Exultate" (l.c.). The dispenser is
   solely the bishop. Here there arose, however, many questions, in some
   respects entering deep into ecclesiastical law and ecclesiastical
   practice, indirectly also into dogmatic, which will only be noted here;
   (1) on the seven orders (ordines), and their relation (the Pope can
   empower even an ordinary priest to ordain to the lower orders); (2) on
   the relation of the priestly to the episcopal consecration (in how far
   is the bishop superior to the priest? in respect of divine right? (jure
   divino); (3) -- and this was the most important question -- on the
   validity of orders that have been conferred by schismatic or heretical
   bishops. From as far back as the Donatist conflict there prevailed a
   controversy on this point, which was decided in the Church, as a rule,
   in a liberal spirit, to the effect, namely, that such ordinations are
   indeed unpermitted, i.e., are null and void as to their practical
   effects, but yet are not invalid. On the other hand the Lombard
   asserted that no heretic can duly celebrate confirmation, the Eucharist
   and ordination to the priesthood. Thereafter there prevailed among the
   Scholastic theologians great uncertainty; yet there was a growing
   leaning to the liberal view. the Sacrament of Penance alone being
   excepted. But in the Middle Ages the Popes very often declared entirely
   invalid the ordinations of bishops who were under disfavour and of
   rival Popes. As regards the effect of this Sacrament, the character was
   here the chief matter. [487] It consists in the conveyance of the right
   to dispense the Sacraments, [488] to forgive sins, to officiate as
   judge, and to be mediator between God and men. [489] But on the other
   hand, again, all the seven orders were called Sacraments by some (in
   the case of others they are regarded only as sacramentalia), although
   it was added, that only the diaconate and the presbyterate have
   institution by Christ as their basis. The episcopate could not be
   reckoned as a special ordo, because tradition forbade it; but efforts
   were made to assign to it a special position, higher than the ordinary
   priesthood, and given to it by Chi ist, and a basis was found for it,
   not in sacramental, but in judicial power. Duns Scotus, moreover, laid
   down the lines of the doctrine, that the episcopal consecration is a
   special Sacrament.

   7. Marriage. [490] Like the former Sacrament, this one also encroaches,
   in the particular questions connected with it, on the field of
   ecclesiastical law, only that these questions are tenfold more numerous
   than in the case of the other. The expediency of declaring marriage a
   Sacrament, and thereby bringing this foundation of society under
   ecclesiastical jurisdiction is obvious. Just on that account it was
   overlooked also that the declaring of marriage a Sacrament implied that
   breaches had previously been made in the general conception of a
   Sacrament. Marriage was already instituted by God in Paradise for the
   propagation of the human race (and therefore as an obligation [ad
   officium]), and to be indissoluble too; but according to Thomas it was
   only raised to the position of a Sacrament by Christ, inasmuch as He
   made it the picture of His union with the Church, thereby established
   anew its indissoluble character, and also united with marriage a saving
   gift. [491] So far as it also provides for propagation within the
   Church, its sacramental character is already justified; [492] but
   besides its sacramental effect, marriage, since the Fall, has also the
   character of an indulgence, as "remedium" against the insurgent
   passions of the flesh. [493] It is further admitted, that among all the
   Sacraments marriage has the "minimum de spiritualitate," [494] hence it
   stands in the last place, and the unmarried life is to be preferred.
   The examination of the question, whether the "copula carnalis," or, the
   right to demand the "debitum conjugale," belongs to the essence of
   marriage, was necessarily treated with Joseph's marriage in view. As
   there was no wish to exclude that right from the essence of marriage
   (the assertion of the right does not belong to its essence), one was
   led to the interesting question whether Mary, when she concluded
   marriage with Joseph, was not obliged to agree conditionally to a
   possible assertion of the right of marriage on the part of Joseph. The
   Lombard still answered this question in the affirmative; [495] but
   Bonaventura already found another way of solving it. [496] As to
   "material" and "form," there prevailed the greatest uncertainty. Yet in
   the Middle Ages it was not doubted that the decisive external sign is
   the expressed "consensus" of the parties to the marriage, [497] the
   priest's blessing was held to be only "a sacramental," not the
   Sacrament. [498] Many Schoolmen, it is true, sought to extract an
   effectual spiritual character, but the majority recognised only a quite
   undefined saving grace. [499] On the other hand Durandus denied
   entirely the opus operatum (the saving grace), saying that marriage
   only signifies something sacred (union of the Church with Christ).
   [500] That excessive recognition of saving grace stands in flagrant
   opposition to the view that was derived from Augustine, that the
   "copula carnalis" in marriage, because it is not materially different
   from the "copula carnalis fornicatoria," is so deeply infected with
   sin, that sin is committed, not indeed by the partner who consents, but
   by the partner who demands, even when it is done for the purpose of
   avoiding adultery. [501] While therefore the Sacrament consists in the
   expressed "consensus" to enter into marriage with a person of the other
   sex, and thereby the right of the "debitum conjugale" is implicitly
   laid down, the assertion of this sacramental right is to be held a sin!
   [502] In the Bull of Eugene IV. (l.c). there is to be found, again, a
   short serviceable summing up."Septimum est sacramentum matrimonii, quod
   est signum conjunctionis Christi et ecclesiæ secundum apostolum. Causa
   efficiens matrimonii regulariter est mutuus consensus per verba de
   præsenti expressus. Adsignatur autem triplex bonum matrimonii. Primum
   est proles suscipienda et educanda ad cultum dei. Secundum est fides
   quam unus conjugum alteri servare debet. Tertium indivisibilitas
   matrimonii, propter hoc quod significat indivisibilem conjunctionem
   Christi et ecclesiæ. Quamvis autem ex causa fornicationis liceat tori
   separationem facere, non tamen aliud matrimonium contrahere fas est,
   cum matrimonii vinculum legitime contracti perpetuum sit." How strong
   still in the fourteenth century was the disinclination of the Scotist
   theologians to regard marriage as a full sacrament, may be seen from
   Werner, II., p. 424 ff. (against Durandus Aureolus).

   In the doctrine of the Sacraments Thomas was the teacher of determining
   influence in the Middle Ages, and he has remained such to the present
   day in the Catholic Church. But, so far as the new ecclesiasticism
   admitted of it at all, Thomas went back to Augustine. Yet how strongly
   even in him the doctrine of the gratia gratis data (grace graciously
   bestowed) is affected by a regard to the doctrine, that God treats with
   us according to our merits; how this latter view, which Augustine had
   not entirely eradicated, still exercised its influence, Thomas's
   doctrine of the Sacraments shows already very plainly. The earnest,
   truly religious spirit which distinguished him was increasingly
   weakened and led astray by regard for what was held valid. Yet that,
   certainly, is not the only weakness. An influence, at least equally
   pernicious, was exercised by the logical apprehension of grace as a
   physical, mysterious act, and a communication of objective benefits.
   That also originated with Augustine, and that also, logically carried
   out, broke up Augustinianism; the breaking up of Augustinianism was
   really not occasioned from without; it was in great part the result of
   an inner development. The three elements which Augustine left standing
   in and along with his doctrine of grace, the element of merit, the
   element of gratia infusa and the hierarchical priestly element,
   continued to work, till they completely transformed the Augustinian
   mode of thought. But as we have seen, that was already foreshadowed in
   Gregory the Great, and on the other hand the process did not reach its
   termination yet in the Middle Ages. The Augustinian reaction of the
   fifteenth and sixteenth centuries which partly embodied itself in the
   decrees of Trent, was only fully checked again, after a struggle for
   three hundred years, in the nineteenth century.

   C. The Revision of Augustinianism in the Direction of the Doctrine of
   Merit.

   That the grace springing from the passio Christi is the foundation of
   the Christian religion, and therefore must be the Alpha and Omega of
   Christian Theology -- this fundamental Pauline and Augustinian thought
   was directly denied by no ecclesiastical teacher of the West. [503] But
   as in itself it may mean many things, and, without definite
   interpretation, by no means guarantees the purity of the Christian
   religion -- for what is grace? God Himself in Christ, or divine forces?
   and what does grace effect? faith, or a mysterious quality? -- so also,
   if the effect of grace is to be held as only "improvement," for this
   very reason it is capable of being wrought over in a way that
   ultimately cancels it.

   The Lombard -- in accordance with his intention to reproduce tradition
   -- confined himself to repeating with precision the Augustinian
   propositions about grace, predestination and justification (faith and
   love). [504] But as soon as he brings forward propositions about free
   will, these have by no means an Augustinian, but rather a Semipelagian
   ring; for they are already dominated by a regard to merit. [505] Where
   this view is taken, that is to say, a point must always be ultimately
   found, which makes it possible to attribute a value to the independent
   action of man over against God. But the contradiction which plainly
   comes out in the Lombard, when his doctrine of grace is compared with
   his doctrine of freedom, is equally prevalent among the theologians
   before him, nay, in them it comes out more strongly, most strongly in
   Abelard. [506] There is still to be observed as noteworthy the specific
   view taken by the Lombard of saving grace, who simply identifies it
   with the Holy Spirit. His meaning is, that while all other virtues
   become man's own by means of an infused habit (habitus), love arises
   directly in the soul through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, since
   it is the indwelling Holy Spirit Himself. In this noteworthy view there
   lies the approach to a more evangelical position; for "habitus" there
   is substituted the direct activity of the Holy Ghost. Just on that
   account this view [507] seldom found followers; [508] quite as few did
   the other, that in grace the gratia gratis dans (God Himself) and the
   gratia gratis data ought to be distinguished. [509] The desire was to
   have, not God, but divine forces that can become human virtues.

   Here lies the fundamental error. In its ultimate basis the mode of view
   is not a religious but a moral one. That comes out distinctly in the
   case of the Schoolman who may be styled par excellence the theologian
   of grace, namely Thomas. It would seem as if one could not value grace
   more highly than he has done; from God to God through grace -- that is
   the theme of his entire dogmatic. And yet ultimately it is habitual
   virtue on which all depends. The decisive mistake was already made by
   Augustine. It lies in the gratia cooperans, which is distinguished from
   the gratia operans (præveniens). The latter does not procure
   justification and salvation, but the former. But the former is only
   cooperative, for it runs parallel with the liberated will, and the two
   together produce merit, which is the matter of importance. But why is
   merit the matter of importance? Because the theologian cannot conceive
   of anything else availing before God than improvement that exhibits
   itself in a habitus. That thought, however, is not framed from the
   standpoint of religion, but from the standpoint of morality, or is a
   distressed conscience to be comforted by saying that there will
   gradually be formed a habit of love? Look at it as we will, faith
   appears important here only in so far as it opens the way for the
   procuring of virtues; the gratia præveniens becomes the bridge that
   leads over to morality. But in the last analysis the cause that led to
   this scheme of doctrine lies still deeper; for we must necessarily ask,
   why is the grace, which is, of course, to dominate the whole process,
   so narrowly conceived of in respect of its power, that it is unable to
   effect, alone and perfectly, what it contemplates? The answer to this
   question must not simply run: in order to set aside the thought of an
   arbitrary procedure on God's part, for in other connections there was a
   falling back on the hidden will of God. Nor is it enough to say that
   the moral principle, that each one shall receive according to his
   deeds, furnishes the solution here; this had an influence, but was not
   the only thing that was at work. At bottom, rather, it was because the
   conception itself of God and of grace admitted of no other conclusion.
   There was no recognition of personality, neither of the personality of
   God, nor of man as a person. If even in earthly relations man cannot be
   otherwise raised to a higher stage, than by passing into a person who
   is superior, more mature, and greater, that is, by entering into
   spiritual fellowship with such an one, and attaching one's self to him
   by reverence, love, and trust, then the same holds good, but in a way
   that transcends comparison, of the rising of man from the sphere of sin
   and guilt into the sphere of God. Here no communications of things
   avail, but only fellowship of person with person; the disclosure to the
   soul, that the holy God who rules heaven and earth is its Father, with
   whom it can, and may, live as a child in its father's house -- that is
   grace, nay, that alone is grace, the trustful confidence in God,
   namely, which rests on the certainty that the separating guilt has been
   swept away. That was seen by Augustine as little as by Thomas, and it
   was not discerned even by the mediæval Mystics, who aspired to having
   intercourse with Christ as with a friend; for it was the man Jesus of
   whom they thought in seeking this. But all of them, when they think of
   God, look, not to the heart of God, but to an inscrutable Being, who,
   as He has created the world out of nothing, so is also the productive
   source of inexhaustible forces that yield knowledge and transformation
   of essence. And when they think of themselves, they think, not of the
   centre of the human ego, the spirit, which is so free and so lofty that
   it cannot be influenced by benefits that are objective, even though
   they be the greatest perceptions and the most glorious investiture, and
   at the same time is so feeble in itself that it can find support only
   in another person. Therefore they constructed the thesis: God and
   gratia (i.e., knowledge and participation in the divine nature), in
   place of the personal fellowship with God, which is the gratia. That
   gratia, only a little separated from God in the thesis, became in
   course of time always further removed from Him. It appears deposited in
   the merit of Christ, and then in the Sacraments. But in the measure in
   which it becomes more impersonal, more objective, and more external,
   confidence in it is also impaired, till at last it becomes a magical
   means, which stirs to activity the latent good agency of man, and sets
   in motion the standing machine, that it may then do its work, and that
   its work may be of account before God. One sees plainly that
   everythings depends ultimately on the conception of God. In the gratia
   cooperans that conception of God comes to view which represents God,
   not as the holy Lord in relation to guilty man, and as the Father of
   Jesus Christ in relation to His child, but as the unfathomable power
   that comes to help man with knowledge and with secret influences of a
   natural kind, in order that, by love and virtue, man may be able to win
   independent worth before Him. In Thomas it is the Augustinian
   intellectualism, closely conjoined with the doctrine of deification,
   which ultimately determines the view of God and of grace. In the later
   Schoolmen the intellectualism is surmounted, and a beautiful beginning
   is made to reflect upon will, and thereby upon personality. But as it
   is no more than a beginning, grace appears finally in Nominalism simply
   as emptied of its contents and reduced to a magical force. Where the
   simplest and the hardest thing is not taken account of--childship and
   faith in contrast with the guilt of sin -- piety and speculation are
   condemned to treat physics and morality (the natura divina and the
   bonum esse [the divine nature and the being good]) in endless
   speculations, to see grace in the conjunction of these two elements,
   with the result that, when the understanding has awakened and
   discovered its limits, there is an ending up with a bare aliquid
   (something) and with a morality that underbids itself. This conclusion
   is in keeping with the God who is inscrutable self-will, and who, just
   on that account, has set up an inscrutably arbitrary institution of
   grace as an establishment for the insurance of life.

   The fundamental features of Thomas's doctrine of grace are the
   following: [510] the external principles of moral action are the law
   and grace (Summa II. 1, Q. 90): "The exterior principle moving to
   goodness is God, who both instructs us by the law and aids us by
   grace." In Qs. 90-108 the law is treated, and in Q. 107, Art. 4, it is
   asserted, that although the new law is easier as respects the external
   commands, it is more difficult as respects the "repression of the inner
   impulses" (cohibitio interiorum motuum). [511] In Qs. 109-114 there
   follows the doctrine of grace. Thomas treats first (Q. 109) of the
   necessity of grace. In Art. 1 it is laid down that it is impossible
   without grace to know any truth. The exposition is extremely noteworthy
   because it is very strongly determined by Aristotelian influences.
   [512] At the same time the intellectualism of Thomas comes out here
   most distinctly: grace is the communication of super-natural knowledge;
   but the "light of grace" (lumen gratiæ) is, moreover, "superadded to
   nature" (naturæ superadditum). In both these views a disastrous step
   forward is taken; for what is "superadded" is not necessary to the
   accomplishment of man's end, but reaches beyond it, may therefore be
   wanting, or establishes, if it is present, a superhuman worth, and
   hence a merit. Only now in Art. 2 is the relation of grace to moral
   goodness spoken of. Here appears at once the consequence of the
   "superadditum." To man in his state of integrity the capacity is
   ascribed to do in his own strength "the good proportionate to his
   nature" (bonum suae naturae proportionatum)--God only comes into view
   here, as everywhere else, as "primus movens" (the primary mover); yet
   divine help was needed in order to obtain a meritorious "bonum
   superexcedens" (surplus goodness). But after the Fall there is need in
   order to both these ends of grace, which must first restore man's
   nature. Accordingly a twofold grace is required by him here. In this
   way the distinction is already drawn between gratia operans and gratia
   cooperans, and at the same time there is contemplated as man's goal a
   supernatural state, which can only be reached by help of the second
   grace, which produces merits. [513] In Art. 3 the question as to
   whether man can love God above all things without grace is dealt with
   in the same way: Nature before the Fall is certainly capable of that;
   for it is "quiddam connaturale homini" (something congenial to man);
   but after the Fall nature is incapable of it. "Man in the state of
   unfallen nature did not need the gift of grace superadded to natural
   goodness (naturalibus bonis) for loving God naturally above all things,
   though he needed the aid of God moving him to this, but in the state of
   corrupt nature man needs also for this the help of grace that heals
   nature." [514] In Art. 5 it is said regarding the question as to
   whether without grace man can merit eternal life, that every nature
   can, by its action, only bring about an effect which is proportionate
   to its strength. "But eternal life is an end exceeding the proportions
   (proportionem) of human nature; hence man cannot in his own strength
   produce meritorious works which are proportionate to eternal life.
   Therefore without grace man cannot merit eternal life." Nothing is said
   here of merits de congruo, nay, in Art. 6 it is denied that by natural
   good deeds man can prepare for this grace; [515] no doubt conversion to
   God comes about in free will, but the will cannot turn to God unless
   God converts it; for man cannot raise himself independently from the
   state of sin without grace, [516] cannot even in this state avoid with
   certainty mortal sins (Art. 8), nay even the redeemed man needs grace
   in order not to fall into sin; [517] hence perseverance is also a
   special gift of grace. [518]

   After this, in Q. I to, the essence of grace is described. The inquiry
   begins very characteristically with the question "whether grace places
   anything in the soul" (utrum gratia ponat aliquid in anima). Here it is
   laid down that gratia has a threefold meaning = benevolent disposition,
   free gift without equivalent, and thanks. Divine grace is not only
   benevolent disposition, but also gift, and therefore "it is manifest
   that grace places something in him who receives grace." Now the
   definition: "Thus, therefore, by man's being said to have the grace of
   God, there is signified something supernatural in man proceeding from
   God. Sometimes, however, the grace of God is a designation for God's
   eternal love itself, as it is also called the grace of predestination,
   in so far as God has predestinated or chosen some gratuitously, and not
   on the ground of merit" (sic igitur per hoc, quod dicitur homo gratiam
   dei habere, significatur quiddam supernaturale in homine a deo
   proveniens. Quandoque tamen gratia dei dicitur ipsa æterna dei
   dilectio, secundum quod dicitur etiam gratia prædestinationis, in
   quantum deus gratuito et non ex meritis aliquos prædestinavit sive
   elegit). [519] But as grace "places something in the soul," it is also
   a quality of the soul, i.e., in addition to the help by which God in
   general moves the soul to good action, He infuses into it a
   supernatural quality. [520] In the two following articles (3 and 4) it
   is now proved that grace is not only the being filled with this or that
   quality (not only with love even), but that it is related to the
   infused virtues as the natural light of reason (lumen rationis) to the
   acquired virtues (virtutes acquisitæ), and that it is to be regarded
   therefore as participation in the divine nature by means of an
   illumination penetrating the whole being, whereby the true sonship to
   God comes to exist. [521]

   From this point, in Q. 111, the division of grace is sketched. And,
   first, a distinction is drawn between gratia gratum faciens (by which
   man is united to God [qua ipse homo deo conjungitur]), and gratia
   gratis data (the priestly official grace, by which the man himself is
   not justified, but the justification of another is contemplated [qua
   non homo ipse justificatur, sed justificatio alterius comparatur]). It
   is worthy of note that Thomas begins with this distinction (Art. I).
   Then follows the separation of grace into gratia operans and gratia
   co-operans (that by which He moves us to good volition and action --
   gift of habit divinely imparted to us [illa, qua nos movet ad bene
   volendum et agendum -- habituale donum nobis divinitus inditum]); it is
   justified by the proposition: "the operation of any effect is not
   attributed to that which moves, but to the mover" (operatio alicujus
   effectus non attribuitur mobili, sed moventi). In the effect, so far as
   our soul is mota non movens (the moved, not moving) the gratia operans
   appears; in the effect, so far as it is mota movens (the moved, moving)
   the gratia cooperans appears (Art. 2). [522] Parallel with this is the
   division into gratia præveniens and gratia subsequens (Art. 3). [523]
   In Art. 4 the gratia gratis data, i.e., the grace with which one helps
   others (for the edification of the community, official grace), is
   subjected to a further division according to I Cor. xi., and in Art. 5
   it is shown that the gratia gratum faciens is to be valued much more
   highly than the gratia gratis data.

   In Q. 112 the causæ gratiæ (causes of grace) are now considered. That
   God alone can be the cause is deduced in a genuinely Old Catholic way
   from the conception of grace as deifica (making divine). [524] Hence
   man cannot even prepare himself for this grace, the preparation rather,
   which is necessary, must be effected by grace itself, [525] therefore
   the act of preparation for gratia infusa is not meritorious, for
   although every forma presupposes a materia disposita (prepared), yet it
   holds good even in the things of nature that "the preparedness of the
   material does not necessarily secure form save by virtue of the agent
   who causes the preparedness" (dispositio materiæ non ex necessitate
   consequitur formam nisi per virtutem agentis, qui dispositionem
   causat). [526] This gratia gratum faciens can be smaller in the one,
   greater in the other, just because it is a free gift; [527] but because
   it is something supernatural, no one here below to whom it is not
   specially revealed can know for certain whether he possess it. [528]

   There follows in Qs. 113 and 114 the inquiry into the effects of grace.
   In correspondence with the distinction between gratia operans and
   gratia cooperans the effect of grace is twofold -- justification and
   meritorious good works; but even in justification the will must
   co-operate. Only the very first point is distinguished by the sole
   efficiency of grace. This comes out at once in Art. 1 (Q. 113). Thomas
   raises the question whether the justification of the sinner is the
   remission of sins (utrum justificatio impii sit remissio peccatorum?),
   and in an extremely round-about explanation he answers at bottom with
   no, although he apparently replies to the question in the affirmative.
   He lays it down, that is to say, that "justification, passively
   received, introduces an impulse towards righteousness" (justificatio
   passive accepta importat motum ad justitiam), but that it comes into
   view here "as a certain change (transmutatio) from a state of
   unrighteousness to a state of righteousness." "And because movement is
   described rather from the terminus ad quem than from the terminus a
   quo, so a change (transmutatio) of this kind, by which one is changed
   (transmutatur) from a state of unrighteousness into a state of
   righteousness, derives its name from the terminus ad quem, and is
   called the justification of the sinner"; in other words: the actual
   justification does not yet take place through the "remission of sins,"
   but only on account of the contemplated end can it be said that
   forgiveness of sins is already justification; in reality, however,
   justification -- as a translation into a new state -- only takes place
   later. This becomes still plainer, when it is affirmed in Art. 2 that
   even for the forgiveness of sins the gratia infusa is necessary. This
   has the effect, certainly, of introducing a bad confusion; for if the
   position: "remission of guilt cannot be understood where there is no
   infusion of grace" (non potest intelligi remissio culpæ, si non adest
   infusio gratiæ) is correct (it is proved by the reflection that
   forgiveness of sins presupposes "the effect of divine love" in us,
   i.e., presupposes that we love God in return), then forgiveness of
   sins, instead of being the first thing, is the last, and one must ask
   himself, what then is really the effect of the gratia præveniens (in
   the strictest sense)? Is it mere vocatio (calling), or something
   undefinable? Thomas here got astray with his own distinctions, or -- in
   a highly characteristic way -- he left in darkness what man owes to
   prevenient grace. In accordance with this it is pointed out in Arts.
   3-5, that for justification there must already co-operate a movement of
   free will (motus liberi arbitrii), a movement of faith (motus fidei)
   and a hatred of sin (odium peccati), i.e., we are at once led on to
   contemplate the intermingling of grace and self-activity. [529] Only
   now does justification take place (Art. 6); for "four things are to be
   reckoned (enumerantur) which are required for the justification of the
   sinner, viz., the infusion of grace, the movement of free will in
   relation to God (in deum) by faith, and the movement of free will in
   relation to sin (in peccatum), and the remission of guilt (this last
   follows, then, from the three other things); the reason of which is
   that, as has been said, justification is a certain movement by which
   the soul is moved by God from a state of guilt into a state of
   righteousness; but in any movement by which anything is moved by
   another, three things are required. First, the moving (motio) of the
   mover himself; second, the movement as in motion (motus mobilis);
   third, the consummation of the movement, or the arrival at the goal.
   From the side (ex parte), therefore, of the divine moving there is
   received the infusion of grace, from the side of free will the
   retirement and advance (recessus et accessus) of movement, while the
   consummation or arrival at the goal of this movement is brought about
   (importatur) by the remission of guilt. For in this justification is
   consummated." [530] But although justification culminates in the
   forgiveness of sins, yet, as will appear, the whole process does not
   yet culminate in justification. Of this justification of the sinner it
   is further taught (Art. 7), that it is effected "originaliter" at the
   moment of infusion, and that "it is realised instantaneously and
   without succession" (in instanti fit absque successione). The
   difficulty, that the giving of form (infusion) can only take place in
   materia disposita (in prepared matter) is set aside by saying, that
   "for the infusion of grace into the soul God does not require any
   disposition save that which He Himself creates. But He creates a
   disposition of this kind sufficient for the reception of grace,
   sometimes indeed suddenly, but sometimes gradually and in stages" (ad
   hoc quod gratiam infundat animæ, non requirit aliquam dispositionem,
   nisi quam ipse facit. Facit autem hujusmodi dispositionem sufficientem
   ad susceptionem gratiæ quandoque quidem subito quandoque autem paulatim
   et successive). [531] In what follows, the order of the process is now
   inverted in a bold way (Art. 8): from the point of view of time the
   four things named above coincide, but causally they follow each other
   thus -- (1) the infusion of grace; (2) the movement towards God in
   love; (3) the turning from sin; (4) the forgiveness of guilt. The
   legitimacy of this inversion is not proved by Thomas; the aim in view
   is manifest; grace must stand at the beginning. But because he is
   averse to distinguishing a grace which is not infused, but is simply
   the awakening of trust (fiducia), he cannot allow validity to the
   scheme which would really correspond with his mode of thought, namely,
   (1) a grace that is merely movens; (2) faith (fides); (3) detestation
   of sin; (4) remission of guilt; (5) infused grace (gratia infusa). He,
   therefore, places infused grace first "causally" (causaliter) (from the
   correct reflection that at all events the precedence belongs to this),
   but it is a mere assertion, which he himself cannot effectively prove,
   that this gratia is infusa; for its effects do not correspond with
   this. The confusion which, on closer inspection, we at once see to have
   been introduced by him here, [532] was not without its influence in the
   period that followed. In the concluding view taken of justification
   (Arts. 9 and 10), it is laid down that it is not only a great work
   (opus magnum) of God, but is really even a miraculous work (opus
   miraculosum); but at bottom the latter holds good only of sudden
   conversions: "certain miraculous works, although they are less than the
   justification of the sinner, so far as the good that comes into
   existence is concerned, are, nevertheless, beyond the usual order of
   such effects, and therefore have more of the nature of miracle"
   ("quædam miraculosa opera, esti sunt minora quam justificatio impii
   quantum ad bonum quod fit, sunt tamen præter consuetum ordinem talium
   effectuum et ideo plus habent de ratione miraculi"). This exhausts
   justification, yet not the whole process; only now, rather, are the
   effects first considered which are imparted through grace in an
   increasing measure to him who is already justified. They are all placed
   under the head of merit (Q. 114). First, the question is raised whether
   man can acquire merit at all before God (Art. 1). The answer runs: not
   in the absolute sense of strict righteousness, but certainly in virtue
   of a benevolent arrangement of God. [533] Then in accordance with this
   it is declared impossible that anyone should merit for himself eternal
   life, even if he lives in the state of unfallen nature (in statu
   natural integræ) (Art. 2); for "eternal life is something good that
   exceeds the proportions of created nature" (vita æterna est quoddam
   bonum excedens proportionem naturæ creatæ). [534] On the other hand, to
   the question, whether the man who is in a state of grace can merit
   eternal life "ex condigno," no explicit answer is given. [535] The
   decision rather runs (Art. 3), "meritorious work of man can be looked
   at in two ways; on the one hand in so far as it proceeds from free
   will, on the other hand in so far as it proceeds from the grace of the
   Holy Spirit. If it is looked at with respect to the substance of work
   and in so far as it proceeds from free will, there cannot here be
   condignity on account of the very great inequality of proportions. For
   it appears congruous, that man working according to his virtue should
   be rewarded by God according to the excellence of his virtue. But if we
   speak of meritorious work with respect to what proceeds from the grace
   of the Holy Spirit, it is in this case meritorious of eternal life ex
   condigno. For here the value of the merit is estimated according to the
   power of the Holy Spirit who moves us to eternal life. The reward also
   of the work is estimated by the dignity of the grace by which man, made
   a participant of the divine nature, is adopted as a son of God, to whom
   inheritance is due in virtue of the very right of adoption" (opus
   meritorium hominis dupliciter considerari potest; uno modo, secundum
   quod procedit ex libero arbitrio, alio modo, secundum quod procedit ex
   gratia spiritus sancti. Si consideretur secundum substantiam operis et
   secundum quod procedit ex libero arbitrio, sic non potest ibi esse
   condignitas propter maximam inæqualitatem proportionis. Videtur enim
   congruum, ut homini operanti secundum suam virtutem deus recompenset
   secundum excellentiam suæ virtutis. Si autem loquamur de opere
   meritorio secundum quod procedit ex gratia spiritus sancti, sic est
   meritorium vitæ æternæ ex condigno. Sic enim valor meriti attenditur
   secundum virtutem spiritus sancti moventis nos in vitam æternam.
   Attenditur etiam pretium operis secundum dignitatem gratiæ, per quam
   homo consors factus divinæ naturæ adoptatur in filium dei, cui debetur
   hæreditas ex ipso jure adoptionis). The same thing, then, is in one
   respect ex condigno, in another respect ex congruo! The period that
   followed was not satisfied with this, but attributed to human merit a
   higher worth; but to this Thomas himself gave the impulse. In Art. 4 it
   is shown that the meritorious principle is love, whether we look at
   merit ex ordinatione divina (by divine arrangement), or at merit "in so
   far as man has, beyond other creatures, the power of acting for himself
   as a voluntary agent" (in quantum homo habet præ ceteris creaturis ut
   per se agat voluntarie agens). In both cases it can easily be shown,
   that in love and in no other virtue merit consists. [536] In view of
   the principle "any act of love merits absolutely eternal life"
   (quilibet actus caritatis meretur absolute vitam æternam), it is now
   asked in Art. 8, whether man can merit the increase (augmentum) of
   grace or love, and this question is answered roundly in the
   affirmative; for "that to which the motion of grace extends falls under
   merito condigni, but the motion of any thing moving extends not only to
   the ultimate goal of the movement, but also to the whole progress in
   movement; but the goal of the movement of grace is eternal life, while
   the progress in this movement is according to the increase of love.
   Thus therefore the increase of grace falls under merito condigni"
   (illud cadit sub merito condigni, ad quod motio gratiæ se extendit,
   motio autem alicujus moventis non solum se extendit ad ultimum terminum
   motus, sed etiam ad totum progressum in motu; terminus autem motus
   gratiæ est vita aeterna, progressus autem in hoc motu est secundum
   augmentum caritatis. Sic igitur augmentum gratiæ cadit sub merito
   condigni). On the other hand, the question whether man can also merit
   perseverance in grace is denied in the following article, and thus the
   ultimate worth of "merit" is cancelled, and a way of return sought for
   to pure Augustinianism. [537]

   In order to form a correct historic estimate of this grace doctrine of
   Thomas, we must keep in view, in addition to the interest of Christian
   piety by which he was really guided, and in addition to the practice of
   the Church, which for him was authoritative, that in the philosophy of
   religion he was determined by Augustine's doctrines of God and of
   predestination, and in ethics by Aristotle's doctrines of God and of
   virtue. Because both were certainties for him, and he therefore made it
   his business to unite the two, he framed that complicated system of
   doctrine in which the dexterous, often paradoxical, subtleties of
   Augustine, the believing sceptic, became as much fundamental tenets as
   the most direct and confident deliverances of his piety. These
   fundamental tenets are then placed in connection with the entirely
   contrasted thoughts of Aristotle, while with wearisome reiteration the
   definition of God as primum movens is made to serve as the bridge. How
   entirely dependent Thomas is upon Augustine is shown by the doctrine of
   predestination, which he has taken over in all its strictness; [538]
   how largely dependent he is upon Aristotle is shown both by his
   doctrine of God and above all by the Pars Secunda Secundae, the special
   doctrine of morals, in which it is demonstrated that virtue consists in
   the right government of the appetencies and impulses by reason, and is
   then perfected supernaturally by the gifts of grace. Finally, in order
   to get a complete view of Thomas's doctrine of grace, we must add his
   doctrines of the constitution of man, of the primitive state, of the
   Fall, of original sin and of sin, as they are developed in Parts I., Q.
   90-102, and II., 1 Q. 71-89. But we may refrain from presenting these
   here in fuller detail, partly because Thomas attaches himself closely
   to Augustine, partly because the chief points have already been
   specified in the discussion of his doctrine of grace. [539] Yet his
   doctrine of the consilia evangelica deserves still a special
   consideration. This doctrine forms the conclusion of his discussion of
   the doctrine of the new law. But on the other hand the doctrine of
   grace also culminates in the "evangelical counsels," so that in a very
   real sense these represent the summit of the whole course of thought.
   Thomas (II., 1 Q. 108, Art. 4) first of all gives the following
   definition: "This is the difference between counsel and precept, that
   precept introduces (importat) necessity, while counsel is made
   dependent on the option (in optione ponitur) of him to whom it is
   given, and so counsels are fittingly (convenienter) added to precepts
   in the new law, which is the law of liberty, but not in the old law,
   which was the law of servitude (servitutis)." Thereupon it is remarked
   that the "precepts of the new law" are necessary to (but also
   sufficient for) eternal life, "but there ought to be counsels regarding
   those things by which man can attain the appointed end better and more
   readily" (consilia vero oportet esse de illis, per quae melius et
   expeditius potest homo consequi finem prædictum). Then it is explained
   that here on earth man is placed between the things of this world and
   spiritual benefits, and that entire devotion to the former is removed
   by the præcepta. Yet on the other hand man does not require to
   surrender the things of this world entirely in order to attain to the
   goal of eternal life (!), "but he attains more expeditiously by
   abandoning (abdicando) totally the good things of this world, and
   therefore the evangelical counsels are given regarding this." But the
   benefits of this world consist in the possession of outward goods, in
   sexual pleasures, and in the possession of honours, which relate to the
   lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life. To
   relinquish these entirely, so far as it is possible -- in this consists
   the evangelical counsels, and in the adoption of them consists "omnis
   religio, quæ statum perfectionis profitetur" (all religion which
   professes a state of perfection). The adoption of even one of these
   counsels has a corresponding worth, as, e.g, when one gives alms to a
   poor man beyond what is obligatory, abstains from marriage for a long
   time for the sake of prayer, or does good to his enemies in excess of
   what is due, etc. The following of these counsels is a ground of merit
   in a still higher degree than the following of the commands, so that
   here in a pre-eminent way it holds good, that God gives eternal life to
   man, not merely in grace, but also by virtue of His righteousness.
   [540]

   Thomas's doctrine of grace, when judged of from the stand-point of
   religion, presents two faces. On the one hand it looks back to
   Augustine, [541] on the other hand it looks forward to the dissolution
   which Augustinianism was to undergo in the fourteenth century. Whoever
   examines Thomism carefully, will find that its author makes an earnest
   endeavour, by means of a strictly religious mode of view, to assert the
   sole efficacy of divine grace; but on the other hand he will be
   compelled to note, that at almost all decisive points the line of
   statement takes ultimately a different direction, the reason being that
   the effect of grace itself is seen in a contemplated end that has a
   character partly hyperphysical, partly moral ("participation in the
   divine nature," and "love," conjoined by the thought that love merits
   eternal life). [542] But as compared with what was presented by
   Halesius, Bonaventura and others, or, with what was taught at the time,
   Thomism was already a religious reaction; for those theologians yielded
   to a much more decided tendency to render the doctrine of grace less
   effectual by means of the doctrine of merit. By the appearing of
   Thomas, a development was checked, which, apart from him, would have
   asserted itself much more rapidly, but which in the end, nevertheless
   (from the middle of the fourteenth century), gained, through the
   victorious conflicts of the Scotists against the Thomists, the
   ascendency in the Church, thereby calling forth a new reaction, which
   seems to have slowly gathered force from the close of the fourteenth
   century. [543]

   At all points, from the doctrines as to the nature of man and as to the
   primitive state, on to the doctrine of final perfection, there are
   apparent the dissolving tendencies of the later scholasticism, led by
   Halesius, Bonaventura and Scotus.

   1. Halesius, who was also the first to introduce into dogmatics the
   expression "supernatural good" as having a technical sense, taught that
   the justitia originalis belongs to the nature of man itself as its
   completion, but that there is to be distinguished from this the gratia
   gratum faciens, which man already possessed in the primitive state as a
   supernatural good, though this was imparted to him, not in creation,
   but only after creation, while Adam moreover earned it for himself
   meritoriously by good works ex congruo. [544] So merit was to begin so
   early! Thomas knows nothing of this; but Bonaventura repeated this
   doctrine; [545] it is also to be found in Albertus, [546] and the
   Scotists adhered to it. [547] The advantage which this doctrine
   offered, namely the possibility of reckoning to the perfection of human
   nature itself the justitia originalis, which was distinguished from the
   gratia gratum faciens, was greatly counterbalanced by the injury
   involved in introducing the meritum de congruo into paradise itself,
   and thus placing merit from the beginning side by side with the "sole
   efficacy" of grace. The meritum de congruo is thus earlier than the
   meritum de condigno; for the latter could only be implanted, and was
   meant only to be implanted, in Adam after reception of the gratia
   gratum faciens, in order that he might merit for himself eternal life.

   2. There already appear in Thomas (see above p. 297) approaches towards
   the breaking up of the Augustinian doctrines of sin and original sin,
   in so far as he no longer broadly grants the proposition, "naturalia
   bona corrupta sunt" (natural goodness is corrupt), in so far as he
   defines concupiscence, which is in itself not evil, as only "languor et
   fomes" (tinder), emphasizes the negative side of sin more strongly than
   Augustine, and assumes, on the ground of the ratio remaining, an
   abiding inclination towards goodness (inclinatio ad bonum). Yet he
   certainly taught a stricter doctrine than Anselm, who really only
   accentuated the negative side, and began to waver even in regard to its
   character as guilt. [548] To him Duns attached himself, in so far as he
   at bottom separated the question about concupiscence from the question
   about original sin; the former is for him no more the formal in the
   latter, but simply the material. Thus there remains for original sin
   merely the being deprived of the supernatural good, from which there
   then resulted certainly a disturbing effect upon the nature of man,
   while however nothing was really lost of the natural goodness. [549]

   3. According to Thomas the magnitude of the first sin (and therefore
   also of inherited sin) is infinite, according to Scotus it is finite.

   4. The Lombard had already taught that inherited sin is propagated
   simply through the flesh, and that the soul created for the latter is
   thereby defiled. [550] He held, therefore, as many others did, that
   inherited sin is inherited sin, in so far as it must propagate itself
   as a contagion (contagium) from Adam onwards. At the same time he also
   touches, on the other hand, on the thought of Augustine: "all these had
   been the one man, i.e., were in him materially" (omnes illi unus homo
   fuerant, i.e., in eo materialiter erant), though the emphasis lies on
   the materialiter, so that the matter is to be understood, not
   mystically but realistically. [551] Now, although Thomas, with the view
   of giving expression to guilt, and at the same time placing the accent
   on the will (not merely on the flesh), affirmed, in opposition to this,
   an imputation on a mystical basis, [552] yet the former idea continued
   to be the ruling one. Now, if in spite of this the guilt of the
   inherited sin is greatly reduced even in Thomas, it appears in Duns
   quite insignificant, notwithstanding all that is said regarding it.
   Nay, even the consequences of sin are presented by him in another
   light; for, as inherited sin is simply nothing but loss of the
   supernatural gift (donum), it has not attacked the nature of man. This
   remains, even after the Fall, uninjured. Duns really carried on a
   polemic against the Thomist definition of inherited sin as vulneratio
   naturæ (wounding of nature). [553] Now, if we add to this, that by
   hair-splitting over defilement, corruption of nature, moral
   culpability, and penalty (macula, corruptio naturæ, reatus culpæ,
   poena), the subject was quite brought down to the level of casuistry,
   we must come to be of the opinion that Scholasticism ultimately lost
   sight entirely of the Augustinian starting-point.

   The religious view of sin, which even Augustine, indeed, had not
   strictly wrought out, entirely disappeared. Inherited sin was an
   external negative character, which is cancelled by the positive
   character of magical grace. Thus there remained only the wretched dregs
   of a view that had once been full of life, and had deeply stirred the
   soul.

   5. It is obvious that free will also was now bound to have a higher
   value attached to it than the Augustinian-Thomist tradition admitted
   of. When once the fundamental thesis was abandoned, that moral goodness
   only exists in connection with God (by dependence on Him), when,
   consequently, the view again prevailed that man can make a parade
   before God with his independent works, the process of emptying
   Augustinianism of its contents (for the formulæ durst not be
   surrendered) necessarily became inevitable. Thomas himself, indeed, had
   begun, though at first timidly, to assign to free will a special range
   of action as apart from grace. His mode of procedure, in giving with
   the one hand and taking with the other, could not continue to be
   maintained. Bonaventura made predestination dependent on prescience,
   and limited God as cause in His relation to rational creatures. He is
   not entire cause (tota causa), but cause along with another contingent
   cause, i.e., with free will (causa cum alia causa contingente, scil.
   cum libero arbitrio). For Duns, and likewise for the leading
   theologians till the Council of Constance (and later), the will of the
   creature is the second great power next to God, [554] and to what they
   correctly lay down in the sphere of empirical psychology, they also
   give a material and positive religious significance. But in this way
   they separate themselves both from Augustine and from religion; for, as
   a dogmatic theologian, Augustine knows of free will only as a formal
   principal or as the cause of sin. It was the hereditary fate of
   mediæval dogmatic, that through the mixing up of knowledge of the world
   with religion, a relatively more correct knowledge of the world became
   as dangerous, nay, still more dangerous to faith, than a knowledge that
   was false; for every piece of knowledge, in whatever way it was found,
   was at once introduced into the calculation as having religious worth.
   Against the Pelagianism, which, with ever decreasing hesitation, made
   use of Augustinianism simply as "an artistic form of speech,"
   Bradwardine was the first to take again a strong stand, and after his
   time, the reaction never again disappeared, but slowly gathered
   strength in the fifteenth century, till the time of Wesel and Wessel,
   Cajetan and Contarini, till the time of Luther and the Decrees of
   Trent. [555]

   6. Most distinct, and fraught with the gravest practical results, was
   the further development of Scholasticism as regards the doctrine of
   justification and the meritorious acquirement of eternal life. But how
   many germs tending to develop into the Pelagian deterioration of these
   doctrines had already been deposited in his system by Thomas himself? I
   will not repeat here what must have already come clearly to view above
   in the account of the Thomist doctrine of grace. The most manifest
   outcome of the further development in Scotism consists in these things:
   (1) that the decisive effect of "prevenient grace" became more and more
   a mere assertion, or, say, a form of speech -- "co-operating grace" is
   the only intelligible grace -- (2) that what, for Thomas, was "meritum
   ex congruo" became "meritum ex condigno," while the "merita ex congruo"
   were seen in impulses and acts which Thomas had not placed under the
   point of view of merit at all, and (3) that, as a parallel to the
   meritoriousness of attritio, the meritoriousness of "fides informis,"
   of the mere obedience of faith, became more highly estimated. In this
   point the corruption was perhaps greatest; for the fides implicita, the
   mere self-surrender, now became in a sense a fundamental dogmatic
   principle. [556]

   According to Scotus, the man who does not possess the habit of grace
   (habitus gratiæ), who therefore is not in union with God, and hence can
   do nothing really meritorious to earn eternal life, must not be held as
   having no power to conform his conduct to the divine commands. He can
   still always fulfil these commands (otherwise God would require of him
   something impossible, and would be partial were He not to save all),
   and He must fulfil them; for he must prepare himself for the first
   grace. As it is a natural duty to love God beyond everything, it is
   also a duty that can be fulfilled; accordingly, even the natural
   righteousness of heathen and sinners is not without connection with the
   supernatural virtues; indeed, it cannot at all be proved that a habit
   of love produced by supernatural grace is always necessary in order to
   love God above all; this rather is simply an ecclesiastical tenet.
   Before the Fall at least all this held good, and it can be proved,
   indeed, from Aristotle (!) that it holds good also after the Fall. It
   is with this in view that Scotus' doctrines of grace and of merit must
   be understood. In point of fact, merit always precedes grace with him,
   that is to say, first the merit de congruo, then the merit de condigno;
   [557] the former entirely neutralises the thought of prevenient grace,
   the latter cancels the decisive significance of co-operating grace.
   Everywhere in words, by means of extremely forced distinctions,
   Augustinianism is defended, but in reality it is discarded. The
   position that was not disputed even by Thomas and Augustine, that we
   are not justified unwillingly (inviti), receives from Nominalism a
   Pelagian interpretation, and the other position, that eternal life is
   the reward for the merits one acquires on the basis of infused grace,
   is so understood that the accent falls on the will, and not on the
   merit of Christ. The divine factor really appears only in the
   "acceptance" (acceptatio), which, as it dominates the whole relation
   between God and man and is arbitrary, does not allow merits in the
   strictest (necessary) sense to be spoken of. The Nominalist doctrine is
   not simple moralism, only in so far as the doctrine of God does not
   admit in any case of a strict moralism. This comes out most plainly in
   Occam, who, indeed, taken altogether, presents the paradoxical
   spectacle of a strongly pronounced religious nature finding refuge
   simply in the arbitrary will of God. It is reliance on this arbitrary
   will alone that frees him from Nihilism, and the same applies to the
   greatest theologians of the period of the Reform Councils, till Nicolas
   of Cusa brought about a change. Faith, in order to maintain itself,
   found no other means of deliverance from the inrushing floods of
   world-knowledge than the plank of the divine arbitrariness, to which it
   clung with intense eagerness. These theologians were still no moralists
   -- they merely appear such to us; -- it was only the Socinians who
   became that. "According to Occam the necessity of supernatural habits
   (habitus) for the obtaining of eternal life cannot be proved on grounds
   of reason. What alone could support the proof would be, that the acts
   of faith, love, and hope corresponding to these habits are not possible
   without their supernatural habits; this, however, cannot be proved. A
   heathen living among Christians can come to hold the articles of the
   Christian faith as true, on grounds of purely natural conviction; a
   philosophically trained heathen can live according to the conviction,
   acquired in a natural way, that God, who is more excellent than all
   else, must be loved above all else. The acts of faith, hope, and love
   performed by such men originate, not from infused, but from acquired
   habits, while these latter can exist even among Christians, and really
   do exist where there is a certain height of moral and intellectual
   development. The necessity of supernatural habits is established solely
   by the authority of traditional Church doctrine. Thus then as regards
   the necessity of supernatural habits, we see Occam arriving at the most
   extreme opposition to the necessity of supernatural habits that is
   possible within the limits of Church faith." (? !) So Werner. [558]
   That here there is still always a keeping within the limits of
   ecclesiastical faith is an instructive assertion of the modern Catholic
   theologian. The truth is, that the displacement of "merits" is here
   carried so far, that the distinction between merita ex congruo and
   merita ex condigno is entirely neutralised; man can acquire for himself
   in the state of nature merita de condigno; but God has willed,
   nevertheless, the necessity of a supernatural habitus and has appointed
   the corresponding institutions. [559] Now although many theologians,
   such as Occam himself, might feel their religious conscience quieted by
   the reflection that God's arbitrary will is for us His mercy, yet the
   only general effect possible from this kind of theology -- especially
   when we recall the attritio and the indulgences, was that there should
   be recognised in good works the instrumental causes (causæ
   instrumentales) for the reception of eternal life, that these good
   works, moreover, should be judged to be meritorious even in their
   minimised form, and that, finally, self-subjection to the revelation
   taught by the Church should be held to be a sufficient good motive
   (bonus motus), which is so completed by the Sacraments that it imparts
   worthiness. In this way Nominalism was understood even by the earnest
   Augustinians of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. They saw in it
   a denial of the grace of God in Christ, and they did not let themselves
   be led astray from this judgment by the most acute distinctions of the
   Nominalists: "In vain is much said in the way of repudiation; what the
   other hears in everything is only a No."

   Perhaps the plainest evidence of the decline of an inwardly grounded
   doctrine of salvation and of the growing attachment of value to
   creaturely goodness in the last centuries of the Middle Ages, is the
   doctrine of Mary, as embracing both the doctrine of her immaculate
   conception and the doctrine of her co-operation in the work of
   redemption. [560]

   1. We have seen above (Vol. V., p. 235) that even Augustine had doubts
   as to whether Mary was subject to the general law of sin, and
   Paschasius Radbertus already knows that Mary was sanctified in the
   womb. Anselm, certainly, who on this point was more Augustinian than
   Augustine, had distinctly rejected the immaculate conception (Cur deus
   homo II. 16); but a few years after his death we meet with a festival
   in Lyons (1140) in honour of the immaculate conception of Mary, which
   proves how widely current the superstition had already become in the
   lower strata of the Church). [561]

   Bernard (ep. 174 ad canonicos Lugd.) spoke against the new festival,
   but used feeble weapons in opposing the idea that was expressed in it:
   that Mary was already sanctified in the womb, and continued also to be
   protected against all sin; but that her conception was not sinless,
   otherwise that of her parents must also have been so (i.e., if in this
   way the proof is to be got of the sinless birth of Christ); that the
   sinless conception was a prerogative of Christ. But if general opinion
   already held as certain what Bernard had laid down as to the
   sinlessness of Mary, [562] and if, besides this, the act of birth was
   surrounded with the halo of the miraculous, how could the logic in
   these fancies be hindered from pressing on to the ultimate extreme? The
   Pre-Scotist Schoolmen still denied, it is true, the immaculate
   conception (even Bonaventura); but if Thomas adheres to sanctification
   in the womb, and accordingly assumes, immediately after the conception,
   a special influence of grace upon Mary, why shall she not be declared
   exempt from original sin itself? Thomas answers, because Christ is the
   redeemer of all men; but that he would no longer be if Mary had
   remained free from original sin (S. III., Q. 27). Still -- everything
   is possible, of course, for Scholasticism -- why can it not be assumed
   that Christ's death had a reflex power for Mary? Then, again, original
   sin is a mere privatio, is it not? Why cannot God, who can do
   everything, fill Mary from the beginning with grace? And is this being
   filled with grace not necessary if she is after-wards to act, not
   merely a passive, but an active part in the work of redemption (see
   sub. 2)? So Scotus then held it as "probable" that Mary was conceived
   without sin, and therefore never possessed the concupiscentia carnis
   (in Sent. III., Dist. 3, Q. 1). From that time the Franciscans
   strenuously maintained this view against the Dominicans (Thomists). The
   "reflex power of redemption" was the fig-leaf to cover the apostasy
   from Christ, and -- to adopt the artistic form of speech -- "her
   preservation from contracting original sin was due to its being fitting
   that the Mediator, Christ, should prove Himself in the most perfect way
   to be Mediator by means of some human creature that was above all
   others adapted for this (that is, meritum de congruo on Mary's part,
   seen ex præscientia [in the exercise of prescience]). The most perfect
   kind of mediation is that by which the injured is anticipated in such a
   way that he never at all begins to be angry about the injury done to
   him, and therefore lets forgiveness drop as superfluous." [563]

   This proof is extraordinarily instructive, for it contains implicitly
   the admission that Christ is not the perfect Redeemer of all men, but
   that He only establishes for them the possibility of redemption. That
   is correctly thought from a Catholic point of view; but it is not
   usually plainly expressed in that quarter -- nay, for good reasons
   there is a very grave reluctance to express it. Thomists and Scotists
   rivalled each other in glorifying Mary; but the former magnified in her
   the power and splendour of the grace which cleanses and purifies, the
   latter magnified the grace itself which originally (ab origine) imparts
   innocence. But if grace is able to do that, why does it not do it
   always? It seems, then, as if it were not really the glorifying of
   grace that is aimed at. Certainly not. "Only with the existence of a
   perfect innocence wrought by redeeming grace is a complete
   representation afforded of all orders of rank in human beatification.
   The highest stage is represented by the blessedness of the soul of
   Christ, which was absolutely blessed even on earth without foregoing
   merit; then follows the holy virgin, whose beatifying merit was her
   perfect innocence wrought by the grace of redemption; in the third rank
   stand those whose souls were never stained by actual sins; lastly come
   those who, from being great sinners, have become saints." [564]

   In this graduated choir it is manifestly not grace that is of effect,
   but merit. Here again there was a connecting of the idea of consilia
   evangelica with salvation. As is well known, the great controversy
   about the immaculate conception was not fought out in the Middle Ages.
   But the University of Paris condemned the rejection of the new doctrine
   (1387); at Bâsle the "Reform Council" gave its voice for it (36. Sess.
   1439), and Sixtus IV. (Extravag. III., 12, 1) prepared the way for its
   adoption as dogma by forbidding, under the penalty of excommunication,
   the pronouncing it heresy, though at the same time he declared to the
   world that the apostolic chair had not yet decided, i.e, could not yet
   overlook the opposition of the Dominicans at the time. Not without
   ground these latter could point out that they themselves encouraged the
   deepest conceivable veneration of Mary, for their great teacher had
   taught that there should be paid to the holy virgin, not, indeed,
   latreia as to God, nor yet douleia, as to the saints, [565] but
   hyperdouleia. [566]

   2. From as early as the time of Irenæus occasion was furnished, through
   the fatal parallel drawn between Eve and Mary, for attributing to Mary
   a certain share in the work of redemption; from the idea of the graded
   hierarchy of angels and saints in heaven the impulse was received to
   worship Mary along with Christ as the Queen of Heaven ("in the midst
   between the Son, who is holiest of the holy, and all the saints, royal
   virgin, gate of heaven, way, the ladder from sins" [media inter filium,
   qui est sanctus sanctorum, et alios sanctos, virgo regia, janua coeli,
   via, peccatorum scala]; the most extravagant veneration even on the
   part of Bernard in the Sermones II. in adv. dom.: "let us also strive
   to ascend by her to Him who by her descended to us; by her to come into
   the grace of Him who by her came into our misery; by thee may we have
   access to the Son, O blessed contriver of grace, author of life, mother
   of salvation, that through thee He may receive us, who through thee was
   given to us. Thy innocence excuses before Him the guilt of our
   corruption . . . let thy abundant love cover the magnitude of our sins,
   and thy glorious fecundity confer on us fecundity of merits; our lady,
   our mediatrix, our advocate, reconcile us to thy Son, commend us to thy
   Son, represent us before thy Son! Grant, O blessed one, by the grace
   which thou hast found . . . that He who through thy mediation deigned
   to partake of our infirmity and misery, may, through thy intercession
   also, make us partakers of His glory and blessedness" [studeamus et nos
   ad ipsum per eam ascendere, qui per ipsam ad nos descendit; per eam
   venire in gratiam ipsius, qui per eam in nostram miseriam venit; per te
   accessum habeamus ad filium, O benedicta inventrix gratiæ, genetrix
   vitæ, mater salutis, ut per te nos suscipiat, qui per te datus est
   nobis. Excusat apud ipsum integritas tua culpam nostræ corruptionis
   . . . copiosa caritas tua nostrorum cooperiat magnitudinem peccatorum,
   et foecunditas gloriosa foecunditatem nobis conferat meritorum; domina
   nostra, mediatrix nostra, advocata nostra, tuo filio nos reconcilia,
   tuo filio nos commenda, tuo filio nos repræsenta! fac, O benedicta, per
   gratiam quam invenisti . . . ut qui te mediante fieri dignatus est
   particeps infirmitatis et miseriæ nostræ, te quoque intercedente
   participes faciat nos gloriæ et beatitudinis suæ [567] ]). From here it
   was only a step to the doctrine of Scotus and the Scotists, that Mary
   cooperated, not only passively, but actively, in the incarnation. [568]

   movement, see Werner, Duns Scotus, p. 4 ff.

   [249] Cf. Books 6-8 of the History of the Aufklärung by Reuter,
   especially the sections on the Averrhoistic Aufklärung, as well as on
   the importance of the Arabic and Jewish middle-men, also on the
   influence of the Natural Sciences and on the University of Paris in the
   thirteenth century. The Arabs Avicenna (ob. 1037) and Averrhoes (ob.
   1198), the former supranaturalistic, the latter pantheistic, in his
   tendency, were the most important commentators on Aristotle, whose
   works became known to the West by means of Spanish Jews. But by
   Averrhoes, who exercised a powerful attraction, Aristotle was in the
   first instance discredited, so that several Church interdicts were
   issued against him. But it was soon observed that Aristotle, so far
   from favouring pantheism, really refuted it. Scotus Erigena and
   Averrhoes -- his system meant for the Church of the thirteenth century
   what Gnosticism in the second century, Manichæanism in the fourth,
   Socinianism in the seventeenth, meant for Church Christianity, see
   Renan, Averroes et l'Averroisme -- were now regarded as the real
   enemies of Church dogma. Naturalistic pantheism in general now became
   the chief object of persecution; to oppose it, the supranaturalistic
   elements were derived from Aristotelianism, and this Aristotelianism
   had the widest scope given to it (see Schwane, Dogmengesch. des
   Mittelalters, p. 33 ff.). Among the Jewish scholars it was chiefly
   Maimonides who influenced the Schoolmen of the thirteenth century.
   Thomas owed very much to him, and in part transcribed him (see Merx,
   Prophetie des Joel, 1879). In this way the juristic-casuistic element
   in Scholasticism was still further strengthened, and pharisaic-talmudic
   theologoumena crept into mediæval theology, which are partly traceable
   to the Persian age of Judaism. But besides this, Neoplatonic and
   Aristotelian material found its way to the schoolmen from the
   translations of the Jews, who had rendered the Arabic versions of the
   Greek philosophical writings into Latin; see Bardenhewer, Die Schrift
   de causis, 1882.

   [250] In the sense in which Kant exposed and refuted dogmatism. It was
   only Roger Bacon who stoutly fought his way out of these fetters in the
   thirteenth century; see Reuter, II., p. 67 ff.

   [251] Among all the Orders the Dominican was the first to adopt into
   its rules directions as to study (see Denifle, Archiv. fur Litt.-u.
   Kirchengesch. des Mittelalters I., p. 165 ff.

   [252] Cf. e.g., for the period about 1250 the Chronicle of Salimbene
   and Michael l.c., p. 39 f. That in the Dominican Order itself a
   tendency had at first to be checked, which, after the style of the
   older Orders, emphasised asceticism so strongly that no room was left
   for study, which indeed described science (including theology) as
   dangerous and pernicious, has been convincingly proved by Wehofer O. P.
   from the book of the Dominican Gérard de Frachet, "Vitas Patrum"
   (published not long after 1256, issued in the Monum. Ord. Frat. Prædic.
   Historica. Löwen, 1896), and from the attitude of Humbert of Romans
   (General of the Order from 1254 to 1263; Gorres-Jahrbuch f. Philos. Bd.
   IX., 1896, p. 17 ff.) That "propter philosophiam" one goes to hell or
   at least -- after a great example -- receives here already on earth a
   sound cudgelling from angels, was never forgotten in the Catholic
   Church. The founder of the Trappist Order simply attempted to bring
   into force again an old monastic tradition: "study, i.e., philosophy is
   sin."

   [253] See the first question in Part I. of the Summa of Thomas; Art.
   I.: "Utrum sit necessarium præter philosophicas disciplinas aliam
   doctrinam haberi." Art. II: "Utrum sacra doctrina sit scientia."
   Answer: "Sacram doctrinam esse scientiam. Sed sciendum est quod duplex
   est scientiarum genus. Quædam enim sunt, quæ procedunt ex principiis
   notis lumine naturali intellectus sicut Arithmetica; quædam vero sunt
   quæ procedunt ex principiis notis lumine superioris scientiæ, sicut
   Perspectiva procedit ex principiis notificatis per Geometriam. . . . Et
   hoc modo sacra doctrina est scientia, quia procedit ex principiis notis
   lumine superioris scientiæ, quæ scil. est scientia dei et beatorum.
   Unde sicut Musicus credit principia revelata sibi ab Arithmetico, ita
   doctrina sacra credit principia revelata sibi a deo." Art. III.: "Utrum
   sacra doctrina sit una scientia?" Conclusio: "Cum omnia considerata in
   sacra doctrina sub una formali ratione divinæ revelationis
   considerentur, eam unam scientiam esse sentiendum est." Artic. IV.:
   "Utrum s. doctrina sit scientia practica?" Conclusio: "Tametsi s.
   theologia altioris ordinis sit practica et speculativa, eminenter
   utramque continens, speculativa tamen magis est quam practica," etc.

   [254] Thomas shows himself an Augustinian by his estimation also of
   Holy Scripture. Scripture alone was for him absolutely certain
   revelation. All other authorities he held as only relative. Very many
   passages can be quoted from Thomas to prove that the "formal principle
   of the reformation" had a representative in the great Schoolman. Cf.
   Holzhey, Die Inspiration d. hl. Schrift in der Anschauung des
   Mittelalters, 1895. This book, which did not necessarily require to be
   written, gives an account of the estimation of Holy Scripture on the
   part of the mediæval theologians and sectaries from the period of
   Charles the Great till the Council of Trent. The author remarks very
   correctly (p. 164 f.) that the view of Holy Scripture, or the mode of
   apprehending the notion of inspiration, does not pass beyond what is
   furnished by the Church Fathers, and that even among the theologians
   from the time of Alcuin till the beginning of the sixteenth century the
   greatest agreement regarding Holy Scripture prevailed. But when the
   author says further, that the doctrine of the absolute perspicuity and
   sufficiency of the Bible finds no confirmation in the mediæval Church
   -- for even if expressions of the kind were to be met with among the
   mediæval theologians, yet the living union with the Church and
   tradition is at the same time presupposed -- then that is in one
   respect a platitude. It is such also (but only in one respect) when the
   author remarks that the Middle Ages always recognised the exposition of
   Holy Scripture as an attribute of the Church. But on the really
   interesting problem Holzhey has scarcely touched, namely whether even
   in the Middle Ages a unique importance does not belong to Scripture as
   rule for the vita Christiana and whether it was not held by very many
   in this respect as absolutely clear and sufficient. That this question
   is to be answered affirmatively is to me beyond doubt. To the sentence
   of Duns Scotus: "Sacra scriptura sufficienter continet doctrinam
   necessariam viatori," many parallels may be adduced. Besides, there is
   still another question on which Holzhey has scarcely entered: since
   when was the decision of the Church in matters of faith placed as
   another kind of authority alongside Scripture as of equal weight?
   Certainly not yet since Thomas, scarcely only since Duns, but, as
   Ritschl likewise (Fides implicita, p. 31 f.) remarks, only since Occam,
   and even since his time not yet generally.

   [255] Anselm proves in part the articuli fidei; in principle Thomas
   refuses to do so (Pars. I., Quæst. I., Art. 8); yet the ratio bases
   itself on the articuli fidei in order to prove something else. We shall
   see how, as the development proceeded, Scholasticism always relied less
   on ratio in divine things. This may be an appropriate place for a short
   description of the "Summa" (see Portman, Das System der theol. Summe
   des hl. Thomas, Luzern 1885). The 1. Part (119 Quæst.) treats of God
   and the issue of things from God, the 2. Part (1. Sect.) of general
   morality (114 Quæst.), the 2. Part (2. Sect.) of special morality (189
   Quæst.) from the point of view of the return of the rational creature
   to God, the 3. Part of Christ and the Sacraments (90 Quæst.) As a
   supplement there has been added, from the commentary on the Lombard,
   the concluding part of the doctrine of the Sacraments, and the
   eschatology (102 Quæst.) Every Quæstio contains a number of articuli,
   and every articulus is divided into three parts. First the
   difficultates are brought forward, which seem to answer in the negative
   the question propounded, then the authorities (one or more, among them
   here and there also Aristotle), then follows the speculative
   discussion, dealing with principles, and thereafter the solution of the
   particular difficulties (the conclusiones are not formulated by Thomas
   himself, but by his commentators). The scheme corresponds with the
   Pauline-Augustinian thought: "From God to God." The introduction
   (Quæst. i) comprises the questions on theology as a science, on the
   subject (object) of theology -- God and all else sub ratione dei, -- on
   the methods (auctoritas and ratio, theology as doctrina argumentativa,
   sed "hæc doctrina non argumentatur ad sua principia probanda, quæ sunt
   articuli fidei, sed ex eis procedit ad aliquid aliud probandum . . .nam
   licet locus ab auctoritate quæ fundatur super ratione humana sit
   infirmissimus, locus tamen ab auctoritate quæ fundatur super
   revelatione divina est efficacissimus. Utitur tamen sacra doctrina
   etiam ratione humana, non quidem ad probandam fidem [quia per hoc
   tolleretur meritum fidei], sed ad manifestandum aliqua alia, quæ
   traduntur in hac doctrina. Cum enim gratia non tollat naturam, sed
   perficiat, oportet quod naturalis ratio subserviat fidei, sicut et
   naturalis inclinatio voluntatis obsequitur caritati. . . . Sacra
   doctrina utitur philosophorum auctoritatibus quasi extraneis argumentis
   et probabilibus, auctoritatibus autem canonicæ scripturæ utitur proprie
   et ex necessitate arguendo, auctoritatibus autem aliorum doctorum
   ecclesiæ quasi argumentando ex propriis sed probabiliter. Innititur
   enim fides nostra revelationi apostolis et prophetis factæ, qui
   canonicos libros scripserunt, non autem revelationi, si qua fuit aliis
   doctoribus facta"), on the exposition of Holy Scripture, etc. Quest.
   2-27 of the I. Part treat of God's existence (five proofs for God), the
   nature of God (primum movens, ens a se, perfectissimum, actus purus),
   His attributes, His unity and uniqueness, His knowableness, the name of
   God, further of the inner life-activity in God (of His knowledge, His
   world of ideas, His relation to truth, His life, His will, the
   expressions of His will, providence and predestination); lastly, of the
   outer activity of God or the divine omnipotence, and of the divine
   blessedness. Then follows in Q. 27-44 the investigation de processione
   divinarum personarum (Trinity); lastly, Q. 44-119, the doctrine of
   creation, and here (1) the origination of things (creation out of
   nothing, temporality of the world); (2) division of creation (doctrine
   of angels, doctrine of the world of bodies, doctrine of man, here
   minute investigations into the substance of the soul, the union of body
   and soul, the powers of the soul, human knowledge; then concerning the
   creation of man, the divine image in man, paradise and the original
   state); (3) the doctrine of the divine government of the world (on
   angels as means of providence, etc.). The II. Part (1 sect.) is
   grounded entirely on the Aristotelian Ethics. It begins with an
   introduction on man's end (the bonum = beatitudo = deus ipse = visio
   dei), and proceeds to treat of freedom, the nature of free acts of the
   will, the goodness and badness of acts of the will (to the goodness
   belongs the rationality of the act of the will), merit and guilt (Q.
   6-21). Thereon follow investigations into the emotional life of man
   (passiones), which is minutely analysed (Q. 22-48). Now only comes the
   account of the principles of moral action, of "habitus" or of the
   qualities of the soul. After an introduction (Q. 49 sq.) the doctrine
   of virtue is discussed (divided according to the object into
   intellectual, moral, and theological virtues), the cause of the
   virtues, their peculiarities (virtue as moderation or the "middle"
   course between two extremes) and the culmination of the virtues in the
   gifts of the Holy Ghost (the eight beatitudes and the fruits of the
   Spirit). This is followed by the doctrines of the nature of sin
   (contrary to reason and nature), of the division of sins, of the
   relation of sins to one another, of the subject (the will), the causes
   (inner and outer) of sin, of original sin and its effects (the
   deterioration of nature, darkening = macula, the reatus poenæ, mortal
   sins and venial sins). All this belongs to the inner principles of
   moral conduct. This part concludes with the discussion of the outer
   principles, namely, the law and grace. The "law" is discussed on all
   sides, as eternal law (that is, the law according to which God Himself
   acts, and whose reflected rays are all laws valid for the creatures),
   as natural law, as human law, as Old Testament and New Testament law,
   and as law of "counsels" for special perfection. But the New Testament
   law, as it is inward, and infused by grace, is the law of grace, and
   thu the way is prepared for passing to the second outer principle of
   moral acts -- to grace which gives man aid for the good. Grace is the
   outer principle of the supernatural good; in the intellectual sphere it
   is not necessary for the knowledge of natural truths, but it is so for
   the knowledge of the supernatural; it is likewise requisite for ability
   to do the supernatural good. Here there is a keen polemic against
   Pelagianism: man cannot by naturally good acts even prepare himself
   sufficiently for grace; he can neither convert himself, nor continue
   always steadfast in goodness. An inquiry into the nature, division,
   causes, and effects of grace (doctrine of justification, doctrine of
   the meritoriousness of good works), forms the conclusion. The II. Part,
   2. section now contains special ethics, namely, first, the precise
   statement of the theological virtues (faith, hope, and love), the
   commands corresponding to these virtues, and the sins against them,
   then the discussion of the cardinal virtues, wisdom, righteousness
   (here in Q. 57-123 the most exhaustive account is given, inasmuch as
   religiousness as a whole is placed under this term), courage, and
   moderation; lastly, the discussion of the special virtues, i.e., of the
   gifts of grace and duties of station (Q. 171-189). Under this last
   title there are dealt with (a) the charisms, (b) the two forms of life
   (the contemplative and the active), (c) the stations of perfection
   (namely, the station of the bishops as the virtuosi in neighbourly
   love, and the station of the monks, with special reference to the
   Mendicant monks). The III. Part now aims at showing by what provision
   and means the return of the rational creature to God has become
   possible by way of faith, hope, and love, namely, through Christ and
   the Sacraments. To this there is the intention to add eschatology.
   Hence there is a treatment here (1) of Christ, in particular of His
   incarnation and His natures. After a discussion of the necessity of the
   incarnation (on account of sin, and since a satisfactio de condigno was
   requisite) for the removal of original sin, the personal unity, the
   divine person, of Christ, and His human nature are set forth (in which
   connection, Q. 8, there is reference to the Church as the mystic body
   of Christ, and the thought of "Christus" as the head of mankind is
   strongly accentuated); then the consequences of the personal union
   (communicatio idiomatum) and all bearings of the constitution of the
   Godman are explained. On this follows (2) a section on the work of
   Christ, which, however, contains almost no speculation whatever, but
   illustrates in an edifying way the history of Christ from his entrance
   into the world (Q. 27-31, the doctrine of Mary). In connection with the
   suffering and death of Christ, the point of view of the "conveniens" as
   distinguished from the "necessarium" has special prominence given to
   it. Immediately after the work of Christ the doctrine of the Sacraments
   is added (Q. 60 sq.); for redemption is imparted to individuals only
   through the Sacraments, which have their efficacy from Christ, and
   through which men are incorporated into Christ. The statement begins
   with the general doctrine of the Sacraments (nature, necessity, effect,
   cause, number, connection); then follows the discussion of baptism,
   confirmation, the eucharist, and penance. Here Thomas was obliged to
   lay down his pen. It was not granted to him to complete his "Summa."
   What was still wanting, as has been remarked, was supplied from his
   other works; but in this supplement we miss somewhat of the strictness
   marking the expositions given by himself in the Summa, since it was
   mainly constructed out of notes and excursus on the text of the
   Lombard. Observe lastly, that in the Summa repetitions are not only not
   avoided, but occur to an incalculable extent.

   [256] See Baur, l.c. II., p. 235: "The thorough reasonableness of the
   ecclesiastical faith, or the conviction that for all doctrines of the
   ecclesiastical system some kind of rationes can be discovered, by which
   they are established even for the thinking reason, was the fundamental
   presupposition of Scholasticism. But after Scholasticism had risen to
   its highest point in Thomas and Bonaventura, it became itself doubtful
   again of this presupposition. This very important turning-point in the
   history of Scholasticism, after which it tended increasingly to fall to
   pieces, is represented by Duns Scotus." (Doctrine of double truth as
   consequence of the Fall!) Besides Duns Scotus, and after him, it was
   chiefly the doctor resolutissimus Durandus who, at first a Thomist,
   passed over to Nominalism and obtained currency for its mode of thought
   (see his commentary on the Lombard). He worked in the first third of
   the fourteenth century; on him see Werner in the 2. vol. of the
   "Scholastik des spateren Mittelalters."

   [257] Even the sufficiency of the Bible was doubted by Duns (against
   Thomas).

   [258] Nominalism only achieved its position in the Church after a hard
   struggle. From the clays of Roscellin it was viewed with suspicion, and
   the appearing of Occam in its support could not be in its favour
   (Occam's writings prohibited in 1389 by the University of Paris). But
   from the middle of the fourteenth century it established itself, and
   even Dominicans -- although the controversy between Thomists and
   Scotists continued -- became advocates of it. Indeed, when Wyclif and
   other Reformers (Augustinians) again adopted realism, a new chapter
   began. Realism now, from the close of the fourteenth century, became
   ecclesiastically suspected (on account of the spiritualism, the
   determinism, and the intellectualistic mysticism, which seemed to
   endanger ecclesiasticism). The most important representatives of
   Post-Scotistic Scholasticism are Petrus Aureolus, John of Baconthorp,
   Durandus, and Occam. On the "theological mode of thought and the
   general mental habit" of these scholars, see Werner, Nachscotist.
   Scholastik, p. 21 ff. On the Thomist scrutiny applied by Capreolus to
   Post-Scotistic Scholasticism, see ibid., p. 438 ff. That Nominalism, in
   spite of its dogmatic probabilism, did not, at least at the beginning,
   weaken dogma, is best illustrated by the fanatical attack on the
   peculiar doctrine of Pope John XXII.

   [259] See Siebeck, Die Anfänge der neueren Psychologie in der
   Scholastik, in the Zeitschr. f. Philos. u. philos. Kritik, 1888, 1889.

   [260] Duns also rejected the Thomist idea that in created things the
   absolute divine original form is pictured forth, and, under the
   direction of Aristotle, passed over to a naturalistic doctrine of the
   world.

   [261] Still less, as frequently happens, is the Jesuit Order, with its
   casuistic dogmatic and ethic, to be made accountable here, as if it was
   the first to introduce the innovation. This Order simply entered into
   the inheritance of mediæval Nominalism.

   [262] For the speculative Scholasticism there was substituted the
   empirico-casuistic. The Nominalists sought to show, with an immense
   expenditure of acuteness and speculation, that there could not be a
   speculative Scholasticism. When they had furnished this "proof," there
   remained over purely hollow forms, which were bound to collapse, or
   could be maintained only through the compulsory force of a powerful
   institution. What was not brought within the view of Nominalism, in
   spite of all its progress, was the idea of personality (see for the
   first time the Renaissance), and consequently the person of Christ (see
   the Reformation), and above all, history (see the eighteenth and
   nineteenth centuries). For it the place of history was still occupied
   always by the rigid Church It is not otherwise still to-day with the
   science of the Jesuits. They consistently trifle with history, and can
   treat it, in the tone of a man of the world, with a certain amusement
   and easy scorn, when once they have estabished the things which the
   conception of the Church requires to be established.

   [263] The juristic Popes from Gregory VII. onwards, especially the
   Popes of the thirteenth century, anticipated the Nominalist doctrine of
   fides implicita: "In his commentary on the Decretals (in lib. I., c. 1
   de summa trinitate et fide Catholica) Innocent IV. laid down two
   momentous rules. First, that it is enough for the laity to believe in a
   God who recompenses, but with regard to everything else, of dogma or
   moral doctrine, merely to believe implicitly, that is to think, and to
   say, I believe what the Church believes. Second, that a cleric must
   obey even a Pope who issues an unrighteous command" (Döllinger, Akad.
   Vorträge II., p. 419). The latter position does not interest us here;
   there is interest, however, in the more precise definition of the
   former given by Innocent, (1) that the lower clergy, who cannot carry
   on the study of theology, are to be regarded as laymen; only they must
   believe in transubstantiation; (2) that an error with regard to
   Christian doctrine (the doctrine of the Trinity even) does not do harm
   to a layman, if he at the same time believes (believes erroneously)
   that he holds to the doctrine of the Church. Ritschl (Fides implicita,
   1890) has dealt more minutely with this important doctrine. He shows
   that it originated from a passage of the Lombard (1. III., dist. 25).
   But the terminology, the range and the validity of the fides implicita
   remained uncertain among the theologians and Popes till the end of the
   thirteenth century. The great teachers of the thirteenth century (above
   all Thomas) confined it within narrow limits, and in this contradicted
   the Popes (even Innocent III. comes under consideration; see Ritschl,
   p. 5 f.). Even Duns differs little from Thomas (p. 20 ff.). But Occam
   reverted to the exposition of Innocent IV. (p. 30 f.); nay, although he
   is a doctor, he claims fides implicita for himself (with regard to the
   doctrine of the Eucharist): "quidquid Romana ecclesia credit, hoc solum
   et non aliud vel explicite vel implicite credo." Occam wishes to get
   free play for his doctrine of the Eucharist, which diverges from the
   traditional view; he saves himself therefore by roundly acknowledging
   the Church doctrine, that he may then make his divergence appear as a
   theological experiment. Here therefore the fides implicita is turned to
   account for another purpose. It is remarkable that in its original
   purpose it was rejected (no doubt on account of Thomas) by Gregory XI.
   (against Raymund Lullus); but by Biel it is again accepted, and treated
   apparently with reserve, but in the end there is seen just in it the
   proof of fides as infusa (as the work of God). Neither Occam nor Biel
   wishes by this to treat dogma ironically, on the contrary they show
   their want of inner freedom in relation to dogma; but when Laurentius
   Valla winds up his critical supplementings with the assertion that he
   believes as mother Church does, the irony is manifest, In what way the
   fides implicita extended into the period of the Reformation has been
   shown by Ritschl, p. 40 if., who also traces out the doctrine among
   later Catholic teachers. That there is an element of truth in the
   recognition of the fides implicita is easily seen; but it is not easy
   to define theologically what is right in it. Where value is attached to
   the mere act of obedience, or where, for that part, there is also
   something of merit attributed to it, the limit of what is correct is
   transgressed.

   [264] Into the philosophy of Duns Scotus (see Werner, l.c., and the
   summary in the article by Dorner in Herzog's R.-E., 2 ed.) and of Occam
   (see Wagemann in the R.-E.) I cannot here enter further. Important
   theological doctrines of both will fall to be spoken of in the
   following section. It is well known that Duns Scotus himself was not
   yet a Nominalist, but prepared the way for applying this theory of
   knowledge to dogmatics. He already emphasised the independence of the
   secular sciences (even of metaphysics) as over against theology, while
   in general he brought out much more clearly the independence of the
   world (in continual discussions with Thomas) as over against God. To
   balance this he gives wide scope to the arbitrary will of God as over
   against the world. Yet that this opinion may not lead to everything
   being plunged in uncertainty, the knowledge of God derived from
   revelation (as distinguished from rational knowledge) is strongly
   accentuated. In Duns we still observe the struggle of the principle of
   reason with the principle of arbitrariness tempered by revelation and
   made conceivable; in Occam the latter has triumphed. To the
   understanding, which Occam brings into court against dogma, the task is
   assigned of showing that logic and physics cannot be applied to the
   articles of faith, and to the supernatural objects that answer to them.
   All doctrines of faith are full of contradictions; but so also it must
   be, according to Occam; for only in this way do they show themselves to
   be declarations about a super-sensible world, which to the
   understanding is a miracle. This theologian has been misunderstood,
   when his criticism of dogma has been taken as suggesting the irony of
   the doubter. If, after proving the doctrine of transubstantiation
   impossible, he finally holds it as more probable than any other
   doctrine, because the Church has fixed it, and because the omnipotence
   of God appears in it most unlimitedly, i.e., because it is the most
   irrational doctrine that can be thought of, in this he is severely in
   earnest, however much he might like to maintain his own dialectic
   doctrine on this point. And what holds good of the doctrine of the
   Supper holds good also of all other cardinal doctrines of the Church.
   Unreasonableness and authority are in a certain sense the stamp of
   truth. That is also a positivism, but it is the positivism whose sins
   have fully developed. Here, too, it applies, that one abyss calls up
   another. The Pre-Nominalist theology had loaded reason with a burden of
   speculative monstrosities, and at the same time required it to bear the
   whole weight of religion; the sobered ratio abandoned entirely the
   thought of a logike latreia, became always more prepared to recognise
   the faith of ignorant submission as religion, and fell back on
   knowledge of the world. On Biel, see Linsenmaun in the Tub.
   Quartalschr., 1865.

   [265] Also from the ancient Church and from dogma in its original sense
   as a whole. Whoever transforms all dogmatic and ethic into casuistry,
   thereby proves that he is no more inwardly, but only outwardly, bound.

   [266] Werner has the credit of having described the reaction of
   Augustinianism in the third vol. of his "Scholastik des Spätteren
   Mittelalters." Yet his account is by no means complete. In pp. 1-232 he
   treats of "the representation of the Scholastic Augustinianism given by
   the mediæval Augustinian-Hermit School," i.e., almost exclusively of
   the doctrines of ægidius (ob. 1315), the great defender of Thomas, and
   of Gregory of Rimini; then, in pp. 234-306, of Bradwardine's doctrine.
   Stöckl also goes into the Augustinianism of the fifteenth century, but
   in his own way. Moreover, Werner will not admit a rejuvenated
   Augustinianism. "The earlier and later attempts to obtain a specific
   Augustinianism fall under different points of view, according as they
   signify a reaction against the enfeebling and externalising of the
   Christian ecclesiastical thought of salvation, or the opposition,
   supported by the name of Augustine, of a resuscitated one-sided
   Platonism to Aristotelianism, or, finally, as they arose from a vague
   fusion of the respect for Augustine in the Church generally, with the
   authority of the head and leader of a particular school. It was to such
   a vague fusion that the Mediæval Order-theology of the Augustinian
   Hermits (?) owed its origin, which came into existence as schola
   ægidiana, and, under many changes, continued to exist till last
   century" (p. 8 f.).

   [267] See Lechler, Wiclif I. Bd., and the same author's monograph on
   Bradwardine, 1863. Bradwardine made a further endeavour to create a
   philosophy adequate to the Christian conception of God, and on that
   account went back on the Augustinian Anselmic speculation as regards an
   absolutely necessary and perfect being, from which all that is and can
   he is to be deduced. But yet he shows himself to be dependent on Duns
   in this, that he represents God and the world exclusively under the
   contrast of the necessary and the contingent (see his book de causa dei
   adv. Pelag., Werner pp. 255 ff. 299), while in other respects also very
   strong influences of Nominalism are discernible in him. Yet these
   influences disappear behind the main tendency, which is directed to
   showing the "immediate unity and coincidence of theological and
   philosophical thought," and to restoring Augustine's doctrine of grace
   together with Determinism. ("All willing in God is absolute
   substance.") Werner will have it that he has proved that Bradwardine is
   no Thomist, but that he reverts to the pre-Thomist Scholasticism. That
   is right in so far as Bradwardine is a logical Augustinian. But Werner
   has an interest in emphasising as strongly as possible the peripatetic
   elements in Thomas; for only when these are emphasised in a one-sided
   way can Thomas continue to he the normal theologian. "According to the
   universal feeling' the Aristotelian basis was indispensable for the
   ends of a methodically conducted theological scholastic science, and as
   a rational restraint upon giving a false internal character to the
   Christian ecclesiastical religious consciousness" (p. 305).

   [268] Even the rejection of all philosophy and of the whole of
   Scholasticism, of which we have an instance in Pupper of Goch (O.
   Clemen, l.c. p. 135 ff.) -- whom Luther described as "Vere Germanus et
   gnosios theologus" -- changed nothing.

   on a level with him.

   [271] Yet, "German patriotism effected a union in many ways of the
   anti-Romish traditions with Humanistic Illuminism" (Loofs).

   [272] Drews, Humanismus und Reformation, 1887.

   [273] Dilthey (Archiv. f. Gesch. d. Philos. 5 Bd., p. 381 ff.), in a
   way that seems to me substantially correct, but somewhat forced, has
   described Erasmus as the founder of theological Rationalism with
   accommodation to the Church. Erasmus was too many-sided, and too
   uncertain of principles, to found anything beyond methods.

   [274] In Nominalism this became otherwise. The exhibition of the
   ecclesiastical doctrine became more and more an end in itself, and was
   detached from the philosophy of religion. That on this account the
   originality and independence of the Christian religion as a historic
   phenomenon came to view again more plainly, is not to be denied.

   [275] In their definition of salvation or of the finis theologiæ, the
   Schoolmen exhibit a Mystic, i.e., an Augustinian, i.e., an old Catholic
   tendency. The fruitio dei is held to be the final end, whether it is
   realised in the intellect or in quiescence of the will in God. For this
   individualistic mode of viewing salvation, which is indifferent to the
   moral destiny of man, the Church is either not taken into account at
   all, or is taken into account simply as a means, and as an auxiliary
   institution. Only in so far as man conceives of himself as a being that
   is earthly, bound to time, and must train himself, are all his ideals,
   and the forces that render him aid, included for him in the Church
   (salvation in time is salvation in the Church), and he must reverence
   the Church, as it is, as the mother of faith, as the saving
   institution, nay, as the regnum Christi. But this regnum has in the
   world beyond a form totally different from its present form. In this
   whole view Scholasticism nowhere passed beyond Augustine. The relation
   is not drawn between the aim to be realised in the earthly, and the aim
   to be realised in the heavenly Church. In the last resort Roman
   Catholicism was then, and is also to-day, no phenomenon with but one
   meaning, as the Greek Church is, and as Protestantism might be. At one
   time it points its members to a contemplation that moves in the line of
   knowledge, love, and asceticism, a contemplation that is as neutral to
   the Church as to every association among men, and to everything
   earthly; at another time it directs men to recognise in the earthly
   Church their highest goods and their proper aim. These directions can
   only be followed alternately, not together. In consequence of this,
   Roman Catholics maintain two notions of the Church, which are neutral
   towards each other, the invisible communion of the elect and the papal
   Church.

   [276] See the Symbol of 1215.

   [277] In this lies the greatest importance of Scholasticism within the
   history of dogma.

   [278] See the excellent selection of passages from the sources in
   Miinscher-Coelln II., 1, § 118, 119. Schwane, l.c., p. 122 ff.

   [279] Anselm's discussions of the conception of God, in which there is
   the first step of advance beyond the Areopagite conception, are not
   taken note of at all by the Lombard, who adhered simply to the
   patristic tradition. Thomas is the first to adopt Anselm's
   speculations.

   [280] See Thomas, P. I., Q. 2, Art. 3, where the cosmological argument
   appears in a threefold form.

   conception had already a strong influence on Thomas.

   knowledge and of science, see Werner, Duns Scotus, p. 180 ff.; ibid.,
   p. 331 ff., on his doctrine of God, which only admits of an a
   posteriori ascertainment of the qualities of the divine Being.

   [284] Werner, l.c., p. 408: "It is a genuinely Scotist thought that the
   absolute divine will cannot be subjected to the standard of our ethical
   habits of thought (!)"

   [285] In contrast with this, Thomas had taught (P. I., Q. 12, Art. 12)
   that indeed "ex sensibilium cognitione non potest tota dei virtus
   cognosci et per consequens nec ejus essentia videri," but that both the
   existence of God and "ea quæ necesse est ei convenire" can be known.
   Duns and his disciples denied this; but, on the other hand, they
   asserted that God is more cognisable than the Thomists were willing to
   grant. The latter denied an adequate (essential) knowledge of God
   (cognitio quidditativa); the Scotists affirmed it, because it was not a
   question at all about the knowledge of an infinite intelligence, but
   about the knowledge of the God who is will, and who has manifested His
   will.

   [286] On this, and the acute criticism of the Aristotelian doctrine of
   God, see Werner, Nachscotistiche Scholastik, p. 216 ff.

   [287] It is a special merit of Ritschl that in his great work in the
   department of the history of dogma he has shown everywhere the
   fundamental importance of the conception of God.

   [288] See Münscher, § 120, Schwane, l.c. p. 152 ff., Bach, Dogmengesch.
   Bd. II., Baur, L. v. d. Dreieinigkeit, Bd. II.

   [289] Application of the Nominalist mode of thought; against him
   Anselm; see Reuter I., p. 134 f.; Deutsch, Abelard, p. 256 f.

   [290] There was a disposition to detect even tritheism in Abelard; on
   his doctrine of the Trinity, see Deutsch, p. 259 ff. Ahelard's wish was
   to reject both the Roscellin conception and strict Sabellianism, yet he
   does not get beyond a fine Modalism (see Deutsch, p. 280 ff.). It is
   noteworthy that, like Luther at Worms, he stated in the prologue to his
   Introductio in theol., that he was ready to be corrected, "cum quis me
   fidelium vel virtute rationis vel auctoritate scriptum correxerit" (see
   Münscher, p. 52).

   [291] Thus it was with Anselm and the Victorinians, especially Richard,
   who reproduced and expounded the Augustinian analogies of the Trinity
   (the powers of the human spirit).

   [292] Joachim of Fiore made it a reproach that the 4th Lateran Council,
   c. 2, took the Lombard under its protection and decreed: "Nos (i.e.,
   the Pope) sacro et universali concilio approbante credimus et
   confitemur cum Petro (scil. Lombardo), quod una quædam summa res est,
   incomprehensibilis quidem et ineffabilis, quæ veraciter est pater et
   filius et spiritus, tres simul personaæ, ac singulatim quælibet
   earundem. Et ideo in deo trinitas est solummodo, non quaternitas, quia
   quælibet trium personarum est illa res, videlicet substantia, essentia
   sive natura divina, quæ sola est universorum principium, præter quod
   aliud inveniri non potest. Et illa res non est generans neque genita
   nec procedens, sed est pater qui generat, filius qui gignitur, et
   spiritus sanctus qui procedit, ut distinctiones sint in personis et
   unitas in natura."

   [293] L.c., p. 179.

   [294] See Münscher, § 121, 122, Schwane, pp. 179-226.

   [295] For a pantheistic view of creation in Thomas an appeal, however,
   can scarcely be made to the expression frequently employed by him,
   "emanatio" (processio) creaturarum a deo; for he certainly does not
   employ the expression in a pantheistic sense. If he says, P. I., Q. 45,
   Art. I: "emanationem totius entis a causa universali, quæ est deus,
   designamus nomine creationis," just for that reason he shows in what
   follows, that "creatio, quæ est emanatio totius esse, est ex non ente,
   quod est nihil."

   [296] Scotus holds the possibility of a divine creation from eternity
   as not unthinkable, but disputes the arguments by which Thomas sought
   to corroborate the position that a beginning of creation in time cannot
   be proved; see Werner, Duns Scotus, p. 380 ff.

   [297] P. I., Q. 44, Art. 4; see also Q. 14, 19, 46, 104.

   [298] Here would be the place to deal with the doctrine of angels held
   by the Schoolmen; but as the material relating to this subject -- the
   fencing and wrestling ground of the theologians, who had here more
   freedom than elsewhere -- is very loosely connected with dogma, and is
   at the same time unworthy of serious consideration, it may be passed
   over; see Thomas, P. I., Q. 50-65; Schwane, pp. 194-217.

   [299] See Summa, P. I., Q. 103-117: de gubernatione rerum, divided
   according to the points of view of finis gubernationis, conservatio and
   mutatio rerum. Under the first point of view it is established
   speculatively that the finis rerum must be "quoddam bonum extrinsecum,"
   because the finis universalis rerum as the ultimate goal must be the
   "bonum universale," but this latter cannot be included in the world,
   since the world, in virtue of its created quality, can never include
   more than a participative bonum; hence God Himself is the finis
   gubernationis (see above). Further, in the general doctrine of
   government the questions are treated, whether there is a gubernatio at
   all, whether it proceeds from one, whether its effect is uniform or
   manifold, whether everything is under it, whether it is everywhere
   direct, whether anything can happen præter ordinem gubernationis, and
   whether anything "reniti possit contra ordinem gubernationis dei." The
   "conservatio" is defined (q. 104, art. 1) as only a continued creating,
   and so it is said at the close of the article (ad. 4): "conservatio
   rerum a deo non est per aliquam novam actionem, sed per continuationem
   actionis quæ dat esse, quæ quidem actio est sine motu et tempore, sicut
   etiam conservatio luminis in aëre est per continuatum influxum a sole."
   This not unobjectionable definition is applied in many different ways.
   Thus miracle is declared impossible, in so far as the ordo rerum
   depends on a prima causa, while on the other hand it is admitted in
   view of the causæ secundæ (art. 6). But according to Thomas the real
   miracles, although they are not so designated, are the creation of the
   world and of souls, and also the justificatio impiorum; for they are
   præter ordinem naturalem. The miracle of all miracles is God, quod
   habet causam simpliciter et omnibus occultam.

   [302] Very worthy of notice is Duns' criticism of Augustine's and
   Anselm's doctrines of malum; see Werner, l.c., p. 402 ff.

   [303] See Deutsch, l.c., pp. 289-318. Abelard's doctrine is a very
   vigorous attempt to give full justice to the humanity of Christ within
   the lines of the traditional dogma. But there was the feeling that this
   attempt was heretical, and it is, in fact, questionable, if we consider
   that it threatens the unity of the person of Christ, on which all
   depends, but which, of course, at that time could only be expressed in
   the impracticable categories of the natures.

   [310] The doctrine of the Holy Spirit did not receive a further
   development in Scholasticism. From the days, certainly, of the Latin
   Empire in the East till the Synod of Florence there was controversy and
   negotiation with the Greeks in numberless treatises about the
   procession of the Holy Spirit. The negotiations for union lasted, with
   interruptions, for almost 250 years, and for a time they furnished a
   certain prospect of success, because from the thirteenth century there
   was a small Latin party in the East, which, however, in the end was
   disowned by the whole Eastern Church. At Lyons in 1274 (can. 1) Greeks
   made admission that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the
   Son ("non tamquam ex duobus principiis, sed tamquam ex uno principio,
   unica spiratione"), and at Florence (Mansi XXXI., p. 1027 sq.) there
   was a coming to terms in a complicated formula, which, however,
   expressly justified the "filioque." But as early as 1443 the Florentine
   Council was condemned at a Jerusalem Synod by the Patriarchs of
   Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem. The Greeks with Latin sympathies
   either confessed penitently their "betrayal of the faith," or preferred
   to remain in Italy and become Roman dignitaries.

   [311] This victory, it is true, came about not in Scholasticism but in
   the Church. Scholasticism was led on rather by Occam to a complete
   dissolution of the God-Manhood of Christ, so that for Socinianism there
   remained nothing more to do (see Werner II., p. 353 ff.). In Certilog.,
   concl. 6, Occam writes: "Est articulus fidei, quod deus assumpsit
   naturam humanam. Non includit contradictionem deum assumere naturam
   asininam; pari ratione potest assumere lapidem vel lignum." Also (l.c.
   concl. 62): "To Christ the predicate Son of God can only be attributed
   in so far as in Him the Verbum divinum appears united with the human
   nature; of a filiation relation of the Verbum divinum in itself the
   reason of man knows nothing"; so also the doctrine of the Trinity is
   contrary to reason (I., Dist. 9, Q. 1). If as over against this there
   is a pointing to fides, it is simply submission to authority that is
   meant. If, now, from any cause, this authority fell away, Socinianism
   was ripe.

   [312] There was repeated here what we have already observed in
   connection with the doctrine of the Trinity. In regard to both dogmas
   theoretical speculation strikes out paths which are scarcely any longer
   united with the paths along which faith moves. There can scarcely be
   conceived of a greater contrariety than is implied, when in the
   doctrine of the person of Christ the "homo" is almost entirely
   eliminated, and then in the doctrine of the work of Christ this "homo"
   takes the commanding place. No doubt by means of words and
   terminologies all chasms can be bridged over; but they are still only
   words.

   [313] See p. 54 ff.

   [314] See Ritschl, Vol. I., p. 55 ff.; Münscher, § 135; Schwane, pp.
   296-333. The passio Christi dominates the whole Western theology. If
   John of Damascus (see Vol. III., p. 288) calls the incarnation the only
   new thing under the sun, Walter v.d. Vogelweide expresses the general
   conviction of the West, when in one of his best-known poems he exalts
   the suffering of Christ as the miracle of all miracles.

   [315] Q. 46, Art. 3: "Tanto aliquis modus convenientior est ad
   assequendum finem, quanto per ipsum plura concurrunt, quæ sunt
   expedientia fini. Per hoc autem quod homo per Christi passionem
   liberatus, multa concurrerunt ad salutem hominis pertinentia præter
   liberationem a peccato: Primo enim per hoc homo cognoscit, quantum
   hominem deus diligat, et per hoc provocatur ad eum diligendum, in quo
   perfectio humanæ salutis consistit. Unde Apostolus dicit: Commendat
   suam caritatem deus,' etc. Secundo quia per hoc nobis dedit exemplum
   obedientiæ et humilitatis et constantiæ, justitiæ et ceterarum virtutum
   in passione Christi ostensarum, quæ sunt necessaria ad humanam salutem.
   Unde dicitur, I., Pet. 2: Christus passus pro nobis, nobis relinquens
   exemplum, etc.' Tertio quia Christus per passionem suam non solum
   hominem a peccato liberavit, sed etiam gratiam justificantem et gloriam
   beatitudinis ei promeruit, ut infra dicetur (Q. 48). Quarto, quia per
   hoc est homini inducta major necessitas, se immunem a peccato
   conservandi, qui se sanguine Christi redemptum cogitat a peccato,
   secundum illud I., Cor. 6: Empti estis pretio,' etc. Quinto quia hoc ad
   majorem dignitatem hominis cessit, ut sicut homo victus fuerat et
   deceptus a diabolo, ita etiam homo esset qui diabolum vinceret, et
   sicut homo mortem meruit, ita homo moriendo mortem superaret. Et ideo
   convenientius fuit quod per passionem Christi liberaremur, quam per
   solam dei voluntatem." In Q. 47 the treatment of redemption from the
   point of view of the convenientissimum is continued.

   [316] It is a step in advance on the part of Thomas that he does not
   confine himself to the death of Christ, but embraces in his view His
   whole life as suffering.

   [317] Q. 48, Art. 2: "Respondeo dicendum, quod ille proprio satisfacit
   pro offensa, qui exhibet offenso id quod æque vel magis diligit, quam
   oderit offensam. Christus autem ex caritate et obedientia patiendo
   majus aliquid deo exhibuit, quam exigeret recompensatio totius offensæ
   humani generis; primo quidem propter magnitudinem caritatis ex qua
   patiebatur, secundo propter dignitatem vitæ suæ quam pro satisfactione
   ponebat, quæ erat vita dei et hominis; tertio propter generalitatem
   passionis et magnitudinem doloris assumpti, ut supra dictum est (Q. 46,
   Art. 6). Et ideo passio Christi non solum sufficiens, sed etiam
   superabundans satisfactio fuit pro peccatis humani generis."

   [318] To this satisfactio superabundans Thomas returns in the 4 Art.
   [redemptio: "respondeo dicendum, quod per peccatum dupliciter homo
   obligatus erat, primo quidem servitute peccati, quia qui facit
   peccatum, servus est peccati. . . . Quia igitur diabolus hominem
   superaverat, inducendo ad peccatum, homo servituti diaboli addictus
   erat. Secundo, quantum ad reatum poenæ, quo homo erat obligatus
   secundum dei justitiam. Et hoc etiam est servitus quædam; ad servitutem
   enim pertinet quod aliquis patiatur, quod non vult, cum liberi hominis
   sit uti se ipso ut vult. Quia igitur passio Christi fuit sufficiens et
   superabundans satisfactio pro peccato et reatu poenæ generis humani,
   ejus passio fuit quasi quoddam pretium per quod liberati sumus ab
   utraque obligatione. Nam ipsa satisfactio qua quis satisfacit, sive pro
   se sive pro alio, pretium quoddam dicitur, quo seipsum vel alium
   redimit a peccato et a poenæ. . . . Christus autem satisfecit non
   quidem pecuniam dando aut aliquid hujusmodi, sed dando id quod fuit
   maximum, seipsum scil. pro nobis. Et ideo passio Christi dicitur esse
   nostra redemptio." There is a not unimportant turn of thought (Q. 47,
   2; 48, 3), where the suffering of Christ is looked at from the point of
   view of sacrifice. Here it is not merely love in general that is
   described as that which has efficacy in the voluntary sacrifice, but
   still more precisely obedience: "Convenientissimum fuit, quod Christus
   ex obedientia pateretur . . . obedientia vero omnibus sacrificiis
   antefertur . . .miles vincere non potest nisi duci obediat, et ita homo
   Christus victoriam obtinuit per hoc quod deo fuit obediens. . . . Quia
   in morte Christi lex vetus consummata est, potest intelligi quod
   patiendo omnia veteris legis præcepta implevit: moralia quidam, quæ in
   præceptis caritatis fundantur, implevit in quantum passus est et ex
   dilectione patris et etiam ex dilectione proximi, cæremonialia veto
   præcepta legis, quæ ad sacrificia et oblationes præcipue ordinantur,
   implevit Christus sua passione, in quantum omnia antiqua sacrificia
   fuerunt figuræ illius veri sacrificii, quod Christus obtulit moriendo
   pro nobis. . . . Præcepta vero judicialia legis, quæ præcipue
   ordinantur ad satisfaciendam injuriam passis, implevit Christus sue
   passione, permittens se ligno affigi pro pomo quod de ligno homo
   rapuerat contra dei mandatum."

   [319] See Art. 3 and 4: "Respondeo dicendum, quod per passionem Christi
   liberati sumus a reatu poenæ dupliciter. Uno modo directe, in quantum
   scil. passio Christi fuit sufficiens et superabundans satisfactio pro
   peccatis totius humani generis; exhibita autem satisfactione
   sufficienti tollitur reatus poenæ (this is, of course, no taking over
   of penalty). Alio modo indirecte, in quantum scil. passio Christi est
   causa remissionis peccati, in quo fundatur reatus poenæ." To the
   objection that on the liberati poenæ satisfactoriæ are still imposed by
   the Church, he replies thus: "Ad hoc quod consequemur effectum
   passionis Christi, oportet nos ei configurari. Configuramur autem ei in
   baptistmo sacramentaliter, secundum Rom. 6, 4: Consepulti sumus ei per
   baptismum in mortem.' Unde baptisatis nulla poena satisfactoria
   imponitur, quia sunt totaliter liberati per satisfactionem Christi.
   Quia vero Christus semel tantum pro peccatis nostris mortuus est, ut
   dicitur I. Pet. 3, 18, ideo non potest homo secundario configurari
   morti Christi per sacramentum baptismi. Unde oportet quod illi, qui
   post baptismum peccant, configurentur Christo patienti per aliquid
   poenalitatis vel passionis quam in se ipsis sustineant (!) Quæ tamen
   multo minor sufficit, quam esset condigna peccato, cooperante
   satisfactione Christi." A wonderful illustration of satisfactio
   superabundans! Even in the 4 Art. the reconciliatio dei is traced, not
   to the endurance of the penal suffering, but to the "sacrificium
   acceptissimum." God is reconciled (1) because the passio Christi
   peccatum removat, (2) because it is sacrifice; "est enim hoc proprie
   sacrificii effectus, ut per ipsum placetur deus"; for as man propter
   aliquod obsequium acceptum forgives the injury, "similiter tantum bonum
   fuit, quod Christus voluntarie passus est, quod propter hoc bonum in
   natura humana inventum deus placatus est super omni offensa generis
   humani, quantum ad eos qui Christo passo conjunguntur." With a change
   of disposition on God's part Thomas will have nothing to do, although
   he expresses himself more cautiously than the Lombard. "Deus diligit
   omnes homines quantum ad naturam quam ipse fecit, odit tamen eos
   quantum ad culpam . . ., non dicendum, quod passio Christi dicitur
   quantum ad hoc, deo nos reconciliasse, quod de novo nos amare
   inciperet, sed quia per passionem Christi sublata est odii causa, tum
   per ablationem peccati tum per recompensationem acceptabilioris
   beneficii." In the 5 Art. the passio Christi is expressly related both
   to the peccatum commune totius humanæ naturæ (et quantum ad culpam et
   quantum ad reatum poenæ), and to the peccata propria singulorum, qui
   communicant ejus passioni per fidem et caritatem et fidei sacramenta.
   Yet in connection with the latter the removal of the reatus poenæ is
   not expressly emphasised. The clearest passage on the penal worth of
   the death of Christ is in Q. 47, Art. 3: "in quo ostenditur et dei
   severitas, qui peccatum sine poena dimittere noluit." But a connected
   view is not outlined from this as a starting-point, while such a view
   can be shown in Bernard.

   [320] See the foregoing note.

   [321] Q. 48, Art. 1: "Christo data est gratia non solum sicut singulari
   personæ, sed in quantum est caput ecclesiæ, ut scil. ab ipso redundaret
   ad membra. Et ideo opera Christi hoc modo se habent tam ad se quam ad
   sua membra sicut se habent opera alterius hominis in gratia constituti
   ad ipsum. . . ." Q. 49, Art. 1: "Passio Christi causat remissionem
   peccatorum per modum redemptionis, quia enim ipse est caput nostrum,
   per passionem suam quam ex caritate et obedientia sustinuit, liberavit
   nos tam quam membra sua a peccatis, quasi per pretium suæ passionis,
   sicut si homo per aliquod opus meritorium, quod manu exerceret,
   redimeret se a peccato quod pedibus commisisset. Sicut enim naturale
   corpus est unum ex membrorum diversitate constans, ita tota ecclesia,
   quæ est mysticum corpus Christi, computatur quasi una persona cum suo
   capite, quod est Christus," and other passages, especially P. III., Q.
   8.

   [322] In Sent. III., Dist. 19, n. 7: "Meritum Christi fuit finitum,
   quia a principio finito essentialiter dependens, etiam accipiendo ipsum
   cum omnibus respectibus, sive cum respectu ad suppositum Verbi, sive
   cum respectu ad finem, quia omnes respectus isti erant finiti."

   [323] See Ritschl, I., pp. 73-82; Werner, p. 454 ff. In Sentent. III.,
   Dist. 19, Q. 1. The 20 Dist. is entirely devoted to the refutation of
   Anselm. Let us quote some leading sentences here: "Sicut omne aliud a
   deo ideo est bonum, quia a deo volitum, et non e converso, sic meritum
   illud tantum bonum erat, pro quanto acceptabatur et ideo meritum, quia
   acceptatum, non autem e converso quia meritum est et bonum, ideo
   acceptatum." . . ."Christi passio electis solum primam gratiam
   disponentem ad gloriam consummatam efficaciter meruit. Quantum vero
   adtinet ad meriti sufficientiam, fuit profecto illud finitum, quia
   causa ejus finita fuit, vid. voluntas naturæ assumptæ et summa gloria
   illi collata. Non enim Christus quatenus deus meruit, sed in quantum
   homo. Proinde si exquiras, quantum valuerit Christi meritum secundum
   sufficientiam, valuit procul dubio quantum fuit a deo acceptatum, si
   quidem divina acceptatio est potissima causa et ratio omnis meriti.
   Omne enim aliud a deo ideo est bonum quia a deo dilectum, et non e
   contrario . . .deus non acceptat opus idcirco quod sit meritorium aut
   bonum. Tantum ergo valuit Christi meritum sufficienter, quantum potuit
   et voluit ipsum trinitas acceptare. Verum tamen ex sua ratione formali
   et de condigno non potuit in infinitum seu pro infinitis acceptari,
   quia nec illud in se fuit formaliter infinitum. Nihilosecius si spectes
   suppositi merentis circumstantiam et dignitatem, habebat quandam
   extrinsecam rationem, propter quam de congruo in infinitum extensive,
   id est pro infinitis, potuit acceptari. Sed quid meruit Christus?
   Meruit sane primam gratiam omnibus qui eam recipiunt, quæ et absque
   nostro merito confertur. Nam licet in adultis qui baptizantur non
   desideretur aliqua dispositio, nihilominus non merentur illam gratiam
   per suam dispositionem . . .nullus actu ingreditur regnum coeleste,
   nisi cooperetur, si habuerit facultatem, et utatur prima gratia, quam
   sibi Christus promeruit."

   [324] Certainly this doctrine of two natures, from its Nestorianism,
   has already the tendency in it to do away with the deity of Christ.

   [325] The redemption theory of Scotus, which, dialectically considered,
   is superior to the Thomist through its completeness, is very severely
   criticised even by Schwane, who, however, does not bring out its
   Pelagian feature (p. 327 ff.). He speaks of "shallow apprehension of
   the incarnation, and a weakening of the conceptions of righteousness
   and merit."

   [327] Expos. in pass. dom. (Opp. ed. du Pin III. pp. 1157, 1187, 1188):
   "Per læsæ majestatis crimen morti est obnoxius. Rex tamen adeo justus
   fuerit, quod nec ullo pacto crimen tuum dimittere velit impunitum,
   altera vero ex parte tam benignus et misericors, quod proprium filium
   suum innocentem doloribus committat et morti, et quidem sponte sua, ut
   justitiam concordet cum misericordia fiatque criminis emendatio. . . .
   Nunquam deus malum impunitum permitteret, eapropter omnia peccata et
   delicta nostra Jesu Christo supposuit. Ideo ipse est justitia et
   redemptio nostra, modo nos junxerimus ei et per fidem gratiamque ei
   adhæserimus."

   [329] In dealing with the history of dogma, we are not required to
   enter on the history of the doctrine of Scripture, for that doctrine
   underwent no change, even the uncertainties about the Canon were not
   removed, and the slight differences in the way of understanding the
   notion of inspiration have no weight attaching to them. The history of
   Bible prohibition, or of the restriction of the use of the Bible among
   the laity, does not fall to be considered here (see above, p. 156).

   [334] Extreme unction cannot be traced back under the term "Sacrament"
   further than to Innocent I. (ep. ad Decent).

   [335] Marriage of course is very often named a sacrament from the
   earliest times, on the ground of the Epistle to the Ephesians.

   [336] Sentent. V. 22-24; VII. 14.

   [337] How gradually the "sacrament of penance" arose our whole account
   in the foregoing chapters has shown; see Steitz, Das Römische
   Buss-sacrament, 1854. Gregory I. called the reconciliatio of the sinner
   a sacrament. From the time of Petrus Damiani (69. orat.) confession was
   often so described, e.g., even by Bernard.

   [338] Since Augustine's time ordination had very frequently been styled
   a "sacrament"; but even the anointing of princes, and the consecration
   of bishops and of churches, etc., were regarded as Sacraments.

   [339] In a passing way the number six also occurs. In the twelfth
   century, moreover, the considerations connected with the Sacraments
   have a very close connection with the struggle against the heretics
   (Catharists). It may be that subsequent investigation will succeed in
   showing that the fixing of the number seven was the direct consequence
   of this struggle.

   [340] See Hahn, p. 113 f.

   I., pp. 437, 460, 467.

   [342] Sentent. IV., dist. 2 A. The former view, that Otto of Bamberg
   already has the number seven, is disproved; see Hahn, p. 107.

   [343] P. III., Q. 65, Art. 4: "Sacramentum eucharistiæ est potissimum
   inter alia sacramenta. Reasons: (i) because in it there is contained
   Christus substantialiter, not merely a virtus instrumentalis
   participata a Christo: (2) because all other Sacraments look to this
   Sacrament sicut ad finem (this is then proved in the case of each
   separately); (3) because almost all Sacraments in eucharistia
   consummantur."

   [344] In l.c. the Sacraments are graded according to their value:
   "Aliorum sacramentorum (i.e., the Eucharist is previously assumed to be
   the chief Sacrament) comparatio ad invicem potest esse multiplex. Nam
   in via necessitatis baptismus est potissimum sacramentorum, in via
   autem perfectionis sacramentum ordinis; medio autem modo se habet
   sacramentum confirmationis. Sacramentum vero pænitentiæ et extremæ
   unctionis sunt inferioris gradus a prædictis sacramentis, quia, sicut
   dictum est, ordinantur ad viam Christianam non per se, sed quasi per
   accidens, scil. in remedium supervenientis defectus. Inter quæ extrema
   unctio comparatur ad pænitentiam, sicut confirmatio ad baptismum; ita
   scil. quod pænitentia est majoris necessitatis, sed extrema unctio est
   majoris perfectionis." But in Q. 65, Art. 1, the number seven is
   justified at length. The Sacraments are instituted "ad perficiendum
   hominem in his quæ pertinent ad cultum dei secundum religionem
   Christianæ vitæ et in remedium contra defectum peccati. Utroque modo
   convenienter ponuntur VII. sacramenta. Vita enim spiritualis
   conformitatem aliquam habet ad vitam corporalem." In the bodily life of
   the individual there is taken into consideraton his individual weal and
   his weal as a social being. This is then set forth scholastically in
   several sub-sections, and it is then shown that in the spiritual life
   baptism means birth (regeneration), confirmation the augmentum (robur),
   the eucharist, nourishment; penance, healing of the maladies that have
   supervened; extreme unction, the taking away of the "reliquiæ
   peccatorum." These five Sacraments relate to the individual. To man as
   animal sociale there relate also in spiritual things ordo and marriage.
   Proof: the potestas regendi multitudinem et exercendi actus publicos is
   necessary in the spiritual life, and marriage provides for the
   propagatio tam in corporali quam in spirituali vita. In the same way it
   is now shown that each separate Sacrament has also its meaning contra
   defectum peccati, and that the number seven is conveniens (e.g., ordo
   contra dissolutionem multitudinis and marriage in remedium contra
   concupiscentiam personalem et contra defectum multitudinis, qui per
   mortem accidit). Thomas also mentions another view, which he had found
   entertained by others: "fidei respondet baptismus et ordinatur c.
   culpam originalem, spei extrema unctio et ordinatur c. culpam venialem,
   caritati eucharistia et ordinatur c. poenalitatem malitiæ, prudentiæ
   ordo et ordinatur c. ignorantiam, justitiæ pænitentia et ordinatur c.
   peccatum mortale, temperantiæ matrimonium et ordinatur c.
   concupiscentiam, fortitudini confirmatio et ordinatur c. infirmitatem."
   We may smile at these attempts; but yet we shall not be able to deny
   the serviceableness of this combination of the seven Sacraments which
   accompany life. The inclusion particularly of orders on the one hand,
   and of marriage on the other, was a master-stroke of a perhaps
   unconscious policy.

   [345] Eugene IV. in Bull "Exultate deo" (Mansi XXXI., p. 1054):
   "(sacramentorum septem noviæ legis) quinque prima ad spiritalem
   uniuscujusque hominis in se ipso perfectionem, duo ultima ad totius
   ecclesiæ regimen multiplicationemque ordinata sunt (quite according to
   Thomas, see above); per baptismum enim spiritualiter renascimur, per
   confirmationem augemur in gratia et roboramur in fide, renati autem et
   roborati nutrimur divina eucharistiæ alimonia. Quod si per peccatum
   ægritudinem incurrimus animæ, per poenitentiam spiritualiter sanamur,
   spiritualiter etiam et corporaliter, prout animæ expedit, per extremam
   unctionem; per ordinem vero ecclesia gubernatur et multiplicatur
   spiritualiter, per matrimonium corporaliter augetur."

   [346] But Hugo still refrained from tracing all Sacraments to
   institution by Christ.

   [347] Biel, Sentent. IV., Dist. 1., Q. 1, dub. 1 (see Hahn, 1.c., p. 18
   f.): "Sciendum quod duplex est definitio. -- Una est oratio exprimens
   quid rei, alia est oratio exprimens quid nominis. Primo modo nihil
   definitur, nisi sit res una h. e. terminus significans unam rem (that
   is logical Nominalism). Definitione quid nominis potest omnis terminus
   categorematicus definiri, quicquid significet in recto vel in obliquo.
   Nam pro omni nomine possunt poni plura nomina distincte significantia
   illa, quæ significantur per illud unum nomen tam in recto quam in
   obliquo. Ad propositum dicitur, quod sacramentum non potest definiri
   primo modo h. e., definitione quid rei quia sacramentum non res una,
   sed aggregatum ex pluribus . . . sed tantum definitur definitione quid
   nominis."

   [348] More exactly, Q. 62, Art. 5: "Sacramenta novæ legis habent
   virtutem ex passione Christi." Hence also the incorporatio in Christo
   is the effect (Q. 62, Art. 1).

   [349] This laying of weight on the word would, on the other hand, have
   necessarily led to the recognition of a closer union of sacrament and
   grace; for the word, as the word of forgiveness of sin, is itself the
   grace. The mistake therefore of Thomas and the Lombard does not lie in
   their uniting the Sacraments too closely with grace by calling them
   causæ (indeed the position, rather, of Hugo is correct -- "continent
   gratiam"); their mistake lies in their defining grace as "participata
   similitudo divinæ naturæ"; for to describe a grace so conceived of as
   the content or the effect of the Sacraments amounts to changing the
   Sacrament into a magical means. We can understand the relative title
   which the Nominalists had as over against this, to regard the grace so
   conceived of as merely accompanying the Sacrament; but by this again
   the certainty and comforting power of God's offer of grace were
   imperilled.

   [350] Brevilog., p. VI., c. I.

   [351] In Sentent. IV., Dist. 2, Q. 2.

   [352] In this there is a gratifying protest expressed against the
   magical.

   [353] Scotus speaks even directly of a "pactum dei initum cum
   ecclesia," that He will always be present at the Sacraments with His
   influence.

   [354] Yet Biel endeavours, by means of ingenious distinctions, to get
   beyond the idea of mere concomitance, and to conceive in such a way of
   the "pactum cum ecclesia" that God is thought of as in virtue of it
   making the Sacraments causæ secundæ of grace, just as all that happens
   in the world is caused by causæ secundæ, which have their efficiency
   from the causa prima; see Dieckhoff, Ev. Abendmahlslehre, p. 219.

   [355] Hahn has distinguished the following leading points of inquiry:
   the conception of the Sacraments, their necessity, their
   serviceableness, their difference at different periods of human
   history, the conception of New Testament Sacraments, their parts, their
   institution, the administrators of the several Sacraments, the
   conditions under which the Sacraments come to exist, their effect
   (their character indelebilis, their gracious effect (a) in its nature,
   (b) relation of the different Sacraments in respect of their gracious
   effect, (c) more precise definition of the gracious effect of the
   Sacraments severally) origin and conditions of the sacramental
   efficacy.

   [356] Even Thomas makes this distinction in Sentent. IV., Dist. 2, Q.
   1, Art. 4, and, moreover, we find here the expression "ex opere
   operato," which we look for in vain in parallel passages of the Summa,
   although he has the thing it denotes (Q. 61, Art. IV., and elsewhere).
   In the commentary on the Lombard the words occur: "Sacramenta veteris
   legis non habebant aliquam efficaciam ex opere operato sed solum ex
   fide; non autem ita est de sacramentis novæ legis, quæ ex opere operato
   gratiam conferunt." On the expression "ex opere operato" see
   R.-Encyckl.2 XIII., p. 277 f. It was already used in the twelfth
   century (not by the Lombard), before it was applied to the Sacraments.
   As distinguished from the expression "ex opere operantis or operante,"
   it denotes that the act as such is meant, not the actor. An effect ex
   opere operato therefore is an effect that is produced simply by the act
   itself as performed, independently of all co-operation of him who
   performs it, or of him who derives benefit from it. Peter of Poictiers
   is supposed to have been the first to use the term in connection with
   the doctrine of the Sacraments (he adds further "ut liceat uti.")
   William of Auxerre says: "Opus operans est ipsa actio (oblatio) vituli,
   opus operatum est ipsa caro vituli sc. ipsum oblatum, ipsa caro
   Christi." Also Albertus M. on John 6, 29: "Dixerunt antiqui dicentes,
   quod est opus operans et opus operatum. Opus operans est, quod est in
   operante virtutis opus vel a virtute elicitum vel quod est essentialis
   actus virtutis, et sine illo nihil valet virtus ad salutem. Opus autem
   operatum est extrinsecum factum quod apothelesma vocant sancti, sicut
   operatum legis est sacrificium factum vel circumcisio facta vel tale
   aliquid."

   [357] Mansi XXXI., p. 1054.

   [358] P. III., Q. 63, Art. 2-6; cf. 1: "sacramenta novæ legis ad duo
   ordinantur, vid, ad remedium c. peccata et ad perficiendam animam in
   his quæ pertinent ad cultum dei secundum ritum Christianæ vitæ.
   Quicumque autem ad aliquid certum deputatur, consuevit ad illud
   consignari, sicut milites qui adscribebantur ad militiam antiquitus
   solebant quibusdam characteribus corporalibus insigniri, eo quod
   deputabantur ad aliquid corporale." This is then applied to the
   spiritual, see Art. 2: "Sacramenta novæ legis characterem imprimunt, in
   quantum per ea deputantur homines ad cultum dei secundum ritum
   Christianæ religionis." Also Art. 3: "Totus ritus christianæ religionis
   derivatur a sacerdotio Christi, et ideo manifestum est, quod character
   sacramentalis specialiter est character Christi, cujus sacerdotio
   configurantur fideles secundum sacramentales characteres, qui nihil
   aliud sunt quam quædam participationes sacerdotii Christi."

   [359] The real, at least the original, motive here, is to save the
   objectivity of the sacrament in view of unbelieving reception.

   [360] Q. 60.

   [361] So it is only for this reason that the word is necessary in
   connection with the Sacrament.

   [362] Hugo and the Lombard had already described the "words" as the
   form. This view likewise was fixed ecclesiastically by the Bull of
   Eugene IV.: "Hæc omnia Sacramenta tribus perficiuntur, vid. rebus
   tamquam materia, verbis tamquam forma, et persona ministri conferentis
   sacramentum cum intentione faciendi quod facit ecclesia."

   [363] Q. 61.

   [364] Observe this word; Thomas is a Mystic.

   [365] Cf. on this also Q. 62, Art. 6: "Sacramenta veteris legis non
   contulerunt gratiam justificantem per se ipsa, i.e., propria virtute,
   quia sic non fuisset necessaria passio Christi. . . . Manifestum est,
   quod a passione Christi, quæ est causa humanæ justificationis
   convenienter derivatur virtus justificativa ad sacramenta novæ legis,
   non autem ad sacramenta veteris legis. . . . Patet, quod sacramenta
   veteris legis non habebant in se aliquam virtutem qua operarentur ad
   conferendam gratiam justificantem, sed solum significabant fidem, per
   quam justificabantur."

   [366] Q.62.

   [367] "Gratia virtutem et donorum sufficienter perficit essentiam et
   potentias animæ, quantum ad generalem ordinationem actuum animæ, sed
   quantum ad quosdam effectus speciales, qui requiruntur in vita
   Christiana, requiritur sacramentalis gratia. -- Per virtutes et dona
   excluduntur sufficienter vitia et peccata, quantum ad præsens et
   futurum, in quantum scil. impeditur homo per virtutes et dona a
   peccando; sed quantum ad præterita peccata, quæ transeunt actu et
   permanent reatu, adhibetur homini remedium specialiter per sacramenta.
   -- Ratio sacramentalis gratiæ se habet ad gratiam communiter dictam,
   sicut ratio speciei ad genus, unde sicut non æquivoce dicitur animal
   communiter dictum et pro homine sumptum, ita non æquivoce dicitur
   gratia communiter sumpta et gratia sacramentalis." The Protestant
   polemic had to come in here and show that the gratia virtutum et
   donorum as gratia fidei is the only grace, and that the sacramental
   grace in every sense is nothing but the manifestation of the gratia
   virtutum et donorum, or, say, of the general and only grace. Of this
   latter it is said (l.c.), "gratia secundum se considerata perficit
   essentiam animæ in quantum participat quandam similitudinem divini
   esse'; et sicut ab essentia animæ fluunt ejus potentiæ, ita a gratia
   fluunt quædam perfectiones ad potentias animæ, quæ dicuntur virtutes et
   dona, quibus potentiæ perficiuntur in ordine ad suos actus." But also:
   "Ordinantur autem sacramenta ad quosdam speciales effectus necessarios
   in vita Christiana."

   [368] I have quoted the whole passage, because it shows more clearly
   than any other that the Catholic doctrine of the Sacraments is at
   bottom nothing but a reduplication of the redemption by Christ, or, to
   put it otherwise, a second structure above the first, by which the
   first is crushed to the ground. As grace was conceived of physically,
   but this physical grace could not be directly connected with the death
   of Christ or derived from it, it was necessary to associate with God
   the Redeemer, besides the instrumentum conjunctum (the God-man Jesus),
   still another instrumentum separatum (the Sacraments). If on the other
   hand the life and death of Christ can be so understood that these
   themselves are seen to be the grace and the Sacrament, the
   reduplication is useless. This is the evangelical Protestant point of
   view; at least it ought to be. Of course it is then no longer possible
   to conceive of grace physically; for in that case the Catholic doctrine
   of the Sacraments must again return, which is, how-ever, a pure
   invention of men, and has nothing to support it in the gospel history.
   This holds true notwithstanding the institution of the Supper by Jesus;
   for where is it found written that the consecrated elements "causant et
   continent gratiam ex opere operato"?

   [369] Q. 64.

   [370] If the necessaria in sacramentis are all to be traced to Christ
   the institutor, then the Bible is not enough; tradition must be
   appealed to; but where is then the limit?

   [371] More precisely: "Quando aliquid se habet ad multa, oportet quod
   per aliquid determinetur ad unum, si illud effici debeat. Ea vero quæ
   in sacramentis aguntur possunt diversimode agi, sicut ablutio aquæ quæ
   fit in baptismo potest ordinari ad munditiam corporalem et ad ludum et
   ad multa alia hujusmodi. Et idea oportet ut determinetur ad unum, i.e.,
   ad sacramentalem effectum per intentionem abluentis. Et hæc intentio
   exprimitur per verba quæ in sacramentis dicuntur, puta cum dicit: Ego
   te baptizo in nomine," etc. An instrumentum inanimatum receives "loco
   intentionis motum a quo movetur," but an instrumentum animatum must
   have the intentio, scil. "faciendi quod facit Christus et ecclesia."
   But Thomas now places himself more decidedly on the side of the lax,
   i.e., he disputes the position that a mentalis intentio is necessary.
   What is enough, rather, as the minister acts in loco totius ecclesiæ,
   is the intention of the Church as actually expressed in the sacramental
   words which he speaks, "nisi contrarium exterius exprimatur ex parte
   ministri vel recipientis sacramentum.

   [372] Hence the 13th Art. of the Augustana; "Damnant illos, qui docent,
   quod sacramenta ex opere operato justificent, nec docent fidem requiri
   in usu sacramentorum, quæ credit remitti peccata."

   [373] Yet Scotus himself stands very near Thomas in the doctrine of the
   Sacraments.

   [374] On his want of logical thoroughness, see Hahn, p. 155.

   [375] See Hahn, p. 158 ff.

   [376] See Hahn, p. 163 f. By conveying the potestas excellentiæ to the
   apostles, Christ empowered them to institute Sacraments.

   [377] See Hahn, p. 392 ff.

   [378] What takes place, therefore, is only that the Sacrament is
   observed as an external adorning of the soul (the unbeliever receives a
   character, enjoys the body of the Lord, stands in an indissoluble
   marriage bond, etc.), while the gracious eject is not wrought. But this
   last at once follows subsequently, if the " indisposition" gives way.

   [379] In its application to the Sacrament the expression "ex opere
   operato" itself passed through a history which is too extensive to
   follow out here; see Schätzler, Die L. v. d. Wirks. d. Sacr. ex opere
   operato, 1860. The assertion is certainly false that the expression
   only denotes that the Sacraments are effectual on account of the work
   accomplished by Christ, or that Christ works in them, that is, it is an
   apologetic novelty of Möhler, or, say, of some theologians already in
   the sixteenth century. The leading thought of Scholasticism was rather
   this, that the Sacrament itself is the opus operatum, and starting from
   this point it proceeded to call the outer act opus operatum, the inner
   disposition opus operans.

   [380] Hahn (p. 401 f.) names as representatives of this view Robert
   Pulleyn, William of Auxerre, and John Wessel, and, as holding this view
   as regards at least the Sacrament of Penance, a large number of
   theologians, among whom the Lombard, Alexander of Hales, Bonaventura,
   and Henry of Ghent are mentioned, These men really taught that where
   there is true contritio, absolution comes directly from God, not
   through the Sacrament of Penance only, which in this case only
   declares. Karl Müller (Der Umschwung in der Lehre von der Busse während
   des 12. Jahrh. in the Abhandl. f. Weizsäcker, 1892, p. 287 ff.) has
   shown that this view runs back to Abelard. He regards it as something
   new, and if applied to the common reigning practice, it would certainly
   have been something new. But there was no kind of change in this
   practice contemplated by it, and it was only a sign that theology again
   grappled with the question, and felt itself unable simply to justify
   theoretically the conception that prevailed in practice of sacrament
   and priest. It went back, therefore, at this point to ideas of the
   early Church, or to ideas that were Augustinian and more spiritual
   (Müller seems to me to overlook this, see further details below).
   Alexander of Hales (Summa IV., Q. 14, M. 2, Art. 1, § 3) writes:
   "Duplex est pænitentia; quædam quæ solummodo consistit in contritione,
   quædam quæ consistit in contritione, confessione, satisfactione;
   utraque est sacramentum. Sed primo modo sumpta non est sacramentum
   ecclesiæ, sed secundo modo. Sacramentum pænitentiæ est signum et causa
   et quantum ad deletionem culpæ et quantum ad deletionem poenæ.
   Contritio enim est signum et causa remissionis peccati et quantum ad
   culpam et quantum ad poenam" (the adding of the remission of temporal
   penalties for sin takes place, however, only through the priestly
   sacrament). With this view of repentance, as is well known, the
   Reformation formed a connection. That fides and sacramentum are
   exclusively essential to each other in the case of all Sacraments was
   emphasised by Robert Pulleyn and Wessel (the former, Sentent. I., octo
   P. V., c. 13: "quod fides facit, baptismus ostendit; fides peccata
   delet, baptismus deleta docet, unde sacramentum dicitur." VI. 61:
   "Absolutio, quæ peracta confessione super pænitentem a sacerdote fit,
   sacramentum est, quoniam rei sacræ signum est. Et cujus sacræ rei est
   signum, nisi remissionis et absolutionis? Nimirum confitentibus a
   sacerdote facta a peccatis absolutio remissionem peccatorum, quam antea
   peperit cordis contritio, designat. A peccatis ergo presbyter solvit,
   non utique quod peccata dimittat, sed quod dimissa sacramento pandat."
   The latter, de comnuin. sanct. [edit. Groning, 1614], p. 817: "Effectus
   sacramentorum sunt secundum dispositionem suscipientis et secundum
   requisitam illi intentioni dispositionem. . . . Dispositio vero
   requisita huic sacramento, ut efficax fiat, est fames et sitis hujus
   vivifici cibi et potus. Unde quanto minus eum esurit et sitit, pro
   tanto minorem etiam effectum consequitur." 818: "Semper sacramenta
   fidei sunt instrumenta, tanto semper efficacia, quanto est fides
   negotiosa"). But in view of these valuable sentences, we must remember,
   as has been remarked above, that to closer inspection a mysterious
   gratia is placed behind and above the fides, which lowers the fides to
   a means.

   [381] The Greek Scholasticism also knows of the obex. Antonius Melissa
   quotes in the Loci Comm. (Migne, Bd. 136, col. 823), sermo 16, the
   saying of a certain Theotimus: eoiken he hamartia parakolumati,
   koluonti ten eunoian tou theou en hemin genesthai.

   [382] In Sentent. IV., Dist. 4, Q. 3, Art. 2: "Indispositus reputatur
   et qui non credi et qui indevotus accedit . . . in sacramentis præcipue
   fides operatur æ ideo defectus fidei specialius pertinet ad fictionem."

   [383] Scotus, in Sent. IV., Dist. 1, Q. 6: "Sacramentum ex virtute
   operis operati confert gratiam, ita quod non requiritur ibi bonus motus
   interior qui mereatur gratiam, sed sufficit quod suscipiens non ponat
   obicem."

   [384] Scotus was the first to direct his attention to this very
   correctly observed character of the commoner type of humanity, and
   began to use it in the way indicated for the doctrine of salvation; see
   Hahn, p. 413 f.

   [385] Or: "Attritus accedit ad confessionem, ex quo ibi fit contritus,
   unde fugatur fictio. Et sic non habet dubium, quia et sacramentum
   suscipit et effectum ejus scil. remissionem peccatorum." Numerous
   passages in Hahn, l.c. From this point of view, indeed, the mere
   purpose to partake of the Sacrament, or the partaking per se, might
   come to be regarded as something initially meritorious, and this step
   was really already taken from the time of the Lombard, the view
   becoming quite widely prevalent. Nay, as if the conscience and the
   plain understanding reacted against the sacramental magic, the Lombard
   declares that the humiliatio before the sensible materials in the
   Sacrament establishes merit (Sentent. IV., Dist. 1 C.): "propter
   humiliationem quidem, ut dum homo sensibilibus rebus, quæ natura infra
   ipsum sunt, ex præcepto creatoris se reverendo subicit, ex hac
   humilitate et obedientia deo magis placeat et apud eum mereatur."

   [386] Apol. Confess. Aug. 13: "Hic damnamus totum populum
   scholasticorum doctorum, qui docent, quod sacramenta non ponenti obicem
   conferant gratiam ex opere operato sine bono motu utentis. Hæc
   simpliciter judaica opinio est sentire quod per ceremoniam
   justificemur, sine bono motu cordis, hoc est, sine fide. Et tamen hæc
   impia et perniciosa opinio magna auctoritate docetur in toto regno
   pontificio."

   [387] On Duns Scotus' doctrine of the Sacraments see Werner, Scotus
   (1881), pp. 462-496; on the doctrine of Post-Scotist Scholasticism see
   the same author, Die Nachscotistische Scholastik (1883), p. 380 ff. As
   specially important characteristics of the Scotist doctrine of the
   Sacraments note the following: (1) the rejection of the inner necessity
   of the Sacraments, since God can grant the saving grace even without
   the employment of these outward signs (all the more firmly is the outer
   necessity maintained, on the ground of the positive divine
   appointment); (2) the rejection of an influence of a naturally
   necessary kind in the media of sacramental grace; (3) the strong
   emphasising of the Sacraments as notæ ecclesiæ; (4) the assertion that
   since the Fall there have been Sacraments effectual ex opere operato;
   (5) the rejection of the virtus supernaturalis in the Sacraments; (6)
   the rejection of the position, that the intellect is the vehicle of the
   sacramental character; (7) the assertion that only from the positive
   appointment of God is it to be concluded that baptism cannot be
   repeated; (8) the assertion, that the reatus culpæ after the act of sin
   is no reatio realis, i.e., that there remains nothing in the soul of
   the effect of sin, which would again be sin; for the habitus vitiosus
   is not sin, seeing that it remains even in the justified; hence there
   stands nothing that is a link between the sinful act and the obligatio
   ad poenam; the latter, therefore, is only a relatio rationis of the
   divine intellect or will, which has its ground in the "ordering will"
   of God; in accordance with this the view of the Sacrament of Penance is
   formed. Occam emptied the Sacraments of every kind of inner and
   speculative import; they have simply an importance because God has so
   ordained them; but we do not know why. Here also the position of things
   was such that as soon as the authority of the Church disappeared, there
   was necessarily a falling away, not only of the doctrine of the
   Sacraments in every sense -- that was no misfortune -- but also of
   every doctrine of grace; for no one had taken the precaution to secure
   that the latter should be able to exist independently of the
   Sacraments.

   [388] See the detailed exposition in Thomas, P. III., Q. 66-71.
   Schwane, pp. 605-622.

   [389] According to the general view (something similar already in
   Ignatius of Antioch) Christ, at His own baptism, imparted to the water
   consecration and power. Hence the water needs no special consecration,
   as the material does in the other Sacraments.

   [390] According to the Scholastic view, which, however, was not shared
   by all, an abolition of sin is in itself possible without infusion of
   saving grace (so Thomas).

   [391] Gabriel Biel (according to Hahn, p. 334): "Licet gratia
   baptismalis sit incipientium et ita imperfecta quantum ad habilitandum
   ad bonum, tamen quantum ad liberandum a malo habet vim gratiæ
   perfectissimæ . . . restituit perfectam innocentiam."

   [392] On the other hand: "baptismus non est institutus ad delendum
   omnia peccata futura, sed tamen præterita et præsentia." Hence the
   rule: "baptismus delet quidquid invenit." This reluctance to relate the
   sin-cancelling grace of baptism to the future, had originally sprung
   from regard for the interests of human freedom and for the serious
   nature of Christian morality. But in the Scholastic period what is
   aimed at mainly is to protect the Church Sacrament of Penance.

   [393] Lombard, Sentent. II., Dist. 32, A. B.: "Licet remaneat
   concupiscentia post baptismum, non tamen dominatur et regnat sicut
   ante, immo per gratiam baptismi mitigatur et minuitur, ut post dominari
   non valeat, nisi quis reddat vires hosti eundo post concupiscentias.
   Nec post baptismum remanet ad reatum, quia non imputatur in peccatum,
   sed tantum poena peccati est, ante baptismum vero poena est et
   culpa. . . . Per gratiam baptismi vitium concupiscentiæ debilitatur
   atque extenuatur, ita ut jam non regnet, nisi consensu reddantur ei
   vires, et quia reatus ipsius solvitur." Thomas defines the fomes (after
   the Fall) in the 27 Q., P. III., as "rebellio inferiorum virium ad
   rationem," or as "inordinata concupiscentia sensibilis appetitus"; but
   by grace it is weakened and loses the reatus. What was still thought of
   even then (see Augustine) was almost exclusively the sexual impulse and
   generation. Therefore there can be no thought of removing the
   concupiscence, and Thomas asserts: "baptismus non aufert actu
   infectionem, prout afficit personam, quod patet ex hoc, quod baptizatus
   per actum naturæ originale transmittit in prolem." He says also, P.
   II., 1, Q. 74, Art. 3: "Transit peccatum originale reatu et remanet
   actu (this is not so strongly expressed afterwards). Sed talis
   corruptio fomitis non impedit, quin homo rationabili voluntate possit
   reprimere singulos motus inordinatos sensualitatis, si præsentiat, puta
   divertendo cogitationem ad alia."

   [394] See note 4 on p. 227.

   [395] As a rule, no doubt, with the addition, that the habitus ligatus
   est propter pueritiam, but that as truly is it perfectly imparted as
   the sleeping man is a living man. So already Thomas. At the Council of
   Vienna in 1311, the view was declared the sententia probabilior and
   sanctioned, that baptism is the cause in the case of parvuli, both of
   the remissio culpæ and of the collatio gratiæ (quoad habitum, etsi non
   pro illo tempore quoad usum), i.e., that it communicates the gratia
   informans et virtutes (Mansi XXV., p. 411).

   [396] Lombardus, IV., Dist. 4 H.: "de adultis, qui digne recipiunt
   sacramentum, non ambigitur quin gratiam operantem et cooperantern
   perceperint . . . de parvulis vero, qui nondum ratione utuntur, quæstio
   est, an in baptismo receperint gratiam qua ad majorem venientes ætatem
   possent velle et operari bonum? Videtur, quod non receperint, quia
   gratia illa caritas est et fides, quæ voluntatem præparat et adjuvat.
   Sed quis dixerit, eos accepisse fidem et caritatem!"

   [397] Following Augustine, Thomas III., Q. 68, Art. 9: the parvuli sunt
   in utero matris ecclesiæ and are thus nourished.

   [398] Here there were great controversies, which will be briefly dealt
   with afterwards.

   [399] Thomas, P. III., Q. 66, Art. 6, declares (against Hugo) that
   baptism in the name of Christ alone is invalid; yet the Apostles
   allowed themselves such baptism.

   [400] See Schanz, Die Wirksamkeit der Sacramentalien, Tüb., Theol.
   Quartalschr. 1886, Part. 4.

   [401] See the polemic against the Catharists (Moneta), Petrobrusiani,
   etc.

   [402] Thomas, P. III., Q. 72, Schwane, pp. 622-627.

   [403] Because only the Apostles had the power to impart the Holy Spirit
   by laying on of hands.

   [404] Not only its presupposition, "sed est majoris necessitatis,"
   Thomas, 1.c., Art. 12. With regard to the presupposition it is said in
   Art. 6: "si aliquis non baptizatus confirmaretur, nihil reciperet."

   [405] "Robur," or "potestas ad pugnam spiritalem," is the chief
   conception; baptism distinguishes believers from unbelievers,
   confirmation the newly-born from the mature. At the same time Thomas
   (Art. 7) sought to introduce confirmation into the process of
   justification, in which, certainly, he had poor enough success: "datur
   baptisato spiritus sanctus ad robur . . . missio seu datio spiritus s.
   non est nisi cum gratia gratum faciente. Unde manifestum est, quod
   gratia gratum faciens confertur in hoc sacramento . . . gratiæ gratum
   facientis primus effectus est remissio culpæ, habet tamen et alios
   effectus quia sufficit ad hoc quod promoveat hominem per omnes gradus
   usque in vitam æternam . . . et ideo gratia gratum faciens non solum
   datur ad remissionem culpæ, sed etiam ad augmentum et firmamentum
   justitiæ, et sic confertur in hoc sacramento." But any number of
   Sacraments might then be forced in! See the summing up of the chief
   deliverances on the Sacrament by Eugene IV. (l.c., p. 1055), where it
   is said of the effect: "datur S. S. ad robur, ut vid. Christianus
   audacter Christi confiteatur nomen." The Pope will have it, besides,
   that per apostolicæ sedis dispensationem even ordinary priests have
   celebrated the Sacrament, yet only with oil which a bishop had
   consecrated. This continued afterwards to be the Catholic view, or,
   say, practice. This special linking of confirmation to the power of the
   Pope goes back to Thomas. He framed the theory, fraught with large
   consequences, that the Sacraments of the Eucharist and of ordination
   relate to the true body of Christ, the others to the mystical (the
   Church). Hence in the celebration of the latter five Sacraments there
   is to be taken into account, besides the potestas ministerii in
   general, the power of jurisdiction (in the case of one in a higher, in
   the case of another in a lower degree) belonging to the Church, that
   is, the Pope. In consequence of this he has the right, in the case of
   confirmation, to depute ordinary priests; in Sentent. IV., Dist. 7, Q.
   3, A. 1: "Sciendum est, quod cum episcopatus non addat aliquid supra
   sacerdotium per relationem ad corpus domini verum, sed solum per
   relationem ad corpus mysticum, papa per hoc quod est episcoporum summus
   non dicitur habere plenitudinem potestatis per relationem ad corpus
   domini verum, sed per relationem ad corpus mysticum. Et quia gratia
   sacramentalis descendit in corpus mysticum a capite, ideo omnis
   operatio in corpus mysticum sacramentalis, per quam gratia datur,
   dependet ab operatione sacramentali super corpus domini verum, et ideo
   solus sacerdos potest absolvere in loco pænitentiali et baptizare ex
   officio. Et ideo dicendum, quod promovere ad illas perfectiones, quæ
   non respiciunt corpus domini verum, sed solum corpus mysticum, potest a
   papa qui habet plenitudinem pontificialis potestatis committi
   sacerdoti."

   [406] Thomas, l.c., Art. 12.

   [407] A passage from Pseudo-Isidore (ep. episc. Melchiadis) played an
   important part, as also the Pseudo-Dionysius.

   [408] Thomas, 1.c.

   [409] Its institution by Christ, first asserted by Albertus, even
   Thomas has only "proved" by declaring that Christ instituted the
   Sacrament, John XVI. 7, "promittendo."

   [410] Thomas, P. III., Q. 73-83; Schwane, pp. 628-661; Article,
   "Transubstantiation," by Steitz-Hauck, Real-Encyclopädie, vol. 152, pp.
   803 ff., 815 ff. (a very thorough-going account).

   [411] Baur points out very correctly (Vorles, II., p. 475) that Thomas
   tries to prove that Christianity without transubstantiation is not the
   absolute religion.

   [412] Only the fact of the conversio was a certainty for the Lombard,
   not the modus; see Sentent. IV., Dist. 11 A.: "Si quæritur, qualis sit
   ista conversio, an formalis an substantialis vel alterius generis,
   definire non sufficio; formalem tamen non esse cognosco, quia species
   rerum quæ ante fuerant, remanent, et sapor et pondus. Quibusdam videtur
   esse substantialis, dicentibus sic substantiam converti in substantiam,
   ut hæc essentialiter fiat illa." Yet that is at bottom the opinion of
   the Lombard also, for he unequivocally teaches (Dist. 12 A.) that after
   the transformation the accidents are "sine subjecto." In the doctrine
   of the Mass the Lombard had not yet reached the height of Realism;
   ideas of the ancient Church still exercised their influence on him; see
   Sentent. IV., Dist. 12 F.: "Quæritur, si quod gerit sacerdos proprie
   dicatur sacrificium vel immolatio, et si Christus quotidie immolatur
   vel semel tantum immolatus sit? Ad hoc breviter dici potest, illud quod
   offertur et consecratur a sacerdote vocari sacrificium et oblationem,
   quia memoria est et repræsentatio sacrificii veri et sanctæ
   immolationis factæ in ara crucis. Et semel Christus mortuus est in
   cruce, ibique immolatus est in semetipso, quotidie autem immolatur in
   sacramento, quia in sacramento recordatio, fit illius quod factum est
   semel."

   [413] On the effect of the Eucharist, see Thomas, Q. 79. In the first
   Art. he shows that it conveys grace; in the second that it gives aid
   for eternal life; in the third that it does not blot out mortal sins,
   seeing that it is given to the spiritually alive, though under certain
   circumstances it removes an unconscious mortal sin; in the fourth that
   it blots out the peccata venalia; in the fifth that it does not cancel
   the penalty of sin entirely, but only "secundum quantitatem devotionis
   sumentium"; in the sixth that it guards men against future
   transgressions; in the seventh that as a Sacrament it profits only the
   receivers, but as a sacrificium the spectators also: "In quantum in hoc
   sacramento repræsentatur passio Christi, qua Christus obtulit se
   hostiam deo, habet rationem sacrificii, in quantum vero in hoc
   sacramento traditur invisibilis gratia sub visibili specie, habet
   rationem sacramenti . . . hoc sacrificium, quod est memoriale dominicæ
   passionis, non habet effectum nisi in illis qui conjunguntur huic
   sacramento per fidem et caritatem. Unde et in Canone Missæ non oratur
   pro his qui sunt extra ecclesiam; illis tamen prodest plus vel minus
   secundum modum devotionis eorum." So the Mass profits only those who
   already have fides and caritas, as securing for them an augmentum
   fidei, or a remission of penalty, and always according to the measure
   of their desert. The Eucharist is the Sacrament and sacrifice which
   accompanies the process of justification, so far as that process has
   already begun and is disturbed by no mortal sin, and which carries the
   process to its higher stages.

   [414] Controversy with the Greeks about leavened bread.

   [415] Mixing with water is the rule.

   [416] Thomas, Q. 74, Art. 1.

   [417] Q. 78, Art. 1.

   [418] Thomas, in Sentent. IV., Dist. 8, Q. 2, Art. 3: "In verbis
   prædictis sicut et in aliis formis sacramentorum est aliqua virtus a
   deo, sed haæc virtus non est qualitas habens esse completum in natura
   . . . sed habet esse incompletum, sicut virtus quæ est in instrumento
   ex intentione principalis agentis."

   [419] There was in possession no traditional doctrine whatever on this
   point; indeed, a proof for the fact itself of transubstantiation could
   not be derived from earlier times. Special appeal was made to
   Pseudo-Ambrosius.

   [420] Sentent. IV., Dist. 12 A.: "Si vero quæritur de accidentibus, quæ
   remanent, scil. de speciebus et de sapore et pondere, in quo subjecto
   fundantur, potius mihi videtur fatendum existere sine subjecto, quam
   esse in subjecto, quia ibi non est substantia nisi corporis et
   sanguinis dominici, quæ non afficitur illis accidentibus. Non enim
   corpus Christi talem in se habet formam, sed qualis in judicio
   apparebit. Remanent ergo illa accidentia per se subsistentia ad
   mysterii ritum, ad gustus fideique suffragium, quibus corpus Christi
   habens formam et naturam suam tegitur."

   [421] Summa IV., Q. 38, 40.

   [422] It is an opinion peculiar to Bonaventura, that the substance of
   the bread would return if the accidents were destroyed.

   [423] Thomas III., Q. 77. In the first Article the question is
   discussed: "Utrum accidentia quæ remanent, sint sine subjecto"; it is
   answered in the affirmative, since they cannot become accidents of the
   body of Christ. In the second Article it is asked: "utrum quantitas
   dimensiva sit subjectum aliorum accidentum," etc., etc. Here already
   the logical investigations into space begin.

   [424] Summa P. III., Q. 75, Art. 6: "Forma substantialis panis non
   remanet" (which is elaborately proved). Yet the breaking relates, not
   to the body of Christ, but to the species sacramentalis ("corpus
   Christi non frangitur"); see Q. 77, Art. 7.

   [425] Even animals, according to Thomas, enjoy the body of the Lord (Q.
   80, Art. 3). Bonaventura is in favour of the opinio honestior that this
   does not happen.

   [426] Q. 76, Art. 3-6.

   [427] John of Paris (de modo existendi corpus Christi, etc., printed in
   London, 1686) declared that the interpretation of the real presence as
   conversio did not come within his faith, but that he was prepared to
   retract, if it was proved to him that the Church (the Pope) had defined
   it. After then rejecting the Berengarian doctrine, as not leading to
   communicatio idiomatum of bread and of body, he holds the following
   view as free from objection (p. 86): "ut substantia panis maneat sub
   accidentibus suis non in proprie supposito, sed tracta ad esse et
   suppositum Christi, ut sic sit unum suppositum in duabus naturis." As
   Münscher (p. 257) has correctly explained, the idea here is this, that
   the bread and the body of Christ become united into one substance, in
   virtue of a common likeness of their qualities, similar to that which
   it was believed must be assumed in the conjoining of the two natures in
   Christ in the unity of one person. It may be said, therefore, that the
   orthodox Catholic view of the Supper is Monophysite; the Berengarian,
   Nestorian; and that of John of Paris, Chalcedonian. Even Occam declared
   that there is nothing in Scripture on the question that the substance
   of the bread does not remain (de sacram. alt. 5), and with regard to
   the view of the real presence, according to which "corpus Christi in
   eodem loco cum substantia panis et vini manet," he says that it is
   "multum rationalis, nisi esset determinatio ecclesiæ in contrarium,
   quia salvat et vitat omnes difficultates quæ sequuntur ex separatione
   accidentium a subjecto" (for this contradicts the Nominalist theory of
   knowledge). But he falls back ultimately on the wish that the doctrine
   of the conversio may he revealed to the Church.

   [428] Trial. IV. 2: "Inter omnes hæreses, quæ unquam in ecclesia
   pullularunt, nunquam considero aliquam plus callide per hypocritas
   introductam et multiplicius populum defraudantem, nam spoliat populum,
   facit ipsum committere idololatriam, negat fidem scripturæ et per
   consequens ex infidelitate multipliciter ad iracundiam provocat
   veritatem." In c. 4 he then works out the view that panis and body of
   Christ are at the same time present. Yet he scouts the idea that any
   kind of priest -- even a sinful one therefore -- can produce Christ.
   The doctrine of impanation receives from him a spiritual turn, though
   this has not the effect of entirely cancelling it. Against the coarse
   form of this doctrine he waged war, and came close to Berengar.

   [429] In his treatise de corpore Christi, written during imprisonment,
   Huss assents to transubstantiation. But from his other writings we must
   assume that he was not of the opinion that a sinful priest can effect
   it (see above his conception of the Church, p. 143).

   [430] Wesel was an adherent of the impanation doctrine.

   [431] The decree as to the Lord's Supper in the Bull of Eugene IV.
   "Exultate deo" runs: "Tertium est eucharistiæ sacramentum, cujus
   materia est panis triticeus et vinum de vite, cui ante consecrationem
   aqua modicissima admisceri debet (there follows an elaborate
   justification of this mixing in opposition to the Armenian practice).
   Forma hujus sacramenti sunt verba salvatoris, quibus hoc conficit
   sacramentum. Nam ipsorum verborum virtute substantia panis in corpus
   Christi et substantia vini in sanguinem convertuntur, ita tamen, quod
   totus Christus continetur sub specie panis et totus sub specie vini.
   Sub qualibet quoque parte hostiæ consecratæ et vini consecrati,
   separatione facta, totus est Christus. Hujus sacramenti effectus, quem
   in anima operatur digne sumentis, est adunatio hominis ad Christum. Et
   quia per gratiam homo Christo incorporatur et membris ejus unitur,
   consequens est, quod per hoc sacramentum in sumentibus digne gratia
   augeatur, omnemque effectum, quem materialis cibus et potus quoad vitam
   agunt corporalem sustentando, augendo, reparando et delectando,
   sacramentum hoc quoad vitam operatur spiritualem, in quo, ut inquit
   Urbanus Papa, gratam salvatoris nostri recensemus memoriam, a malo
   retrahimur, confortamur in bono et ad virtutum et gratiarum proficimus
   incrementum."

   [432] This certainly had also other grounds; but one ground lay in the
   extravagant ideas of the content of the Sacrament.

   [433] P. III., Q. 76, Arts. 1 and 2.

   [434] Thomas, P. III., Q. 80, Art. 12: The priest must enjoy the
   sacramentum perfectum, since he celebrates it; the custom of some
   Churches is to be approved (Thomas still expresses himself cautiously)
   of withholding the cup from incautious laymen. Thereafter there was a
   rapid advance made in practice; the history of this process, and of the
   opposition to it, is not relevant here, as a dogma was not involved.

   [435] Q. 76, Art. 6: "Corpus Christi manet, quousque species
   sacramentales manent."

   [436] Chap. I.

   [437] For the Eucharist as a repetition of the sacrificial death of
   Christ, there could be produced from tradition only a bad, and, to some
   extent, a forged proof. Thomas treats the question in Q. 83, Art. 1.
   According to his custom he raises at the outset three objections, and
   they are very telling, against the position that Christ is offered in
   this Sacrament. He appeals, first, to the passage in Hebrews about the
   being once offered; secondly, to the circumstance that in the Mass
   Christ is not crucified; thirdly, to the Augustinian position, that in
   the sacrifice of Christ "idem est sacerdos et hostia," which does not
   apply in the case of the Mass. But he then explains that (1) the one
   sacrifice is not touched by the repetition, for in the repetition it
   remains always the same; (2) that the altar is repræsentativum crucis;
   and (3) that the priest "gerit imaginem Christi," and hence it holds
   good even for the sacrifice of the mass, that "quodammodo idem est
   sacerdos et hostia." The positive exposition is extremely weak, even
   when we adopt Thomas's standpoint, and shows plainly that at bottom the
   repetition of the sacrificial death of Christ could not in any way be
   theoretically justified. But it stands here as it does with the
   doctrine of the Church. The practice justifies itself by its existence!
   What Thomas has submitted is as follows: -- "Duplici ratione celebratio
   hujus sacramenti dicitur immolatio Christi. Primo quidem quia, sicut
   dicit Augustinus ad Simplic. solent imagines earum rerum nominibus
   appellari, quarum imagines sunt . . . celebratio autem hujus
   sacramenti, sicut supra dictum est (Q. 79, Art. 1. 3), imago quædam est
   representativa passionis Christi quæ est vera ejus immolatio. Et ideo
   celebratio hujus sacramenti dicitur Christi immolatio (here, therefore,
   there is an expression only of symbol and remembrance). Alio modo
   quantum ad effectum passionis Christi, quia scil. per hoc sacramentum
   participes efficimur fructus dominicæ passionis, unde in quadam
   dominicali oratione secreta dicitur: Quoties hujus hostiæ commemoratio
   celebratur, opus nostræ redemptionis exercetur. Quantum igitur ad
   primum modum poterat dici Christus immolari etiam in figuris Veteris
   Testamenti . . . sed quantum ad secundum modum proprium est huic
   sacramento, quod in ejus celebratione Christus immolatur." One easily
   sees that there is not the smallest degree of proof given for the
   repetition of the sacrificial death of Christ. Even in other passages
   in which Thomas speaks of the Eucharist as a sacrifice, I have found
   nothing more than bare assertions, and sometimes an entire uncertainty
   as to the relation of the Eucharistic to the true sacrifice. How weak
   the position is, too, with regard to the effect of this sacrifice, is
   shown by Q. 79, Art. 5: "Sacramentum effectum sacrificii in eo qui
   offert habet vel in his, pro quibus offertur." It is really instituted
   as a sacrament; for "non est institutum ad satisfaciendum, sed ad
   spiritualiter nutriendum per unionem ad Christum," but "per
   concomitantiam" a certain remission of penalty also is effected. "In
   quantum est sacrificium, habet vim satisfactivam, sed in satisfactione
   magis attenditur affectus offerentis quam quantitas oblationis. Quamvis
   ergo hæc oblatio ex sui quantitate sufficiat ad satisfaciendum pro omni
   poena, tamen sit satisfactoria illis, pro quibus offertur vel etiam
   offerentibus, secundum quantitatem suæ devotionis et non pro tota
   poena." It must by no means be regarded as an accident that Thomas has
   not repeated the audacious propositions of Hugo and Albertus (the
   Father first offered the Son for us, we then offer Him for the Father).
   Thomas has only allowed the term vera immolatio to stand, because he
   held that the "Church" taught it. In the Bull of Eugene IV., moreover
   (see above), there is no mention of a repetition.

   [438] Thomas, Summa, P. III. Q. 84-90, Suppl. Q. 1-28. Schwane, p. 661,
   ff. Steitz das römische Busssacrament, 1854.

   [439] Herrmann remarks correctly (Ztschr. f. Theol. u. Kirche 1 vol.,
   p. 30): "In the Romish institution of penance the question is not about
   the way in which the Christian attains to renewal of mind, but about
   providing security for the Christian as he is.

   [440] Karl Müller, in the dissertation referred to above (p. 222), sees
   in this rather something new. Certainly this thought was for a long
   time not expressed, because there was entirely wanting a "theologian of
   penance"; but neither had the prevailing sacramental priestly practice
   any normal theologian. In my opinion it was a novelty in theology, when
   Hugo of St. Victor (see Müller, p. 218 f.) declared that man can only
   be freed from the sentence of eternal damnation by priestly absolution,
   that this absolution is perfectly real, and that "sententiam Petri non
   præcedit, sed subsequitur sententia coeli." In opposition to this,
   Abelard, and all those who, following in his steps (see Müller, p. 308
   ff.), emphasised the contritio, and regarded God as the judex, the
   priest as the declarator, appear to me to have reproduced an old
   ecclesiastical thought, which is parallel to the Augustinian "Crede et
   manducasti," and coincides with the very early idea that sins against
   God are only forgiven by God. That -- as the practice of penance, as
   regards the satisfactions, had become quite different from what it was
   in the ancient Church -- the distinctions of Abelard and his disciples
   with respect to this were new, is certain.

   [441] De sacram. II. 1. 14. Moreover, Hugo certainly then makes other
   conditions still as regards the certainty and sovereignty of the
   priestly forgiveness of sin with respect to the forgiveness of God.
   That at bottom the Sacraments, as a whole, effect only the possibility
   of salvation -- the cardinal thought that lies concealed under the
   Catholic doctrine of the Sacraments -- is acknowledged by Hugo in the
   following very noteworthy sentence (c. 8): "Ubique magis virtus
   sacramentorum exprimitur, nec quod per ea quilibet participantes
   salvandi sint, sed quod salvari possint, significatur." A pernicious
   influence on the shaping of the new theory and practice of penance was
   exercised by the Pseudo-Augustinian treatise de vera et falsa
   pænitentia (Migne T. 40, col. 1113 sq.), which seems to have appeared
   in the tenth or in the beginning of the eleventh century (see Karl
   Müller, Abhandl. f. Weizsäcker, 1892, p. 292. ff.). Luther had already
   recognised its spuriousness before 1517.

   [442] It has been effectively shown by Müller, that the spiritual view
   of penance goes back to Abelard. He says, "the great innovation"; I
   would say "restoration."

   [443] On this account, therefore, he is in disfavour among modern
   Catholic theologians. Credit is given to him, indeed, for placing
   together the three things, contritio (compunctio) cordis, confessio
   oris, satisfactio operis, but his demanding a perfect contritio
   (caritate perfecta), and his not regarding the priestly absolution as
   absolutely necessary, are held to be grave defects. As a fact, he
   declared the contritio, conjoined with the votum confitendi, to be
   sufficient; this is followed by the divine forgiveness of sins, the
   infusion of grace and the remission of the eternal penalty "ante oris
   confessionem et satisfactionem" (Sentent. IV., 17 A). Hence the
   consequent reckoning of the priestly absolution as a forgiveness merely
   declarative, or as a forgiveness merely ecclesiastical, as
   distinguished from the divine forgiveness, 18 E: "Ecce quam varia a
   doctoribus super his traduntur, et in hac tanta varietate quid tenendum
   sit? Hoc sane dicere ac sentire possumus, quod solus deus peccata
   dimittit et retinet, et tamen ecclesiæ contulit potestatem ligandi et
   solvendi. Sed aliter ipse solvit vel ligat, aliter ecclesia. Ipse enim
   per se tantum ita dimittit peccatum, quia et animam mundat ab interiori
   macula et a debito æternæ mortis solvit." 18 F: "Non autem hoc
   sacerdotibus concessit, quibus tamen tribuit potestatem ligandi et
   solvendi i.e., ostendendi homines ligatos et solutos . . . Quia etsi
   aliquis apud deum sit solutus, non tamen in facie ecclesiæ salutus
   habetur nisi per judicium sacerdotis. In solvendis ergo culpis et
   retinendis ita operatur sarcerdos evangelicus et judicat, sicut olim
   legalis in illis qui contaminati erant lepra quæ peccatum significat."
   In addition to the declaration of forgiveness as an ecclesiastical act
   (for the congregation), the binding and loosing on the part of the
   priests consists, according to the Lombard, simply in this, that they
   impose the works connected with penance, or, abate and remit them.
   Here, therefore, there still exists a complete understanding of the
   distinction between inward forgiveness and ecclesiastical
   reconciliation.

   [444] De pænit. P. II., c. 33, q. 3, dist. 1.

   [445] Hence, also, in the 5th Article the following exposition:
   "Peccatum mortale ex parte conversionis inordinatæ ad bonum commutabile
   quandam dispositionem causat in anima vel etiam habitum, si actus
   frequenter iteretur. Sicut autem dictum est, culpa peccati mortalis
   remittitur, in quantum tollitur per gratiam aversio mentis a deo.
   Sublato autem eo, quod est ex parte aversionis, nihilominus remanere
   potest id quod est ex parte conversionis inordinatæ, cum hanc contingat
   esse sine illa (!), sicut prius dictum est; et ideo nihil prohibet,
   quin remissa culpa remaneant dispositiones ex præcedentibus actibus
   causatæ, quæ dicuntur peccati reliquiæ . . . sicut etiam remanet fomes
   post baptismum."

   [446] Yet there still continued certainly to be a want of logical
   consistency, in so far as many Schoolmen maintained that perfect
   contrition conjoined with the votum sacramenti is immediately followed
   by the forgiveness of sins -- a position which even to-day is still
   valid in the Catholic Church.

   [447] How seriously even the fundamental theory was threatened (though
   that of Thomas continued to be held valid) is shown by the proposals of
   Duns Scotus and Durandus (see Schwane, p. 665) to call the sacrament
   not so much "penance" as "confession." Durandus would only have
   confession and absolution described as material and form of the
   sacrament; for contrition and satisfaction are not parts of the
   Sacrament, but the preparation for the forgiveness of sin (Durandus, in
   Sent. IV., Dist. 16, Q. 1). This proposal is quite logical, but it
   shows very plainly how penitence had become externalised in having
   become a sacrament. It was inevitable that this process of
   externalising should continue.

   [448] See Stückert, Die Katholische Lehre v. d. Reue, 1896.

   [449] Thomas, Summa III., Suppl. Q. 1: contritio in opposition to
   superbia, which is initium omnis peccati. An extremely artificial and
   empty distinction between contritio as virtus and contritio as
   sacramental in Q. 5, Art. I: "Contritio potest dupliciter considerari,
   vel in quantum est pars sacramenti vel in quantum est actus virtutis,
   et utroque modo est causa remissionis peccati, sed diversimode: quia in
   quantum est pars sacramenti primo operatur ad remissionem peccati
   instrumentaliter, sicut et de aliis sacramentis patet; in quantum autem
   est actus virtutis sic est quasi causa materialis remissionis peccati,
   eo quod dispositio est quasi necessitas ad justificationem, dispositio
   autem reducitur ad causant materialem." To the question, why then the
   sacrament is necessary if the contritio is enough, Thomas replies (l.c.
   Art. 1): "Quamvis possit tota poena per contritionem dimitti, tamen
   adhuc necessaria est confessio et satisfactio, tum quia homo non potest
   esse certus de sua contritione, quod fuerit ad totum tollendum
   sufficiens, tum etiam quia confessio et satisfactio sunt in præcepto."

   [450] Summa IV., Q. 59, M. 2, A. 4: "expeditius et melius liberatur
   peccator per sacramentum pænitentiæ quam per pænitentiæ virtutem."

   [451] P. III., Suppl. Q. 1, Art. 2. Without using the word "attritio,"
   he gives already the thing in P. III., Q. 85, Art. 5, where an
   exceedingly important statement of the stages of penance is given,
   which clearly shows the divergence of the Catholic from the evangelical
   view: "De pænitentia loqui possumus dupliciter. Uno modo quantum ad
   habitum. Et sic immediate a deo infunditur sine nobis principaliter
   operantibus . . . alio modo possumus loqui de pænitentia quantum ad
   actus quibus deo operanti in pænitentia cooperamur. Quorum actuum
   primum principium est dei operatio convertentis cor, secundus actus est
   motus fidei, tertius est motus timoris servilis, quo quis timore
   suppliciorum a peccatis retrahitur" (take also: "peccatum prius incipit
   homini displicere [maxime peccatori] propter supplicia, quæ respicit
   timor servilis, quam propter dei offensam vel peccati turpitudinem,
   quod pertinet ad caritatem . . . ipse etiam motus timoris procedit ex
   actu dei convertentis cor"). "Quartus actus est motus spei, quo quis
   sub spe veniæ consequendæ assumit propositum emendandi. Quintus actus
   est motus caritatis, quo alicui peccatum displicet secundum se ipsum et
   non jam propter supplicia" (that is the contritio). "Sextus est motus
   timoris filialis, quo propter reverentiam dei aliquis emendam deo
   voluntarius offert."

   [452] In Sentent. IV., Dist. 17, p. 2, a. 1, q. 4.

   [453] Summa IV., Q. 60, A. 3: "Si autem pænitens præparatus quantum in
   se est accedat ad confessionem attritus, non contritus . . . confessio
   cum subjectione arbitrio sacerdotis et satisfactio pænitentiæ injunctæ
   a sacerdote est signum et causa deletionis culpæ et poenæ, quia sic
   subjiciendo se et satisfaciendo gratiam acquirit."

   [454] See Reportt IV., Dist. 14, Q. 4, schol. 2 (quoted in Schwane, p.
   666): "Dico, quod bonus motus præcedens sacramentum pænitentiæ tantum
   est attritio et dispositio de congruo ad deletionem culpæ et infusionem
   gratiæ, quæ remissio culpæ et collatio gratiæ sunt in virtute
   sacramenti pænitentiæ et non in virtute attritionis tantum, nisi
   dispositive. Sed hæc attritio post collationem gratiæ, quæ confertur in
   susceptione sacramenti, fit contritio formata."

   [455] Sess. XIV. de pænit., c. 4: "attritio peccatorum ad dei gratiam
   in sacramento pænitentiæ impetrandam disponit." In recent times,
   following Lämmer (Vortrident. Theologie), Bratke (Luther's 95 Thesen
   und ihre dogmenhistor. Voraussetzung, 1884) and Dieckhoff (Der
   Ablasstreit, dogmengesch. dargestellt, 1886) have very fully treated
   the scholastic doctrine of penance in connection with the doctrine of
   indulgences, after a controversy on the doctrine of indulgences had
   broken out, occasioned by the great work of Janssen (see Kolde, Die
   deutsche Augustiner-Congregation u. Johann v. Staupitz, 1879, the same
   author in the ThLZ. 1882, No. 23, and also dissertations by Kawerau,
   Köstlin, Schweitzer and Janssen "An meine Kritiker"). Bratke already
   placed the doctrine of indulgences in a clearer light in opposition to
   Köstlin. But Dieckhof has especially the credit of having traced back
   the theory to the lax view of penance, and of having shown that here
   the seat of the evil must be sought for. There can be no doubt that the
   doctrine of attritio more and more threatened to become the Church's
   chief means of producing ease of mind, and that it actually became such
   subsequently in wide circles (especially through the influence of the
   Jesuit Father Confessors; but also, prior to them, through the
   influence of the preachers of indulgences). Opposition certainly was
   not wanting, and it grew stronger in many circles in the fifteenth
   century (Augustinian-Thomist reaction, see Bratke, p. S9 ff. and
   elsewhere); but when one reads, e.g., the discussions of John of Paltz,
   the senior contemporary and Augustinian brother of Luther (Kolde l.c.),
   one is shocked to see what a withering up of religion and of the
   simplest morality resulted from the "attritio" ("gallows-repentance").
   The priest is here extravagantly dignified (in the book "Coelifodina");
   for he is the most necessary person, because only very few men are
   really contrite; on the other hand, everyone can bring himself in the
   end to an imperfect contrition; and now he, the priest, through the
   sacrament of penance, transforms this imperfect into a perfect sorrow
   ("paucissimi sunt vere contriti, ergo paucissimi salvarentur sine
   sacerdotibus; possunt autem omnes aliquo modo fieri attriti, et tales
   possunt sacerdotes juvare et eorum ministerio facere contritos et per
   consequens possunt eos salvare"). Or -- everything depends on an
   experienced priest; there is nothing lacking to anyone who finds such
   ("non potest esse peccator adeo desperatus, quia posset consequi
   indulgentias, si habuerit intelligentem et fidelem informatorem et
   voluerit facere, quod potest, et habeat attritionem aliqualem, quæ tunc
   in sacramentis sibi succurritur et imperfectum ejus tollitur, et
   informis attritio, i.e., caritate carens formatur per gratiam
   sacramentalem"); see Kolde, pp. 187, 191; Dieckhoff, p. 14; Bratke, pp.
   53 ff., 111 ff., 128 ff. The last-mentioned gives abundant material,
   from which it appears that Paltz by no means stood alone. Everywhere
   the assertion is made that it is easier, under the new covenant, to
   attain salvation on account of the wonderful efficacy of the cross of
   Christ. At the same time it did not fail to be clearly seen that
   attritio is something else than contritio, not merely quantitatively,
   but also qualitatively. Gabriel Biel, who certainly thinks more
   earnestly about contrition than Paltz, knows very well that under some
   circumstances attritio springs from immoral motives, hence is by no
   means a pars contritionis, and is besides, as a rule, a passing mood
   (Bratke, p. 46 f.). Others knew that also, and nevertheless calmly
   built up on this attritio their theories that were to lead to heaven.
   Indeed some actually gave instructions for deluding God in heaven and
   His holy law; entrance into heaven was to be secured by merely guarding
   against mortal sin for one day in the year or for one hour, and showing
   for this space of time aliquam attritionem (see Petrus de Palude in
   Bratke, p. 84 ff., especially p. 87, note 1). Thus the doctrine of
   attritio, which dominates the whole Christian life, is really the
   radical source of mischief in the Catholic system of doctrine; for in
   it both things are at work, the magical, and therefore godless,
   conception of the efficacy of the Sacrament, and the idea, which is no
   longer Pelagian, but is pressed to the point of denial of all that is
   moral, of a " merit" recognised in any kind of motus that is only a
   turning away from sin. In the fourth extra number of the Rom.
   Quartalschr. (1896), p. 122 ff., Finke has attempted to combat the
   exposition given here. One proposition of the first edition I have now
   shaped more precisely. The sentence about the "withering up of religion
   and the simplest morality" I could not change. I would not have written
   it, if it said in a general way (so Finke seems to have misunderstood
   me), that at the end of the fifteenth century religion and the simplest
   morality had become a desolate waste. That was not my thought; I only
   said that where attritionism reigns, as in the case of John of Paltz
   and others, withering up is a necessary result. To deal now with the
   subject itself, Finke asserts (1) that an attritio which has only the
   timor servilis, in which the fixed purpose of thorough repentance is
   not present, was never held to be adequate sorrow. If the "was held" is
   not to have the sense of "was established as an authoritative dogma,"
   or if the notion "adequate sorrow" is not equivocal (attritio is of
   course in itself never "adequate sorrow," but it becomes such through
   the sacrament), then the position is false; cf. Döllinger and Reusch,
   Moralstreitigkeiten (1889), I., p. 69 ff., and many other passages.
   Liguori himself was an attritionist (p. 458 f.); what he requires over
   and above the timor servilis, does not, from the way in which he has
   presented it, possess much weight. Finke asserts (2): "In the practice
   of penance, confession, and preaching, that is, in dealing with the
   Christian people, it was always taught from the seventh century to the
   sixteenth, that contritio is requisite for confession; the conception
   of contritio, which an Isidore presented in the seventh century and a
   Rabanus in the ninth, coincides with that which we meet with in the
   sermons at the close of the Middle Ages." This thesis the author seeks
   to prove by furnishing (we are thankful to him for it) on pages 128-135
   of his dissertation, extracts from sermons at the end of the mediæval
   period, which are intended to show that sorrow springing from fear was
   not regarded as adequate. Certainly, we reply, how often must the words
   have been spoken from the pulpit at that time: "contritio non potest
   esse sine caritate"! But how little is proved by that! We must question
   the preachers of indulgences, and observe the real spirit that was
   awakened by the confessional and by indulgences. What the Reformers
   relate to us in this regard, what we can ourselves discern from the
   decrees of Trent as to the practice disapproved by the Fathers of the
   Council, what breaks out again afterwards as attritionism in spite of
   the Tridentinum, is certainly more important than what was said in
   sermons and general directions as to repentance, which of course urged
   to the utmost endeavour. In sermons it was also said that all good
   works are gifts from God; but did Luther simply misunderstand the
   temper of his Church, when, in looking back to his works as a monk, he
   speaks of his "own works" with a view to sanctification, which he had
   wished to practise in the spirit of the Church? Besides the assertion
   which Finke makes without qualifications, which he has printed in
   italics, and which relates to a thousand years, is itself very
   considerably restricted when he says (p. 123): "The question is as to
   whether attritio was the form of sorrow in the circles of our people,
   and not as to the doctrinal opinions of a Duns Scotus, etc., which
   remained unknown to the people." As developed doctrines of course they
   remained unknown to the people; but were these doctrines really without
   consequences in practice? And why should one make so light of the
   doctrines of the theologians? In view of the worthlessness of attritio
   as timor servilis asserted by Finke, observe what Bellarmin (de poenit.
   II. c. 57) says as to its value. Perrone (de poenit. c. 2, § 91 f.) has
   certainly been somewhat more cautious, inasmuch as he introduces the
   distinction between the timor simpliciter servilis and the worthless
   timor serviliter servilis.

   [456] As the priest, according to Halesius, could still only remit
   temporal penalties and could not forgive sins, even on that account the
   necessity of confession could not be confidently proved yet. Even
   Bonaventura did not trust himself to represent the order to confess as
   originating in the institution and command of Christ.

   [457] "Sicut aliquis per hoc quod baptismum petit se ministris ecclesiæ
   subicit, ad quos pertinet dispensatio sacramenti, ita etiam per hoc
   quod confitetur peccatum suum se ministro ecclesiæ subicit, ut per
   sacramentum pænitentiæ ab eo dispensatum remissionem consequatur, qui
   congruum remedium adhibere non potest, nisi peccatum cognoscat, quod
   fit per confessionem peccantis. Et ideo confessio est de necessitate
   salutis ejus, qui in peccatum actuate mortale cecidit."

   [458] The "positive" law is the decree of the Council of 1215; further,
   every one of course must know himself to be a sinner; still further,
   one must confess in order to come with greater reverence to the
   Eucharist; finally, in order that the shepherd may be able to
   superintend his flock and protect it from the wolf.

   [459] "Sicut non potest dispensari in jure naturali, ita nec in jure
   positivo divino."

   [460] Art. 2: "ad virtutem pertinet, ut aliquis ore confiteatur, quod
   corde tenet."

   [461] Yet such confession is not sacramental in the strict sense.

   [462] As one must disclose to the physician the whole disease, and this
   is the presupposition of being healed, so is it also with confession.
   "Ideo de necessitate confessionis est, quod homo omnia peccata
   confiteatur quæ in memoria habet, quod si non faciat, non est
   confessio, sed confessionis simulatio." Mortal sins that have been
   forgotten must be confessed in the confession that follows. A
   voluminous work on the history of auricular confession has been written
   by Lea, 2 vols. (English), Philadelphia, 1896. I have not yet been able
   to look into it.

   [463] To describe the qualities of confession the scholastic stanza was
   framed (see Art. 4):


   " Sit simplex, humilis confessio, pura, fidelis,

   Atque frequens, nudo, discreta, libens, verecunda,

   Integra, secreta, lacrimabilis, accelerata,

   Fortis et accusans et sit parere parata."

   [464] On the exception, see above.

   [465] Not ex potestate auctoritatis or excellentiæ, but ministerii.

   [466] The most important propositions of Thomas regarding absolution
   are the following: Suppl. Q. 17, Art. 1: "In corporalibus clavis
   dicitur instrumentum, quo ostium aperitur, regni autem ostium nobis per
   peccatum clauditur et quantum ad maculam et quantum ad reatum poenæ, et
   ideo potestas qua tale obstaculum removetur, dicitur clavis. Hæc autem
   potestas est in divina trinitate per auctoritatem, et ideo dicitur a
   quibusdam, quod habeat clavem auctoritatis, sed in Christo homine fuit
   hæc potestas ad removendum prædictum obstaculum per meritum passionis
   quæ etiam dicitur januam aperire. Et ideo dicitur secundum quosdam
   habere clavem excellentiæ. Et quia ex latere Christi dormientis in
   cruce sacramenta fluxerunt, ex quibus ecclesia fabricatur, ideo in
   sacramentis ecclesiæ efficacia passionis manet, et propter hoc etiam
   ministris ecclesiæ, qui sunt dispensatores sacramentorum, potestas
   aliqua ad prædictum obstaculum removendum est collata, non propria, sed
   virtute divina et passionis Christi, et hæc potestas metaphorice clavis
   ecclesiæ dicitur, quæ est clavis ministerii." Especially important is
   Q. 18, Art. 1: "Sacramenta continent ex sanctificatione invisibilem
   gratiam. Sed hujusmodi sanctificatio quandoque ad necessitatem
   sacramenti requiritur tam in materia quam in ministro, sicut patet in
   confirmatione. Quandoque autem de necessitate sacramenti non requiritur
   nisi sanctificatio materiæ, sicut in baptismo, quia non habet ministrum
   determinatum quantum ad sui necessitatem et tunc tota vis sacramentalis
   consistit in materia. Quandoque vero de necessitate sacramenti
   requiritur consecratio vel sanctificatio ministri sine aliqua
   sanctificatione materiæ, et tunc tota vis sacramentalis consistit in
   ministro, sicut est in pænitentia . . . Per pænitentiæ sacramentum
   nunquam datur gratia, nisi præparatio adsit vel prius fuerit. Unde
   virtus clavium operatur ad culpæ remissionem, vel in voto existens, vel
   in actu se exercens . . . sed non agit sicut principate agens, sed
   sicut instrumentum, non quidem pertingens ad ipsam gratiæ susceptionem
   causandam etiam instrumentaliter, sed disponens ad gratiam, per quam
   fit remissio culpæ. Unde solus deus remittit per se culpam et in
   virtute ejus agit . . . sacerdos ut instrumentum animatum . . . ut
   minister. Et sic patet, quod potestas clavium ordinatur aliquo modo ad
   remissionem culpæ non sicut causans, sed sicut disponens ad eam; unde
   si ante absolutionem aliquis non fuisset perfecte dispositus ad gratiam
   suscipiendam, in ipsa confessione et absolutione sacramentali gratiam
   consequeretur, si obicem non poneret." In what follows it is now proved
   that the priestly clavis cannot possibly relate only to the remission
   of penalty ("ut quidam dicunt"). In Art. 2 it is then shown that "ex vi
   clavium non tota poena remittitur, sed aliqiud de poena temporali,
   cujus reatus post absolutionem a poena æterna remanere potuit, nec
   solum de poena quam pænitens habet in confitendo, quia sic confessio et
   sacramentalis absolutio non esset nisi in onus, quod non competit
   sacramentis novæ legis, sed etiam de illa poena, quæ in purgatorio
   debetur, aliquid remittitur." With regard to the efficacy of the
   absolution a distinction also of this kind was drawn: God cancels the
   reatus culpæ, Christ the reatus poenæ æternæ; both are effectually
   wrought by the minister sacramenti in the exercise of plenary divine
   power, and he has at the same time the right belonging to him to give
   abatement in his absolving of the reatus poenæ temporalis. In Q. 19,
   Art. 3, Thomas shows that the clavis ordinis is given only to the
   priest, while the clavis jurisdictionis -- quæ non clavis coeli est,
   sed quædam dispositio ad eam! -- may be granted also to others. In Q.
   19, Art. 5, it is explained that even the bad priest retains the keys;
   on the other hand, it is said in Art. 6 of the heretical and schismatic
   priests that in them "manet clavium potestas quantum ad essentiam, sed
   usus impeditur ex defectu materiæ. Cum enim usus clavium in utente
   prælationem requirat respectu ejus in quem utitur, propria materia in
   quam exercetur usus clavium est homo subditus. Et quia per ordinationem
   ecclesiæ unus subditur alteri, ideo etiam per ecclesiæ prælatos potest
   subtrahi alicui ille, qui erat ei subjectus. Unde cum ecclesia
   hæreticos et schismaticos et alios hujusmodi privet subtrahendo
   subditos vel simpliciter vel quantum ad aliquid, quantum ad hoc quod
   privati sunt, non possunt usum clavium habere." In Q. 20, Art. 1, it is
   explained that only to the Pope, as he possesses the indistincta
   potestas super omnes, does there fall the application of the power of
   the keys with respect to all, while it is said of the others that "non
   in quolibet uti (potestatem clavium) possunt, sed in eos tantum, qui
   eis in sortem venerunt, nisi in necessitatis articulo." But the priest
   cannot always absolve even his subditus; for aliqua peccata -- if the
   power is not conferred upon him -- fall to be dealt with by his
   superior (Art. 2). A priest can absolve even a bishop; for "potestas
   clavium, quantum est de se, se extendit ad omnes" (Art. 3). Questions
   21-24 treat of excommunication, with which the power of jurisdiction
   has specially to do (Q. 21, Art. 4: "Even an unjust excommunication
   habet effectum suum; in the case of a mortal sin it must be respected;
   sed si quis pro falso crimine in judicio probato excommunicatus est,
   tunc, si humiliter sustinet, humilitatis meritum recompensat
   excommunicationis damnum." Q. 22, Art. 1: "Of the priests only bishops
   and majores prælati can excommunicate, qui habent jurisdictionem in
   foro judiciali, ad quod spectat causa, quæ obligat hominem in
   comparatione ad alios homines": but even those who are not priests can
   excommunicate [because it is not a question of gratia], if they have
   the jurisdictio in foro contentioso).

   [467] Thomas treats satisfactio in Suppl. Q. 12-15. In Q. 12, Arts. 1
   and 2, satisfactio is shown to be actus virtutis et justitiæ; in Art. 3
   the old definition is justified, that satisfacere is both "honorem
   debitum deo impendere" and "præservare culpam futuram." In Q. 13 it is
   shown that man is not in a position to satisfy God quoad æqualitatem
   quantitatis, but certainly quoad æqualitatem proportionis ("ex hoc quod
   per liberum arbitrium agit, deo satisfacere potest, quia quamvis dei
   sit prout a deo sibi concessum, tamen libere ei traditum est, ut ejus
   dominos sit"); in Art. 2 there follows the proof that one can render
   satisfactio for another; yet the thesis has its guarding clauses
   ("Poena satisfactoria est ad duo ordinata, scil. ad solutionem debiti
   et ad medicinam pro peccato vitando." In the latter regard one can help
   another only per accidens, in so far as by good works he can procure
   for the other an augmentum gratiæ: "sed hoc est per modum meriti magis
   quam per modum satisfactionis. Sed quantum ad solutionem debiti, unus
   potest pro olio satisfacere, dummodo sit in caritate, ut opera ejus
   satisfactoria esse possint"). In Q. 14 the quality of the satisfactio
   is treated; here the questions as to the necessity for the man's being
   in a state of caritas are discussed and answered with still greater
   strictness ("Quidem dixerunt" -- Art. 2 -- "quod postquam omnia peccata
   per præcedentem contritionem remissa sunt, si aliquis ante
   satisfactionem peractam in peccatum decidat et in peccato existens
   satisfaciat, satisfactio talis ei valet, ita quod si in peccato illo
   moreretur, in inferno de illis peccatis non puniretur. Sed hoc non
   potest esse, quia in satisfactione oportet quod amicitia restituta
   etiam justitiæ æqualitas restituatur cujus contrarium amicitiam tollit.
   æqualitas autem in satisfactione ad deum non est secundum
   æquivalentiam, sed magis secundum acceptationem ipsius. Et ideo
   oportet, etiamsi jam offensa sit dimissa per præcedentem contritionem,
   quod opera satisfactoria sint deo accepta, quod dat eis caritas, et
   ideo sine caritate opera facta non sunt satisfactoria," but in Art. 5
   it is conceded that bona opera extra caritatem facta diminuunt poenam
   inferni, i.e., as Augustine says, moderate damnation and limit the
   temporal penalties. Q. 15 treats of the means of satisfactio
   ("satisfactio sive referatur ad præteritam offensam sive ad futuram
   culpam per poenalia opera fieri asseritur"). Here the following
   shocking justification of the three penal means of satisfaction is
   given (Art. 3): "satisfactio debet esse talis, per quam aliquid nobis
   subtrahamus ad honorem dei, nos autem non habemus nisi tria bona, scil.
   bona animæ, bona corporis et bona fortunæ, scil. exteriora. Ex bonis
   quidem fortunæ subtrahimus nobis aliquid per eleemosynam, sed ex bonis
   corporis per jejunium. Ex bonis autem animæ non oportet quod aliquid
   subtrahamus nobis quantum ad essentiam vel quantum ad diminutionem
   ipsorum, quia per ea efficimur deo accepti, sed per hoc quod ea
   submittimus deo totaliter, et hoc fit per orationem. . . . Secundum
   quosdam duplex est oratio; quædam quæ est contemplativorum, quorum
   conversatio in coelis est, et talis quia totaliter est delectabilis non
   est satisfactoria. Alia est, quæ pro peccatis gemitus fundit et talis
   habet pænam et est satisfactionis pars. Vel dicendum et melius, quod
   quælibet oratio habet rationem satisfactionis, quia quamvis habet
   suavitatem spiritus, habet tamen afflictionem carnis." The importance
   in respect of theory of satisfaction as expiation of temporal penalties
   of sins that are not remitted does not, for the rest, come specially
   into view for Thomas, in addition to the other ends which satisfactions
   contemplate. Indeed, it is even granted in abstracto that contritio can
   be so perfect that all penalty is condoned by God. Yet as a fact
   satisfactions were regarded almost exclusively from the point of view
   of expiation of the penalties of sin (and these were chiefly the future
   penalties of purgatory). It was here that indulgences came in, and it
   was here that there entered the very pardonable misunderstanding of the
   laity that satisfactions in themselves deliver from all penalties for
   sin -- and it was only with this deliverance that the majority took to
   do.

   [468] For the literature see above (p. 250, note 4). Add also
   Schneider, Die Ablässe, 7 ed., 1881. Thomas, Suppl., Qs. 25-27. Grötz,
   Studien z. Gesch. d. Buss-sacraments in the Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch., Vol.
   15, p. 321 ff., Vol. 16, p. 541 ff. These investigations, which start
   from an examination of a series of forged Bulls on indulgences,
   illustrate the history of the development of indulgences, give
   important disclosures as to the Bulls connected with the Crusades, and
   treat also the papal cases of reservation in the penance discipline
   (cf. Hausmann, Gesch. der papstl. Reservatfälle, 1868). The importance
   which belonged in the course of the development of indulgences to the
   peregrinations to the sacred places, or to Rome (imposed as penance
   works), comes prominently to view in these studies.

   [469] That even in theory there were defects in the Middle Ages is
   acknowledged by Catholic witnesses themselves (see Schneider, p. 10,
   note 2): "Certain letters of indulgence are found which speak at the
   same time of forgiveness of guilt and of penalty (a culpa et a poena);
   but, according to the opinion of Benedict XIV., these indulgences are
   spurious, and must be ascribed to those collectors of alms who
   proclaimed indulgences and at the same time collected alms previous to
   the Synod of Trent." Of course on the Catholic side an appeal is
   readily made to the circumstance that "peccatum" was also used for
   "penalty for sin," "atonement for sin." This meaning can really be
   proved; but whether it suits all cases in which indulgences and sin are
   brought into conjunction is more than questionable.

   [470] To defend at the same time both the satisfactions and the
   indulgences is certainly difficult. If the former are due to the glad
   eagerness of the heart, delivered from guilt, to exercise the love
   bestowed on it, the thought of the indulgence will not arise. On the
   other hand, if indulgences are the remission of the temporal penalties
   of sin, they must not be brought into relation with the idealised
   satisfactions.

   [471] Such exchanges were also necessarily introduced, because the old
   penitential demands were in part exorbitantly high.

   [472] The indulgences were most truly the refuge of the Christians of
   lower type, although the most pious also made use of them. It is
   related of Tetzel that when, in the small town of Belitz, near Berlin,
   no one would buy indulgences from him, he said indignantly, that those
   in the town must either be "right pious people or desperate villains."
   This is told by Creusing in his "Märkische Fürstenchronik," edited by
   Holtze, p. 159, the informant being the Miller of Belitz, Meister Jacob
   (see Heidemann, Die Reform. in der Mark Brandenburg, p. 77).

   [473] After these words were long written down, I came across
   Rousseau's description in his Confessions of the demonic Madame de
   Warens. It is here said (German edition by Denhard, I., p. 291): ". . .
   although she did not believe in a hell, she strangely refused to let
   her faith in purgatory be taken from her." Rousseau regards it as
   strange, because, in spite of his change of faith, he was never able to
   free himself entirely from the Protestant influences of his youth.

   [474] The doctrine of purgatory (purgatorium) was a settled matter for
   the Schoolmen, and was energetically maintained against the Greeks from
   the thirteenth to the fifteenth century. This purgatory, which is for
   departed souls who are absolved but have not made satisfaction for all
   sins, exists, according to the Latin view, till the judgment of the
   world (the Greeks, so far as they recognised it at all, put it after
   the judgment), or for a shorter time. The souls of the righteous, who
   need no further purification, attain at once to the vision of God (the
   counter doctrine of John XXII. was rejected). More particularly, the
   Schoolmen taught that there are five dwelling-places of departed souls:
   (1) hell, to which those guilty of mortal sin at once pass; (2) the
   limbus infantium, i.e., of children who have died unbaptised; (3) the
   limbus patrum, i.e., of the Old Testament saints; (4) purgatorium; (5)
   heaven; see the detailed statement in Thomas, Suppl., Q. 69. That the
   souls of the pious have knowledge of what takes place on earth, and
   intercede for their earthly brethren, has been shown by the Lombard
   (Sent. IV., Dist. 45 G): "Cur non credamus et animas sanctorum dei
   faciem contemplantium in ejus veritate intelligere preces hominum, quæ
   et implendæ sunt vel non? . . . Intercedunt ergo pro nobis ad deum
   sancti, et merito, dum illorum merita suffragantur nobis, et affectu,
   dum vota nostra cupiunt impleri. . . . Oramus ergo, ut intercedant pro
   nobis, i.e., ut merita eorum suffragentur nobis, et ut ipsi velint
   bonum nostrum, quia eis volentibus deus volt et ita fiet"; similarly
   Thomas (Suppl., Q. 73 or 74, Art. 1). The existence of purgatory is
   thus established by Thomas (l.c., Q. 69, Art. 7): "Satis potest
   constare purgatorium esse post hanc vitam; si enim per contritionem
   deleta culpa non tollitur ex toto reatus poenæ nec etiam semper
   venialia dimissis mortalibus tolluntur, et justitia hoc exigit, ut
   peccatum per poenam debitam ordinetur, oportet quod ille, qui post
   contritionem de peccato et absolutionem decedit ante satisfactionem
   debitam post hanc vitam puniatur. Et ideo illi qui purgatorium negant,
   contra divinam justitiam loquuntur, et propter hoc erroneum est et a
   fide alienum (there follows a forged passage from Gregory of Nyssa's
   Works, representing that the whole Church so teaches). Quod non potest
   nisi de illis, qui sunt in purgatorio, intelligi; ecclesiæ autem
   autoritati quicunque resistit, hæresim incurrit." Yet opposition to
   this doctrine never ceased, and it became very active in the fourteenth
   and fifteenth centuries. Wyclif and Wessel strenuously adopted the
   hostile attitude of the Mediæval sects.

   [475] A thesaurus meritorum which the Church administers was first
   adopted by Halesius (see the passages in Münscher, l.c., p. 290 ff.).
   The theory received a fixed construction from Albertus and Thomas. In
   Suppl. Q. 25, Art. 1, the latter gives the following exposition: "Ab
   omnibus conceditur indulgentias aliquid valere, quia impium esset
   dicere, quod ecclesia aliquid vane faceret. Sed quidam dicunt, quod non
   valent ad absolvendum a reatu poenæ, quam quis in purgatorio secundum
   judicium dei meretur, sed valent ad absolvendum ab obligatione qua
   sacerdos obligavit pænitentem ad poenam aliquam vel ad quam etiam
   obligatur ex canonum statutis. Sed hæc opinio non videtur vera. Primo
   quia est expresse contra privilegium Petro datum cui dictum est, ut
   quod in terra remitteret, in coelo remitteretur. Unde remissio, quæ fit
   quantum ad forum ecclesiæ valet, valet etiam quantum ad forum del.. Et
   præterea ecclesia hujusmodi indulgentias faciens magis damnificaret,
   quam adjuvaret, quia remitteret ad graviores poenas, scil. purgatorii,
   absolvendo a pænitentiis injunctis. Et ideo aliter dicendum, quod
   valent et quantum ad forum ecclesiæ et quantum ad judicium dei, ad
   remissionem poenæ residuæ post contritionem et conffessionem et
   absolutionem, sive sit injuncta, sive non. Ratio autem, quare valere
   possiut, est unitas corporis mystici, in qua multi in operibus
   pænitentiæ supererogavetunt ad mensuram debitorum suorum . . . quorum
   meritorum tanta est copia, quod omnem poenam debitam nunc viventibus
   excedunt et præcipuæ propter meritum Christi, quod etsi in sacramentis
   operatur, non tamen efficacia ejus in sacramentis includitur, sed sua
   infinitate excedit efficaciam sacramentorum. Dictum est autem supra,
   quod unus pro alio satisfacere potest; sancti autem, in quibus
   superabundantia operum sanctificationis invenitur, non determinate pro
   isto qui remissione indiget, hujusmodi opera fecerunt, alias absque
   omni indulgentia remissionem consequerentur, sed communiter pro tota
   ecclesia, sicut apostolus ait (Coloss. I.), et sic prædicta merita sunt
   communia totius ecclesiæ. Ea autem quæ sunt alicujus multitudinis
   communia, distribuuntur singulis de multitudine secundum arbitrium ejus
   qui multitudini præest." Note also the cautious remarks: "Remissio quæ
   per indulgentias fit, non tollit quantitatem, poenæ ad culpam, quia pro
   culpa unius alias sponte poenam sustinuit." -- "Ille qui indulgentias
   suscipit, non absolvitur, simpliciter loquendo, a debito poenæ, sed
   datur ei, unde debitam solvat." -- "Non est in destructionem
   indulgentias dare, nisi inordinate dentur. Tamen consulendum est eis
   qui indulgentias consequuntur, ne propter hoc ab operibus pænitentiæ
   injunctis abstineant, ut etiam ex his remedium consequentur, quamvis a
   debito poenæ esse immunes, et præcipue quia quandoque sunt plurium
   debitores quam credant." In Art. 2 those are confuted who assert that
   the indulgences "non tantum valent, quantum pronuntiantur," only so far
   avail for the individual "quantum fides et devotio sua exigit." It is
   proved, "indulgentiæ simpliciter tantum valent quantum prædicantur,
   dummodo ex parte dantis sit auctoritas et ex parte recipientis caritas
   et ex parte causæ pietas." Also: "quæcunque causa adsit, quæ in
   utilitatem ecclesiæ et honorem dei vergat, sufficiens est ratio
   indulgentias faciendi . . . (nam) merita ecelesiæ semper
   superabundant." It is further shown that indulgences belong to the
   clavis jurisdictionis (are not sacramental), and therefore "effectus
   ejus arbitrio hominis subjacet" (also authorised legati non sacerdotes
   can dispense indulgences). To the question whether indulgences can be
   dispensed pro temporali subsidio, it is answered in Art. 3 that this is
   not possible simpliciter, "sed pro temporalibus ordinatis ad
   spiritualia, sicut est repressio inimicorum ecclesiæ, qui pacem
   ecclesiæ perturbant, sicut constructio ecclesiarum et pontium et
   aliarum eleemosynarum largitio." Q. 26 treats of those who can dispense
   indulgences ("papa potest facere prout vult"), Q. 27 of the receivers
   of indulgences. Here in Art. 1 the thesis is contested of those who
   assert that to those guilty of mortal sin indulgences are of benefit,
   not for forgiveness of sins, but yet ad acquirendum gratiam: "in
   omnibus indulgentiis fit mentio de vere contritio et confessis." In
   Art. 3 it is shown that the indulgence does not avail for one who has
   not done what the indulgence is given for. Compare with this also Q.
   74, where in Art. 10 the question is answered whether indulgences are
   of use for the dead. The answer is that they are of no direct use, as
   the dead cannot do what the indulgences are given for. On the other
   hand they are of indirect use, that is, if the indulgence formula runs
   thus: "Quicumque fecerit hoc vel illud, ipse et pater ejus vel
   quicumque alius ei adjunctus in purgatorio detentus, tantum de
   indulgentia habebit." "Talis indulgentia non solum vivo sed etiam
   mortuo proderit. Non enim est aliqua ratio quare ecclesia transferre
   possit communia merita quibus indulgentiæ innituntur in vivos et non in
   mortuos." The indulgences, moreover, do not work simply per modum
   suffragii; they are effectual. Yet arbitrariness on the part of the
   Pope in rescuing souls from purgatory must be limited by this, that
   there must always be a causa conveniens indulgentias faciendi; but such
   is always to be found. It is furthermore probable that the recognition
   of a thesaurus meritorum had a long course of historic preparation in
   the history of religion; see Siegfried in Hilgenfeld's Ztschr., 1884,
   Part 3, p. 356 (also Gött Gel. Anz., 1881, St. 12 and 13): "The
   doctrine of a treasury of good works from which indemnifications can be
   derived for the sins of others came originally into Judaism under
   Iranian influences, as is known to have been the case with so much else
   in the later Jewish dogmatics. If we compare what appears regarding
   this in Spiegel's "Franische Alterthumskunde" with what is to he found
   in Weber's System der altsynagogalen paläst. Theol., 1880, p. 280 ff.,
   that this is a fact we shall not be able to doubt. Now as this
   doctrine, after being first brought forward by Alexander of Hales, owed
   its recognition within the Catholic Church chiefly to Thomas Aquinas,
   of whom it is also well known that he transcribed Maimonides (Merx, Die
   Prophetie des Joel, 1879, pp. 354-367), the suspicion at once arises
   that this doctrine also was derived from Jewish sources. The more exact
   proof that this was actually so we reserve, as it would lead us too far
   afield here." Against this conjecture Güdemann (Jüd. Litt.-Blatt., 21
   Jahrg., 29 Oct., 1890) has raised objections, and has tried to show
   that the "merit of the Fathers" ("Sechus Owaus") is something else and
   much more harmless. Yet identity no one has asserted, but only a
   historical connection. The thesaurus meritorum has been developed in
   directions, and has found applications, of which certainly Judaism did
   not think. But my conviction that a historical connection exists has
   not been shaken by Giidemann's objections. For the rest I do not
   presume to be a judge in this matter, but I would like to point out
   something akin. In the "History of Joseph" preserved in the Syriac,
   which is said to have been composed by Basil of Cæsarea, and yet
   contains only Jewish Haggada, and, so far as I can see, nothing
   Christian (and so apparently is of Jewish origin), one reads (see
   Weinberg, Gesch. Josefs, angeblich verfasst v. Basilius d. Gr. Berlin,
   1893, p. 53): "Potipher's wife said: But if thou art afraid of sin, as
   thou hast asserted, then take gold and silver, as much as thou wilt,
   and give to the poor; and God will forgive thee thy guilt." It is a
   woman under the devil's influence whom the narrator represents as
   speaking, and he certainly disapproved of the woman's speech; but it
   shows undoubtedly that such reflexions were not far off. The abusus --
   and that is condemned also by a pious Catholic -- is disapproved.

   [476] A large amount of material on the lax and strict theories in
   Bratke, 1.c. One thing that made a principal difference was the
   question as to whether indulgences were not of use even for those
   guilty of mortal sin ad acquirendam gratiam, or, whether they could not
   be given beforehand to such persons, to be used by them when they felt
   disposed. Of course the differences of Scotists and Thomists as to
   attritio and contritio are important here also. The explanations of the
   Jubilee indulgence in Bratke, pp. 201 ff., 240 f., appear to use to be
   partly based on misunderstanding and partly exaggerated. The account of
   the indulgence theory of the ecclesiastical reform party, p. 243 ff.
   (Cajetan) is instructive, both as helping us to understand the earliest
   position of Luther, and as enabling us to see how poorly armed this
   reform party was.

   [477] The theory of indulgence is summed up in the Extravagante
   Unigenitus of Clement VI. of the year 1349: "Unigenitus dei filius
   . . . sanguine nos redemit quam in ara crucis innocens immolatus, non
   guttam sanguinis modicam (quæ tamen propter unionem ad verbum pro
   redemptione totius humani generis suffecisset), sed copiose velut
   quoddam profluvium noscitur effudisse. . . . Quantum ergo exinde, ut
   nec supervacua, inanis aut superflua tanto effusionis miseratio
   redderetur, thesaurum militanti ecclesiæ acquisivit, volens suis
   thesaurizare filiis pius pater, ut sic sit infinitus thesaurus
   hominibus, quo qui usi sunt dei amicitiæ participes sunt effecti. Quem
   quidem thesaurum non in sudario repositum, non in agro absconditum, sed
   per beatum Petrum . . . ejusque successores suos in terris vicarios
   commisit fidelibus salubriter dispensandum, et propriis et
   rationabilibus causis: nunc pro totali, nunc pro partiali remissione
   poenæ temporalis pro peccatis debitæ, tam generaliter quam specialiter
   (prout cum deo expedire cognoscerent) vere pænitentibus et confessis
   misericorditer applicandum. Ad cujus quidem thesauri cumulum b. dei
   genetricis omniumque electorum a primo justo usque ad ultimum merita
   adminiculum præstare noscuntur, de cujus consumptione seu minutione non
   est aliquatenus formidandum (!), tam propter infinita Christi merita
   quam pro eo quod, quanto plures ex ejus applicatione trahuntur ad
   justitiam, tanto magis accrescit ipsorum cumulus meritorum."

   [478] See Buddensieg, Wyclif, p. 201 ff., Trialogus IV., 32: "Fateor
   quod indulgentiæ papales, si ita se habeant ut dicuntur, sapiunt
   manifestam blasphemiam. Dicitur enim, quod papa prætendit, se habere
   potentiam ad salvandum singulos viatores, et quantumcunque viantes
   deliquerint, nedum ad mitigandum poenas ad suffragandum eis cum
   absolutionibus et indulgentiis, ne unquam veniant ad purgatorium, sed
   ad præcipiendum sanctis angelis, ut anima separata a corpore indilate
   ipsam deferant in requiem sempiternam. . . . Contra ipsam rudem
   blasphemiam invexi alias, primo sic: nec papa nec etiam dominus Jesus
   Christus potest dispensare cum aliquo nec dare indulgentias, nisi ut
   æternaliter deitas justo consilio definivit. Sed non docetur, quod papa
   vel homo aliquis potest habere colorem justitiæ (on this falls the
   greatest weight) taliter faciendi; igitur non docetur, quod papa talem
   habeat potestatem. . . . Item videtur quod illa opinio multipliciter
   blasphemat in Christum, cum extollitur supra ejus humanitatem atque
   deitatem et sic super omne quod dicitur deus. . . . Sed eia, mili es
   Christi, abicite prudenter hæc opera atque fictitias principis
   tenebrarum et induimini dominum Jesum Christum, in armis suis fideliter
   confidentes, et excutite ab ecclesia tales versutias antichristi,
   docentes populum, quod in ipso solo cum lege sua et membris debet
   confidere et operando illis conformiter ex suo opere bono salvari,
   specialiter si antichristi versutias fideliter detestetur."

   [479] A series of passages from the Disput. adv. indulgentias of Wesel
   has been reprinted by Hauck, p. 303 f. Everything in Wesel is really
   only apparently radical. He lets the vulgar doctrine of the Sacraments
   stand, up to the point at which the Sacrament of Penance does not
   cancel the temporal penalties of sin. But at this point he will stop
   short; for these penalties cannot at all be cancelled (1) because God
   decrees them and means to carry them out; (2) because there is no one
   who could remove them -- the priests are in everything only ministri
   dei in remittendis culpis -- (3) because it is in keeping with piety to
   endure them; (4) because there could be no purgatory at all, if the
   theory of indulgences were correct; for the treasury of indulgences
   would be enough to compensate for all temporal penalties. If there
   mingles already in the polemic of Wesel a Wyclifite-Hussite (Donatist)
   element, in so far as it is required that the objective importance of
   the priests (the hierarchy) be diminished (by no means abolished), this
   element is much more recognisable in Wessel. To the pious alone are the
   keys given. Now as the Popes and priests are in many cases not pious,
   these carnales homines have power at all only in externis, i.e., what
   they undertake has to do, not with the true Church and grace and sin,
   but with the empirical Church; see de sacram. pænit. f. 51: "Carnalis
   homo non sapit, quæ sancti amoris sunt, igitur judicare non potest.
   Unde judicium ecclesiæ et corum qui in ecclesia præsident, quia saepe
   carnales, animales, mundiales aut diabolici sunt et tamen suum officium
   vere administraut sicut viri spirituales est deo pleni, liquet
   excommunicationes et indulgentias non ad ea quæ caritatis et amoris
   sunt se extendere sed tantum ad exteriorem pacem et tranquillitatem
   ecclesiæ. Unde indulgentiæ sunt remissiones de his poenis quas prælatus
   injunxit aut injungere potuit." But further, the keys that are given to
   Peter are not handed over to arbitrary use; true repentance and divine
   forgiveness go together. Everything rests on grace, and only pious
   priests are ministri dei, i.e., ministers of the grace which God alone
   is able to infuse. But wessel took still another important step. He
   asked himself whether the temporal penalties of sin really remain after
   forgiveness, and he is inclined to see discipline rather in the
   penalties of the absolved. (f. 60.) From this point he also assailed
   the conception of satisfactio operum, and drew a conclusion from
   Augustinianism which scarcely anyone before him had ventured to draw:
   satisfaction cannot take place at all, where God has infused His love;
   it leads of necessity to a limitation of the gratia gratis data, and
   detracts from the work of Christ. The plenitudo gratiæ excludes the
   satisfactio (fol. 61, 62), how much more the indulgences, which he
   defines thus (l.c.): "indulgentiarum materia est abusus quæstorum et
   saepe illorum falsum crimen, nonnumquam impura et corrupta intentio
   papæ."

   [480] At Constance (Mansi XXVII., p. 634, No. 42) the proposition was
   condemned: "Fatuum est credere indulgentiis papæ et episcoporum."

   [481] Thomas, P. III., Suppl. Q. 29-33. Schwane, p. 675-677.

   [482] In the earlier period, Ivo and others expressed themselves
   against repetition. From the Lombard's time repetition is approved, but
   not in one and the same illness.

   [483] Thomas, 1.c., Q. 30, Art. 1: "Principalis effectus hujus
   sacramenti est remissio peccatorum, quoad reliquias peccati (what does
   that mean?), et ex consequenti etiam quoad culpam, si earn inveniat."
   Art. 2: "Ex hoc sacramento non semper sequitur corporalis sanatio, sed
   quando expedit ad spiritualem sanationem. Et tunc semper eam inducit,
   dummodo non sit impedimentum ex parte recipientes"; cf. the
   comprehensive description of the Sacrament in the Bull of Eugene IV.
   (Mansi XXXI., p. 1058).

   [484] In itself it was, no doubt, very expedient to introduce a
   Sacrament in connection with death, and thereby to increase confidence
   in dying. This was strengthened by the rite of anointing the several
   members, and thereby showing in an impressive way to the sick, that the
   members with which he had sinned had been cleansed. Here, also, as in
   the case of confirmation, the Church gave heed to men's need of
   something "objective," instead of leading them without any ceremonies
   to Christ.

   [485] Thomas, P. III., Suppl. Q. 34-40. Schwane, pp. 677-685.

   [486] Q. 34, Art. 3: "Sacramentum nihil est aliud quam quædam
   sanctificatio homini exhibita cum aliquo signo visibili. Unde cum in
   susceptione ordinis quædam consecratio homini exhibeatur per visibilia
   signa, constat ordinem esse sacramentum." Art. 5: "Materia in
   sacramentis exterius adhibita significat virtutem in sacramentis
   agentem ex intrinseco omnino advenire. Unde cum effectus proprius hujus
   sacramenti, scil. character, non percipiatur ex aliqua operatione
   ipsius qui ad sacramentum accidit sicut erat in pænitentia sed omnino
   ex intrinseco adveniat, competit ei materiam habere, tamen diversimode
   ab aliis sacramentis quæ materiam habent. Quia hoc quod confertur in
   aliis sacramentis, derivatur tantum a deo, non a ministro qui
   sacramentum dispensat, sed illud quod in hoc sacramento traditur, scil.
   spiritualis potestas, derivatur etiam ab eo qui sacramentum dat sicut
   potestas imperfecta a perfecta. Et ideo efficacia aliorum sacramentorum
   principaliter consistit in materia, quæ virtutem divinam et significat
   et continet, ex sanctificatione per ministrum adhibita. Sed efficacia
   hujus sacramenti principaliter residet penes eum, qui sacramentum
   dispensat, materia autem adhibetur magis ad demonstrandum potestatem,
   quæ traditur particulariter ab habente eam complete, quam ad potestatem
   causandam, quod patet ex hoc quod materia competit usui potestatis."

   [487] Not a saving benefit, therefore, given to an individual; for the
   ordo serves the Church (Thomas, Q. 35, A. 1). Here, also, the doctrine
   of sacramental grace (participatio divinæ naturæ) has breaches made in
   it; nay, Thomas says plainly, Q. 34, Art. 2: "unde relinquitur, quod
   ipse character interior sit essentialiter et principaliter ipsum
   sacramentum ordinis!"

   [488] At the same time the celebration of the Mass is the chief matter;
   it alone is mentioned in the formula of consecration.

   [489] The Lombard, Sent. IV., Dist. 24 I. "Sacerdos nomen habet
   compositum ex Græco et Latino, quod est sacrum dans sive sacer dux.
   Sicut enim rex a regendo ita sacerdos a sacrando dictus est, consecrat
   enim et sanctificat." At the same time being empowered to teach was
   also no doubt mentioned, and for the person of the priest an
   undefinable "amplius gratiæ munus, per quod ad majora redduntur idonei"
   (Thomas, Q. 35, Art. I). In the Bull "Exultate" (Mansi, l.c., p. 1058)
   it is said: "Effectus augmentum gratiæ, ut quis sit idoneus minister."

   [490] Thomas, P. III., Suppl. Q. 41-68. Schwane, pp. 685-693.

   [491] Thomas, l.c., Q. 41, A. 1; 42, A. 2, 3. In the way in which the
   Lombard describes the marriage bond as sacramental, a beautiful proof
   is presented of the ultimate interest of Western Post-Augustinian
   Catholicism, in so far as it is determined at the same time by the
   thought of conformitas naturæ divinæ and by that of caritas, Sentent.
   IV., Dist. 26 F.: "Ut inter conjuges conjunctio est secundum consensum
   animorum et secundum permixtionem corporum, sic ecclesia Christo
   copulatur voluntate et natura, qua idem vult cum eo, et ipsa formam
   sumpsit de natura hominis. Copulata est ergo sponsa sponso
   spiritualiter et corporaliter, i.e., caritate et conformitate naturæ.
   Hujus utriusque copulæ figura est in conjugio. Consensus enim conjugum
   copulam spiritualem Christi et ecclesiæ, quæ fit per caritatem,
   significat; commixtio vero sexuum illam significat, quæ fit per nature
   conformitatem."

   [492] Thomas, P. III., Q. 65, A. 4.

   [493] Thomas, Q. 42, A. 2.

   [494] Thomas, P. III., Q. 65, A. 2.

   [495] Sentent. IV., Dist. 30 B.

   [496] See Schwane, p. 688.

   [497] Thomas, Q. 42, Art. 1: "Verba quibus consensus matrimonialis
   exprimitur sunt forma hujus sacramenti." Also: "Sacramentum matrimonii
   perficitur per actum ejus, qui sacramento illo utitur, sicut
   pænitentia. Et ideo sicut pænitentia non habet aliam materiam nisi
   ipsos actus sensui subjectos, qui sunt loco materialis elementi, ita
   est de matrimonio."

   [498] Thomas, Q. 42, Art. 1: "benedictio sacerdotis est quoddam
   sacramentale."

   [499] Thomas, Q. 42, Art. 3.

   [500] See Schwane, p. 689.

   [501] So Bonaventura and Thomas, Q. 49, Art. 4-6, especially Art. 5:
   "utrum actus matrimonialis excusari possit sine honis matrimonii."
   Here, among other things, it is said: "si aliquis per actum matrimonii
   intendat vitare fornicationem in conjuge, non est aliquod peccatum;
   . . . sed si intendat vitare fornicationem in se . . . hoc est peccatum
   veniale."

   [502] The contradictions on Thomas's part are here very great; for on
   the other hand it is said, l.c., Art. 4, that proles, fides, and
   sacramentum not only excuse, but sanctify, the act of marriage. See
   also in Sentent. Dist. 26, Q. 2, Art. 3: "Cum in matrimonio datur
   homini ex divina institutione facultas utendi sua uxore ad
   procreationem prolis, datur etiam gratia, sine qua id convenienter
   facere non posset."

   [503] The proposition of Irenæus (III., 18, 6): "Si non vere passus
   est, nulla gratia ei, cum nulla fuerit passio," is the firmly adhered
   to basis of the whole of the Christianity and of the whole of the
   theology of the West.

   [504] Sentent. II., Dist. 25 P.: "Libertas a peccato et a miseria per
   gratiam est; libertas vero a necessitate per naturam. Utramque
   libertatem, naturæ scil. et gratiæ, notat apostolus cum ex persona
   hominis non redempti ait: velle adjacet mihi, etc.,' acsi diceret,
   habeo libertatem naturæ, sed non habeo libertatem gratiæ, ideo non est
   apud me perfectio boni. Nam voluntas hominis, quam naturaliter habet,
   non valet erigi ad bonum efficaciter volendum, vel opere implendum,
   nisi per gratiam liberetur et adjuvetur: liberetur quidem, ut velit, et
   adjuvetur, ut perficiat . . . dei gratiam non advocat hominis voluntas
   vel operatio, sed ipsa gratia voluntatem prævenit præparando ut velit
   bonum et præparatam adjuvat ut perficiat." He repeats also correctly
   the Augustinian doctrine of predestination (I. Dist. 40 D.): God does
   not elect on the basis of prescience, but it is only the election that
   produces the merits. He rejects præscientia iniquitatis quorundam:
   "reprobatio dei, qua ab æterno non eligendo quosdam reprobavit,
   secundum duo consideratur, quorum alterum præscit et non præparat,
   i.e., iniquitatem, alterum præscit et præparat, scil. æternam poenam."
   Reprobation rests on the mysterious but just decision not to show mercy
   to some; its result is hardening. The chief propositions of the Lombard
   on faith, love, and works are: III. Dist. 23 D.: "Credere deo est
   credere vera esse quæ loquitur, quod et mali faciunt . . .; credere
   deum est credere quod ipse sit deus, quod etiam mali faciunt; credere
   in deum est credendo amare, credendum in eum ire, credendo ei adhærere
   et ejus membris incorporari: per hanc fidem justicatur impius" (word
   for word after Augustine). So also he distinguishes in faith, after
   Augustine, id quod and id quo creditur (l.c. sub. C.). The latter,
   subjective faith, is to be distinguished according as it is virtus and
   according as it is not virtus. Faith, so far as love is still wanting
   to it, is fides informis (not virtue). All deeds without faith are
   devoid of goodness, II. Dist, 41 A.: "cum intentio bonum opus faciat et
   fides intentionem dirigat, non immerito quæri potest, utrum omnis
   intentio omneque opus illorum malum sit, qui fidem non habent? . . .
   Quod a quibusdam non irrationabiliter astruitur, qui dicunt omnes
   actiones et voluntates hominis sine fide malas esse . . . Quæ ergo sine
   fide fiunt, bona non sunt, quia omne bonum deo placet." II. Dist. 26
   A.: "Operans gratia est, quæ prævenit voluntatem bonam: ea enim
   liberatur et præparatur hominis voluntas, ut sit bona bonumque
   efficaciter velit; cooperans vero gratia voluntatem jam bonam sequitur
   adjuvando . . . Voluntas hominis gratia dei prævenitur atque
   præparatur, ut fiat bona, non ut fiat voluntas, quia et ante gratiam
   voluntas erat, sed non erat bona et recta voluntas." It is repeatedly
   said that grace consists in the infusion of fides cum caritate (i.e.,
   the Holy Spirit), and that only with this the merits of man begin;
   accordingly justitia as bona qualitas mentis (virtus, qua recte
   vivitur) is entirely a work of God.

   [505] Sentent. II., Dist. 24 C.: "Liberum arbitrium est facultas
   rationis et voluntatis, qua bonum eligitur gratia assistente vel malum
   eadem desistente." II. Dist. 27 G.: "Cum ex gratia dicuntur esse bona
   merita et incipere . . . gratia gratis data intelligitur, ex qua bona
   merita incipiunt. Quæ cum ex sola gratia esse dicantur, non excluditur
   liberum arbitrium, quia nullum meritum est in homine, quod non fit per
   liberum arbitrium." II. Dist. 26 G.: "Ante gratiam prævenientem et
   operantem, qua voluntas bona præparatum in homine, præcedere quædam
   bona ex dei gratia et libero arbitrio, quædam etiam ex solo libero
   arbitrio, quibus tamen vita non meretur, nec gratia, qua justificatur."
   II. Dist. 27 J.: "Cum dicitur fides mereri justificationem et vitam
   æternam, ex ea ratione dictum accipitur, quia per actum fidei meretur
   illa. Similiter de caritate et justitia et de aliis accipitur. Si enim
   fides ipsa virtus præveniens diceretur esse mentis actus qui est
   meritum, jam ipsa ex libero arbitrio originem haberet, quod quia non
   est, sic dicitur esse meritum, quia actus ejus est meritum, si tamen
   adsit caritas, sine qua nec credere nec sperare meritum vitæ est. Unde
   apparet vere quia caritas est spiritus s., qui animæ qualitates
   informat et sanctificat, ut eis anima informetur et sanctificetur, sine
   qua animæ qualitas non dicitur virtus, quia non valet sanare animam."
   H. Dist. 41 C.: "Nullus dei gratiam mereri potest, per quam
   justificatur, potest tamen mereri, ut penitus abiciatur. Et quidem
   aliqui in tantum profundum iniquitatis devenerunt, ut hoc mereantur, ut
   hoc digni sint; alii vero ita vivunt, ut etsi non mereantur gratiam
   justificationis, non tamen mereantur omnino repelli et gratiam sibi
   subtrahi."

   [506] In Anselm (Dialog. de lib. arb.), Bernard (de gratia et lib.
   arb.), and Hugo the Augustinian propositions regarding grace are
   repeated, but the explanations of free will are in part still more
   uncertain than in the Lombard. According to Anselm the rectitudo liberi
   arbitrii has disappeared indeed, but the potestas servandi rectitudinem
   remains; see c. 3: "liberum arbitrium non est aliud, quam arbitrium
   potens servare rectitudinem voluntatis propter ipsam rectitudinem." The
   ratio and the will power remain, and so, after the Fall, men are like
   those who have eyes and can see, but for whom the object has
   disappeared (c. 4). The libertas arbitrii is accordingly defined by him
   (1) formally (ratio et voluntas tenendi), but also (2) materially, in
   as much as the voluntas tenendi remains. According to Bernard (c. 8)
   there belongs to free will, not the posse vel sapere, but only the
   velle; but the latter remains: "manet igitur post peccatum liberum
   arbitrium, etsi miserum, tamen integrum . . . non ergo si creatura
   potens aut sapiens, sed tantum si volens esse desierit, liberum
   arbitrium amisisse putanda erit." In this formal description of free
   will Hugo diverges still further from Augustine; for what is
   characteristic of this fatal development is this, that for Augustine's
   religious mode of view, for which freedom is beata necessitas, there is
   substituted an empirico-psychological mode of view, which is of no
   concern for religion, and which nevertheless now influences religious
   contemplation. "Voluntas semper a necessitate libera est": this
   proposition is again made a foundation in the doctrine of religion. On
   Abelard's doctrine see Deutsch, 1.c., p. 319 ff., who illustrates in
   particular the dangerous side in the conception of intentio on which
   Abelard lays stress, and shows how the intellectualism of the
   theologian is in conflict with the traditional doctrine of original
   sin.

   [507] See II. Dist., 27 J. (see above, p. 277, note 1); I. Dist., 17
   B.: "Ipse idem spiritus sanctus est amor sive caritas, qua nos
   diligimus deum et proximum, quæ caritas cum ita est in nobis, ut nos
   faciet diligere deum et proximum, tunc spiritus sanctus dicitur mitti
   ac dari nobis." I. Dist., 17 Q.: "Alios actus atque motus virtutum
   operatur caritas, i.e., spiritus s., mediantibus virtutibus quarum
   actus sunt, utpote actum fidei, i.e., credere fide media, et actum
   spei, i.e., sperare media spe. Per fidem enim et spem prædictos
   operatur actus. Diligendi vero actum per se tantum sine alicujus
   virtutis medio operatur. Aliter ergo hunc actum operatur quam alios
   virtutum actus."

   [508] Duns contested it; on the other hand, Pupper of Goch and Staupitz
   defended.it; see Otto Clemen, J. Pupper von Goch (Leipzig, 1896), p.
   249.

   [509] Sentent. II., Dist. 27 G. "Cum ex gratia dicuntur esse bona
   merita et incipere, aut intelligitur gratia gratis dans, i.e., deus,
   vel potius gratia gratis data, quæ voluntatem hominis prævenit."

   [510] On the general scheme in which Thomas has inserted his doctrine
   of grace, and especially on the significance of the Church as correlate
   of redemption, see Ritschl. Rechtfertigung, I. vol., 2 ed., p. 86 ff.
   The most wonderful thing in Thomas is that in the whole account no
   notice is taken of the specific nature of grace as gratis Christi.

   [511] "Quantum ad opera virtutum in interioribus actibus præcepta novæ
   legis sunt graviora præceptis veteris legis." The later Schoolmen did
   not indeed directly contest this position, but they asserted that
   through the Sacraments the defective fulfilment of the commands of the
   new law is supplemented.

   [512] "Cognoscere veritatem est usus quidam vel actus intellectualis
   luminis (omne quod manifestatur lumen est'), usus autem quilibet
   quendam motum importat . . . videmus autem in corporalibus, quod ad
   motum non solum requiritur ipsa forma, quæ est principium motus vel
   actionis, sed etiam requiritur motio primi moventis. Primum autem
   movens in ordine corporalium est corpus cæleste." This is now applied
   to the motus spirituales, whose ultimate author must therefore be God,
   "ideo quantumcunque natura aliqua corporalis vel spiritualis ponatur
   perfecta, non potest in suum actum procedere nisi moveatur a deo, quæ
   quidem motio est secundum suæ providentiæ rationem, non secundum
   necessitatem naturæ, sicut modo corporis coelestis. Non solum autem a
   deo est omnis motio, sicut a primo movente, sed etiam ab ipso est omnis
   formalis perfectio, sicut a primo actu. Sic igitur actio intellectus et
   cujuscunque entis creati dependet et a deo quantum ad duo. Uno modo in
   quantum ab ipso habet perfectionem sive formam per quam agit, alio modo
   in quantum ab ipso movetur ad agendum. Intellectus humanus habet
   aliquam formam, scil. ipsum intelligibile lumen, quod est de se
   sufficiens ad quædam intelligibilia cognoscenda . . . altiora vero
   intelligibilia intellectus humanus cognoscere non potest, nisi fortiori
   lumine perficiatur . . . quod dicitur lumen gratiæ, in quantum est
   naturæ superadditum. Sic igitur dicendum est, quod ad cognitionem
   cujuscunque veri homo indiget auxilio divino, ut intellectus a deo
   moveatur ad suum actum, non autem indiget ad cognoscendam veritatem in
   omnibus nova illustratione superaddita naturali illustrationi, sed in
   quibusdam quæ excedunt naturalem cognitionem."

   [513] "In statu naturæ integræ quantum ad sufficientiam operativæ
   virtutis poterat homo per sua naturalia velle et operari bonum suæ
   naturæ proportionatum, quale est bonum virtutis acquisitæ, non autem
   bonum superexcedens, quale est bonum virtutis infusæ; sed in statu
   naturæ corruptæ etiam deficit homo ab hoc, quod secundum suam naturam
   potest, ut non possit totum hujusmodi bonum implere per sua naturalia.
   Quia tamen natura humana per peccatum non est totaliter corrupta, ut
   scil. tanto bono naturæ privetur, potest quidem etiam in statu naturæ
   corruptæ per virtutem suæ naturæ aliquod bonum particulare agere, non
   tamen totum bonum sibi connaturale." He must be healed auxilio
   medicinæ. "Sic igitur virtute gratuita superaddita virtuti naturæ
   indiget homo in statu naturæ integræ, quantum ad unum scil. ad
   operandum et volendum bonum supernaturale, sed in statu naturæ corruptæ
   quantum ad duo, scil. ut sanetur et ulterius ut bonum supernaturalis
   virtutis operetur, quod est meritorium."

   [514] In Art. 4 the fulfilling of the law of God is treated in the same
   way.

   [515] "Quod homo convertatur ad deum, hoc non potest esse nisi deo
   ipsum convertente, hoc autem est præparare se ad gratiam, quasi ad deum
   converti . . . homo non potest se præparare ad lumen gratiæ
   suscipiendum, nisi per auxilium gratuitum dei interius moventis."

   [516] Art. 7: "Cum enim peccatum transiens actu, remaneat reatu, non
   est idem resurgere a peccato, quod cessare ab actu peccati, sed
   resurgere a peccato est reparari hominem ad ea quæ peccando amisit."
   Sin has three evils as its consequences, macula, corruptio naturalis
   boni, reatus culpæ. None of these results can be removed otherwise than
   by God.

   [517] Art. 9: "homo ad recte vivendum dupliciter auxilio dei indiget.
   Uno quidem modo quantum ad aliquod habituale donum, per quod natura
   humana corrupta sanetur et etiam sanata elevetur ad operanda opera
   meritoria vitæ æternæ, quæ excedunt proportionem naturæ. Alio modo
   indiget homo auxilio gratiæ, ut a deo moveatur ad agendum. Quantum
   igitur ad primum auxilii modum, homo in gratia existens non indiget
   alio auxilio gratiæ quasi aliquo alio habitu infuso, indiget tamen
   auxilio gratiæ secundum alium modum, ut scil. a deo moveatur ad recte
   agendum, et hoc propter duo. First generally (nulla res creata potest
   in quemcunque actum prodire nisi virtute motionis divinæ), second
   specially, propter conditionem status humanæ naturæ, quæ quidem licet
   per gratiam sanetur quantum ad mentem, remanet tamen in ea corruptio et
   infectio quantum ad carnem per quam servit legi peccati; remanet etiam
   quædam ignorantiæ obscuritas in intellectu; propter varios enim rerum
   eventus et quia etiam nos ipsos non perfectæ cognoscimus, non possumus
   ad plenum scire quid nobis expediat, et ideo necesse est nobis, ut a
   deo dirigamur et protegamur qui omnia novit et omnia potest. Et propter
   hoc etiam renatis in filios dei per gratiam convenit dicere: Et ne nos
   inducas in tentationem, et fiat voluntas tua, etc."

   [518] Art. 10 (strictly Augustinian, against Pelagius): "Ad
   perseverantiam habendam homo in gratia constitutus non quidem indiget
   aliqua alia habituali gratia, sed divino auxilio ipsum dirigente et
   protegente contra tentationum impulsus . . . et ideo postquam aliquis
   est justificatus per gratiam, necesse habet a deo petete prædictum
   perseverantiæ donum, ut scil. custodiatur a malo usque ad finem vitæ:
   multis enim datur gratia, quibus non datur perseverare in gratis."

   [519] Art. 1.

   [520] Art. 2: ". . . multo magis illis quos movet ad consequendum bonum
   supernaturale æternum, infundit aliquas formas seu qualitates
   supernaturales, secundum quas suaviter et prompte ab ipso moveantur ad
   bonum æternum consequendum."

   [521] Art. 3: "Sicut lumen naturale rationis est aliquid præter
   virtutes acquisitas, quæ dicuntur in ordine ad ipsum lumen naturale,
   ita etiam ipsum lumen gratiæ, quod est participatio divinæ naturæ, est
   aliquid præter virtutes infusas, quæ a lumine illo derivantur et ad
   illud lumen ordinantur." Hence because grace is not a mere virtue, but
   aliquid virtute prius, it is not placed in aliqua potentiarum animæ,
   but in the essence of the soul itself. "Sicut enim per potentiam
   intellectivam homo participat cognitionem divinam per virtutem fidei,
   et secundum potentiam voluntatis amorem divinum per virtutem caritatis,
   ita etiam per naturam animæ participat secundum quandam similitudinem
   naturam divinam, per quandam regenerationem" (Art. 4).

   [522] Note also: "Est autem in nobis duplex actus; primus quidem
   interior voluntatis; et quantum ad istum actum, voluntas se habet ut
   mota, deus autem ut movens, et præsertim cum voluntas incipit bonum
   velle, quæ prius malum volebat. Et ideo secundum quod deus movet
   humanam mentem ad hunc actum, dicitur gratia operans. Alius autem actus
   est exterior qui cum a voluntate imperetur consequens est quod ad hunc
   actum operatio attribuatur voluntati. Et quia etiam ad hunc actum deus
   nos adjuvat et interius confirmando voluntatem, ut ad actum perveniat,
   et exterius facultatem operandi præbendo, respectu hujusmodi actus
   dicitur gratia cooperans. (There follows a proof-passage from
   Augustine). Si igitur gratia accipiatur pro gratuita dei motione, quia
   movet nos ad bonum meritorium convenienter dividitur gratia per
   operantem, et cooperantem. Si vero accipiatur gratia pro habituali
   dono, sic est duplex gratiæ effectus, sicut et cujuslibet alterius
   formæ, quorum primus est esse, secundus est operatio. . . . Sic igitur
   habitualis gratia, in quantum animam sanat vel justificat sive gratam
   deo facit, dicitur gratia operans, in quantum vero est principium opens
   meritorii, quod ex libero arbitrio procedit, dicitur cooperans." At an
   earlier point Thomas had already made an analogous distinction with
   regard to righteousness (justitia); see II., 1 Q. l00, Art. 12: "Si
   loquamur de justificatione proprie dicta sic considerandum est, quod
   justitia potest accipi prout est in habitu vel prout est in actu, et
   secundum hoc justificatio dupliciter dicitur. Uno quidem modo secundum
   quod homo fit justus adipiscens habitum justitia. Alio veto modo,
   secundum quod opera justitiæ operatur, ut secundum hoc justificatio
   nihil aliud sit quam justitiæ exsecutio. Justitia autem, sicut aliæ
   virtutes, potest accipi et acquisita et infusa. Acquisita quidem
   causatur ex operibus, sed infusa causatur ab ipso deo per ejus gratiam,
   et hæc est vera justitia, secundum quam aliquis dicitur justus apud
   deum."

   [523] "Sicut gratia dividitur in operantem et cooperantem secundum
   diversos affectus, ita etiam in prævenientem et subsequentem,
   qualitercumque gratia accipiatur. Sunt autem quinque effectus gratiæ in
   nobis, quorum primus est ut anima sanetur, secundus est, ut bonum
   velit, tertius est, ut bonum quod vult efficaciter operetur, quartus
   est, ut in bono perseveret, quintus est, ut ad gloriam perveniat. Et
   ideo gratia secundum quod causat in nobis primum effectum, vocatur
   præveniens, respectu secundi effectus et prout causat in nobis
   secundum, vocatur subsequens respectu primi effectus."

   [524] "Cum donum gratiæ nihil aliud sit quam quædam participatio divinæ
   naturæ, quæ excedit omnem aliam naturam, ideo impossibile est quod
   aliqua creatura gratiam causet. Sic enim necesse est, quod solus deus
   deificet, communicando consortium divinæ naturæ per quandam
   similitudinis participationem, sicut impossibile est, quod aliquid
   igniat nisi solus ignis" (Art. 1).

   [525] The thought is this, that gratia as habituate donum dei requires
   a preparation, because (Aristotelian) "nulla forma potest esse nisi in
   materia disposita; sed si loquamur de gratia secundum quod significat
   auxilium dei moventis ad bonum (that is, the gratia prima), nulla
   præparatio requiritur ex parte hominis, quasi præveniens divinum
   auxilium." With this momentous distinction the dissolution of
   Augustinianism took its beginning.

   [526] Art. 3: "Præparatio hominis ad gratiam est a deo sicut a movente,
   a libero autem arbitrio sicut a moto . . . Secundum quod est a libero
   arbitrio, nullam necessitatem habet ad gratiæ consecutionem."

   [527] This also is a momentous, as it is also an Augustinian,
   proposition, due likewise to thinking of grace as gratia infusa
   (habitus). No doubt Thomas further explains, that ex parte finis the
   greatness of grace always remains the same ("conjungens hominem summo
   bono, quod est deus"). But "ex parte subjecti gratia potest suscipere
   magis vel minus, prout scil. unus perfectius illustratur a lumine
   gratiæ quam alius. Cujus diversitatis ratio quidem est aliqua ex parte
   præparantis se ad gratiam, qui enim magis se ad gratiam præparat
   pleniorem gratiam accipit." This position was the main source of
   disaster for the period that followed: there was naturally the growing
   tendency to think more of the præparatio than of the causa, and to
   overlook the addition which Thomas had appended: "sed hac ex parte non
   potest accipi prima ratio hujus diversitatis, quia præparatio ad
   gratiam non est hominis, nisi in quantum liberum arbitrium ejus
   præparatur a deo. Unde prima causa hujus diversitatis accipienda est ex
   parte ipsius dei, qui diversimode suæ gratiæ dona dispensat ad hoc quod
   ex diversis gradibus pulchritudo et perfectio ecclesiæ consurgat, sicut
   etiam diversos gradus rerum instituit, ut esset universum perfectum."
   This explanation manifestly leads in quite a different direction from
   the one mentioned first, with which it is associated; for in the case
   of the former it is really a question about a more or less, in the case
   of the latter, on the other hand, it is a question about varieties,
   which are necessary to the perfectness of the beautiful whole. But
   Thomas could unite the two explanations in accordance with his
   ontology, because, like Augustine, he regarded ultimately even the less
   good as necessary in the cosmic system, since it is just in this way
   that the beauty of the whole comes out in the manifoldness of its
   parts. Of course this reflection simply cancels the ethical mode of
   contemplation and transforms it into the æsthetic. Thus, so far as
   Thomas does not derive the existence of more or less grace from the
   dispositio (præparatio) hominis, but traces it rather to God, he knows
   only of æsthetic ways of justifying it (Art. 4).

   [528] This is the third momentous position (Art. 5): "Nullus potest
   scire, se habere gratiam, certitudinaliter; certitudo enim non potest
   haberi de aliquo, nisi possit dijudicari per proprium principium." No
   one is sure of a conclusion, who does not know the major premiss.
   "Principium autem gratiæ at objectum ejus est ipse deus, qui propter
   sui excellentiam est nobis ignotus." One can only ascertain the
   possession of grace conjecturaliter (per aliqua signa). But one can
   very well be sure of possessing scientia and fides, "non est autem
   similis ratio de gratia et caritate." We see here what ruin was wrought
   by the thought of gratia infusa as a mysterious habitus which is
   applied to the soul! But this habitus, of which one cannot be certain,
   corresponds with the deus ignotus!

   [529] Art. 3: "In eo, qui habet usum liberi arbitrii, non fit motio a
   deo ad justitiam absque motu liberi arbitrii, sed ita infundit donum
   gratiæ justificantis, quod etiam simul cum hoc movet liberum arbitrium
   ad donum gratiæ acceptandum in his, quæ sunt hujus motionis capaces."
   4: "deus movet animam hominis convertendo eam ad se ipsum . . . prima
   conversio ad deum fit per fidem . . . ideo motus fidei requiritur ad
   justificationem impii." 5: "recessus et accessus in motu liberi
   arbitrii accipitur secundum detestationem et desiderium . . . oportet
   igitur quod in justificatione impii sit motus liberi arbitrii duplex,
   unus quo per desiderium tendat in dei justitiam, et alius, quo
   detestetur peccatum."

   [530] It may be remarked, by the way, that here and there in the Middle
   Ages it is related that those specially endowed with grace detected
   (sensibiliter) the infusion of grace, felt with the sense of taste a
   sweetness, etc.

   [531] The exposition is again cosmological (Aristotelian): "Quod enim
   agens naturale non subito possit disponere materiam, contingit ex hoc,
   quod est aliqua proportio ejus quod in materia resistit ad virtutem
   agentis et propter hoc videmus, quod quanto virtus agentis fuerit
   fortior, tanto materia citius disponitur. Cum igitue virtus divina sit
   infinita, potest quamcunque materiam creatam subito disponere, etc.
   etc."

   [532] It shews itself, e.g., in the contradiction Art. 8 ad Primum,
   where he says: "Quia infusio gratiæ et remissio culpæ dicuntur ex parte
   dei justificantis, ideo ordine naturæ prior est gratiæ infusio quam
   culpæ remissio. Sed si sumantur ea quæ ex parte hominis justificati,
   est ex converso; nam prius est ordine naturæ liberatio a culpa, quam
   consecutio gratiæ justificantis." But only the one thing or the other
   holds good. It is the worst scholasticism to assert that the two views
   can be held together.

   [533] This is the religious robe that is thrown over the irreligious
   "merit." Thomas says that meritum and merces are the same = retributio
   as pretium of a deed. Justitia in the strict sense exists only inter
   eos, quorum est simpliciter æqualitas. Where therefore there is
   simpliciter justum, there is also simpliciter meritum vel merces. In
   other cases there exists at the most a meritum secundum quid (not
   justum). But between God and men there is the greatest inequality, and
   all goodness which man has springs from God; hence there is here, not a
   meritum simpliciter, but certainly a meritum "in quantum uterque
   operatur secundum modum suum." But the modus humanæ virtutis is
   appointed by God; "ideo meritum hominis apud deum esse non potest nisi
   secundum persuppositionem divinæ ordinationis, ita scil. ut id homo
   consequatur a deo per operationem quasi mercedem, ad quod deus ei
   virtutem operandi deputavit." Still it is to be noted here, that Thomas
   does not determine merit purely according to the arbitrary will of God;
   it is estimated rather by the faculty and end of man. Yet in the period
   that followed, there was an adhering always more closely, because it
   was more convenient, and because the conception of God admitted of it
   to pure arbitrariness as respects meritoriousness, and a relying on the
   Church's being initiated into the purposes of this arbitrariness. But
   in this article Thomas has a still further addition that is not without
   its significance; he continues: "Sicut etiam res naturales hoc
   consecuntur per proprios motus et operationes, ad quod a deo sunt
   ordinatæ, differenter tamen, quia creatura rationalis se ipsam movet ad
   agendum per liberum arbitrium. Unde sua actio habet rationem meriti,
   quod non est in aliis creaturis." It is implied therefore in the nature
   of free will that it acquires merits; in Art. 4, e.g., in addition to
   the thesis that the meritorious originates ex ordinatione divina,
   Thomas has made an independent use of this thesis.

   [534] "Nulla natura creata est sufficiens principium actus meritorii
   vitæ æternæ, nisi superaddatur aliquod supernaturale donum, quod gratia
   dicitur."

   [535] "Ex condigno" = in a truly meritorious way, as contrasted with
   "ex congruo" = in the way of a performance, to which, when a benevolent
   view is taken of it, a certain worth and therefore also a certain merit
   can he attributed.

   [536] Here in Arts. 5-7, as if by way of giving extra measure, Thomas
   introduces three chapters, in which he again expressly shows that one
   cannot merit the first grace, that one cannot merit it for another, and
   that one cannot merit even the reparatio post lapsum. But the sections
   are important, for the reason that the decided negative which Thomas
   here adopts everywhere was cancelled, or at least modified, in the
   period that followed. With regard to the first point, he explains most
   distinctly that "omne meritum repugnat gratiæ," hence: "nullus sibi
   mereri potest gratiam primam." But Thomas did not see that what holds
   good of the gratia prima holds good of all grace. Indeed the gratia
   prima, just because it has nothing to do with merit, is at bottom an
   extremely dark phenomenon for him, and this explains his passing over
   it so rapidly. He was himself accountable for it therefore, that in the
   period that followed even the communication of the gratia prima was
   attached to certain merits. The second point is important, because
   Thomas, in distinction from the later Schoolmen, here gives Christ the
   honour, and still keeps Mary and the saints in the background. He
   recalls first of all his expositions in Arts. 1 and 3, to the effect
   that in the meritorious works of the justified that which free will
   does is only a meritum de congruo, and then proceeds: "Ex quo patet,
   quod merito condigni nullus potest mereri alteri primam gratiam nisi
   solus Christus, quia unusquisque nostrum movetur a deo per donum
   gratiæ, ut ipsa ad vitam æternam perveniat, et ideo meritum condigni
   ultra hanc motionem non se extendit. Sed anima Christi mota est a deo
   per gratiam, non solum ut ipse perveniret ad gloriam vitæ æternæ, sed
   etiam ut alios in eam adduceret, in quantum est caput ecclesiæ. . . .
   Sed merito congrui potest aliquis alteri mereri primam gratiam. Quia
   enim homo in gratia constitutus implet dei voluntatem congruum est
   secundum amicitiæ proportionem, ut deus impleat hominis voluntatem in
   salvatione alterius." Thus the saints are certainly admitted by the
   back-door of meritum de congruo. Regarding the third point it is said:
   "Nullus potest sibi mereri reparationem post lapsum futurum, neque
   merito condigni, neque merito congrui"; for the former is excluded,
   because the grace that might be the ground of merit is lost by the Fall
   ("motione prioris gratiæ usque ad haec [viz., the Fall or the mortal
   sin] non se extendente"); the latter becomes in still higher degree an
   impossibility through the impedimentum peccati.

   [537] "Perseverantia vitæ non cadit sub merito, quia dependet solum ex
   motione divina, quæ est principium omnis meriti, sed deus gratis
   perseverantiæ bonum largitur cuicunque illud largitur."

   [538] See Summa I., Q. 23: Predestination is the providence of God in
   relation to creaturæ rationales; He alone can give them the ultimus
   finis, i.e., can "appoint their order." In virtue of His decree, God
   determines the numerus electorum, and in so far as it belongs to divine
   providence "aliquos permittere a vita æterna deficere," so also it
   belongs to it that God should reprobate some. "Sicut enim prædestinatio
   includit voluntatem conferendi gratiam et gloriam, ita reprobatio
   includit voluntatem permittendi aliquem cadere in culpam et inferendi
   damnationis poenam pro culpa" (Art. 3), nay, l.c., Thomas asserts with
   chilling sternness that the reprobatio is also a bonum: "Deus omnes
   homines diligit et etiam omnes creaturas, in quantum omnibus vult
   aliquod bonum; non tamen quodcunque bonum vult omnibus. In quantum
   igitur quibusdam non vult hoc bonum, quod est vita æterna, diciter eos
   habere odio vel reprobate." According to this, therefore, there is also
   a bonum which is no bonum (for the receiver), and so nothing but the
   divine will itself: God loves these men in hell! But on the other hand
   it is also said with Augustine: "Aliter se habet reprobatio in causando
   quam prædestinatio. Nam prædestinatio est causa et ejus quod expectatur
   in futura vita a prædestinatis, scil. gloriæ, et ejus quod percipitur
   in præsenti, scil. gratiæ; reprobatio vero non est causa ejus quod est
   in præsenti, scil. culpæ, sed est causa derelictionis a deo (this has
   not its source in prescience); est tamen causa ejus quod redditur in
   futuro, scil. poenæ acternæ. Sed culpa provenit ex libero arbitrio
   ejus, qui reprobatur et a gratia deseritur." But how shall he not sin
   if God has forsaken him? What does it avail to add: "reprobatio dei non
   subtrahit aliquid de potentia reprobati; unde cum dicitur quod
   reprobatur non potest gratiam adipisci, non est hoc intelligendum
   secundum impossibilitatem absolutam, sed secundum impossibilitatem
   conditionatam"? It was not easy for Thomas to construe the doctrine of
   free will, since in the doctrine of God he had applied throughout the
   thought of the sole divine causality; and in the doctrine of the
   gubernatio (I., Q. 103) had shown that, just like the principium mundi,
   so also the finis mundi is aliquid extra mundum (Art. 2). But if the
   world has no independent end, it follows that the gubernatio must be
   conceived of as implying that by Him alone all things are moved, i.e.,
   brought to their goal; for they themselves cannot move forward to that,
   quod est extrinsecum a toto universo. But by distinguishing the esse
   and operari, as also the primum movens in things and the movens ex se,
   and finally the gubernatio diversa in quantum ad creaturas irrationales
   and in quantum ad creaturas per se agentes, Thomas still succeeds in
   maintaining free will, which indeed he necessarily requires also, in
   order to get merit; see the discussion of freedom of will, I., 83 (Art.
   1: "Homo est liberi arbitrii, alioquin frustra essent consilia,
   exhortationes, præcepta, prohibitiones, præmia et poenæ. . . . Liberum
   arbitrium est causa sui motus, quia homo per liberum arbitrium seipsum
   movet ad agendum. Non tamen hoc est de necessitate libertatis, quod sit
   prima causa sui id quod liberum est, sicut nec ad hoc quod aliquid sit
   causa alterius, requiritur quod sit prima causa ejus. Deus igitur est
   prima causa movens et naturales causas et voluntarias. Et sicut
   naturalibus causis movendo eas non aufert, quin actus earum sint
   naturales, ita movendo causas voluntarias non aufert, quin actiones
   earum sint voluntariæ, sed potius hoc in eis facit; operatur in
   unoquoque secundum ejus proprietatem"). In accordance with this it is
   constantly emphasised in the determining paragraphs on justification
   that the process of grace realises itself with the consent of free
   will, which consent, however, is at the same time an effect of grace:
   when God infuses grace, He moves us according to our own proper nature,
   i.e., in such a way that He moves the free will to the willing
   acceptance of the gift of grace. The same thing is said of the virtues;
   on the one hand they are likewise infused; but on the other hand God
   never acts sine nobis, but always only with the assent of our free
   will; for the rational creature is so constituted that in its being
   impelled by God towards the goal, it must always be impelled
   consentiente voluntate.

   [539] Let us adduce here only a few of the determining positions. As
   had been the case already with Augustine, the "primitive state" created
   a special difficulty for Thomas, inasmuch as on the one hand eternal
   life was to be regarded as a gift of grace, while on the other hand it
   was held as certain that it could only be acquired through merit. It
   necessarily followed from this that the view taken of the primitive
   state was indeterminate; it was not quite conceived of as mere
   possibilitas boni (in the sense of the highest goodness, quod
   superexcedit naturam), but neither was it quite thought of as habitus
   boni. So Thomas, introducing the idea that the vita æterna is a bonum
   superexcedens naturam, described the natural equipment of Adam as
   insufficient for the obtaining of this good, and accordingly assumed
   that in creation there was given to him over and above the natural
   equipment a special gratia superaddita, by the help of which his free
   will should acquire for itself the merit which fits for eternal life;
   see I., Q. 95, Art. 1: Adam received grace at once at creation (not
   only afterwards) -- he was in gratia conditus -- for only grace could
   secure for him the rectitudo, which consists in the subordination of
   the ratio to God, of the inferiores virtutes to the ratio, of the body
   to the soul. But this subordination was not "rationalis"; for otherwise
   it would have continued after the Fall; so it was secundum
   supernaturale donum gratiæ. Note also Art. 4: "Homo etiam ante peccatum
   indigebat gratia ad vitam æternam consequendam, quæ est principalis
   necessitas gratiæ." But this view, still a religious one, had already
   many breaches made in it before Thomas' time, and these always
   increased in number; see below. A further result of this view was that
   Thomas was not able to identify the justilia originalis with the image
   of God, so far as this image is incapable of being lost, or say, to
   unite it with the innate end of human nature, but viewed it as a
   supernatural gift, which leads beyond the bonum naturale and the finis
   naturalis. The grounds for this view are easily discovered. They lie
   both in the purpose entertained that the coming into existence of merit
   shall be proved possible, and in the conceiving of merit as something
   supernatural; in short, in the regarding of asceticism as a state, or
   say opus, which is supernatural, meritorious, and which also conducts
   therefore to eternal life. If the supreme good cannot be so described
   that even the present life as an end is included in it, then nothing
   remains but to erect two stories, residence in the lower story simply
   serving the purpose of gathering merit for entering the higher. The sin
   which originated with Adam (inherited sin) is loss of the justitia
   originalis, and accordingly, as this latter alone effected the
   ordinatio partium, disorder, i.e., rebellion of the lower parts against
   the higher. On the other hand, the principia naturæ humanæ continue
   unaffected by the inherited sin, which is both a habitus and a culpa,
   and even the natural capacity of ratio to know and to will the good is
   only weakened but not eradicated. The chief sentences are (II., 1, Q.
   82-89): ". . . alio modo est habitus dispositio alicujus naturæ ex
   multis compositæ secundum quam bene se habet vel male ad aliud . . .
   hoc modo peccatum originale est habitus; est enim quædam inordinata
   dispositio proveniens ex dissolutione illius harmoniæ, in qua
   consistebat ratio originalis justitiæ, sicut ægritudo corporalis . . .
   unde peccatum originale languor naturæ dicitur" (this view is partly
   æsthetic partly, pathological, 82, 1). "Peccatum originale materialiter
   quidem est concupiscentia, formaliter vero est defectus originalis
   justitiæ;" the former is original sin, because the "inordinatio virium
   animæ præcipue in hoc attenditur, quod inordinate convertuntur ad bonum
   commutabile, quæ quidem inordinatio communi nomine potest dici
   concupiscentia" (82, 3). "Peccatum originale non magis in uno quam in
   alio esse potest" (82, 4). "Anima est subjectum peccati originalis, non
   autem caro . . . cum anima possit esse subjectum culpæ, caro autem de
   se non habeat quod sit subjectum culpæ, quidquid pervenit de
   corruptione primi peccati ad animam, habet rationem culpæ, quod autem
   pervenit ad carnem, non habet rationem culpæ, sed poenæ" (83, 1).
   "Peccatum originale per prius respicit voluntatem" (83, 3). "Cupiditas
   est radix omnium peccatorum" (84, 1); but, on the other hand, it holds
   good: "quoniam inordinate se homo ad temporalia convertens semper
   singularem quandam perfectionem et excellentiam tamquam finem
   desiderat, recte ex hac parte superbia, quæ inordinatus est propriæ
   excellentiæ appetitus, initium omnis peccati ponitur" (84, 2). With
   regard to the consequences of sin: "Principia naturæ (primum bonum
   naturæ) nec tolluntur nec diminuuntur per peccatum
   (empirico-psychological observation, to which, however, a certain worth
   also is given for the religious mode of apprehension), inclinatio ad
   virtutem a natura insita (secundum bonum naturale) diminuitur per
   peccatum (ethical observation, but important for religion), donum
   originalis justitiæ (tertium bonum naturæ) totaliter est ablatum"
   (religious view, v. 85, 1). That sin can ever remove totally the
   inclinatio of the ratio ad bonum is described as unthinkable, since,
   according to Augustine, "malum non est nisi in bono" (85, 2). "Omnes
   vires animæ remanent quodammodo destitutæ proprio ordine, quo
   naturaliter ordinantur ad virtutem, et ipsa destitutio dicitur
   vulneratio naturæ (vulnus ignorantiæ, malitiæ, infirmitatis,
   concupiscentiæ" v. 85, 3). "Mors et omnes defectus corporales
   consequentes sunt quædam poenæ originalis peccati, quamvis non sint
   intenti a peccanti" (85, 5). Death is natural to man secundum naturam
   universalem, non quidem a parte formæ, sed materiæ (85, 6). Q. 86
   treats de macula peccati; Q. 87 de reatu poenæ; P. 88 and 89 de peccato
   veniali et mortali.

   [540] See the voluminous exposition in S. II., 2 Q. 184-189, "de statu
   perfectionis" (bishops and monks), where in Q. 184, Art. 2, the triplex
   perfectio is described, and it is said of that which is possible here
   on earth, that it is not indeed attainable that one "in actu semper
   feratur in deum," but it is attainable that "ab affectu hominis
   excluditur non solum illud quod est caritati contrarium, sed etiam omne
   illud quod impedit ne affectus mentis totaliter dirigatur ad deum"; the
   whole idea of the consilia in particular of virginitas already in
   Pseudo-Cyprian (=Novatian) de bono pud. 7: "Virginitas quid aliud est
   quam futuræ vitæ gloriosa meditatio?"

   [541] It may also be traced back to Augustine that from Thomas, as has
   been already remarked, the specific nature of grace propter Christum
   and per Christum never receives clear expression in the whole doctrine
   of grace. The connection is simply now and again asserted, but is not
   distinctly demonstrated, while the whole doctrine of grace is treated
   completely prior to the doctrine of the person of Christ. Is that
   accidental? No, certainly not! It comes out here again, that in the
   West, because the Mystic-Cyrillian theory was not maintained
   (Soterology and Soteriology as identical), there had come to be -- in
   spite of Anselm -- entire uncertainty as to how really Christology was
   to be dogmatically utilised. The only possible solution was not found,
   namely in adhering, without theoretic speculation, to the impression
   produced by the person who awakens spirit and life, certainty and
   blessedness.

   [542] Therefore faith also, and forgiveness of sins play, in spite of
   all that is said of them, an insignificant part. Faith is either fides
   informis, that is, not yet faith, or fides formata, that is, no longer
   faith. Faith as inward fiducia is a transitional stage.

   [543] Just in the doctrines of grace and sin did the Scotists gain more
   and more the upper hand; as regards the other doctrines, their
   dialectico-sceptical investigations were crowned with a smaller measure
   of success.

   [544] Schwane, 1.c., p. 379 f., S. II., Q. 96, membr. 1: "Alii ponunt,
   ipsum (Adam) fuisse conditum solummodo in naturalibus, non in gratuitis
   gratum facientibus et hoc magis sustinendum est et magis est rationi
   consonum . . . Sic noluit deus gratiam dare nisi præambulo merito
   congrui per bonum usum naturæ."

   [545] See Schwane, p. 383.

   [546] See Schwane, p. 384.

   [547] L. C., p. 391. Werner, Scotus, p. 410 ff. Scotus himself says:
   "Adam conditus fuit sine omni peccato et sine gratia gratum faciente"
   (Report, Par. III. D. 13, Q. 2, n. 3)

   [548] De conceptu virg. 27: "Hoc peccatum, quod originale dico, aliud
   intellegere nequeo in infantibus nisi ipsam, factam per inobedientiam
   Adæ, justitiæ debitæ nuditatem, per quam omnes filii sunt iræ: quoniam
   et naturam accusat spontanea quam fecit in Adam justitiæ desertio, nec
   personas excusat recuperandi impotentia. Quam comitatur beatitudinis
   quoque nuditas, ut sicut sunt sine omni justitia, ita sint absque omni
   beatitudine." C. 22: "Peccatum Adæ ita in infantes descendere, ut sic
   puniri pro eo debeant ac si ipsi singuli illud fecissent personaliter
   sicut Adam, non puto." Hence also the idea of the limbus infantium now
   came always more prominently in view. But the rejection of the
   damnation of infants overturns the whole of Augustinianism.

   [549] Comm. in Sent. II., Dist. 30 Q. 2: Original sin cannot be
   concupiscence; for the latter is (1) natural, (2) " . . . tum quia non
   est actualis, quia tunc illa concupiscentia esset actualis, non
   habitualis, quia habitus derelictus in anima ex peccato mortali non est
   peccatum mortale, manet enim talis habitus dimisso peccato per
   pænitentiam; nec etiam ignorantia est, quia parvulus baptizatus ita
   ignorat sicut non baptizatus." One is now eager to hear what original
   sin then is, and the answer is received (D. 32, with an appeal to
   Anselm): "carentia justitiæ debitæ." "Et si obicitur, quod aliqui
   sancti videntur dicere concupiscentiam esse peccatum originale,
   respondeo: concupiscentia potest accipi vel prout est actus vel habitus
   vel pronitas in appetitu sensitivo et nullum istorum est formaliter
   peccatum, quia non est peccatum in parte sensitiva secundum Anselmum.
   Vel potest accipi, prout est pronitas in appetitu rationali, i.e., in
   voluntate ad concupiscendum delectabilia immoderate, quæ nata est
   condelectari appetitui sensitivo, cui conjungitur. Et hoc modo
   concupiscentia est materiale peccati originalis, quia per carentiam
   justitiæ originalis, quæ erat sicut frenum cohibens ipsam ab immoderata
   delectatione, ipsa non positive, sed per privationem, fit prona ad
   concupiscendum immoderate delectabilia." Very loose also is Dun's
   conception of the first sin of man (of Adam) as distinguished from the
   sin of the angels; it did not arise from uncontrolled self-love, but
   had its root in uncontrolled love for the partner associated with him
   (Werner, p. 412); this uncontrolled conjugal love, however, was (1) not
   libidinous, for in the primitive state there was no bad libido; (2) the
   act to which Adam allowed himself to be led was not in its nature an
   immoral act, but only transgression of a command imposed for the
   purpose of testing. Adam accordingly sinned only indirectly against the
   command to love God, and at the same time transgressed the law of
   neighbourly love by over-passing, through his pliancy, the proper
   limit. That is a comparatively slight fault, and is not equal in its
   gravity to the smallest violation of a natural rule of morality.
   Compare with this empiristic view Augustine's or Anselm's description
   of the greatness of the first sin! In order to see clearly the
   Pelagianism of Scotus, it must still be added that he disputed the
   doctrine of Thomas, that in the state of justitia originalis even the
   smallest venial sin was unthinkable. According to him only mortal sins
   were impossible; on the other hand, as man in his original state was
   just man, such sins were quite well possible as do not entail directly
   the loss of righteousness, but only occasion a delay in arriving at the
   final goal. How small according to this view, in spite of all
   assertions to the contrary, is the significance of the first sin and of
   original sin! In a disguised way Duns taught, as did Julian of Eklanum,
   that on the one hand there belongs to the natural will the quality that
   leads it to turn to the good without effort, while on the other hand,
   because it is the will of man, the possibility of "small sins" was
   given even in the original state! Occam draws here again the ultimate
   conclusions (v. Werner II., pp. 318 f.). As everything is arbitrary, he
   asserts on the one hand that we must not dispute that it is in God's
   power to remit to the sinner the guilt of sin, and bestow upon him
   saving grace without repentance and contrition; on the other hand, he
   denies all inner ideal necessary connection between moral guilt and
   penalty or expiation. "In this way," Werner justly remarks,
   "theological Scholasticism arrived at the opposite extreme to the idea
   expressed in the Anselmic theory of satisfaction of the inviolability
   of a holy order, whose absolute law of righteousness implies, that God
   can only remit the reatus poenæ æternæ at the cost of a supreme
   atonement, the making of which transcends all the powers of a mere
   creature." But it was not from laxity that Occam destroyed the
   principles of Augustinianism; there met in combination in him rather
   two clearly recognisable factors, "the absolute lack of an ideal
   understanding of the world" (or let us say more correctly, his
   philosophic empiricism), and the greatest interest in determining the
   necessity of the saving grace of Christ simply from revelation itself.
   But -- vestigia terrent; we can learn by studying the historical
   consequences of Occamism, that thinking humanity will not continue to
   he satisfied, if religion is set before it simply as revelation, and
   all links are severed which bind this revelation with an understanding
   of the world. From Occam it either goes back again to Thomas
   (Bradwardine and his spiritual descendants, cf. also the Platonism of
   the fifteenth century) or passes on to Socinianism. But should it not
   be possible that the history of religion should henceforward render to
   thoughtful reflection the service that has hitherto been rendered to it
   by Plato's and Augustine's and Thomas's understanding of the world? We
   shall not be able certainly to dispense with an absolute, but it will
   be grasped as an experience. The Nominalism that sought to deliver the
   Christian religion from the "science" that perverted it made a
   disastrous failure in carrying on this rightly chosen task, because it
   understood by religion subjection to an enormous mass of material,
   which, having arisen in history, admits of no isolation.

   [550] Sent. II., Dist. 31, A. B.: "caro sola ex traduce est." With
   Augustine the propagation of inherited sin is derived from the pleasure
   in the act of generation "unde caro ipsa, quæ concipitur in vitiosa
   concupiscentia polluitur et corrumpitur: ex cujus contactu anima, cum
   infunditur, maculam trahit, qua polluitur et fit rea, i.e., vitium
   concupiscentiæ, quod est originale peccatum."

   [551] So, I think, must Anselm also be understood, de conc. virg. 23.

   [552] Adam's sinful will (as the will of the primus movens in humanity)
   is the expression of the universal will; see II., 1, Q. 81, Art. 1:
   "Inordinatio quæ est in isto homine ex Adam generato, non est
   voluntaria voluntate ipsius, sed voluntate primi parentis, qui movet
   motione generationis omnes qui ex ejus origine derivantur." Hence
   inherited sin is not personal sin, but peccatum naturæ, the effect of
   which really is that its significance and gravity are greatly lessened.

   [553] In Sentent. II., Dist. 29. See at the same place the passage
   showing that the "voluntas in puris naturalibus habet justitiam
   originalem."

   [554] Bonaventura (in Sentent. I., Dist. 40, Art. 2, Q. I) asks: "an
   prædestinatio inferat salatis necessitatem?" He answers: "prædestinatio
   non infert necessitatem saluti nec infert necessitatem libero arbitrio.
   Quoniam prædestinatio non est causa salutis nisi includendo merita
   (complete apostasy from Augustine), et ita salvando liberum arbitrium
   (that is ambiguous). Ad intelligentiam autem objectorum notandum, quod
   prædestinatio duo importat, et rationem præscientiæ et rationem causæ.
   In quantum dicit rationem causæ, non necessario ponit effectum, quia
   non est causa per necessitatem, sed per voluntatem, et iterum non est
   tota causa, sed cum alia causa contingente, scil. cum libero arbitrio.
   Et regula est, quod quotiescumque effectus pendet ex causa necessaria
   et variabili -- a necessaria tamquam ab universali, a variabili tamquam
   a particulari -- denominatur a variabili (in this way predestination is
   set aside), quia denominatio est a causa particulari, et effectus, quia
   dependet a causa contingente, est contingens. Et præter rationem causæ
   importat rationem præscientiæ et præscientia quidem totum includit in
   cognitione liberum arbitrium et ejus cooperationem et vertibilitatem et
   totum. Et præterea non est nisi veri, et etiam de vero contingente est
   infallibilis." Duns' doctrine of predestination is very complicated. It
   is dependent on his conception of God, which includes a determinism of
   arbitrariness (see Ritschl, l.c., I., pp. 58 f., 64). But just because
   the all-working God is always the contingently working will, the
   possibility of there being contingency in the world is disclosed. God
   embraces this contingency only with His prescience, and this prescience
   embraces the possible equally with the actual. The effect of this is,
   not only that predestination, as having unity, and as being inwardly
   motived, is cancelled, but that God appears no longer as the absolute
   Being who wills and can do one thing, but as the relative Being who, in
   an unfathomable way, wills and can do everything possible. Over against
   such a conception of God the will of man can assert itself not only as
   free, but also as relatively good, and so predestination and the grace
   that is the alone cause vanish, or rather predestination remains, in so
   far as absolute contingency and absolute arbitrariness coincide; see in
   Sent. I., Dist. 40, in resol: "Prædestinatio bifariam accipitur. Primo
   et proprie pro actu divinæ voluntatis, quo rationalem creaturam ad
   æternam eligit vitam seu decernit ac determinat se daturum in præsenti
   gratiam et gloriam in futuro. Secundo accipitur fusius pro actu etiam
   intellectus divini, pro præcognitione vid. quam habet deus salutis
   electorum, quæ quidem præcognitio concomitatur et consequitur
   electionem. Divina autem voluntas circa ipsas creaturas libere et
   contingenter se habet. Quocirca contingenter salvandos prædestinat, et
   posset eosdem non prædestinare. . . . Ex quo consequitur, quod is qui
   damnatus est damnari possit, quandoquidem ob ejus prædestinationem non
   est ejus voluntas in bonum confirmata, ut peccare nequeat."

   [555] From Bradwardine's preface to his treatise de causa dei c.
   Pelagium Münscher quotes the following passage: "In hac causa, quot,
   domine, hodie cum Pelagio pro libero arbitrio contra gratuitam gratiam
   tuam pugnant, et contra Paulum pugilem gratiæ spiritualem! Quot etiam
   hodie gratuitam gratiam tuam fastidiunt solumque liberum arbitrium ad
   salutem sufficere stomachantur! aut si gratia utantur, vel perfunctorie
   necessariam eam simulant ipsamque se jactant liberi sui arbitrii
   viribus promereri, ut sic saltem nequaquam gratuita, sed vendita
   videatur! Quot etiam, deus omnipotens, impotentes de sui potestate
   arbitrii præsumentes tuæ cooperationis auxilium in operationibus suis
   recusant, dicendo cum impiis recede a nobis' . . . Quin immo et
   voluntati suæ in contingenter futuris omnimodam tribuunt libertatem, in
   tantum ut etiam contra vocem propheticam a tua subjectione exemptionem
   prætendant . . . Et quot et quam innumerabiles eis favent! Totus etenim
   poene mundus post Pelagian: abiit in errorem. Exsurge igitur, domine,
   judica causam tuam et sustinentem te sustine, protege, robora,
   consolare! Scis enim quod nusquam virtute mea, sed tua confisus,
   tantillus adgredior tantam causam." It is easily seen that here, as in
   the case of Gottschalk, the spirit and style of Augustine have
   exercised an influence. But Bradwardine and all the Reformers after him
   and previous to Luther simply went back upon Augustine (Wyclif, Huss,
   Wesel, Wessel, Staupitz, etc.). Just on that account this movement
   issued, not in the Evangelical Reformation, but in the Articles of
   Trent, or, in Bajus and Jansen; see Ritschl, Rechtfertigung, 1 vol., 2.
   ed., pp. 105-140. Ritschl begins these discussions with the not quite
   accurate words: "The effort will be fruitless to point out in any
   theologian of the Middle Ages the Reformation conception of the
   doctrine of justification, that is to say, the deliberate
   distinguishing between justificatio and regeneratio." Bradwardine's
   doctrine of free will has been treated in detail by Werner (III., p.
   270 ff.). Conscious in the highest degree that it was a question about
   the articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiæ, Bradwardine revived
   Augustine's doctrine of the incapacity of free will. Whether he really
   contracted the horizon of the Augustinian theology by tracing back its
   contents to the doctrines of the immutability of the divine thought and
   will as being its ultimate fundamental import (Werner, p. 282 ff. ), is
   a question I leave undiscussed. Certainly to me also the determinism
   seems to come out more strongly in Bradwardine than in Augustine; but
   Werner has an interest in separating Bradwardine as far as possible
   from Augustine, Anselm, and Thomas, because his doctrine led to Wyclif,
   and to that Augustinianism which Catholic theology no longer tolerates,
   though, as a fact, it is the genuine Augustinianism. Yet neither can
   these theologians, on the other hand, make use of the pure Nominalism
   of Occam. Hence Bradwardine is recognised, so far as he became "an
   involuntary witness (?) as it were, for the necessity of a restoration
   of the ecclesiastical Scholasticism on a Thomist basis."

   [556] In germ the fides implicita was contained from the beginning in
   the Western system as a factor to which religious value was attributed.
   But only in Nominalism did this germ open into blossom.

   [557] See Werner I., p. 418 ff. In Sentent. II., Dist. 28, Q. 1,
   Question: "How can God forgive guilt without giving grace? videretur
   enim esse mutatio in deo, si non ponatur in ipso justificato. Potest
   illa opinio confirmari per hoc, quod illud præceptum Diliges dominum
   deum, etc.,' est primum, a quo tota lex pendet et prophetæ. Ad actum
   igitur hujus præcepti aliquando eliciendum (actus elicitus dilectionis,
   rationis) tenetur voluntas; ita quod non potest esse semper omissio
   actus hujus præcepti sine peccato mortali. Quodcumque autem voluntas
   actum hujus præcepti exsequitur, licet informis, et disponit se de
   congruo ad gratiam gratificantem sibi oblatam, vel resistet et peccabit
   mortaliter, vel consentiet et justificabitur." In the following way the
   Augustinian position that meritum is the munus dei is justified (Dist.
   17, Q. 1 in Resol.): "in actu meritorio duo sunt consideranda. Primum
   illud quod præcedit rationem meritorii, in quo includitur substantia et
   intentio actus ac rectitudo moralis. Secundum est ratio meritorii, quod
   est esse acceptum a divina voluntate, aut acceptabile, sive dignum
   acceptari ad præmium æternum. Quantum ad primum, potentia est causa
   prima et principalis, et habitus causa secunda, cum potentia utatur
   habitu, non e converso; alias habens semel gratiam nunquam posset
   peccare, cum causa secunda semper sequatur motionem causæ primæ, nec
   possit movere ad oppositum illius, ad quod causa prima inclinat. Sed
   accipiendo actum in quantum est meritorius talis conditio ei convenit
   principaliter ab habitu et minus principaliter a voluntate. Magis
   siquidem actus acceptatur ut dignus præmio, quia est elicitus a
   caritate, quam quia est a voluntate libere elicitus, quamvis utrumque
   necessario requiratur . . . Actus meritorius est in potestate hominis
   supposita generali influentia, si habuerit liberi arbitrii usum et
   gratiam, sed completio in ratione meriti non est in potestate hominis
   nisi dispositive, sic tamen dispositive quod ex dispositione divina
   nobis revelata"; observe here the yes and no which comes out in these
   distinctions. Consequently Bradwardine was right in fixing down the
   following errors in the reigning Scholasticism: (1) While denying that
   the meritum is causa principalis doni gratiæ, it asserts that it is
   causa sine qua non; (2) while denying that man can of himself merit
   saving grace, it asserts that he can prepare himself for it in a way
   required of him, and that God then gives His grace, because even in
   naturalibus the forma is at once given to the materia disposita; (3)
   while denying that man can, strictly speaking, initiate the saving
   process, it asserts that he consents and follows ex propriis viribus;
   (4) it asserts that man merits divine grace ex congruo (c. Pelag. 39),
   "et quia iste error est famosior ceteris his diebus, et nimis multi per
   ipsum in Pelagianum præcipitium dilabuntur, necessarium videtur ipsum
   diligentiori examine perscrutari." The situation at the beginning of
   the sixteenth century is excellently described by Ritschl thus (I., p.
   138): "The state of things in respect of public doctrine which the
   Reformation found existing was not apprehended and represented by the
   two sides with historical precision and justice. The theological
   opponents of the Reformation, who were exclusively Realists, entirely
   ignore the fact, that for a century and a half the Nominalist School
   had maintained the Pelagian doctrine with regard to merita de congruo,
   and had over-rated the merita de condigno as compared with the merit of
   Christ, that as a School they had won equal public rights with the
   Realists, and even in respect of science and practice had exercised a
   far-reaching influence on the latter. The Reformers on the other hand
   directed their reproaches and charges of Pelagianism, which should have
   applied only to the Nominalist tradition, against Scholasticism in
   general."

   [558] II., P. 339 f.

   [559] The Catholic precautionary position lies simply in this, that God
   need give the vita æterna to no one at all, but that that life is in
   every case an arbitrary gift, the source of which is an ordained
   arrangement. This precautionary position, however, has nothing to do
   with the question about sin and guilt, but originates in the general
   doctrine of God.

   [560] The Pelagian motives underlying the doctrine of Mary are pretty
   much concealed in Scholasticism, but they are clearly apparent on
   closer inspection. The treatment, moreover, of the doctrine of the
   human soul of Christ by Scotus and the Scotists is also a beautiful
   demonstration of their Pelagianism, but the description here of this
   complicated line of doctrinal development would take us too far; see
   Werner I., p. 427 ff.; II., p. 330 ff. What alone reconciles us in the
   marialogy is the observing that pious faith allows itself utterances
   about the relationship of Mary to God and Christ which it does not
   venture to make about its own relationship. In this sense -- though it
   appears paradoxical -- there is much that is evangelical in the
   doctrine of Mary. It would be an interesting task to prove this from
   the doctrine of Mary as taught by the Schoolmen individually.

   [561] The history of the worship of Mary is throughout a history in
   which the superstitious religion of the congregations and the monks
   worked upwards from its dark foundations, and determined theology,
   which reluctantly submitted; but, on closer view, this is seen to hold
   good of almost all specifically Western Catholic practices and
   doctrines. The paradosis agraphos, the tradition, which is now claimed
   as the papal, that has existed semper, ubique et apud omnes, is the
   common superstition, which everywhere and always expressed itself in
   analogous forms. In this sense the Catholic position cannot be
   disputed, that the Romish Church is the Church of stable, and yet at
   the same time living, tradition. This tradition is stable, because the
   lower religious instincts, which are compounded of fear and
   sensuousness, are stable; it is living, because theology by its devices
   gradually legitimised these instincts. This does not of course imply
   the denial, that apart from this there was another and higher content
   in the Catholic tradition. For the literature on the worship of Mary
   see Vol. IV., p. 314, and Reusch, Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1887, No. 7.

   [562] A monk relates that Bernard, who appeared to him in a dream,
   regretted and retracted his doubts about the immaculate conception (see
   Werner II., p. 349, f.)

   [563] III. Dist. 3, Q. 1, n. 4 sq. Werner I., p. 460.

   [564] III. Dist. 3, Q. 1, n. 7, 12. Werner I., p. 462. On the attitude
   of the later Scotists, l.c. II., p. 347 f. Two sanctifications of Mary
   were assumed, the first at the moment of her being conceived
   (extinction of original sin, i.e., of the fomes peccati), the second at
   the moment of her conceiving (impossibilitas peccandi). Occam adopted
   this double sanctification also, but made less of its effects, because
   he did not rate very highly the peccatum originis itself.

   [565] Special proofs of the worship of saints and relics are not
   necessary, as Scholasticism added nothing of importance to the practice
   and theory that prevailed even from early times. The doctrine of the
   saints was attached in the closest way to the doctrine of the consilia.
   The intercession of the saints was proved from the idea of the
   connection of the earthly Church with the heavenly; on their merita,
   see the doctrine of indulgences. Thomas was here also the ruling
   authority as a teacher, and by his doctrine of the merits of the saints
   he prepared the way for the Pelagianism of the Scotists.

   [566] Thomas, S. III., Q. 25, Art. 5. Thomas claimed latreia for the
   cross and the image of Christ, III., Q. 25, Arts. 3 and 4; see also
   II., 1 Q. 103, Art. 4.

   [567] Bernard is also fond of variations on the thought that the Son
   will hear the mother, the Father the Son. "Hæc peccatorum scala, hæc
   mea maxima fiducia est, hæc tota ratio spei meæ." The Son cannot refuse
   to hear the mother; for the "invenisti gratiam apud deum" is still in
   force. These thoughts passed over in succum et sanguinem of
   Catholicism; they were disseminated especially by the Franciscans.

   [568] On the proof, see Werner I., pp. 433 f., 435 ff.; II. 352 ff. In
   Duns the idea coheres with his general zoological ideas; yet for him it
   has also independent significance.

       instrumentaliter, sicut et de aliis sacramentis patet; in quantum

       dilectione patris et etiam ex dilectione proximi, cæremonialia veto
       præcepta legis, quæ ad sacrificia et oblationes præcipue
       ordinantur, implevit Christus sua passione, in quantum omnia
       antiqua sacrificia fuerunt figuræ illius veri sacrificii, quod
       Christus obtulit moriendo pro nobis. . . . Præcepta vero judicialia
       legis, quæ præcipue ordinantur ad satisfaciendam injuriam passis,
       implevit Christus sue passione, permittens se ligno affigi pro pomo

     * Cum dicitur fides mereri justificationem et vitam æternam, ex ea
       ratione dictum accipitur, quia per actum fidei meretur illa.
       Similiter de caritate et justitia et de aliis accipitur. Si enim
       fides ipsa virtus præveniens diceretur esse mentis actus qui est
       meritum, jam ipsa ex libero arbitrio originem haberet, quod quia
       non est, sic dicitur esse meritum, quia actus ejus est meritum, si
       tamen adsit caritas, sine qua nec credere nec sperare meritum vitæ
       est. Unde apparet vere quia caritas est spiritus s., qui animæ
       qualitates informat et sanctificat, ut eis anima informetur et
       sanctificetur, sine qua animæ qualitas non dicitur virtus, quia non
       valet sanare animam.: [92]1
     * Cum enim peccatum transiens actu, remaneat reatu, non est idem
       resurgere a peccato, quod cessare ab actu peccati, sed resurgere a

     * Cum ex gratia dicuntur esse bona merita et incipere . . . gratia
       gratis data intelligitur, ex qua bona merita incipiunt. Quæ cum ex
       sola gratia esse dicantur, non excluditur liberum arbitrium, quia
       nullum meritum est in homine, quod non fit per liberum arbitrium:
       [94]1
     * Cum ex gratia dicuntur esse bona merita et incipere, aut
       intelligitur gratia gratis dans, i.e.: [95]1
     * Cum in matrimonio datur homini ex divina institutione facultas

     * Cur deus homo: [97]1 [98]2
     * Cur non credamus et animas sanctorum dei faciem contemplantium in

     * Curia: [100]1

     * De pænitentia loqui possumus dupliciter. Uno modo quantum ad

       operantibus . . . alio modo possumus loqui de pænitentia quantum ad
       actus quibus deo operanti in pænitentia cooperamur. Quorum actuum
       primum principium est dei operatio convertentis cor, secundus actus
       est motus fidei, tertius est motus timoris servilis, quo quis
       timore suppliciorum a peccatis retrahitur: [102]1
     * Deum et animam scire cupio. Nihilne plus? Nihil omnino: [103]1
     * Deus diligit omnes homines quantum ad naturam quam ipse fecit, odit
       tamen eos quantum ad culpam . . ., non dicendum, quod passio
       Christi dicitur quantum ad hoc, deo nos reconciliasse, quod de novo
       nos amare inciperet, sed quia per passionem Christi sublata est
       odii causa, tum per ablationem peccati tum per recompensationem
       acceptabilioris beneficii: [104]1
     * Deus omnes homines diligit et etiam omnes creaturas, in quantum
       omnibus vult aliquod bonum; non tamen quodcunque bonum vult
       omnibus. In quantum igitur quibusdam non vult hoc bonum, quod est
       vita æterna, diciter eos habere odio vel reprobate: [105]1
     * Dicendum quod etiam per fidem applicatur nobis passio Christi ad
       percipiendum fructum ipsius, secundum illud Rom. 3: [106]1
     * Dico, quod bonus motus præcedens sacramentum pænitentiæ tantum est
       attritio et dispositio de congruo ad deletionem culpæ et infusionem
       gratiæ, quæ remissio culpæ et collatio gratiæ sunt in virtute
       sacramenti pænitentiæ et non in virtute attritionis tantum, nisi
       dispositive. Sed hæc attritio post collationem gratiæ, quæ
       confertur in susceptione sacramenti, fit contritio formata.: [107]1
     * Dixerunt antiqui dicentes, quod est opus operans et opus operatum.
       Opus operans est, quod est in operante virtutis opus vel a virtute
       elicitum vel quod est essentialis actus virtutis, et sine illo
       nihil valet virtus ad salutem. Opus autem operatum est extrinsecum
       factum quod apothelesma vocant sancti, sicut operatum legis est
       sacrificium factum vel circumcisio facta vel tale aliquid.: [108]1
     * Duplex est pænitentia; quædam quæ solummodo consistit in
       contritione, quædam quæ consistit in contritione, confessione,
       satisfactione; utraque est sacramentum. : [109]1
     * Duplici ratione celebratio hujus sacramenti dicitur immolatio
       Christi. Primo quidem quia, sicut dicit Augustinus ad Simplic.
       solent imagines earum rerum nominibus appellari, quarum imagines
       sunt . . . celebratio autem hujus sacramenti, sicut supra dictum
       est (Q. 79, Art. 1. 3), imago quædam est representativa passionis
       Christi quæ est vera ejus immolatio. Et ideo celebratio hujus
       sacramenti dicitur Christi immolatio (here, therefore, there is an
       expression only of symbol and remembrance). Alio modo quantum ad
       effectum passionis Christi, quia scil. per hoc sacramentum
       participes efficimur fructus dominicæ passionis, unde in quadam
       dominicali oratione secreta dicitur: Quoties hujus hostiæ
       commemoratio celebratur, opus nostræ redemptionis exercetur.
       Quantum igitur ad primum modum poterat dici Christus immolari etiam
       in figuris Veteris Testamenti . . . sed quantum ad secundum modum
       proprium est huic sacramento, quod in ejus celebratione Christus
       immolatur.: [110]1
     * Ecce Homo: [111]1
     * Ecce homo: [112]1 [113]2
     * Ecce quam varia a doctoribus super his traduntur, et in hac tanta
       varietate quid tenendum sit? Hoc sane dicere ac sentire possumus,
       quod solus deus peccata dimittit et retinet, : [114]1
     * Ecclesia: [115]1
     * Effectus augmentum gratiæ, ut quis sit idoneus minister.: [116]1
     * Effectus sacramentorum sunt secundum dispositionem suscipientis et
       secundum requisitam illi intentioni dispositionem. . . . Dispositio
       vero requisita huic sacramento, ut efficax fiat, est fames et sitis
       hujus vivifici cibi et potus. Unde quanto minus eum esurit et
       sitit, pro tanto minorem etiam effectum consequitur.: [117]1
     * Ego Berengarius corde credo et ore confiteor panem et vinum quæ
       ponuntur in altari : [118]1
     * Ergo si deviat terrena potestas, judicabitur a potestate
       spirituali, sed si deviat spiritualis minor, a suo superiori, si
       vero suprema, a solo deo, non ab homine poterit judicari, testante
       apostolo: [119]1
     * Est articulus fidei, quod deus assumpsit naturam humanam. Non
       includit contradictionem deum assumere naturam asininam; : [120]1
     * Est autem hæc auctoritas, etsi data sit homini et exerceatur per
       hominem, non humana sed potius divina, ore divino Petro data
       sibique suisque successoribus in ipso quem confessus fuit petra
       firmata, dicente domino ipsi Petro: [121]1
     * Est autem in nobis duplex actus; primus quidem interior voluntatis;
       et quantum ad istum actum, voluntas se habet ut mota, deus autem ut
       movens, et præsertim cum voluntas incipit bonum velle, quæ prius
       malum volebat. Et ideo secundum quod deus movet humanam mentem ad
       hunc actum, dicitur gratia operans. : [122]1
     * Et si obicitur, quod aliqui sancti videntur dicere concupiscentiam
       esse peccatum originale, respondeo: concupiscentia potest accipi
       vel prout est actus vel habitus vel pronitas in appetitu sensitivo
       et nullum istorum est formaliter peccatum, quia non est peccatum in
       parte sensitiva secundum Anselmum. Vel potest accipi, prout est
       pronitas in appetitu rationali, i.e.: [123]1
     * Ex condigno: [124]1
     * Ex hoc sacramento non semper sequitur corporalis sanatio, sed
       quando expedit ad spiritualem sanationem. Et tunc semper eam
       inducit, dummodo non sit impedimentum ex parte recipientes: [125]1
     * Ex quo patet, quod merito condigni nullus potest mereri alteri
       primam gratiam nisi solus Christus, quia unusquisque nostrum
       movetur a deo per donum gratiæ, ut ipsa ad vitam æternam perveniat,
       et ideo meritum condigni ultra hanc motionem non se extendit. Sed
       anima Christi mota est a deo per gratiam, non solum ut ipse
       perveniret ad gloriam vitæ æternæ, sed etiam ut alios in eam
       adduceret, in quantum est caput ecclesiæ. . . . : [126]1
     * Experto crede, aliquid amplius invenies in silvis, quam in libris.
       Ligna et lapides docebunt, quod a magistris audire non possis.:
       [127]1
     * Exultate deo: [128]1
     * Fateor quod indulgentiæ papales, si ita se habeant ut dicuntur,
       sapiunt manifestam blasphemiam. Dicitur enim, quod papa prætendit,
       se habere potentiam ad salvandum singulos viatores, et
       quantumcunque viantes deliquerint, nedum ad mitigandum poenas ad
       suffragandum eis cum absolutionibus et indulgentiis, ne unquam
       veniant ad purgatorium, sed ad præcipiendum sanctis angelis, ut
       anima separata a corpore indilate ipsam deferant in requiem
       sempiternam. . . . Contra ipsam rudem blasphemiam invexi alias,
       primo sic: nec papa nec etiam dominus Jesus Christus potest
       dispensare cum aliquo nec dare indulgentias, nisi ut æternaliter
       deitas justo consilio definivit. Sed non docetur, quod papa vel
       homo aliquis potest habere colorem justitiæ (on this falls the
       greatest weight) taliter faciendi; igitur non docetur, quod papa
       talem habeat potestatem. . . . Item videtur quod illa opinio
       multipliciter blasphemat in Christum, cum extollitur supra ejus
       humanitatem atque deitatem et sic super omne quod dicitur
       deus. . . . Sed eia, mili es Christi, abicite prudenter hæc opera
       atque fictitias principis tenebrarum : [129]1
     * Fatuum est credere indulgentiis papæ et episcoporum.: [130]1
     * Fides implicita: [131]1 [132]2
     * Forma substantialis panis non : [133]1
     * Gratia virtutem et donorum sufficienter perficit essentiam et
       potentias animæ, quantum ad generalem ordinationem actuum animæ,
       sed quantum ad quosdam effectus speciales, qui requiruntur in vita
       Christiana, requiritur sacramentalis gratia. -- Per virtutes et
       dona excluduntur sufficienter vitia et peccata, quantum ad præsens
       et futurum, in quantum scil. impeditur homo per virtutes et dona a
       peccando; sed quantum ad præterita peccata, quæ transeunt actu et
       permanent reatu, adhibetur homini remedium specialiter per
       sacramenta. -- Ratio sacramentalis gratiæ se habet ad gratiam
       communiter dictam, sicut ratio speciei ad genus, unde sicut non
       æquivoce dicitur animal communiter dictum et pro homine sumptum,
       ita non æquivoce dicitur gratia communiter sumpta et gratia
       sacramentalis.: [134]1
     * Hæc omnia Sacramenta tribus perficiuntur, vid. rebus tamquam
       materia, verbis tamquam forma, et persona ministri conferentis
       sacramentum cum intentione faciendi quod facit ecclesia.: [135]1
     * Hæc peccatorum scala, hæc mea maxima fiducia est, hæc tota ratio
       spei meæ.: [136]1
     * Hæresis est peccatum, per quod meruerunt per mortem a mundo
       excludi: [137]1
     * Hic damnamus totum populum scholasticorum doctorum, qui docent,
       quod sacramenta non ponenti obicem conferant gratiam ex opere
       operato sine bono motu utentis. Hæc simpliciter judaica opinio est
       sentire quod per ceremoniam justificemur, sine bono motu cordis,
       hoc est, sine fide. Et tamen hæc impia et perniciosa opinio magna
       auctoritate docetur in toto regno pontificio.: [138]1
     * Hoc peccatum, quod originale dico, aliud intellegere nequeo in
       infantibus nisi ipsam, factam per inobedientiam Adæ, justitiæ
       debitæ nuditatem, per quam omnes filii sunt iræ: quoniam et naturam
       accusat spontanea quam fecit in Adam justitiæ desertio, nec
       personas excusat recuperandi impotentia. Quam comitatur
       beatitudinis quoque nuditas, ut sicut sunt sine omni justitia, ita
       sint absque omni beatitudine.: [139]1
     * Homo est liberi arbitrii, alioquin frustra essent consilia,
       exhortationes, præcepta, prohibitiones, præmia et poenæ. . . .
       Liberum arbitrium est causa sui motus, quia homo per liberum
       arbitrium seipsum movet ad agendum. Non tamen hoc est de
       necessitate libertatis, quod sit prima causa sui id quod liberum
       est, sicut nec ad hoc quod aliquid sit causa alterius, requiritur
       quod sit prima causa ejus. Deus igitur est prima causa movens et
       naturales causas et voluntarias. Et sicut naturalibus causis
       movendo eas non aufert, quin actus earum sint naturales, ita
       movendo causas voluntarias non aufert, quin actiones earum sint
       voluntariæ, sed potius hoc in eis facit; operatur in unoquoque
       secundum ejus proprietatem: [140]1
     * Homo etiam ante peccatum indigebat gratia ad vitam æternam
       consequendam, quæ est principalis necessitas gratiæ.: [141]1
     * Id ipsum dicatis omnes, et non sint in vobis schismata. Quod
       servari non posset nisi quæstio exorta determinetur per eum, qui
       toti ecclesiæ præest, ut sic ejus sententia a tota ecclesia
       firmiter teneatur, et ideo ad solam : [142]1
     * Ideo de necessitate : [143]1
     * Igitur ecclesiæ unius et uniæ a unum corpus, unum caput, non duo
       capita, quasi monstrum, Christus videlicet et Christi vicarius
       Petrus Petrique successor: [144]1
     * Ille qui indulgentias suscipit, non absolvitur, simpliciter
       loquendo, a debito poenæ, sed datur ei, unde debitam solvat.:
       [145]1
     * In corporalibus clavis dicitur instrumentum, quo ostium aperitur,
       regni autem ostium nobis per peccatum clauditur et quantum ad
       maculam et quantum ad reatum poenæ, et ideo potestas qua tale
       obstaculum removetur, dicitur clavis. : [146]1
     * In eo, qui habet usum liberi arbitrii, non fit motio a deo ad
       justitiam absque motu liberi arbitrii, sed ita infundit donum
       gratiæ justificantis, quod etiam simul cum hoc movet liberum
       arbitrium ad donum gratiæ acceptandum in his, quæ sunt hujus
       motionis capaces.: [147]1
     * In hac causa, quot, domine, hodie cum Pelagio pro libero arbitrio
       contra gratuitam gratiam tuam pugnant, et contra Paulum pugilem
       gratiæ spiritualem! Quot etiam hodie gratuitam gratiam tuam
       fastidiunt solumque liberum arbitrium ad salutem sufficere
       stomachantur! aut si gratia utantur, vel perfunctorie necessariam
       eam simulant ipsamque se jactant liberi sui arbitrii viribus
       promereri, ut sic saltem nequaquam gratuita, sed vendita videatur!
       Quot etiam, deus omnipotens, impotentes de sui potestate arbitrii
       præsumentes tuæ cooperationis auxilium in operationibus suis
       recusant, dicendo cum impiis recede a nobis' . . . Quin immo et
       voluntati suæ in contingenter futuris omnimodam tribuunt
       libertatem, in tantum ut etiam contra vocem propheticam a tua
       subjectione exemptionem prætendant . . . Et quot et quam
       innumerabiles eis favent! Totus etenim poene mundus post Pelagian:
       abiit in errorem. : [148]1
     * In hac ejusque potestate duos esse gladios, spiritualem videlicet
       et temporalem, evangelicis dictis instruimur. Nan dicentibus
       apostolis: ecce gladii duo hic (Luke XXII. 38: [149]1
     * In quantum est sacrificium, habet vim satisfactivam, sed in
       satisfactione magis attenditur affectus offerentis quam quantitas
       oblationis. : [150]1
     * In quantum in hoc sacramento repræsentatur passio Christi, qua
       Christus obtulit se hostiam deo, habet rationem sacrificii, in
       quantum vero in hoc sacramento traditur invisibilis gratia sub
       visibili specie, habet rationem sacramenti . . . hoc sacrificium,
       quod est memoriale dominicæ passionis, non habet effectum nisi in
       illis qui conjunguntur huic sacramento per fidem et caritatem. Unde
       et in Canone Missæ non oratur pro his qui sunt extra ecclesiam;
       illis tamen prodest plus vel minus secundum modum devotionis
       eorum.: [151]1
     * In statu naturæ integræ quantum ad sufficientiam operativæ virtutis
       poterat homo per sua naturalia velle et operari bonum suæ naturæ
       proportionatum, quale est bonum virtutis acquisitæ, non autem bonum
       superexcedens, quale est bonum virtutis infusæ; sed in statu naturæ
       corruptæ etiam deficit homo ab hoc, quod secundum suam naturam
       potest, ut non possit totum hujusmodi bonum implere per sua
       naturalia. Quia tamen natura humana per peccatum non est totaliter
       corrupta, ut scil. tanto bono naturæ privetur, potest quidem etiam
       in statu naturæ corruptæ per virtutem suæ naturæ aliquod bonum
       particulare agere, non tamen totum bonum sibi connaturale.: [152]1
     * Indispositus reputatur et qui non credi et qui indevotus accedit
       . . . in sacramentis præcipue fides operatur æ ideo defectus fidei
       specialius pertinet ad fictionem.: [153]1
     * Inordinatio quæ est in isto homine ex Adam generato, non est
       voluntaria voluntate ipsius, sed voluntate primi parentis, qui
       movet motione generationis omnes qui ex ejus origine derivantur.:
       [154]1
     * Inter omnes hæreses, quæ unquam in ecclesia pullularunt, nunquam
       considero aliquam plus callide per hypocritas introductam et
       multiplicius populum defraudantem, nam spoliat populum, facit ipsum
       committere idololatriam, negat fidem scripturæ et per consequens ex
       infidelitate multipliciter ad iracundiam provocat veritatem.:
       [155]1
     * Ipse idem spiritus sanctus est amor sive caritas, qua nos diligimus
       deum et proximum, quæ caritas cum ita est in nobis, ut nos faciet
       diligere deum et proximum, tunc spiritus sanctus dicitur mitti ac
       dari nobis.: [156]1
     * Jesus mel in ore, in aure melos, in corde jubilus.: [157]1
     * Justitia: [158]1
     * Latreia: [159]1
     * Lex Christi: [160]1
     * Libertas a peccato et a miseria per gratiam est; libertas vero a
       necessitate per naturam. Utramque libertatem, naturæ scil. et
       gratiæ, notat apostolus cum ex persona hominis non redempti ait:
       velle adjacet mihi, etc.,' acsi diceret, habeo libertatem naturæ,
       sed non habeo libertatem gratiæ, ideo non est apud me perfectio
       boni. Nam voluntas hominis, quam naturaliter habet, non valet erigi
       ad bonum efficaciter volendum, vel opere implendum, nisi per
       gratiam liberetur et adjuvetur: liberetur quidem, ut velit, et
       adjuvetur, ut perficiat . . . dei gratiam non advocat hominis
       voluntas vel operatio, sed ipsa gratia voluntatem prævenit
       præparando ut velit bonum et præparatam adjuvat ut perficiat.:
       [161]1
     * Liberum arbitrium est facultas rationis et voluntatis, qua bonum
       eligitur gratia assistente vel malum eadem desistente.: [162]1
     * Licet gratia baptismalis sit incipientium et ita imperfecta :
       [163]1
     * Licet remaneat concupiscentia post baptismum, non tamen dominatur
       et regnat sicut ante, immo per gratiam baptismi mitigatur et
       minuitur, ut post dominari non valeat, nisi quis reddat vires hosti
       eundo post concupiscentias. Nec post baptismum remanet ad reatum,
       quia non imputatur in peccatum, sed tantum poena peccati est, ante
       baptismum vero poena est et culpa. . . . Per gratiam baptismi
       vitium concupiscentiæ debilitatur atque extenuatur, ita ut jam non
       regnet, nisi consensu reddantur ei vires, et quia reatus ipsius
       solvitur.: [164]1
     * Magna nobis et pretiosa promissa donavit, ut divina simus consortes
       natura: [165]1
     * Materia: [166]1
     * Materia in sacramentis exterius adhibita significat virtutem in
       sacramentis agentem ex intrinseco omnino advenire. Unde cum
       effectus proprius hujus sacramenti, scil. character, non
       percipiatur ex aliqua operatione ipsius qui ad sacramentum accidit
       sicut erat in pænitentia sed omnino ex intrinseco adveniat,
       competit ei materiam habere, tamen diversimode ab aliis sacramentis
       quæ materiam habent. Quia hoc quod confertur in aliis sacramentis,
       derivatur tantum a deo, non a ministro qui sacramentum dispensat,
       sed illud quod in hoc sacramento traditur, scil. spiritualis
       potestas, derivatur etiam ab eo qui sacramentum dat sicut potestas
       imperfecta a perfecta. Et ideo efficacia aliorum sacramentorum
       principaliter consistit in materia, quæ virtutem divinam et
       significat et continet, ex sanctificatione per ministrum adhibita.
       Sed efficacia hujus sacramenti principaliter residet penes eum, qui
       sacramentum dispensat, : [167]1
     * Meritum Christi fuit finitum, quia a principio finito essentialiter
       dependens, etiam accipiendo ipsum cum omnibus respectibus, sive cum
       respectu ad suppositum Verbi, sive cum respectu ad finem, quia
       omnes respectus isti erant finiti.: [168]1
     * Mors et omnes defectus corporales consequentes sunt quædam poenæ
       originalis peccati, quamvis non sint intenti a peccanti: [169]1
     * Nam veritate testante spiritualis potestas terrenam potestatem
       instituere: [170]1
     * Non autem hoc sacerdotibus concessit, quibus tamen tribuit
       potestatem ligandi et solvendi i.e.: [171]1
     * Non est in destructionem indulgentias dare, nisi inordinate dentur.
       Tamen consulendum est eis qui indulgentias consequuntur, ne propter
       hoc ab operibus pænitentiæ injunctis abstineant, ut etiam ex his
       remedium consequentur, quamvis a debito poenæ esse immunes, et
       præcipue quia quandoque sunt plurium debitores quam credant: [172]1
     * Non in declamatoriis rhetoricationibus nec in otiosis
       disputationibus, sed in seriis exercitiis pænitentiæ et fidei,
       quando conscientia in tentationibus cum sua indignitate vel coram
       ipso judicio dei vel in agone mortis luctatur. Hoc enim solo modo
       rectissime intelligi potest doctrina de justificatione, sicut in
       scriptura traditur.: [173]1
     * Nos (i.e.: [174]1
     * Nova editio symboli necessaria est ad vitandum insurgentes errores.
       Ad illius ergo auctoritatem pertinet editio symboli, ad cujus
       auctoritatem pertinet finaliter determinare ea quæ sunt fidei, ut
       ab omnibus inconcussa fide teneantur. : [175]1
     * Nulla est major ad amorem invitatio, quam prævenire : [176]1
     * Nulla lex populo christiano est danda, nisi ipsius papæ
       auctoritate: [177]1
     * Nulla natura creata est sufficiens principium actus meritorii vitæ
       æternæ, nisi superaddatur aliquod supernaturale donum, quod gratia
       dicitur.: [178]1
     * Nulla penitus mulier ab aliquo fratre recipiatur ad obedientiam:
       [179]1
     * Nullus dei gratiam mereri potest, per quam justificatur, potest
       tamen mereri, ut penitus abiciatur. Et quidem aliqui in tantum
       profundum iniquitatis devenerunt, ut hoc mereantur, ut hoc digni
       sint; alii vero ita vivunt, ut etsi non mereantur gratiam
       justificationis, non tamen mereantur omnino repelli et gratiam sibi
       subtrahi.: [180]1
     * Nullus potest scire, se habere gratiam, certitudinaliter; certitudo
       enim non potest haberi de aliquo, nisi possit dijudicari per
       proprium principium.: [181]1
     * Nullus potest sibi mereri reparationem post lapsum futurum, neque
       merito condigni, neque merito congrui: [182]1
     * Omnes vires animæ remanent quodammodo destitutæ proprio ordine, quo
       naturaliter ordinantur ad virtutem, et ipsa destitutio dicitur
       vulneratio naturæ (vulnus ignorantiæ, malitiæ, infirmitatis,
       concupiscentiæ: [183]1
     * Operans gratia est, quæ prævenit voluntatem bonam: ea enim
       liberatur et præparatur hominis voluntas, ut sit bona bonumque
       efficaciter velit; cooperans vero gratia voluntatem jam bonam
       sequitur adjuvando . . . Voluntas hominis gratia dei prævenitur
       atque præparatur, ut fiat bona, non ut fiat voluntas, quia et ante
       gratiam voluntas erat, sed non erat bona et recta voluntas.: [184]1
     * Opus operans est ipsa actio (oblatio) vituli, opus operatum est
       ipsa caro vituli sc. ipsum oblatum, ipsa caro Christi.: [185]1
     * Ordinantur autem sacramenta ad quosdam speciales effectus
       necessarios in vita Christiana.: [186]1
     * Poena satisfactoria est ad duo ordinata, scil. ad solutionem debiti
       et ad medicinam pro peccato vitando.: [187]1
     * Pagani jure sunt sub papæ obedientia.: [188]1
     * Parochus: [189]1
     * Paschasius ineptus ille monachus Corbeiensis.: [190]1
     * Passio Christi causat remissionem peccatorum per modum
       redemptionis, quia enim ipse est caput nostrum, per passionem suam
       quam ex caritate et obedientia sustinuit, liberavit nos tam quam
       membra sua a peccatis, quasi : [191]1
     * Peccatum Adæ ita in infantes descendere, ut sic puniri pro eo
       debeant ac si ipsi singuli illud fecissent personaliter sicut Adam,
       non puto: [192]1
     * Peccatum originale materialiter quidem est concupiscentia,
       formaliter vero est defectus originalis justitiæ: [193]1
     * Peccatum originale non magis in uno quam in alio esse potest:
       [194]1
     * Peccatum originale per prius respicit voluntatem: [195]1
     * Per læsæ majestatis crimen morti est obnoxius. Rex tamen adeo
       justus fuerit, quod nec ullo pacto crimen tuum dimittere velit
       impunitum, altera vero ex parte tam benignus et misericors, quod
       proprium filium suum innocentem doloribus committat et morti, et
       quidem sponte sua, ut justitiam concordet cum misericordia fiatque
       criminis emendatio. . . . Nunquam deus malum impunitum permitteret,
       eapropter omnia peccata et delicta nostra Jesu Christo supposuit.
       Ideo ipse est justitia et redemptio nostra, modo nos junxerimus ei
       et per fidem gratiamque ei adhæserimus.: [196]1
     * Perseverantia vitæ non cadit sub merito, quia dependet solum ex
       motione divina, quæ est principium omnis meriti, sed deus gratis
       perseverantiæ bonum largitur cuicunque illud largitur: [197]1
     * Prædestinatio bifariam accipitur. Primo et proprie pro actu divinæ
       voluntatis, quo rationalem creaturam ad æternam eligit vitam seu
       decernit ac determinat se daturum in præsenti gratiam et gloriam in
       futuro. Secundo accipitur fusius pro actu etiam intellectus divini,
       pro præcognitione vid. quam habet deus salutis electorum, quæ
       quidem præcognitio concomitatur et consequitur electionem.: [198]1
     * Præparatio hominis ad gratiam est a deo sicut a movente, a libero
       autem arbitrio sicut a moto . . . Secundum quod est a libero
       arbitrio, nullam necessitatem habet ad gratiæ consecutionem.:
       [199]1
     * Principalis effectus hujus sacramenti est remissio peccatorum,
       quoad reliquias peccati (what does that mean?), et ex consequenti
       etiam quoad culpam, si earn inveniat.: [200]1
     * Principia naturæ (primum bonum naturæ) nec tolluntur nec
       diminuuntur per peccatum (empirico-psychological observation, to
       which, however, a certain worth also is given for the religious
       mode of apprehension), inclinatio ad virtutem a natura insita
       (secundum bonum naturale) diminuitur per peccatum (ethical
       observation, but important for religion), donum originalis justitiæ
       (tertium bonum naturæ) totaliter est ablatum: [201]1
     * Principium autem gratiæ at objectum ejus est ipse deus, qui propter
       sui excellentiam est nobis ignotus: [202]1
     * Quæritur, si quod gerit sacerdos proprie dicatur sacrificium vel
       immolatio, et si Christus quotidie immolatur vel semel tantum
       immolatus sit? Ad hoc breviter dici potest, illud quod offertur et
       consecratur a sacerdote vocari sacrificium et oblationem, quia
       memoria est et repræsentatio sacrificii veri et sanctæ immolationis
       factæ in ara crucis. Et semel Christus mortuus est in cruce, ibique
       immolatus est in semetipso, quotidie autem immolatur in sacramento,
       quia in sacramento recordatio, : [203]1
     * Quæstio: [204]1
     * Quando aliquid se habet ad multa, oportet quod per aliquid
       determinetur ad unum, si illud effici debeat. Ea vero quæ in
       sacramentis aguntur possunt diversimode agi, sicut ablutio aquæ quæ
       fit in baptismo potest ordinari ad munditiam corporalem et ad ludum
       et ad multa alia hujusmodi. Et idea oportet ut determinetur ad
       unum, : [205]1
     * Quantum ad opera virtutum in interioribus actibus præcepta novæ
       legis sunt graviora præceptis veteris legis.: [206]1
     * Quantum oporteat fidelem : [207]1
     * Quartus actus est motus spei, quo quis sub spe veniæ consequendæ
       assumit propositum emendandi. Quintus actus est motus caritatis,
       quo alicui peccatum displicet secundum se ipsum et non jam propter
       supplicia: [208]1
     * Qui non solvit, frustra dicit: dimitte; : [209]1
     * Quia infusio gratiæ et remissio culpæ dicuntur ex parte dei
       justificantis, ideo ordine naturæ prior : [210]1
     * Quicumque fecerit hoc vel illud, ipse et pater ejus vel quicumque
       alius ei adjunctus in purgatorio detentus, tantum de indulgentia
       habebit.: [211]1
     * Quicunque habuerit fidem caritate formatam . . .in communi sufficit
       cum virtute perseverantiæ ad salutem. . . . Non exigit deus, ut
       omnes filii sui sint continue pro viatione sua in actu cogitanti
       particulari de qualibet fidei particula : [212]1
     * Quicunque igitur huic potestati a deo sic ordinatæ resistit, dei
       ordinationi resistit, nisi duo sicut Manichæus : [213]1
     * Quid est, quod dicimus deo: dimitte nobis debita nostra, et omnis
       gens orat deum quem credit, ut dimittat sibi peccata? Si enim
       solvimus quod debemus, cur oramus ut dimittat? Numquid deus
       injustus est, ut iterum exigat quod solutum est? Si autem non
       solvimus, cur frustra oramus, ut faciat quod, quia non convenit,
       facere non potest?: [214]1
     * Quidem dixerunt" -- Art. 2 -- "quod postquam omnia peccata per
       præcedentem contritionem remissa sunt, si aliquis ante
       satisfactionem peractam in peccatum decidat et in peccato existens
       satisfaciat, satisfactio talis ei valet, ita quod si in peccato
       illo moreretur, in inferno de illis peccatis non puniretur. Sed hoc
       non potest esse, quia in satisfactione oportet quod amicitia
       restituta etiam justitiæ æqualitas restituatur cujus contrarium
       amicitiam tollit. æqualitas autem in satisfactione ad deum non est
       secundum æquivalentiam, sed magis secundum acceptationem ipsius. Et
       ideo oportet, etiamsi jam offensa sit dimissa per præcedentem
       contritionem, quod opera satisfactoria sint deo accepta, quod dat
       eis caritas, et ideo sine caritate opera facta non sunt
       satisfactoria: [215]1
     * Quieta non movere: [216]1
     * Quis nesciat, reges et duces ab iis habuisse principium, qui deum
       ignorantes, superbia, rapinis, perfidia, homicidiis, postremo
       universis pæne sceleribus, mundi principe diabolo videlicet
       agitante, dominari cæca cupiditate et intolerabili præsumptione
       affectaverunt.: [217]1
     * Quod enim agens naturale non subito possit disponere materiam,
       contingit ex hoc, quod est aliqua proportio ejus quod in materia
       resistit ad virtutem agentis et propter hoc videmus, quod quanto
       virtus agentis fuerit fortior, tanto materia citius disponitur. Cum
       igitue virtus divina sit infinita, potest quamcunque materiam
       creatam subito disponere, etc. etc.: [218]1
     * Quod homo convertatur ad deum, hoc non potest esse nisi deo ipsum
       convertente, hoc autem est præparare se ad gratiam, quasi ad deum
       converti . . . homo non potest se præparare ad lumen gratiæ
       suscipiendum, nisi per auxilium gratuitum dei interius moventis.:
       [219]1
     * Quod non potest nisi de illis, qui sunt in purgatorio, intelligi;
       ecclesiæ autem autoritati quicunque resistit, hæresim incurrit.:
       [220]1
     * Remissio quæ per indulgentias fit, non tollit quantitatem, poenæ ad
       culpam, quia pro culpa unius alias sponte poenam sustinuit.: [221]1
     * Respondeo dicendum, quod ille proprio satisfacit pro offensa, qui
       exhibet offenso id quod æque vel magis diligit, quam oderit
       offensam. Christus autem ex caritate et obedientia patiendo majus :
       [222]1
     * Respondeo dicendum, quod per passionem Christi liberati sumus a
       reatu poenæ dupliciter. Uno modo directe, in quantum scil. passio
       Christi fuit sufficiens et superabundans satisfactio pro peccatis
       totius humani generis; exhibita autem satisfactione sufficienti
       tollitur reatus poenæ : [223]1
     * Robur: [224]1
     * Sacerdos nomen habet compositum ex Græco et Latino, quod est sacrum
       dans sive sacer dux. Sicut enim rex a regendo ita sacerdos a
       sacrando dictus est, consecrat enim et sanctificat.: [225]1
     * Sacra scriptura sufficienter continet doctrinam necessariam
       viatori: [226]1
     * Sacram doctrinam esse scientiam. Sed sciendum est quod duplex est
       scientiarum genus. Quædam enim sunt, quæ procedunt ex principiis
       notis lumine naturali intellectus sicut Arithmetica; quædam vero
       sunt quæ procedunt ex principiis notis lumine superioris scientiæ,
       sicut Perspectiva procedit ex principiis notificatis per
       Geometriam. . . . Et hoc modo sacra doctrina est scientia, quia
       procedit ex principiis notis lumine superioris scientiæ, quæ scil.
       est scientia dei et beatorum. Unde sicut Musicus credit principia
       revelata sibi ab Arithmetico, ita doctrina sacra credit principia
       revelata sibi a deo.: [227]1
     * Sacramenta continent ex sanctificatione invisibilem gratiam. Sed
       hujusmodi sanctificatio quandoque ad necessitatem sacramenti
       requiritur tam in materia quam in ministro, sicut patet in
       confirmatione. Quandoque autem de necessitate sacramenti non
       requiritur nisi sanctificatio materiæ, sicut in baptismo, quia non
       habet ministrum determinatum quantum ad sui necessitatem et tunc
       tota vis sacramentalis consistit in materia. Quandoque vero de
       necessitate sacramenti requiritur consecratio vel sanctificatio
       ministri sine aliqua sanctificatione materiæ, et tunc tota vis
       sacramentalis consistit in ministro, sicut est in pænitentia . . .
       : [228]1
     * Sacramenta novæ legis characterem imprimunt, in quantum per ea
       deputantur homines ad cultum dei secundum ritum Christianæ
       religionis.: [229]1
     * Sacramenta novæ legis habent virtutem ex passione Christi.: [230]1
     * Sacramenta veteris legis non contulerunt gratiam justificantem per
       se ipsa, i.e.: [231]1
     * Sacramenta veteris legis non habebant aliquam efficaciam ex opere
       operato sed solum ex fide; non autem ita est de sacramentis novæ
       legis, quæ ex opere operato gratiam conferunt.: [232]1
     * Sacramentum effectum sacrificii in eo qui offert habet vel in his,
       pro quibus offertur.: [233]1
     * Sacramentum eucharistiæ est potissimum inter alia sacramenta.:
       [234]1
     * Sacramentum matrimonii perficitur per actum ejus, qui sacramento
       illo utitur, sicut pænitentia. Et ideo sicut pænitentia non habet
       aliam materiam nisi ipsos actus sensui subjectos, qui sunt loco
       materialis elementi, ita est de matrimonio.: [235]1
     * Sacramentum nihil est aliud quam quædam sanctificatio homini
       exhibita cum aliquo signo visibili. Unde cum in susceptione ordinis
       quædam consecratio homini exhibeatur per visibilia signa, constat
       ordinem esse sacramentum.: [236]1
     * Salve caput cruentatum: [237]1
     * Satis potest constare purgatorium esse post hanc vitam; si enim per
       contritionem deleta culpa non tollitur ex toto reatus poenæ nec
       etiam semper venialia dimissis mortalibus tolluntur, et justitia
       hoc exigit, ut peccatum per poenam debitam ordinetur, oportet quod
       ille, qui post contritionem de peccato et absolutionem decedit ante
       satisfactionem debitam post hanc vitam puniatur. Et ideo illi qui
       purgatorium negant, contra divinam justitiam loquuntur, et propter
       hoc erroneum est et a fide alienum: [238]1
     * Sciendum est, quod cum episcopatus non addat aliquid supra
       sacerdotium per relationem ad corpus domini verum, sed solum per
       relationem ad corpus mysticum, papa per hoc quod est episcoporum
       summus non dicitur habere plenitudinem potestatis per relationem ad
       corpus domini verum, sed per relationem ad corpus mysticum. Et quia
       gratia sacramentalis descendit in corpus mysticum a capite, ideo
       omnis operatio in corpus mysticum sacramentalis, per quam gratia
       datur, dependet ab operatione sacramentali super corpus domini
       verum, et ideo solus sacerdos potest absolvere in loco pænitentiali
       et baptizare ex officio. Et ideo dicendum, quod promovere ad illas
       perfectiones, quæ non respiciunt corpus domini verum, sed solum
       corpus mysticum, potest a papa qui habet plenitudinem pontificialis
       potestatis committi sacerdoti.: [239]1
     * Sciendum quod duplex est definitio. -- Una est oratio exprimens
       quid rei, alia est oratio exprimens quid nominis. Primo modo nihil
       definitur, nisi sit res una h. e. terminus significans unam rem
       (that is logical Nominalism). Definitione quid nominis potest omnis
       terminus categorematicus definiri, quicquid significet in recto vel
       in obliquo. Nam pro omni nomine possunt poni plura nomina distincte
       significantia illa, quæ significantur per illud unum nomen tam in
       recto quam in obliquo. Ad propositum dicitur, quod sacramentum non
       potest definiri primo modo h. e., definitione quid rei quia
       sacramentum non res una, sed aggregatum ex pluribus . . . : [240]1
     * Sed quid est justificati in sanguine ipsius? Quæ vis est sanguinis
       hujus, obsecro, ut in eo justificentur credentes? Et quid est
       reconciliati per mortem filii ejus? Itane vero, cum irasceretur
       nobis deus pater, vidit mortem filii sui pro nobis et placatus est
       nobis?: [241]1
     * Semper sacramenta fidei sunt instrumenta, tanto semper efficacia,
       quanto est fides negotiosa: [242]1
     * Septimum est sacramentum matrimonii, quod est signum conjunctionis
       Christi et ecclesiæ secundum apostolum. Causa efficiens matrimonii
       regulariter est mutuus consensus per verba de præsenti expressus.
       Adsignatur autem triplex bonum matrimonii. Primum est proles
       suscipienda et educanda ad cultum dei. Secundum est fides quam unus
       conjugum alteri servare debet. Tertium indivisibilitas matrimonii,
       propter hoc quod significat indivisibilem conjunctionem Christi et
       ecclesiæ. Quamvis autem ex causa fornicationis liceat tori
       separationem facere, non tamen aliud matrimonium contrahere fas
       est, cum matrimonii vinculum legitime contracti perpetuum sit.:
       [243]1
     * Sextus est motus timoris filialis, quo propter reverentiam dei
       aliquis emendam deo voluntarius offert.: [244]1
     * Si autem pænitens præparatus quantum in se est accedat ad
       confessionem attritus, non contritus . . . confessio cum
       subjectione arbitrio sacerdotis et satisfactio pænitentiæ injunctæ
       a sacerdote est signum et causa deletionis culpæ et poenæ, quia sic
       subjiciendo se et satisfaciendo gratiam acquirit: [245]1
     * Si deo inconveniens est, hominem cum aliqua macula perducere ad
       hoc, ad quod ilium sine omni macula facit, ne aut boni incepti
       pænitere aut propositum implere non posse videatur: multo magis
       propter eandem inconvenientiam impossibile est nullum hominem ad
       hoc provehi, ad quo factus est: [246]1
     * Si igitur gratia accipiatur pro gratuita dei motione, quia movet
       nos ad bonum meritorium convenienter dividitur gratia per
       operantem, et cooperantem. Si vero accipiatur gratia pro habituali
       dono, sic est duplex gratiæ effectus, sicut et cujuslibet alterius
       formæ, quorum primus est esse, : [247]1
     * Si loquamur de justificatione proprie dicta sic considerandum est,
       quod justitia potest accipi prout est in habitu : [248]1
     * Si nihil pretiosius agnoscimr deus fecisse quam rationalem naturam
       ad gaudendum de se, valde alienum est ab eo, ut ullam : [249]1
     * Si non vere passus est, nulla gratia ei, cum nulla fuerit passio:
       [250]1
     * Si omne bonum tam bonum est, quam mala est ejus destructio (!),
       plus est bonum incomparabiliter quam sint ea peccata mala, quæ sine
       æstimatione superat ejus interremptio . . .tantum bonum tam amabile
       potest sufficere ad solvendum quod debetur pro peccatis totius
       mundi, immo plus potest in infinitum: [251]1
     * Si quæritur, qualis sit ista conversio, an formalis an
       substantialis vel alterius generis, definire non sufficio; formalem
       tamen non esse cognosco, quia species rerum quæ ante fuerant,
       remanent, et sapor et pondus. Quibusdam : [252]1
     * Sic ergo aliqui doctores videntur dissensisse vel circa ea quorum
       nihil interest ad fidem utrum sic vel aliter teneatur, vel etiam in
       quibusdam ad fidem pertinentibus, quæ nondum erant per ecclesiam
       determinata. Postquam autem essent auctoritate universalis ecclesiæ
       determinata, si quis tali ordinationi pertinaciter repugnaret,
       hæreticus censeretur. Quæ quidem auctoritas principaliter residet
       in summa pontifce: [253]1
     * Sic igitur virtute gratuita superaddita virtuti naturæ indiget homo
       in statu naturæ integræ, quantum ad unum scil. ad operandum et
       volendum bonum supernaturale, sed in statu naturæ corruptæ quantum
       ad duo, scil. ut sanetur et ulterius ut bonum supernaturalis
       virtutis operetur, quod est meritorium.: [254]1
     * Sicut aliquis per hoc quod baptismum petit se ministris ecclesiæ
       subicit, ad quos pertinet dispensatio sacramenti, ita etiam per hoc
       quod confitetur peccatum suum se ministro ecclesiæ subicit, ut per
       sacramentum pænitentiæ ab eo dispensatum remissionem consequatur,
       qui congruum remedium adhibere non potest, nisi peccatum cognoscat,
       quod fit per confessionem peccantis. Et ideo confessio est de
       necessitate salutis ejus, qui in peccatum actuate mortale cecidit.:
       [255]1
     * Sicut enim per potentiam intellectivam : [256]1
     * Sicut enim prædestinatio includit voluntatem conferendi gratiam et
       gloriam, ita reprobatio includit voluntatem permittendi aliquem
       cadere in culpam et inferendi damnationis poenam pro culpa: [257]1
     * Sicut etiam res naturales hoc consecuntur per proprios motus et
       operationes, ad quod a deo sunt ordinatæ, differenter tamen, quia
       creatura rationalis se ipsam movet ad agendum per liberum
       arbitrium. Unde sua actio habet rationem meriti, quod non est in
       aliis creaturis.: [258]1
     * Sicut gratia dividitur in operantem et cooperantem secundum
       diversos affectus, ita etiam in prævenientem et subsequentem,
       qualitercumque gratia accipiatur. Sunt autem quinque effectus
       gratiæ in nobis, quorum primus est ut anima sanetur, secundus est,
       ut bonum velit, tertius est, ut bonum quod vult efficaciter
       operetur, quartus est, ut in bono perseveret, quintus est, ut ad
       gloriam perveniat. Et ideo gratia secundum quod causat in nobis
       primum effectum, vocatur præveniens, respectu secundi effectus et
       prout causat in nobis secundum, vocatur subsequens respectu primi
       effectus.: [259]1
     * Sicut lumen naturale rationis est aliquid præter virtutes
       acquisitas, quæ dicuntur in ordine ad ipsum lumen naturale, ita
       etiam ipsum lumen gratiæ, quod est participatio divinæ naturæ, :
       [260]1
     * Sicut non potest dispensari in jure naturali, ita nec in jure
       positivo divino.: [261]1
     * Sicut omne aliud a deo ideo est bonum, quia a deo volitum, et non e
       converso, sic meritum illud tantum bonum erat, pro quanto
       acceptabatur et ideo meritum, quia acceptatum, non autem e converso
       quia meritum est et bonum, ideo acceptatum.: [262]1
     * Sicut rectus ordo exigit, ut profunda christianæ fidei prius
       credamus, quam ea præsumamus ratione discutere.: [263]1
     * Siquidem cum nomino Jesum, hominem: [264]1
     * Sufficit mihi ad omnem justitiam solum habere propitium, cui soli
       peccavi: [265]1
     * Talis indulgentia non solum vivo sed etiam mortuo proderit. Non
       enim est aliqua ratio quare ecclesia transferre possit communia
       merita quibus indulgentiæ innituntur in vivos et non in mortuos.:
       [266]1
     * Tanto aliquis modus convenientior est ad assequendum finem, quanto
       per ipsum plura concurrunt, quæ sunt expedientia fini. Per hoc
       autem quod homo per Christi passionem liberatus, multa concurrerunt
       ad salutem hominis pertinentia præter liberationem a peccato: :
       [267]1
     * Tertium est eucharistiæ sacramentum, cujus materia est panis
       triticeus et vinum de vite, cui ante consecrationem aqua
       modicissima admisceri debet (there follows an elaborate
       justification of this mixing in opposition to the Armenian
       practice). Forma hujus sacramenti sunt verba salvatoris, quibus hoc
       conficit sacramentum. Nam ipsorum verborum virtute substantia panis
       in corpus Christi et substantia vini in sanguinem convertuntur, ita
       tamen, quod totus Christus continetur sub specie panis et totus sub
       specie vini. Sub qualibet quoque parte hostiæ consecratæ et vini
       consecrati, separatione facta, totus est Christus. Hujus sacramenti
       effectus, quem in anima operatur digne sumentis, est adunatio
       hominis ad Christum. Et quia per gratiam homo Christo incorporatur
       et membris ejus unitur, consequens est, quod per hoc sacramentum in
       sumentibus digne gratia augeatur, omnemque effectum, quem
       materialis cibus et potus quoad vitam agunt corporalem sustentando,
       augendo, reparando et delectando, sacramentum hoc quoad vitam
       operatur spiritualem, in quo, ut inquit Urbanus Papa, gratam
       salvatoris nostri recensemus memoriam, a malo retrahimur,
       confortamur in bono et ad virtutum et gratiarum proficimus
       incrementum.: [268]1
     * Transit peccatum originale reatu et remanet actu (this is not so
       strongly expressed afterwards). Sed talis corruptio fomitis non
       impedit, quin homo rationabili voluntate possit reprimere singulos
       motus inordinatos sensualitatis, si præsentiat, puta divertendo
       cogitationem ad alia.: [269]1
     * Ubique magis virtus sacramentorum exprimitur, nec quod per ea
       quilibet participantes salvandi sint, sed quod salvari possint,
       significatur.: [270]1
     * Unam sanctam: [271]1
     * Unam sanctam ecclesiam Catholicam et ipsam apostolicam urgente fide
       credere cogimur et tenere. Nosque hanc firmiter credimus et
       simpliciter confitemur, extra quam nec salus est nec remissio
       peccatorum: [272]1
     * Unde et dominus (Luke XXII. 32: [273]1
     * Unigenitus dei filius . . . sanguine nos redemit quam in ara crucis
       innocens immolatus, non guttam sanguinis modicam (quæ tamen propter
       unionem ad verbum pro redemptione totius humani generis
       suffecisset), sed copiose velut quoddam profluvium noscitur
       effudisse. . . . Quantum ergo exinde, ut nec supervacua, inanis aut
       superflua tanto effusionis miseratio redderetur, thesaurum
       militanti ecclesiæ acquisivit, volens suis thesaurizare filiis pius
       pater, ut sic sit infinitus thesaurus hominibus, quo qui usi sunt
       dei amicitiæ participes sunt effecti. Quem quidem thesaurum non in
       sudario repositum, non in agro absconditum, sed per beatum Petrum
       . . . ejusque successores suos in terris vicarios commisit
       fidelibus salubriter dispensandum, et propriis et rationabilibus
       causis: nunc pro totali, nunc pro partiali remissione poenæ
       temporalis pro peccatis debitæ, tam generaliter quam specialiter
       (prout cum deo expedire cognoscerent) vere pænitentibus et
       confessis : [274]1
     * Ut inter conjuges conjunctio est secundum consensum animorum et
       secundum permixtionem corporum, sic ecclesia Christo copulatur
       voluntate et natura, qua idem vult cum eo, et ipsa formam sumpsit
       de natura hominis. Copulata est ergo sponsa sponso spiritualiter et
       corporaliter, i.e.: [275]1
     * Utitur tamen sacra doctrina etiam ratione humana, non quidem ad
       probandam fidem, quia per hoc tolleretur meritum fidei: [276]1
     * Utrum accidentia quæ remanent, sint sine subjecto: [277]1
     * Utrum sacra doctrina sit scientia.: [278]1
     * Utrum sit necessarium præter philosophicas disciplinas aliam
       doctrinam haberi.: [279]1
     * Verba ejus spiritus et vita erant.: [280]1

       modo quantum ad aliquod habituale donum, per quod natura humana
       corrupta sanetur et etiam sanata elevetur ad operanda opera
       meritoria vitæ æternæ, quæ excedunt proportionem naturæ. Alio modo
       indiget homo auxilio gratiæ, ut a deo moveatur ad agendum. Quantum
       igitur ad primum auxilii modum, homo in gratia existens non indiget
       alio auxilio gratiæ quasi aliquo alio habitu infuso, indiget tamen
       auxilio gratiæ secundum alium modum, ut scil. a deo moveatur ad
       recte agendum, et hoc propter duo: [887]1
     * homo per eandem materiam causæ deo satisfacere debet, per quam
       offenderat.: [888]1

     * ideo meritum hominis apud deum esse non potest nisi secundum
       persuppositionem divinæ ordinationis, ita scil. ut id homo
       consequatur a deo per operationem quasi mercedem, : [897]1
     * ideo quantumcunque natura aliqua corporalis vel spiritualis ponatur
       perfecta, non potest in suum actum procedere nisi moveatur a deo,
       quæ quidem motio est secundum suæ providentiæ rationem, non
       secundum necessitatem naturæ, sicut modo corporis coelestis. Non
       solum autem a deo est omnis motio, sicut a primo movente, sed etiam
       ab ipso est omnis formalis perfectio, sicut a primo actu. Sic
       igitur actio intellectus et cujuscunque entis creati dependet et a
       deo quantum ad duo. Uno modo in quantum ab ipso habet perfectionem
       sive formam per quam agit, alio modo in quantum ab ipso movetur ad
       agendum. Intellectus humanus habet aliquam formam, scil. ipsum
       intelligibile lumen, quod est de se sufficiens ad quædam
       intelligibilia cognoscenda . . . altiora vero intelligibilia
       intellectus humanus cognoscere non potest, nisi fortiori lumine
       perficiatur . . . quod dicitur lumen gratiæ, in quantum est naturæ
       superadditum. Sic igitur dicendum est, quod ad cognitionem
       cujuscunque veri homo indiget auxilio divino, ut intellectus a deo
       moveatur ad suum actum, non autem indiget ad cognoscendam veritatem
       in omnibus nova illustratione superaddita naturali illustrationi,
       sed in quibusdam quæ excedunt naturalem cognitionem.: [898]1

       motio autem alicujus moventis non solum se extendit ad ultimum
       terminum motus, sed etiam ad totum progressum in motu; terminus
       autem motus gratiæ est vita aeterna, progressus autem in hoc motu
       est secundum augmentum caritatis. Sic igitur augmentum gratiæ cadit

       ac rectitudo moralis. Secundum est ratio meritorii, quod est esse
       acceptum a divina voluntate, aut acceptabile, sive dignum acceptari
       ad præmium æternum. Quantum ad primum, potentia est causa prima et
       principalis, et habitus causa secunda, cum potentia utatur habitu,
       non e converso; alias habens semel gratiam nunquam posset peccare,
       cum causa secunda semper sequatur motionem causæ primæ, nec possit
       movere ad oppositum illius, ad quod causa prima inclinat. Sed
       accipiendo actum in quantum est meritorius talis conditio ei
       convenit principaliter ab habitu et minus principaliter a
       voluntate. : [910]1
