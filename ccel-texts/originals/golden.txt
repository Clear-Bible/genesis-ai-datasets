                           Chapter 1 - General Maxims

   If we know HIM, we know enough!

   Christ's character is built in us; not given to us. Righteousness is
   imputed.

   Never take the initiative in moving into anything unless you have the
   Word of God to garrison you.--As soon as the Spirit takes hold of that
   Word, He makes it a throbbing reality.

   The motto of Jesus' life: "I have come to do Thy will, O God."

   Some leave the great essentials, and involve themselves with doctrinal
   issues.

   Don't crowd God into two thousand years.

   We were not made for the here and now; we were made for the heart of
   God.

   The spiritual, mental and physical should all have their source in the
   Christ.

   It is not a reformation, but a total deliverance when He comes.

   When we move in the will of God, it answers about a thousand prayers.

   There is such a difference between being religious and being spiritual.

   Always watch out that you have not too many possessions. If you are not
   careful, those possessions will possess you!

   Don't develop a devil consciousness; develop a God consciousness.

   Too many are conscious of their limitations. Count HIM in! Remember
   what He did with five loaves and two fishes.

   We should give to God our very best--and all that we have.

   We can be just as holy, just as devoted to Jesus as we want to be; and
   we can walk just as near to Him as we want to.

   We can let the hour of our visitation slip right away from us.
   Awareness--we have to be aware.

   The highest vocation of any spiritual manifestation is worship and
   adoration; not service.

   The whole issue between broken humanity and God is a question of life
   and death; not heaven and hell.

   Lord, keep me alive until I die.

   Humility is something which is birthed within, and, if we think we have
   it; we haven't!

   In the realm of the Spirit, there is no distinction between secular and
   holy. Everything in God's sight, in this new life, is holy.

   We learn the laws of living in the realm of spiritual reality by
   living.

   "I don't want your gifts, your services, what you are doing; I want
   your HEART."

   He has so many who serve Him, but so few who love Him!

   Everybody wants the fruitage; nobody wants the death that causes the
   fruitage.

   When He gives a word, it is creative, and has a measure of faith every
   time.

   Miracles are for beginners, but, for disciples, He expounds all things.

   Miracles appeal to the cosmic curiosity of the flesh. Don't
   commercialize them. Have spiritual adjustment in God. "Rejoice not in
   miracles, but that your name is written in heaven."

   Many have the Christ, but they have not discovered the hidden treasures
   in Him. (Colossians 2:3)

   Never "Why" God: Worship Him!

   Truth is never ours until it is personalized in our lives.

   It is good to have a disappointment once in a while. It will throw us
   into God like nothing else will.

   He is always and forever the same, but He is seeking to change us.

   You and I are basically made for His pleasure.

   Don't read traditionally, or perfunctorily, because you think you have
   to read!

   Just to please the heart of God one day at a time is wonderful. Don't
   let your life pattern project so far ahead that it swallows up the
   importance of the moment.

   I like what I call an overall pattern and perspective in my thinking.

   My ministry is only a means unto the end; it is not the end.

   The instrument is always of greater value than what the instrument can
   do.

   No experience, in itself, ever matures us.

   The more we see and know Him: The more we love Him.

   Anybody can stand a blessing, but few people can take a defeat, a
   disappointment.

   Here (on earth) is the place of decision.

   Then (in heaven) is the place of expression.

   I am saved;

   I am being saved;

   I am yet to be saved.

   Jesus: "I made the testing; also a way of escape."

   Everybody has enough entertainment --they need instruction!

   God has all eternal ages to work out the problems that we can't work
   out here.

   Every heart has its own discipline, its own cross, and its own dealings
   with God.

   "Be still and know that I am God." --Don't clatter so much!

   My motto: Keep in the middle of the road.

   We learn to pray by praying.

   In a consecrated life, there are no accidents.

   The martyrs in the arena in Rome had an inner life element: They had
   agape love. Some can't face a lion, because they cannot face themselves
   for five minutes!

   The devil will tempt us with the identical setup God uses to test us.
   Temptation is always unto defeat and death. Testing is always unto
   strength and life.

   A walk in the Spirit is not a gift; it is an attainment.

                     Chapter 2 - Baptism of the Holy Spirit

   Baptism of the Holy Spirit is the divine explosion within the innermost
   part of man which brings to the surface all things good and evil.

   If you don't find an interior revolution which will affect the
   external, I question your experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

   1. The Holy Spirit is always the dynamic, the power for any of the
   things God will do. It was the Holy Spirit working in the Old Testament
   in every sign and miracle. God is causation; Jesus executes the will;
   the Holy Spirit accomplishes the work.

   2. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the dynamic by which the mystical
   Body of Christ can be formed, and the emphasis of God today,
   dispensationally, is that of getting His Body ready, shaped up, filled
   with life, vision, hope, so that He can take her home. That is His
   great program!

   It is time people got acquainted with the objective for which this
   marvelous, unheard of outpouring was sent!

   God's first thought is not what we can do, but what we can become.

   Works are subservient to what we become.

   Jesus said He would call us out; He would train us; give us discipline;
   He would give us all that was needed in the way of separation, and
   light, and illumination, and, most of all, the terrible training which
   was necessary to conform us into the image and likeness of Himself--the
   Bridegroom, because we would be the Bride. The Bride must have some
   features like unto the Bridegroom. He will begin to restore, reshape,
   repattern, and redesign in us--in this Body with the features that are
   becoming here, so that some day we may be taken out of this earth, and
   united with Him, and projected into the things of the eternal ages. For
   in Ephesians it says that through the Church, He will show His glory
   and grace in ages to come. This is the instrument. So He says, "Ye
   shall be unto Me My witness in the world." The power of the Holy Spirit
   will come upon you, and immerse you into what He is, and Who He is, and
   YOU will BECOME identified with Him.

   ". . . Ye shall be witnesses unto Me . . ." (Acts 1:8b) Become this
   thing: a witness unto God--unto God first. Become unto Me: a process:
   All Swings to the glory of God. That is the real functioning; that is
   the ultimate.

   "Ye shall become,"--not DO! I believe in Works--absolutely. But I want
   it in its order in God, in the Spirit. He doesn't say a thing we are
   going to do. He says something that we are becoming; something that we
   will become. Why? Under the dynamic of this Spirit; He will immerse us
   under its power.--He will not destroy our individuality or our
   personality concept and fundament of being, He will not do that. He
   wants every kind, everyone of us, but it shall be an immersion--you go
   out of sight! You go out of sight! You are not sprinkled.

   If you ever get the real baptism of the Spirit, the you' is lost, your
   identity, your manifestation--the you' is submerged--out of sight. All
   of that potential of the you' that Wants to get into prominence, it is
   out of sight; it is buried; buried! He says, "I will immerse you, I
   will baptize you in the Spirit and under the impact and power of this
   dynamic, you shall become unto Me in the world My witness." Why is it
   that Jesus should say to them on this occasion: "Ye shall become
   . . ."? It is a verb of being, not of action. However, in order to
   build this Body, we will find He will give us so many things to occupy
   us, but all of that is reactionary--the effect; the reaction from the
   doing reflects right back again to the Body. That is why we contribute
   to the building of the Body. Becoming is a process. The Holy Spirit was
   given in that baptism for the building and making of this Body.

   Why did Paul pray as he did? Did you ever look at the prayers of Paul?
   Go into the New Testament and follow all the prayers of Paul and see
   what the burden of them was. Every last prayer that is mentioned was
   concerning this Body; it was concerning the believers; it was
   concerning those who were incorporated in this mystical thing. The
   burden of prayer on Paul's heart was the completion and the building
   and making of this Body. What is the burden on the heart of Jesus? The
   redemption of the world? No--He had died for the world, He can't do any
   more than that! His prayer in John 17 is, "I pray not for the world,
   but for them which Thou hast given Me; for they are Thine." The Holy
   Spirit is praying "for the saints according to the will of God."

   The submerging of the Spirit is the only dynamic by which this Body can
   be built and brought to completion.
     __________________________________________________________________

                        Chapter 3 - The Bride of Christ

   Eve was taken OUT of the body of Adam. Notice that it was not the whole
   body of Adam which made the bride. So, too, out of the Body of Christ
   can come His Bride. This also is brought about by a separation--He
   calls the overcoming group His Bride. The whole group, or body, is not
   the Bride. The highest expression in God's thought, He calls the Bride.

   God is using the world to hammer out a Bride. They Crucified Jesus. Do
   you think we are going to have any more glorious ending? Don't worry;
   we will have to know something of the fellowship of the sufferings and
   defeat of the Bridegroom. He went home in shame and disgrace, without
   the applause and satisfaction of the world--He went out in darkness. Do
   you think the Bride is going home on a bandwagon? A lot of people are
   trying to get that bandwagon painted up now, so it will play real good.

   Where will the Bride--the overcomers--be in this picture? She will be
   identified with a slain Bridegroom, and the Bride will know something
   of being slain. The Bride of Christ will know the slain life, and she
   will go home as a slain Bride in union with the Bridegroom. She comes
   from the desert, leaning. As long as there is an ounce of flesh, she
   will stand in her own strength. God has to reduce and deplete her, and
   bring her to complete exhaustion of self-effort. In Song of Solomon we
   read: "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
   beloved?" In Hosea 2:14 it says, ". . . I will allure her, and bring
   her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her."--He charms
   her and allures her into the wilderness so that He can speak love words
   to her. It is a love scene; a trysting, so that He might speak love
   words to her; to have her whole attention; to have her whole heart.
   Leaning means dependence. We see John at the Last Supper leaning on
   Jesus' bosom; there is a language between them. Jesus waits for
   somebody to come near enough to hear His heartbeat--breaking.

   In the Song of Solomon, toward the end, the Bride becomes so intense
   with longing for her Bridegroom, that she dares to speak. I suppose as
   we, too, go on with God, we become so bold in our resistance to the
   world that we become almost offensive to people. They will say: "Where
   are your interests? Don't you have any touch for the world? Can't you
   be absorbed in it?" We just say, "We can't. We have none." Our
   interests are not here. They are over there with Him: The Bride, right
   in the presence of that King Solomon (the world) declares it, as he
   turns and describes her beautifully as she really is. He describes her,
   and the world knows there is something peculiar, because she won't come
   under the philosophy of this world, but under the philosophy of the
   Spirit. "Forget thy people;" (human contacts) who have served us. The
   time comes when God won't let us have a crutch to stand on. HE wants to
   be the satisfying portion. "Forget thy people"--it doesn't mean we
   don't like them any more--but we don't let them have an influence in
   our life. We become independent of them; released. We keep them in
   their proper place. "Forget thy people and thy father's house"--a
   separation as was the case with Rebekah. (Genesis 24) "My father's
   house" is our natural concept of life; the natural flesh concept.

   If we dare to lean, we will hear! He is wooing us again to a mystical
   union with the eternal heart of God.

   The Church is holding us back from the coming of the Lord. "Let us be
   glad and rejoice, and give honour to Him: for the marriage of the Lamb
   is come, and His wife hath made herself ready." (Revelation 19:7)
     __________________________________________________________________

                       Chapter 4 - Choices and Decisions

   We are standing here, and we are the sum total of all the choices and
   decisions we have made in our lives. They have all registered, and
   this, is the composition of our character. We live in our wills.

   We forget, when speaking about heaven, that so many of the things which
   are for us in the ages yet to come, after this life has been lived, and
   we as a conscious entity,--a spirit released from the body, and moving
   in the new resurrection body--in a new spiritual realm, most of the
   things that we have on that other shore--over there in the ages--are
   DETERMINED HERE.

   Now don't think that we can just live a Christian life as happy as
   bumble bees, and, when we go to heaven, everything is going to be so
   wonderful, l am sorry to disillusion some people. It isn't going to be
   that way! Right here and now, we are making the decisions; the choices;
   the surrenders; the outpourings of life. We are doing that HERE, and
   THAT WILL DETERMINE what we will have over there. That is not built up
   all of a sudden over there; not at all. We determine all that right
   here and now.

   Life is too short for us to put into manifestation much that we would
   choose. Even with a good choice, life is too short for it. But I tell
   you one thing, life is long enough so that when Truth is presented, and
   there is an occasion for us to make a decision; or a surrender; or die
   a death; or accept a Truth--right here is where we do it, but the
   fruitage--the real fruitage--of it, won't always be seen here. We
   aren't here long enough; the real fruitage will be projected in the
   things yet to come.

   Remember when Jesus was talking about the talents? He said the same
   thing to all three men; (two were faithful and one wasn't) He said,
   "Thou hast been faithful over a few things . . . I will now give you a
   gold house to live in, a pair of wings to fly with, and also an harp!"
   No, all of those things hadn't anything to do with what He was talking
   about. He said, "Thou hast been faithful over a few things." What was
   the reward? A gold crown? An harp? No, the reward was the lifting up of
   a quality of faithfulness, which the two men earned here, and
   projecting it upon a new plane over there--multiplied!

   The reward was not the material things which most hymn writers put in
   singing books. The reward for those men was the faithfulness which they
   had acquired HERE, multiplied and projected upon a new level; on a new
   plane. Jesus Said "Thou hast been faithful over a few things--you will
   also now be faithful over many things."

   People think that, when we die, God is going to give us all presents;
   that He is going around with a big clothes basket full of crowns and
   saying, "Here's a crown . . . and I won't give you any, you missed
   chapel twice. . .?" He doesn't do any such fantastic things that in the
   world. CROWNS ARE WON! We EARN THEM--they are not souvenirs. Crowns are
   symbolic of certain authority and power which we merit and earn while
   we are here. It is here that we make our decisions, and certain
   surrenders. We have to die to a lot of things that nearly kill us--they
   SHOULD kill Us! The trouble is we don't die. We say, "It nearly killed
   me." It is supposed to kill us . . . so we will learn.

                             Chapter 5 - The Church

   There has always been a main objective towards which every
   manifestation of God moves. Each dispensation shows this. Today it is
   the Body of Christ.

   What was the burden of Paul's prayers? It was for the growth and
   development of believers--the Body. It was not bringing in the kingdom
   and getting this world set straight, nor was this the object of Jesus'
   prayer. His burden was bringing out of the world as many as possible
   into salvation. "Go ye to the ends of the earth with the gospel
   message;" not to Christianize the world, but to evangelize the world.
   And having evangelized the world, to gather them together in what He
   calls the Body of Christ. So we should spend our effort and time on
   this group. This is brought out in Ephesians 4:11-13: "And he gave some
   apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
   and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
   ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ; Till we all come in
   the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of
   Christ."--The Spirit, and even all of the personality gifts relate to
   the edification of that unique, strange, mystical group of people--the
   Body of Christ.

   I am so glad that all direction is in the Head. Here is my body, He
   does not expect my hands to be my brains; He expects them to serve what
   my mind directs. And we forget that Christ is the Head of the Church.
   Christ is the Head of the Body and, therefore, there should be nothing
   originating in us; only receptivity to perform and do that which is
   actuated and directed from the Head. We move around and that is why I
   think the church or Body is so feeble, because it doesn't know how to
   live from the Living Head. We try to produce what the Head wants to
   produce. The Head wants to make the program. He only asks us to
   function as members, not as the Head!

   It takes us a long time to find that out. We are so used to directing
   from our own natural self--our own head directing what our body is to
   do, but God says, "No, not that any more. You will become just a member
   in My Body, for I am the Head." All direction; all programs; anything
   that is worthwhile at all should originate in Him. He has to have us as
   a Body through whom He executes and moves. What a burden that would
   take off of our hearts and lives if we could ever believe it and learn
   it.

   Churches in the book of Revelation have a work complex, instead of a
   worship complex.

   Ephesians 2:21: "In Whom all the building fitly framed together groweth
   unto an holy temple in the Lord." This verse has to do with the things
   of God in the holy temple. It has to do with prayer, outpouring
   intercession, worship, adoration; all that pertains to God. It is all
   Godward--all that is going on in the temple. He says, "I am building
   you into a temple; each of you is a stone in the temple, so that ye may
   be a habitation for God; for all that goes on in the temple." The
   stones take hours to chip off and hammer, but by and by He fits them
   into the temple. "You looked like a mountain when I first got you, but
   this little stone is all you are, and I am fitting you into this
   temple."

   The idea of meeting together in an informal mood--receptivity--is
   really apostolic. That was the mood, the approach the early disciples
   had. They had no form. They didn't have singing books with ]ingle bells
   in them! What were they singing? They were singing the Psalms from the
   Old Testament, and many of the tunes were in minor key under the
   pattern of the old Jewish synagogue worship. Now that is all they knew,
   and God recognized it. You see when they came out of Judaism there was
   nothing formed as a pattern that was left for its development. God
   never gave any orders as to the form or shape their worship should
   take. He allowed them to shape it in accordance with what they felt in
   their hearts to do. The only two ordinances He let us are those of
   Baptism and the Lord's Supper; these are the only two that He
   instituted, He didn't institute all the ordinances we have now, but
   they have come up with the church, because if we don't have anything
   beside what the Lord instituted we are possessed to have something; so
   we will invent a form of worship. This isn't wicked or bad, and may be
   a means of helping some weaker soul towards God. So, I am not too
   critical, but I don't want that, I don't need it.

   In God, and in the Spirit there is originality and spontaneity, but we
   have lost track of it; I remember in the earliest days of the
   outpouring of the Spirit that those were the two characteristic marks
   of the moving of the Spirit--a spontaneity and an originality in His
   movings. Nothing was programmed or fixed. But you know, when we slip
   away from that into a stereotyped fashion, the Spirit isn't always
   pleased to follow us in our little pattern.

   Speaking of persecution in the early Church, it was the impact of truth
   that caused them to move as they did--to take the persecution. It was
   this strange impact of life that possessed the early Church, and made
   them different.

   The Church was founded on the testimony; not on Peter, but on his
   testimony of to who Jesus was.

   There are five personality gifts: apostles, prophets, evangelists,
   pastors, and teachers. (Eph. 4) He placed them in the Body. Even
   evangelists, Whose ministry is out in the world and darkness, have the
   Body as a home base for inspiration and direction. For the Body is
   controlled by The Head. My head has no business planning anything. My
   head was made to execute what The Head planned. We are the members; we
   are not The Head, and members of His Body can only serve as The Head
   directs. Stop shoving evangelists out into the world with artificial
   objectives such as trying to bring the world to the Lord, clearing up
   politics, and getting everything in shape. Where did that come from?
   From religious tradition.

   It is so much easier to do something than to become something. So, in
   the Church, it is easier to do programs and activities than to abide,
   evolve, and become. God is after the becoming, and so He says, "I have
   placed all the personality gifts in the Church." Don't project them out
   into the world. The evangelist functions to the ends of the earth!
   That's his field--but he has to come back. Why? Because he is getting
   the material out there to make the Body, and he brings it back into the
   Body. What is the Body made of? The Body is made of raw material;
   redeemed humanity. God's emphasis is upon building a Body, and not upon
   redeeming the world. He has placed the personality gifts there, "FOR
   the perfecting of the saints, FOR the work of the ministry, FOR the
   edifying of the Body of Christ."

                             Chapter 6 - Communion

   He is a seeking God--seeking with a broken heart; not getting the
   response which He should have in the creature. We say our hearts get so
   hungry, but God's heart is so hungry. When did you give Him anything to
   satisfy Him? When did you feed Him? The first picture of His broken
   heart is found in Genesis 3:8-10, and the last one in Revelation 3:20.
   In Revelation He says, (to an individual; not to a collective group):
   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and
   open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
   with Me.--I won't coerce you; I won't open the door."

   God is coming to that door saying, "Adam, where art thou?" He is saying
   the same thing, because the same Adam is still dwelling in there; and,
   in that original thought of God for man, there is still a throbbing
   Heart longing that we would open to Him, "You were made for Me, and I
   for you. My heart is aching and longing for you." There will be a
   restoration of What was lost way back in the Garden; Jesus will restore
   it in any individual who wants that experience back again.

   I asked the Lord about "sup with Him, and he with Me." He said, "I let
   them always offer to Me first, because I am a Guest, and I will sup
   with them using whatever they have to offer Me." We bring our
   resources; we lay it all before Him; we have sweet fellowship with Him,
   but our resources are soon exhausted. "I let them have the first
   privilege," our Lord says, "Then I supply Eternal Bread, Eternal Life;
   all that has eternal value."

   What a time we have bringing our little crooked loaf of bread,
   scorched, and all out of shape. We nearly die trying to get it
   consecrated to the Lord, but He says, "I take it, dear, and I have a
   Loaf too; partake of it forever!"

A Communion Prayer:

   We are all so self-centered about our comings and our goings, our
   little lives, our little doings, and our fussing around. Dear Lord,
   help us to get away from that. Let our inner beings pour out to Thee in
   a holy, loving consecration, a surrender, and a yielding of all that we
   have. Let it flow back again to Thy loving heart. Teach us how to enter
   into communion with Thee; deliver us from prayer patterns, and help us
   to be normal, natural, and real with Thee so that Thou wilt be able to
   receive from us that which would satisfy and please Thy heart.

                             Chapter 7 - The Cross

   Every man will find his discipline, and every man will find his cross.
   All Christians are not disciples. When He first introduces the cross,
   it is to Christians. Jesus Christ never places a cross on anybody. It
   is in our volitional Power of will to choose. He doesn't lay a cross on
   us "so we can love Him!" No, we voluntarily take it. He never imposes
   it; it will be the instrument on which we will be slain. Our cross will
   be the most liberating thing in our life. As with Christ's cross, it
   liberates and sets free everything in salvation, and the things of God.

   If we want to sidestep the cross and miss its ministries, we won't go
   to hell, but, if we sidestep this cross, we will sidestep one of the
   greatest agencies in the economy of God to bring us into God. He says,
   "Come, take up this cross as a voluntary act." The cross is the
   instrument of death, but it brings a fuller revelation to our hearts
   and lives than that of any other agency in His economy.

   If we would know fellowship in the future, we must know it now. We must
   know the cross in its two fold teaching; not only sins forgiven, but,
   on the other side, joy: agony--but joy. Embrace it; hang on to it;
   cruel and bitter though it is; for joy and a sensing of God, as never
   before, will follow.

   Be willing for the crucifixion, because it is the author of LIFE.

   The more spiritually-minded we are in heart and life, the more we can
   understand the revelation of God, and the more we understand the cross.

   "Though He were a Son," He learned obedience continually. (Heb. 2:10;
   5:8) That was like a cross. Learning obedience is a cross which we will
   have too, if we want to follow Him. "If any man wants to follow Me (to
   My destiny), let him take up his own cross and follow Me." But this is
   not the cross which He lays on us; it is something that we may
   voluntarily resist or accept. It is a cross distinct from trials and
   testings that He brings upon us. It does amount to great suffering, but
   it is a suffering in which we have the power to resist if we don't want
   to take it. Sometimes, for example, great teaching, a great revelation,
   amounts to a cross. We know if we take that cross up, if we embrace
   that Truth, if we dare to subject ourselves under the impact and power
   of that Truth, it is going to be a terrific cross that will kill us. It
   will crucify us. Well, it is supposed to! Take up YOUR cross.

   Your cross and my cross will vary according to the disposition, and the
   calling of our lives, so we don't have the same in that sense, but
   everyone will have one.

   Why? Because in God's economy and purpose for us, He knows the pattern,
   the situation, the episode that will perfectly crucify our old flesh.
   So He says: "Will you voluntarily take it? You pick it up. You know
   what My cross did for Me. It was the place of My execution; it was the
   place where I died; now, you take yours. It will be the place of the
   execution of the creature that you are; it will slay you. I don't lay
   it upon you; I want you to voluntarily take it up, for then your
   identification with Me will be what I want--a voluntary love and
   surrender."

   So, He will bring a cross to you; it may take different shapes and
   forms, but it is always a cross. I can't interpret your cross; nobody
   but you can. So when God brings it, don't be amazed, upset, and
   confused.

   He says, "Take it up." For if you take up your cross; this decision,
   this consideration, this surrender; if you take that up into your life
   pattern and walk, you will have a crown over there. Because the sequel,
   the answer, to a cross is a crown. And there is no crown without a
   cross, because every cross, if borne, will take a crown.

   "Hold that fast which thou hast . . ." What do we have? We have the
   Truth, which becomes a cross, which will slay every one of us. Hold
   fast to the Truth as to a treasure, lest something come along, and
   snatch it away. Hold fast the Word of Truth which is a cross; it will
   eventually spell a crown. Snatch your crown! For the crown is the
   answer to the Truth. Hold to your Truth; hold to your cross; lest in
   not holding it, the crown is affected.

   What is the symbol of suffering? It is the cross.

   Christ had His cross every day, and Calvary was the climax. "He was
   made perfect through suffering." Ready for supreme sacrifice, suffering
   had done the silent, sacred ministry. ". . . Who for the joy that was
   set before Him, endured the cross . . ." (Heb. 12:2). ". . . Our light
   affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory." (2 Cor. 4:17) He has gone, but
   He left His cross. Every man has his own cross to bear, but the sequel
   is life and secret joy-- the crown.

   Your cross is your crown in disguise.

   Prayer: May we interpret the cross, the crown, the Truth.

                         Chapter 8 - Divine Arrangement

   A divine arrangement is a certain method or rule by which God works.
   Never ask Him to change to accommodate your mind; adapt yourself to His
   method.

   2 Timothy 1:7: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of
   power, and of love, and of a sound mind." Sound mind is a bad
   translation; a better one is disciplined spirit. God says, to build
   this strange, mystical thing--the new man--"I will give you, first of
   all, POWER, then love and a sound mind (disciplined spirit)." Now, why
   did He begin with power? Because power is the dynamic by which the
   whole thing is made manifest. No need messing around trying to get love
   or something else. The whole thing is based on a dynamic power God
   furnishes, which is the Holy Spirit. You will find the same order in
   the Old and New Testament, and in your heart and mine. Whenever you see
   an arrangement like that in the Bible, leave it the way it is written.
   Some would put love first, instead of power, but we can't change it.
   There is a divine order.

   From creation on, everything that we have comes through the power of
   the Spirit: (In the Old Testament the word is ruach, and in the New
   Testament it is pneuma). They both have the same idea of breath or
   life--the outbreathing, ruach; the breath of God--that is Spirit; that
   is Life; pneuma, breath--pneumonia, pneumatic tire, air, breath,
   spirit; all come from the same word.

   Why do we have the breath of Life? Because we can't receive anything in
   creation without it. We have it in the life of Jesus. He was conceived
   by the Spirit; born of the Spirit; baptized in the Spirit; He
   ministered in the Spirit. His whole life moved in the power of God,
   called the Holy Spirit, and He lived in it, moved in it, ministered in
   it; and even when He died, the resurrection was by the Eternal Spirit.
   If all that was needed in the life of Jesus, how much more we need the
   power of the Spirit in our lives! We can't get anywhere without the
   Holy Spirit.

   Notice the divine arrangement of the Beatitudes: Never recast them;
   never change their order. They say, "Blessed is he, Blessed is he',
   etc. so why not have them any which way, because they all begin
   Blessed' don't they?" We cannot do that; we have to have a sequence.
   They HAVE to begin with "Blessed are the poor in spirit," as the basis
   for all the other "Blessed's" to follow; we cannot change that.

   The Sermon on the Mount covers Matthew, Chapters 5, 6, 7. Oh, the
   Sermon on the Mount! The logic in there is just beautiful! Jesus is
   teaching His disciples. The whole Sermon on the Mount hasn't anything
   to do with the sinner at all.

   What is the first Beatitude? Does it say those who hunger and thirst
   after righteousness shall be filled because we have to be hungry first,
   and we know that is the great basic need? No, that isn't the first
   Beatitude. The first one begins with a very wonderful statement:

   (1) "Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven."

   There could not have been a broader, more beautiful statement. Why? In
   Greek "the poor in spirit," means "bankruptcy". Blessed--or most
   fortunate; or, to be envied is better--is a person who has been reduced
   to bankruptcy, without any potential of his own, for in his bankruptcy,
   all heaven is his!

   Why is there not more heaven in some people? The rich young ruler in
   Matthew 19, turned away sorrowful, because he had great possessions.
   Anyone who has great possessions is not going to get too far with the
   Lord. Most fortunate, to be envied, is a person who is reduced to
   bankruptcy in any self-resources. "In me dwelleth no good thing." This
   is basic, because then it is possible for all heaven to be yours. Then
   Jesus goes on with the rest of the Beatitudes, because they are
   divinely arranged--in sequence. One makes it possible for the second,
   and we can't get to the third until we have had the first and second.
   The point is; their blessedness all runs into a series sequence.

   (2) "Blessed are they that mourn; for they Shall be comforted."

   Why is this one next? Because the clearer our vision is of Jesus, and
   the beauty of His loveliness and purity, grace and strength, the more
   we are truly able to mourn in the true sense of the word--mourn our
   sin; mourn the nature and cause; mourn because we grieve Him. Then we
   are comforted by His grace.

   (3) "Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth."

   Whence does this meekness come? What causes our mourning? The Holy
   Spirit, working in the heart, now produces meekness and brokenness not
   formerly known to the humanity at all. It is the natural result of this
   poverty and mourning, which results in grace and comfort. This poverty
   and mourning produces a meekness in our nature like Christ's. Thus the
   meek inherit all things--the earth. They are not seeking now; are not
   proud or lifted up, so He can trust the meek and they are safe All this
   has revealed to them their deep need. Now comes the hunger.

   (4)"Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for
   they shall be filled."

   We have to be conditioned continually in heart and spirit for the
   reception of that which we hope and long for. Whence this hunger and
   thirst? Is it for salvation? No. It is for a fuller and fuller
   revelation of Jesus. God creates the appetite, and fills it from His
   side. The new creature needs to be fed. "He shall be
   filled,"--completely satisfied.

   (5) "Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy."

   Man, by nature, is not merciful. The Spirit has manifested God's mercy
   in such measure that man, in turn, becomes merciful himself, and also
   obtains mercy. "For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged;
   and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."
   (Matthew 7:2)

   (6) "Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God."

   The Spirit is bringing the soul to purity--not sinless perfection, nor
   faultlessness. The surrendered will--a heart whose only and every
   motive is Godward is pure in heart. "With the pure thou wilt show
   Thyself pure." (Psalm 18:26) "With the pure all things are pure."
   (Titus 1:15) What or Whom do they see? GOD, not only in heaven, but
   here in everything which touches the life--God first. (Romans 8:28)

   (7) "Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children
   of God."

   We are now so united and blessed in fellowship that we enter into the
   service of the King. He can now truly trust us. (2 Corinthians
   5:18-21), (Colossians 1:20.)

   (8) "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake: for
   theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

   This is the natural outcome of life or service in God. We are not of
   the world; it hates us. "Through much tribulation, and patience ye
   shall enter the kingdom of God." (Acts 14:22b) "Yea, and all that will
   live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." (2 Timothy)
   Suffering is our lot, but all heaven is ours. This is general suffering
   for the cause of Christ and righteousness in the earth, such as
   persecutions, involving name, reputation, and principles of Truth for
   which we become martyrs.

   (9) "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
   shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice
   and be exceedingly glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so
   persecuted they the prophets who were before you."

   What suffering is this? The previous sufferings are general ones; now
   they will become specific. They will bring you into closer union and
   identification with Christ, and bring your heart into the "fellowship
   of His sufferings." (Philippians 3:10, and Colossians 1:24)--The climax
   of the Beatitudes is marked by suffering. It is the desired end.

   Let us note two things in the study of the Beatitudes:

   1. The progression and perfect movement or growth; there is sequence of
   marked significance. One Beatitude grows, evolves, naturally out of the
   other. There is maturity and growth in strength as the soul is led
   onward.

   2. It takes the work of the Holy Spirit to produce each step. He alone
   can bring us, and hold us in each of these positions, for each
   condition, pronounced "blessed" or "happy", is diametrically opposed to
   everything natural.

   Almost the first revelation which comes to the Christian early in the
   way is his poverty and lack of spirit. The human spirit is wild,
   beastlike. Our human spirit breaks down, and cannot work in the new
   maim into which He has now brought us. Man does not like to be reduced
   to a "beggar", but only then can the Power of heaven manifest itself.
   Then Christ can be all in all.

   When Jesus was teaching concerning prayer, He gave us three orderly
   phases of our prayer life: asking, seeking, knocking. Matthew 7:7: "Ask
   and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall
   be opened unto you." Now we cannot disarrange that. We would spoil the
   whole sequence; we would spoil the whole arrangement. We do not receive
   first by knocking; first is the aspect of asking--we ask, and then we
   receive. Our knocking is the last part. There is something in between
   --seeking: "Seek and ye shall find."

   First comes the spirit; then soul; then body. ". . .And I pray God your
   whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
   of our Lord Jesus Christ." (1 Thes. 5:23)

   Another divine arrangement is found in Psalm 27:1: "The Lord is my
   light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of
   my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" Here David is getting his
   experience in God. What is the first thing he finds?

   1.Light. (We must have that to get the whole thing going.)

   2.Salvation.

   3.Strength of life.

   The full swing of a conception of God is always in a Trinity.

   "He is my light." Light dispels darkness, but it also reveals my
   condition. David is in the realm of darkness, so light must come first.
   Jehovah God is my light; God, in the beginning, was the Author of it.
   The Lord is first unto me light. Now the reason for this is that the
   natural man is born in darkness. God's first approach is light; by that
   He begins to reveal to us what we are, who we are, and the condition in
   which we are in.

   "He is my salvation." The next bit of revelation is what God will be to
   David. The Lord is my light, and the Lord . . . is my salvation, my
   deliverance out of this chaos.-- So the second phase of this work is
   the presentation of the Christ in His redemptive work--that of my
   salvation.

   "He is the strength of my life." He is my light-- the One Who brings
   light to me, He is my salvation, delivering me out of my darkness,
   transforming me into the kingdom of light. Now I find that even here I
   cannot live it, only in Him. He has to be the very strength of my life.
   The Holy Spirit is the power and strength of my life. Therefore, in the
   last analysis, if your revelation of God is perfect, in the sense of
   completion, it will be a Trinity. David has had a revelation of God. He
   says, God is a Trinity!

   God is my Light--That's the Father.

   God is my Salvation--That's the Son.

   God is the Strength of my life-- That's the Holy Spirit. No revelation
   is complete unless it has the Trinity in it. There is a special
   ministry in my being for each Member of the Trinity. My fellowship is
   with the Father, with the Son, and with the Holy Ghost.
     __________________________________________________________________

                         Chapter 9 - Divine Revelation

   Never approach the Lord as you would approach any other literature. The
   Holy Spirit is needed for its revelation.

   Truth cometh by revelation, and that by the Spirit of God; not by our
   mental processes, but by the Holy Spirit, Who reveals the things of God
   to us. (1 Cor. 2:10)

   Teachers are those who have gotten into the Word, move in the Spirit,
   and have revelation, light, and Truth from God by the Holy Ghost. I
   have the Bible, and I have the Holy Spirit, but they run parallel in
   their responses. Just as soon as I move in the Word of God, I have to
   move into a broader, and more glorious revelation of the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Jesus said, "I am the Truth." This means that all Truth is personified
   in Him; all Truth becomes articulate; all Truth becomes fully
   expressive in this dynamic, marvelous, living Christ, and the nearer we
   get to Him, the more we love Him. Oh, those profound unfoldings by the
   Spirit, Who takes us into the Person of Christ, in Whom are hidden the
   treasures!

   If the Holy Spirit has been gracious enough to take us into the
   darkness, and has said: "Look, you have made a discovery," we come out
   enriched, because we have found some little, simple treasure in the
   personality setup of Christ.

   There is much that we can have which is quite visible and tangible;
   what we call the articulate aspect of Him. But there is so much of Him
   which is evasive. It is abstract, but it is in this Christ, and that is
   where I get blessed. When Jesus was here, He said, "I am the Truth." He
   means by that: all Truth is summed up in this revelation. "He that hath
   seen Me, hath seen the Father."

   You see, He is talking about a manifestation of the nature and
   character of God.

   The people who gathered about Him, and heard Him speak, saw His
   manifestation in miracle power. They were recipients of His grace, and
   even of His healing, but how many of you think they had any inner
   revelation as to His identity? No, they didn't--even His disciples did
   not.

   It took Him three Years of intensive work for the disciples to even
   recognize that He was the Messiah, let alone the Son of God! That never
   entered their brains when they first started out with Him, It was a
   long time before they even found Out He was the Son of God, They all
   supposed Him to be the son of Joseph. Later on they perceived by His
   learned exposition, and, finally, through His works, miracle working,
   and all the rest, that this Man did not teach or speak like any of the
   rest of them. Well, of course not!

   Finally, after three years, they could accept Him as their Messiah, but
   that is as far as their acceptance went! When Jesus came down from
   Caesarea Philippi, He turned to His disciples, when alone with them,
   and asked, "Whom do men say that I am?" Now if He had been revealed in
   a long white robe with a halo in the back of Him, do you think He would
   have asked that? NO. Then He asked, "Whom say ye that I am?" He pins
   them down, He doesn't want a general opinion from them. Peter answered:
   "Thou art the Christ." (Christ means the Messiah). But he says
   something more, "The Son of the living God."--"And Jesus answered and
   said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona for flesh and blood hath
   not revealed it unto thee, but My Father, Who is in heaven." (Matthew
   16:17) This was a revelation by God the Father. Truth comes by a
   revelation of the Spirit, not by reasoning, logic, scientific
   deduction, philosophy or any other scheme.

   "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father." (Matthew 11:27). Then it
   takes the Father, through the Holy Spirit, to reveal Him to us, but the
   Father is really the only One Who knows Him.

   Jesus Christ, and the Word of Life run parallel. If we are studying the
   Word of God as Truth, we will have to have the parallel revelation of
   the Lord Jesus running with it. Jesus doesn't stand over there, static,
   as we study something in the Word here. We have to have an inner,
   personal fellowship with the Lord running parallel with the Word, or
   there is no life or Spirit in the Word at all. We may have wonderful
   insight as to the letter of the Word, but there is no corresponding
   insight into the Lord. We do not have an inner consciousness of entity;
   no awakening. Anyone who is finding Truth in these deeper, fuller
   revelations of life in the Word of God, who is still entertaining the
   same vision and conception of Jesus he had fifteen years ago, is not
   very far along in spiritual growth. Why? The revelation of Christ, the
   personality of Christ, must unfold, and unfold, and unfold until we
   begin to find the treasures of this revelation --TRUTH HIDDEN IN THE
   CHRIST. It is hidden. Where will we get this Truth? It comes only by a
   parallel revelation. I never can read that Word of God, and get
   anything unless there is a continual, parallel revelation all the time
   in my spirit. I am discerning something new in Him. I see Him in some
   new slant of light. Why? As I read the Word, I see Him! He's the WORD!
   Keep that parallel. Don't try to divorce the Lord from the Word.

   Keep your parallel: The opening of the Word of God under the power of
   the Spirit, and the opening as to this wonderful Christ--God--the
   Eternal Son. God, coming to us in flesh, going home, but coming again
   in the power of the Spirit. Keep that, all the while, in parallel with
   the Word. It is a double revelation, and it is sweet, and we should
   have it!
     __________________________________________________________________

                             Chapter 10 - Emotions

   Sometimes I have a test of faith as I mature in God. He doesn't ask me
   to understand Him, but He understands me perfectly. I don't always
   understand Him, but I love Him anyway. Sometimes He is very difficult
   to understand, and I say, "Lord don't look at my tears. Please, look at
   me, in here, where I'm saying, Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord."

   The Lord has a right to leave me without a touch of His Presence for
   weeks or months at a time. I have my contact without my emotional
   reaction. If He wants to leave for China for three months, it's all
   right if I don't get blessed in three months, or even sing a little
   song while at home walking around.--I pay a price for every last thing
   I get from God. I pay a price for it, and I want to. He is not going to
   baby me.--We have to learn that, and that isn't pleasant.--But God is
   doing something inside of me like a tornado. Then out of that I come
   out with: "The Lord is wonderful!--He IS wonderful!"

   The further we go on in God, the less He is going to honor that field
   of the emotions. We have to learn to walk with the Lord without His
   conscious Presence, which is very terrifying. Less and less are we
   dependent on our old devotional patterns that served for our living.
   How can faith develop if He is going to humor us along all the time?

   In those difficult places we will never be able to synchronize the
   state in which we are moving with our fluctuating emotions. They will
   not always flow together. We are trying to let our emotions run
   parallel with our experience.
     __________________________________________________________________

                             Chapter 11 - End Time

   All the fields will be going into distortion--music, philosophy,
   literature, everything. The enemy comes in to distort it--the rhythm
   and beauty are gone. We see it in every field. The standards that
   maintained, and were good in their own fields, that all is
   undermined--in the nations, in government, in schools, in family life.
   God will let it run on that mechanism until it will run out on that. It
   is antichrist contrasting against Christ; against Truth; and a spirit
   of lowliness: May we be able to discern, and distinguish between them.

   People call the confusion and thunder in the nations today, a roar. It
   is a roar, but I hear God; I hear GOD; I HEAR GOD! When people are
   saying, "the roar" today, I hear the roar, but I also hear the voice of
   God, and He is speaking to those whose ears are attuned to Him, so they
   will not "think it strange." "What do you hear?" they ask. Well, you
   wouldn't believe what I hear, but I am not the only one. I have friends
   around the world, and I say to them, "Do you hear it, dear?" And they
   say, "Yes, it's an indication that it is God; it is God speaking; the
   movings of God." All some hear are the signs of the times, and the war,
   and some other things.

   I feel that there is an invasion of God all the time. I feel it in the
   world; I feel like He is pushing in all the time. I feel that toward
   the end of this time, heaven is pushing toward the earth in its last
   struggle. I feel it in my spirit; that invasion; that push; that holy
   urge of God. Some spirits become conscious of it, and are quite
   overwhelmed with it. They should be. Others are not, and I am very
   charitable with them.

Prayer:

   In these closing days, it seems we need Thee all the more, because we
   are conscious of the moving of the power of the enemy in every form
   that he can move in. He is pressing in upon us; he is pressing in upon
   the whole civilization in every field; the whole order. We are
   conscious of it. Lord, may we be hidden away in Thee continually, and
   able to partake of Thee and Thy life and vision enough to stand; to
   please and satisfy Thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Chapter 12 - Faith

   When God speaks the Word, it has two definite qualifies. It is
   authoritative, and it has creative power. The Word is quickened by the
   Spirit. Faith lays hold of, and wraps itself around that Word. It is
   our garrison of strength, and security for faith. Its creative power
   ministers to our faith and strengthens it.

   When He speaks a Word, it has:

   1. All the authority of heaven back of it.

   2. It is creative.

   A grain of faith always goes with the Word. When He gives the Word, He
   gives faith with it to encourage us.

   I don't want a God that I understand. I have a God Whom I can trust
   where I can't understand. He keeps much in the background SO that "we
   walk by faith and not by sight." So I won't understand every last
   thing. If you would understand God perfectly, there would be no place
   for faith, and He wouldn't be God.

   Truth has to pass the assent of the intellect, and has to come down to
   the heart. Anyone, who is truly converted to God, is intellectually
   converted first before his heart is truly converted, for the heart must
   have that before it is converted with faith. The heart, the whole
   emotional life, with the will, has taken hold of that Truth. My mind
   has grasped it long ago; my mind gave assent to it; then it goes to the
   spirit. It comes down into my inner being. Before the heart can reach
   out, it has to have an object. Faith demands an object which it can
   grasp.
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Chapter 13 - Fellowship

   Sometimes, just the offering of our humanity pleases Him. He loved the
   disciples' presence, but there was failure on their part on the Mount
   of Transfiguration. They also failed in the Garden, because of their
   limited spiritual comprehension. Matthew 26:43, "And He came and found
   them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy." The actual translation
   here is: "For sheer sorrow they slept . . ."

   Degrees of Fellowship

   He will give according to the capacity that is opened to Him. There is
   such a thing as putting that capacity, that receptivity in the hands of
   God, in the Spirit, so that He can take its potential, and open it
   until it comes to the fullness of all that God expects. He doesn't
   expect me to be Peter or Paul. He wants me to be just the creature that
   I am. He wants you to be just exactly who you are--not trying to
   strain, or be discouraged because you can't offer to Him what these
   magnificent saints have been able to offer. Don't be disturbed over
   that, but be very sure, dead sure, that what opening there is; what
   capacity you have; that's surrendered to the Lord all the time. Keep it
   open all the time to the Spirit; exposed to Him, so that as you read,
   as you come and as you go, as you speak, preach, sing, or pray,
   whatever you do, you are exposed there to receive whatever God has to
   offer. Then He will build up our fellowship. He will strengthen it; He
   will enlarge it until, when He fills that capacity, you will be just as
   blessed, and happy, and just as satisfying and pleasing to God as the
   one who has the capacity of Paul. You can give to God all that He
   expects of the pleasure and satisfaction from you. So can I. So could
   Paul. So I call this degrees of fellowship.

   We talk about "the fall of man", but the, word "fall" is not mentioned
   in the Bible--"death" is. . . ."In the day that thou eatest thereof
   thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17) Do you think death was in the heart
   of God when He created Adam? No. When God came, after Adam had sinned,
   He still had access to him; He still had communion with him. All of his
   wreckage does not hinder God coming and bringing him out of his
   wreckage into a glorious new creature--a thing that has never lived on
   the earth before.

   The first picture of a brokenhearted God is here in Genesis when He
   says, "Oh, Adam, where art thou?" He did not come to rebuke him, but He
   came to salvage him, and to bring him through. He didn't come down as a
   Judge, but as LORD God, Who would bring redemption to this whole
   chaotic being; the whole world. That was the lovely, marvelous Son of
   God! I want you to love Him.

   I only can feel a pathos in God's voice. "Adam, where art thou?" Adam
   had been made to bring to God a peculiar pleasure that no other thing
   in the universe could bring. No angels could bring it; no created thing
   could bring it; but man, in his response, because he is created in the
   image and likeness of God, could offer back to God that which the heart
   of God had always hungered for.

   He cares about a fellowship with you, more than anything on God's
   earth. He cares more about the fellowship of your heart than He does
   anything in the world, because it is something that only YOU can give.
   --People can do so many things. He wants you to become something. There
   is a process in becoming. Even in the next age I expect to grow. It's
   merely the releasing of the little seed plot here; the little
   potential. It took years to get it in shape to be released, and
   projected to the eternal ages as a media for the glory of God, and to
   give His heart pleasure. That's what life is about. That's what I want
   people to see.

   After a meeting, I was walking down a lane alone, thanking the Lord,
   and loving Him. How many ever just love the Lord?

                               Chapter 14 - Flesh

   God didn't even want the smell of sweat on the Priests. Anything of the
   human; the agitation of the flesh; the effort of flesh; He does not
   want. (Ezek. 44:18)

   Do not let the old nature which is still alive, direct traffic--deny
   yourself.

   The Book of Revelation was given to the Church; not the world. Keeping
   this in mind, God's judgment is coming upon all the earth--our
   humanity. He is coming to test us and prove us on the flesh level.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Chapter 15 - Gifts

   In Romans 11:29 we read that "The gifts and calling of God are without
   repentance." A gift can be operated purely in the flesh or psyche; it
   depends purely upon who is back of the motivating and directing.--In I
   Corinthians, chapters 12-14 we find Paul correcting their motives
   regarding the gifts. In chapter twelve he enumerates the gifts (the
   manifestation gifts as well as the personality gifts); in chapter
   thirteen he talks of motives back of the gifts; and in the fourteenth
   chapter he encourages them to seek after the best gifts.

   To better understand Paul in his teaching here, we must go back into
   the original Greek writings where we find that the translators (who are
   not inspired) have unfortunately placed the first verse of chapter
   thirteen as the last verse of chapter twelve. Let us read it as it
   should have been:

   "But covet earnestly the best gifts; and yet show I unto you a more
   excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
   and have not charity (love), I am become as sounding brass, or a
   tinkling cymbal." Paul is now no longer speaking of the gifts but of a
   WAY. The Corinthians had all the gifts and all the power. Paul had to
   correct them, for their motivation was wrong. Rather than their motive
   coming from their natural heart and life and disposition, it must come
   from the love of God shed abroad in their hearts and lives; the agape'
   love is to control the power of the manifestation in the gifts. When
   the gifts are not motivated by the love of God--that broken bleeding
   heart of Jesus--, if we don't have that to become the motive for their
   manifestation, it is nothing to God but sounding cymbals and rattles!
   He warns them that even though the gift may bless somebody, as far as
   its reaction in the one possessing the gift is concerned, it is not to
   the glory of God, and the heart is not refreshed, neither does he grow.
   "It profiteth me nothing."

   Paul tells them concerning spiritual gifts, as we read in chapter
   twelve, that he wants to do a little corrective teaching. He then goes
   on in chapter thirteen to give the law by which these gifts are to be
   operated. "Now show I unto you a more excellent way,"--not a more
   excellent gift. Love is never a gift; love is a fruit. He then goes on
   to correct their motivation. We will never understand chapters twelve
   through fourteen of I Corinthians unless we read them all as one thing.

                                Chapter 16 - God

   If God wants to appear in a body, He can, but in essence He is Spirit;
   not a spirit, but He is Spirit. The article is not in the original at
   all. He is Spirit. That is why He is present everywhere.

   I don't define God: I experience Him. I can have a doctrinal idea of
   God, but afterward I find the reality when I come in touch with HIM.
     __________________________________________________________________

                          Chapter 17 - God's Objective

Prayer:

   Thou hast always taken the initiative to reach us. In just that simple,
   and humble way, we come back and say, "Thank You, Lord; continue to
   draw us that we may run after Thee and find Thee." We are on our way
   back to Thy wonderful and loving heart, and we must be prepared to
   live, and move with Thee. Thou hast given us instruction in the Word,
   and Thou hast told us the objective that Thou art aiming at; the
   purpose Thou hast in Thy heart; the desires that are in Thy heart and
   mind. We want to discover them, and learn how to intelligently
   cooperate with Thee; to move with Thee under the inspiration of Thy
   Spirit and leadership.

   MY objective is to glorify God. HIS objective is to conform me to the
   image of His Son. Objective: Man was made to glorify God. Rev. 4:11:
   "Thou art worthy; O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for
   Thou hast Created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were
   created." 1 Cor. 10: "Whether, therefore, ye eat, or drink, or
   whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."

   The glory of God becomes the focal point toward which I move as a
   Christian. I am doing this for the glory of God --all. What is your
   objective for living? The naked will of God is the means to glorify
   God. "The heavens declare the glory of God." Why? Because the will of
   God is being done there. God wants people dedicated in every vocation
   of life. If you are selling neckties, the fact that God's will is being
   done, glorifies Him. God's will: want it as a holy thing; as a holy
   trust, whatever it is.

   Eph. 2:10: "God has made us what we are, creating us in Christ Jesus
   for the good deeds which are prepared beforehand by God as our sphere
   of action." (Moffatt)

   Col. 1:16: "For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
   that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by
   Him, and for Him."

   Heb. 13:21: "Make you perfect in every good work to do His will,
   working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus
   Christ: to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."

   Psa. 27:4: "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek
   after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my
   life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in His temple."

   He didn't make us because He needed us. He made us because of two
   reasons:

   1. To glorify Him.

   2. To do His pleasure and to do His will.

   He gives grace and strength for the execution of His will, and if
   people will take a little time just to find out His will, it would
   glorify Him, and we would go leaps and bounds in the things of God. We
   have a moral and spiritual likeness to God. These are qualities not
   found in the lower creation. To man He says, "Here is the world; have
   dominion . . . bring it into subjection so it can serve you, and it
   will provide all your needs."

   I wish you could get the reaction that is in my heart when I look at
   your hungry hearts. It thrills me. It thrills me to know there are some
   people in this busy, wild, furious, rat race of a world who still are
   conscious there is God somewhere: "Where is He? Will somebody help me
   find Him?" That's what I want too. I want to let God do the work that
   so many people are trying to do.

   Our preachers, and people are so busy trying to help God along, but we
   don't have to help poor God along. It's all I can do, with what little
   vision I have, to keep up with Him! What a strange philosophy has
   bewitched the people! It has bewitched them. God does not need us in
   that sense. He wants to love us, and He wants us to love Him. When we
   have a philosophy reduced to such simplicity, we just sit down and say,
   "Is that all?" He says, "Yes." If we love God perfectly, and we are
   conscious of His love filling us, we do all the things that are
   necessary.

   Now, wouldn't that take a burden off of ten thousand workers! They bear
   an assumed burden. I am not saying they are not burdened. There is a
   difference between a burden we assume--a religiousity, and a burden
   which HE brings, which is easy. It is light, and there is a sweet
   consciousness of that undergirding all the while we are carrying it.

   He would be greatly helped if He could get some souls aroused, and
   awakened so that they would love Him, walk with Him, talk with Him, and
   live with Him. But you see, that reduces life to such simplicity, and
   our world seems to love complication; multiplied complications, which
   makes them feel they are going somewhere in the world. But what is
   their objective? GOD is our objective.

   When the sound of God is in a meeting, how many know your heart knows
   it right away. That's a hangover of creation in its loveliness when it
   was real in the beginning. Everything was fresh and untouched;
   undimmed. The response in Adam to God was instantaneous. God could come
   down and communicate with him, and discuss the things that were on His
   heart, show him His will, how to possess; how to reclaim the earth.
   That was all in the heart of God.

   Man could respond when God came down in the cool of the evening,
   through a consciousness, (translated "sound"; or in English "voice")
   when God hadn't spoken yet. God had not spoken, yet they could hear
   Him. It's that subtle, strange, mystical union that we have with God--a
   fellowship that doesn't need words, how many know the closest, the
   loveliest things we have had in God cannot be put in words? Them is a
   joy; them is glory; them is a deep inner consciousness that no words
   can tell;--that sweetness; that inner communion; how many know it is
   past words? My deepest prayers have never been words; they are past
   words.

   God always moves toward two striking objectives in His creation: His
   glory, and His pleasure. These are the two great objectives toward
   which life is focused. No one dares to be original in God today; this
   age won't let you say, "Lord, what do YOU want?" Why were we made? I am
   sure we weren't made for the objective most people have today. "The
   heavens declare the glory." What are the heavens doing? They are doing
   the thing for which God made them. Even in inanimate creation, the
   first objective is "The heavens declare the GLORY of God." Even though
   creation is under an awful bondage, it still breaks through, and there
   is glory. How can we glorify God? Wherever the will of God is executed,
   He is glorified. Do what the Lord tells you to do.

   He told Adam, "Have dominion and authority, and cause nature to
   respond, and all these secrets that are now hidden, will be divulged to
   you. They will come to you as you grow With Me, and as I release them,
   and you are built to receive them, you can govern, possess, and move
   . . ." That was His program. So He Comes and deals with Adam. Adam gave
   Him great joy, and pleasure, and His creation functioned in the method,
   and procedure that it should follow. God rejoiced because He was
   finding satisfaction. God was being glorified.

   Then came the temptation. Now temptations are always of the devil.
   Testings, and provings are always of God. God never tempts us. God
   proves us, and tests us unto strengthening; unto growth. All growth is
   under a law of testing and proving.

   God had been absent in the interim when Adam sinned. Now, His first
   coming back, His first contact, is with a dead man with a moral and
   spiritual nakedness. "They hear the voice of God walking." They were
   acute to catch the sound which accompanies the Presence of God; the
   sound which is indicative of His moving. It must have been terrible
   when He came down, and walked in the cool of the evening, and found no
   response. Have you ever lost a very dear friend? Isn't it
   heartbreaking?--Lost--We can't fix it, and we can't mend it; we want to
   talk, and there is no voice.

   God walked the earth to gain a little fellowship from His own
   creation--to have the understanding, and the mutual intercourse of
   spiritual life with Adam. Oh, the broken heart of God! We will know it,
   sometimes, if we ever fellowship with Jesus in all the fullness. How
   many know it enlarges our whole capacity for God, and I raise Him for
   every heartbreak. "Farther on, the way grows harder." It HAS to.

   The last year of Jesus was the terrifying, terrible year of His life
   and we follow in His footsteps. Is the servant above the Lord? "If he
   would follow Me," Jesus said, "he must take up his cross." What did the
   cross do to Jesus? It was the instrument upon which He died. What will
   my cross be? It will be the instrument upon which I die. But what a
   release! All heaven opened to Him, and so it will with us.

   Adam, in the beginning, had a sensitivity to God; access to God;
   contact; he sensed God. That failure on Adam's part didn't finish God's
   walking. When Jesus came, He came to walk the earth again, that He
   might bring to man the Word of Life and Truth, and begin an intercourse
   of spiritual understanding. He walked the earth for what? Seeking;
   seeking; hungry for fellowship.

   The thing that would please His heart most, I think, is to have your
   heart in sweet fellowship with Him, more than anything you ever do or
   think. Why? Because that is something that nobody in the world can live
   but YOU. He has millions of angels serving him; many serving here, but
   few loves. It is so much more beautiful to sit five minutes in his
   Presence, and love Him! May God walk and talk within us.

                            Chapter 18 - Graduation

   It is our attitude toward Truth, and our power to receive that
   classifies us. Paul mentions three classes of people: natural;
   spiritual; carnal man. The thing which determines the class to which we
   belong, is our capacity to understand: our love of Truth; our embracing
   the Truth, and letting it work in us. We should ask ourselves the
   question: "Am I actually a lover of the Truth?"

   Gradation is all through the New Testament. It speaks about children,
   even little children, and by and by about sons and grown-up sons. Do
   you see a development? That is God. There is nothing static in Him.
   Gradation is also mentioned with regard to food: milk, meat, and strong
   meat.

   He sometimes gets the superfluous stuff, the non-essentials, out of the
   way. He says "Let us grow in grace and love." Two words in the Word of
   God have intrigued me: one is "TO GROW"; the Other is "TO LEARN." There
   is nothing in the two words of instantaneous acquisition, or grasping
   or holding. Salvation may be in a moment, but growing, and learning are
   processes. I am glad to find that they even relate to our Lord in His
   human aspect. When he took up the human concept to manifest and show to
   God what the Adam should be, He was restricted to it, and He GREW in
   stature and knowledge. HE GREW; HE LEARNED!

   "And though He were The Son of God, yet LEARNED He the things of God
   through a law of suffering." (Heb. 5:8) Well, that's the lovely Christ
   we have. Do you think we are exempt? No, Jesus said, "No scholar is
   above his master." We can grow just as much as we want to, and we can
   learn just as much as we want to. For both involve a process, but not
   an immediate possession. I can be saved in a moment, but it takes a
   lifetime to develop what God is after.

   We are changed from one degree of glory to another. We are still being
   changed. Note how the Revelation Churches made a display of what they
   did. "I know thy works (now don't bring out all that to Me), but I have
   somewhat to say to YOU."

   God is here, and He has plenty of food, but our portion of it is
   determined by how we react to the Truth. Proverbs 30:8 says, "Feed me
   with food convenient for me." The original reads: "Feed me with food
   which is my daily portion." What food may feed one, may not feed
   another who may not be able to grasp that portion of the Word at all,
   because we are all living on different spiritual levels. Our powers of
   receptivity have to be built up, and the hunger has to be created in us
   so that God can meet us.

   So many people say, "You have this, and you have that--God is good to
   this one, and God isn't good to that one." Now don't do that way. When
   He gave, it says distinctly in Matthew 25:15: "He gave to each
   according to his ability." How many can see that giving was governed by
   the individual, and not by God. He gave according to their capacity.
   The giving was regulated by the instrument; not by God. Yet people
   always say, "God did this, and God did that, and gave that one such and
   such." That's not true. God gives according to the receptivity of the
   individual, the capacity that is them. Now, none of us is accountable
   for that; we wake up with what capacity we have.

   In John 21, three kinds of sheep are mentioned: lambs (lambkins),
   sheep, sheep (old sheep), Jesus begins with the diminutive: "Pasture My
   little sheep." His first concern is His flock, but He is concerned with
   the potential sheep; not the old one. One can't do much with them.

   That is why I covet young people, because their thought patterns
   haven't all been arranged for them; their little philosophies haven't
   all been cooked up by some evangelist or Bible teacher, or somebody
   else, and all fixed for them. I want young people who are freed, and
   cleared from a lot of that technique to which they have to surrender
   and die. I often say, "Don't read too much. You will probably have to
   die to all of it anyway."

   John 21:15-17 says "So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
   Simon, son of Jonas, lovest (agapao--love unto sacrifice) thou Me more
   than these? He saith unto Him, Yea Lord; Thou knowest that I love
   (phileo--am fond of) Thee. He saith unto him feed My lambs. He saith to
   him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest (love unto
   sacrifice) thou Me? He saith unto Him, Yea Lord; Thou knowest that I
   love (am fond of) Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep. He saith unto
   him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest (phileo--fond of) thou
   Me? Peter was grieved because He said unto him the third time, lovest
   thou Me? And he said Unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou
   knowest that I love (am very fond of) Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed
   My sheep."

   Peter can only come up to "phileo" --I am very fond of You; not
   "agapao"--a love unto sacrifice.--Note: We get a beautiful lesson here.
   When we cannot measure up to the strong place He would have us reach,
   He comes down to us, and meets us in the measure of love of which we
   are capable. So the third time Jesus says, "Are you very fond of Me?"
   or "Am I dear to you?" This breaks poor Peter's heart, and he
   confesses, "Yea, Lord, Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am
   fond (phileo) of Thee (not agapao)."

   There are different methods of feeding too, which are not brought out
   in translations. Notice that the original words are different:

   1. Lambs--lambkins--graze. My lambkins; you (Peter-shepherds) have to
   go out and find the food; they are not safe to choose.

   2. Sheep--immature--lesser sheep who yet have to be grazed; they are
   not yet safe or able to discern error.

   3. Sheep--old sheep--feed; should be able by now to be turned out into
   pasture, and have "their senses exercised to discern truth from error."

   I ask the Lord to send me the people Who will be helped. So I always
   pray to keep away the people Who can't be helped, but bring in the
   People who need help, and know they need it, and are anxious to receive
   it. Then, I feel, that creates an atmosphere in which the Spirit of God
   can move. I have often prayed people out of the meeting, and prayed
   them in.

   When Jesus taught, it was the same. He didn't have one message for
   everybody. He had a message for the multitude; peculiarly the message
   with physical phenomena, such as healings and visions; the things which
   would attract them physically. He used all of those as He taught in
   fascinating parables and stories, but, when He was alone with His
   disciples, Scripture says, "He expounded all things to them." Can you
   see the difference? "For without parables He did not speak to the
   multitude"; only with them. When He was alone with receptive
   hearts--some that He could coach a little more, He was able to open
   even more.

   If we follow the gradation in the New Testament, illustrated by those
   who followed Him, we will be surprised to find He is always the center,
   and about Him moves this multitude; it gradually reduces and reduces,
   until it becomes quite a unique little group, who can really have an
   ear to hear. In Revelation it says over and over: "To him that hath an
   ear, let him hear"--those who have capacity to hear. So I pray, for
   those who have ears, to come.
     __________________________________________________________________

                              Chapter 19 - Healing

   Regarding healing: The miracle in the flesh will perish, but the
   miracle in the spirit--to make us into living spirits--will last
   through eternal ages. Do you want deliverance or development?

   People get these strange ideas that God always fits into the same
   pattern. He did not raise every corpse that was being buffed!

   God reaches the basic need by a physical distress.

   I am always healed in spirit first, before it ever touches my body.

   Christ's words are as much a miracle as His deeds. The very words He
   speaks are above the realm of nature and philosophy of man. The miracle
   of the Word is always above the miracle of the deed--it lasts for ages,
   but the deed only for time. When He works a miracle on my spirit, it
   abides through the eternal ages. The miracle on my body is only for
   time, and the miracle dies with me.

   We must learn this: God does not always do the things which He is able
   to do. He doesn't always want to do the things, because they are not
   always in His design and purpose. All things are possible, but all
   things are not always probable.

   Now regarding the man who claimed all the promises for the healing of
   his mother of cancer, and, when it didn't work, came to me asking,
   "Why?" He never once said, "What are You doing, Lord?" He was telling
   the Lord what he wanted the Lord to do! If he had spent five minutes
   before the Lord praying and asking Him to speak to his heart, and had
   said, "Lord, You give me a Word concerning this situation; I don't
   know. You know all my natural human instincts and desires, but I don't
   know what Your purpose is in this thing at all, because You have that
   situation relating to a great scheme of which I have no knowledge at
   all. What is Your will concerning this?" Then He will reveal His will
   to you, and always give you some Word of promise which will carry you.
   He has done that many times.--I have had to unlearn a lot I learned
   forty years ago; not because it was not scriptural, but the promise
   didn't pertain to that particular situation.

   Second Peter 1:4 says the promises are given to us. The promises are
   given to us; we don't take them to Him. When the emergency comes, and
   the need comes, God, knowing us and the whole situation, will give us
   the Word. Now don't try to get it the first minute; it isn't like a
   ouija board: one, two, three, bumble bee, I want a promise all for
   me. . . And then we get one and it doesn't work. Then we don't like it,
   so we put it back in the box, and then we pull out another one, and we
   say, "Oh, the Lord spoke to me!"

   God has HIS WORD, and He has a Word for every occasion, and, if we will
   be honest with Him, whether we like the Word He gives us or not, that
   is not the point. If we go to find a Word we like which we think will
   bridge the chasm, and then it doesn't work; that is disastrous. He may
   give us a Word that we may really not relish very much, but when He
   gives it to us, we can take it, and go to God and say, "Oh Father, what
   is Your thought about this situation? Now, Father, I could find a lot
   of promises which I would like, but I don't know how to use them,
   because I don't know which one fits this. Now, speak to my heart."

   It will take us a while to get still, and whatever Word He has, I don't
   care if it is the simplest thing, cherish that; hold it; that is fresh;
   a promise fresh from heaven, because God spoke it. We say, "Doesn't he
   speak through His Word?" Yes, but the Word in itself is a dead thing.
   If we go and find the promises, they are all dead. They have to be
   enlightened by the Spirit of God. When God speaks a Word it has two
   qualities about it. The Word which God speaks into our hearts has faith
   already with it, and it is creative. As soon as that Word gets into our
   hearts, it begins creating; bringing life; it has power. But a Word
   which we pick (now it is The Word of God; don't quarrel about
   that)--the one we pick has no life; no power. Let Him speak the Word;
   then we can go through with Him.

                            Chapter 20 - Holy Spirit

   After the fall and ruin, the Holy Spirit still moves as the life
   principle of God. He now groans throughout all creation, as well as in
   the heart of the believer, and waits for the day of triumph and
   consummation. He brooded over the earth in the beginning to bring it to
   its creation. Now He groans through us to bring it to its redemption.

   The Holy Spirit will live in anybody who will let Him. We talk of the
   humiliation of Jesus in taking upon Himself the form of man. That's
   fine, but I think it's also tremendous to know that the Holy Spirit has
   never assumed a body of His own. He says, "I will dwell in you. You
   will be My temple."

   Jesus says in John 16:13, "1 have many things I would like to talk to
   you about; but you cannot now take them, but afterward the Holy Spirit
   will lead (guide) you into all Truth." It's a leading --that means
   utter dependence.

   These songs (see JWF's book of Hymns) came to me in the Spirit. I
   remember standing with my guitar singing songs in the Spirit I had
   never heard sung; pouring out in the Spirit were the music and the
   song, the Whole thing born right out of that instrument, more than
   once. Have you ever been in a meeting where the Spirit would fall, and
   we would sing in the Spirit that way? It was a real manifestation of
   the Holy Spirit. But We don't have any of those early, lovely
   manifestations any more--any Pentecost that I know of. That was all
   very real. I am glad I came in in the early days, because that lovely
   thing had not been touched, nor tampered, nor meddled with by people,
   and there was no one to spoil or channel it. You see, it is in man's
   power to always channel it, label it, and have it arranged. God doesn't
   like that.

   Now the two characteristic marks of the early Pentecost that I remember
   were originality in the moving the Spirit, and spontaneity. Those two
   marks, I think are all blurred now. I have been in Pentecostal meetings
   a lot, but even in this outpouring that we have now, those two marks
   are not evident. There was an originality of the Spirit, but no one
   today wants to find room for it. They encourage the Spirit and tell Him
   what to do! That is wrong! When the Holy Spirit wants to work, we don't
   need to encourage or instruct Him in a thing, but it has come to that
   method where He has no original design or pattern, because He is so
   coached by all the rest: "Get them in the Spirit . . . let . . ."

   I always want to say, "Sit down; this is holy stuff; don't touch it."
   But you dare not do that. When the Holy Spirit had His way in those
   early days, He did unusual things which would be original and
   spontaneous--not studied, and no one planned for it. I have gone to
   meetings just dozens and dozens of times when not one would know who
   was going to have any part in the meeting at all most informal. The
   Holy Spirit might use this person or another as a channel through whom
   he would provide the theme for that meeting. It would be the key for
   that gathering, and the meeting would center around that one theme.

   Maybe the next night that person wouldn't have the Spirit on him at
   all, but another one would have a leading of the Spirit, and God would
   bring forth. It was spontaneous; it was not studied; we never had any
   programs made; in fact, we didn't know what they were. That can be
   maintained for a while--not too long. Religious flesh--not bad, vulgar,
   cussing, swearing, flesh, but religious flesh can spoil a thing as much
   as getting drunk. You don't have to get drunk to spoil it; just be
   religious. How many know you can be religious, and not spiritual? I
   have seen that.

   I would like to see the spontaneity of the Spirit rather than the
   efforts of man encouraging and handling it. The things in God don't
   need that; they don't need that. They need flesh to be quiet in His
   Presence. I have been in meetings where we didn't have one moving at
   all --not a hymn--not a prayer--not a scripture lesson, and sat in the
   Presence of the Lord two hours without one single manifestation of any
   description; then get up and go home so refreshed one would think he
   had a spiritual bath! I don't see that any more.

   What would our meetings today be like if anyone would dare to be quiet?
   It's like the two people who sat in a meeting; one sat so serenely, and
   so quietly, and then there was the extrovert: explosive, and
   demonstrative.

   He was saying, "Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory!" He said to the other
   man, "Haven't you any glory, brother?" The other man said, "Yes, mine
   is glory unspeakable!" I thought that was good. "Yes, mine is
   unspeakable, and full of glory." We don't need to arrange anything;
   just move with God. We can't regulate it. He would sometimes do the
   most surprising things, but we never knew how it would be. It can't
   last too long; man will always be there trying to manipulate the things
   of the Spirit.

   Now concerning the word power' as used in the New Testament, we find
   our English translators have combined two Greek words into one. There
   needs to be a distinction made here:

   1. Dunamis: The power to execute-- always His. (Acts 1:8; Luke 1:35)

   2. Exousia: Authority: that is always mine. (John 10:18) You will
   notice that He says, "When He, (the Holy Ghost) is come upon you, then
   things will happen." Why? Because the ability, the power to execute,
   the power to make good, the power to bring the thing through (dunamis)
   that is always His. He only lends the power to us, when the occasion
   demands; the dunamis; to make that thing do. Then the Holy Spirit comes
   upon us, the ability is ours, and then He lifts it. Why? To keep us
   dependent and humble, where we belong.

   Now the other meaning of the word power' is seen where Jesus said, "I
   have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again:
   The word power' (exousia) in this verse means authority. He went into
   the grave, and He did not come forth of His own power! He had
   authority, but God had to exercise the power (dunamis)! God, through
   the eternal Spirit raised Him from the dead.

   The power of authority, and the power to execute, are two different
   things.

   Every little while, as occasion demands, He drops the Holy Spirit--the
   dunamis--over me, and I have the ability to do that which His will
   calls for. Immediately after, I couldn't do that thing to save my life.

   We receive power to do the thing which He permits. He will give us only
   enough power as the occasion demands, and after that, we might as well
   sit down. God retains the right to dispense the power. God is yet
   sovereign. He only gives the measure when the occasion arises. That is
   why none of us can take the initiative to do things.

   The naked Word hasn't any power at all, but when He speaks that Word to
   my heart, the Spirit quickens it, and it becomes creative. Faith and
   power come with the creative Word.

   What is the attitude I am to take? --Lord, speak to my heart the things
   for which You want me to believe. Indicate to me what You want me to do
   in this situation. Then when He speaks the Word to my heart it is like
   dynamite--that thing will hold me through anything, and the devil can't
   hold anything against me when God gives me the Word.

   "And there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And
   when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written
   . . ." (Luke 4:17) He had definite instruction: it was Holy Ghost
   dictation. It does not say He hunted through the Scriptures until He
   found a passage which He always enjoyed. So many times the reading is
   what we like; not what He directs us to read. Oh, that He could only
   direct--direct in the choice of a hymn; a testimony; a verse, or what
   He desires! So many times the whole force and power of a meeting may
   hinge on a hymn suggested by the Holy Spirit.

   Everything in Spirit moves in rhythm. Rhythm is all the way through
   Scripture--ascending and descending, moving in a rhythmic movement. We
   may be sharing, ministering, teaching out them, but not for long; we
   have to come back. This is His divine process:

   Ascent = Glory, revelation, illumination, visitation.

   Decent = Execution, demonstration.

   Ascent = Jesus went up to Jerusalem --revelation.

   Descent = He went down to Nazareth --"and was subject unto them."

   Ascent = He went up Mt. of Transfiguration--glory, revelation.

   Descent = He went down to the foot of the mountain to the demoniac (you
   and I)--execution and demonstration.

   Ascent = He went up to Calvary.

   Descent = He went down to the tomb.

   Ascent = He arose and ascended.

   Descent = He has to come back again; it isn't finished.

                               Chapter 21 - Jesus

   We forget we have a victorious Head; He is crowned, and all power is
   vested in Him in heaven and in earth. We are only cells in the Body. We
   don't have to worry; just look at the birds, etc.

   He is the center of everything; He is the center of the universe, and
   everything should verge to Him. Our hearts should all the time move
   toward Him.

   If we know HIM; we know enough.

   The glory is not a divine attribute; it is a divine effulgence. Jesus
   could leave that glory to redeem man. "He took upon Himself the form of
   a servant."; the "morphe"; all the essential elements of man. (Phil.
   2:7)

   The divine Son of God is the core of His being. That can't be tempted,
   but this human which He has wrapped around Him can be tempted. How many
   know there is a "tree" in the wilderness? From God's side, the testing
   is to harden everything in Him like steel. From the enemy's side, it is
   unto destruction. As Man, he says, "I can of Myself do nothing-- not My
   will . . ."

   Jesus' vocation was to do the will of God. The Holy Spirit is the power
   by which the will of God is executed--the dynamic.

   I want to talk about Jesus in one of the characters He bears. He has
   many names, and He represents many characters. He is One in Himself,
   but He has many phases of life and character. While He was here on the
   earth, He called Himself the SON of MAN many times. I made a study of
   it, and it has given me new perspective in my vision of Him. He is
   projected out there, and I see Him in greater light than when I am too
   close. Sometimes, some things need to be looked at, and examined very
   closely; other times we lose all perspective when we get too close. We
   have to get away from them. For instance, we can be right in the
   mountains, and not see them, but if we are at a distance, when the
   light is just so, we get a different effect of the mountains. The
   impact upon our sense of beauty is one that we don't get while we are
   living tight in them, because we need perspective.

   We need it in our thinking; we need it in our approach to God; we need
   it in our study. People become involved in their own individual
   problems, and their own interests--that's good--, but too much of that
   is self-centered.

   When I was caught in that jam, God pulled me out of it. He told me,
   "You have to have perspective. Don't stay so close. When you are
   closest to the situation, you lose your sense of value, because there
   is nothing with which to contrast it. That's very fatal; your
   perspective is wrong. Now, come on, leave your situation where you are
   tight there; now come on. I won't hurt you; don't be Scared. Now come
   along with Me Over here."

   It's rather dating to get out of yourself for a minute. We are so
   self-centered. When he begins to dislodge us, and we stand over there,
   He'll say, "Now, do you see how it is?" When we are too localized, we
   lose our sense of value. That's one little fault we have as Christians,
   who love Him, walk with Him, serve Him. It took the Lord a long time to
   thrash that thing through with me.

   We have to find out who we are, and a little bit about ourselves,
   because we are too self-centered. He wants us to trust Him with the
   most sacred items in our hearts, but if we are fearful, He can't help
   us. We have to be dating enough to say: "Here is this situation, Lord,"
   and then let Him work.

   Being identified with us, He calls Himself: Son of Man. He was the
   perfect ideal concept of man. What did God make when He made a man? He
   was not only Savior, but He was God's ideal of a man. How do we know
   this? Because He calls Himself the Last Adam.

   He calls Himself Son of Man 85 times in the gospels: 32 times in
   Matthew, 15 times in Mark, 26 times in Luke, 12 times in John.

   The Holy Son of God could mask Himself. He was sinless, but dependent,
   just as much as Adam was dependent. No sin ever touched Him, but He
   assumed a role of deep humility, and said, "I will become that kind of
   man--dependent." For example, when He worked His miracles, He said of
   Himself, "I do not do these by Myself; what I see the Father do, that I
   do." Why does He say this? Because He is playing the part of that Adam,
   and the glorious aspect of the whole manifestation is Godward. He will
   redeem man, but His first thought is focused Godward.

   "I will live unto the glory of God. I will become an obedient servant
   unto God, and in this plan will be the redemption of mankind. My first
   thought is Godward, that He might have the satisfaction He never found
   in Adam." God found it in the Last Adam. He identified Himself as man
   at the baptism. He prayed because He had to pray.

   On the Mt. of Transfiguration, the glory broke out from WITHIN. It was
   concealed all the while He was walking this earth. The Word is careful
   to say that the glory came from within; not that something came upon
   Him. Nobody knew the Miracle Who walked this earth. But you see, when
   Jesus comes to maturity, it is released, and He is glorified. His
   garments--His body were like a tremendous, shining light; transfigured.
   We shall yet reach such a state by a glorified body. Adam never should
   have seen death. He should have seen glorification. No idea of death
   was in God's thought for Adam. The Last Adam moved to the place of
   glorification.

   What isolation!--I think that Jesus must have been the loneliest of men
   because He had no one with whom to share His exaltation when He stood
   upon the mountain top; no one to understand His cryptic words, nor to
   decipher His writing in the sand. He chose an inner circle, but their
   vision was so dim that even by His side they were a world away from
   Him! I think, perhaps, when coming down from some transcendent place,
   the flame of mystic revelation was upon His face.

   In the temptation in the wilderness, Jesus was with wild beasts, but
   none of them touched Him. He had dominion over them. He could speak to
   the fish, and they came up with a coin. He could speak to the storm
   that the devil was raging, and there was calm. The enemy is the prince
   of the air, you know: the prince of all those elements, and sometimes
   he likes to bring on a ferocious, terrific time. It isn't God at all;
   it's the devil. The devil was always out to kill Him. When He was a
   little baby, the devil tried to kill Him, and later, in Nazareth, he
   tried to throw Him over a precipice. He always wanted to get Him out of
   the way, but God wouldn't let him. Jesus had authority over the
   elements: "Be quiet!" That was authority; the authority of a perfected
   man talking!

   Jesus took the human nature in which He voluntarily chose to move. He
   took that nature up, and wrapped it about Him, but inside He was
   eternally the Son of God; the Eternal Son of God; one of the Trinity;
   but He chose to limit Himself. He laid aside so much; not His deity;
   not His divinity. He still maintained that divinity, but He said, "I
   will throw about Me this human nature with its limitation, and with its
   utter dependence. I have to be the Last Adam. Them was a first one. I
   have to be, before God, the Last Adam."

   What else did He have to be? The perfect man that God wanted Adam to
   become. He was demonstrating what that perfect human being should have
   done. I wish you would make a distinction, when you read of Jesus
   walking and moving--can you distinguish between a supernatural
   manifestation of God, and also a manifestation of a miracle that comes
   from Jesus?--for He moved many times as man, when people thought it was
   only God. No. It was the forces and powers of an ideal, perfected,
   human concept of life, without sin, limited and dependent, which could
   do things.

   God said to Adam: "Now I have given you, potentially, powers for that
   in your human construction. If you will abide and live with Me in My
   will and purpose, these powers will all function in your life. Keep
   yourself exposed to Me; and I can cause these things to move naturally;
   not as additional powers added to you as a human being."

   That is the marvelous expression of what God wanted the first Adam to
   do, which he failed to do through sin and disobedience. But the
   restored; the real Adam; moving in God; in His will; could have this
   marvelous expression. He could have dominion over all the earth. He
   could say, "Fish, come," and they would come. As the Second Adam, Jesus
   is a striking, wonderful example of what the first Adam could have
   been.

   I want you to see His utter dependence in His manifestation as the Last
   Adam. Jesus doesn't act independently in anything. He is the most
   dependent creature. He restricts His fashion of living to the fact that
   He is the Last Adam.

   In creation, God made man limited and dependent; two chief
   characteristics of the human. Man is dependent upon God, for there is
   no life in himself; he is a created being, and he is limited to moving
   within the sphere of the natural bounds. Of the human nature, God said,
   "I will make it dependent and limited. I will make him dependent so
   that man cannot of himself do anything, but, as I give him life and
   strength, and My will is revealed, he will take his will and attach it
   to Mine, and We will work together."

   Man didn't originate anything. God originated all the planning; Adam
   was to execute it as limited and dependent man.

   Jesus was a completely consecrated instrument in the hands of God for
   the display of God's grace and power. "He that hath seen Me hath seen
   the Father. I don't originate anything. The Words that I speak (the
   message), are God's; the power that I have is God's. I am the Last
   Adam. I am functioning, but there is no independence in Me; nor in any
   of the Trinity."

   Concerning the Spirit, He says, "When He, the Spirit, is come, He will
   take of the things that I have given, and show them unto you." He will
   not speak from Himself--not: "He will not speak of Himself." (Of' is a
   poor preposition.) He speaks of Himself in His ministry hundreds of
   times, but He never speaks from Himself as an authority. "He will take
   the things that I have given, and speak them unto you." Why? To keep
   that strange dramatic unity in the whole scheme: the Father, the Son,
   the Holy Spirit:

   The Trinity in His teaching;

   The Trinity in His message;

   The Trinity in His method of work.

   So He says, "If you have seen Me, you have seen the Father, for We are
   One. What I do, that's the Father working through Me; for I preach what
   the Lord God Jehovah gives Me; I am an instrument in His hands."

   I like His yieldedness and His absolute surrender. It astounds me! The
   more I see Him, the more I marvel at this Christ; the most tremendous
   character that ever walked the earth; the most sublime personality that
   ever touched the earth! (John 14:8-11)

   The last thing Jesus ever offered back to God was His spirit. Jesus'
   life was one of: Obedience, devotion; utter dependence.

   He had to do a lot of things before He could teach.--Acts 1:1 "The
   former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both
   to do and teach."

   In Jesus' teaching, He never did too much with effect. He dealt with
   causation. In the Old Testament, God always dealt with the immediate:
   the act; that's as far as it could go. Adultery-- kill! Don't you think
   Jesus was cognizant of wrong? Certainly. Did He pick at the wrong? He
   went back to causation, and helped the poor creature with the thing
   that caused it. Causation is our field of motivation.

   The Old Law said, "That is wrong!" The New Testament says, "That is
   wrong; what made it wrong?" Listen to Jesus' teaching:

   "It has been said an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth . . . but I
   say unto you . . ., something has provoked that deed, let's see if we
   can't get that thing fixed. It has been said, thou shalt not commit
   adultery, but let's go back to what caused the adultery. He that hateth
   his brother has already committed murder . . ." You say you can't prove
   it; where is the knife and the pistol? That kind of murder isn't done
   with knives and pistols. Don't you know many people have been slain,
   because of a hateful spirit on the part of some person? The root of the
   thing is our field of motivation.

   Christianity is not a philosophy. It is a way of life. We may make
   philosophic patterns for its detailed movings-- that's legitimate--but
   we cannot reduce it to any philosophic form with which we are familiar.
   We are treating it from one level when it is resting in another. It was
   never intended to be pulled down to fit into our modern thinking and
   ways.

   Jesus didn't come to bring a new philosophy by which we could live; He
   came to bring us life: a redemption to bring us out of the chaos of an
   old setup in every form, through a marvelous redeeming action. That
   redeeming action moves into every field of our lives and beings. It
   isn't a philosophy; it is life. "I have come to bring you life." He
   didn't say, "I have come to redeem you from hell." He has, hasn't He?
   Yes, but He never allowed His teaching to move between these two points
   to which it has been reduced today. Our popular evangelism, and most of
   the popular teaching about Christ, move between these two: heaven and
   hell. Escape hell, and go to heaven. Jesus never taught that way. We
   never can find a message that he preached on heaven, or on hell. If
   those are the two great paramount issues, then why didn't the Son of
   God ever preach about them?

   What are the two pivotal points, then? They are life and death. So we
   come quite amiss; we come quite short of what He intended us to have.
   "I have come to bring You life." If we have that life, we escape
   hell.--Don't make issues of things He never made issues of at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

                          Chapter 22 - Kingdom of God

   In Luke 17:20-21, where He speaks of "the kingdom of God"--this kingdom
   realm that we live in--Jesus didn't call it "the kingdom." He called it
   "the realm" and I like it much better; Many of our translators are
   using the word "realm" now, and they should, because our word "kingdom"
   has these connotations of bugles, banners, horses, chariots, and
   thrones. He isn't talking about that. He is talking about a vast realm
   of spiritual reality. All spiritual reality is in this one realm called
   the kingdom of the Spirit, which is the new realm into which we are
   birthed. We have to live in this realm, just the same as in the world
   into which we are born. We have to learn to adjust ourselves to it.

   When He introduces us into this kingdom, He introduces us to a vast
   realm. In that realm He has angels, paradise, and all that world; a
   domain; a kingdom over which God rules; over which there is
   jurisdiction and purpose. In creation, God said man should reign or
   rule over a great domain. In that kingdom are various
   kingdoms--mineral, animal, vegetable.

   When He made a man, He made a vast new realm consisting of the human
   concept of life. He made us human beings with capacities and potentials
   that we don't know anything about. God was to be glorified in this vast
   field or realm. The realm remained after man became a sinner, but there
   was no King; no authority that the realm was designed for. That
   kingdom, without a King, waited for a King. This realm is in every
   heart, waiting for the King to come in to possess it. Jesus said to the
   Pharisees, "The kingdom of God is resting within you." He seeks to
   possess that kingdom, and He longs to get power over it. It is waiting
   for Him to possess.

   Scofield calls the kingdom, "salvation" which is wrong. God brings a
   spiritual thing in. He is enthroned in our hearts. We enter this
   spiritual kingdom through a new birth. He is reclaiming that kingdom
   every time He comes into a heart. "He came to seek and save that which
   was lost."--His redemption not only includes man, but all creation.
   This Whole universe, because of sin, has to be redeemed. On the cross,
   the blood touched the earth first; "Cursed be the ground." That is the
   first thing that was brought under judgment.

   "Unless you are born of the Spirit, you cannot see (understand) the
   kingdom of God." (John 3:3)

   "And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven
   suffereth violence and the violent take it by force." (Matthew 11:12)
   "Taking the kingdom of heaven by violence" means stress, and suffering
   on our part in order to possess this realm into which He has birthed
   us. We have great joy and all that, but that is sort of a sideline. To
   me, the life of the Spirit is, in a sense, the most tragic thing I can
   get into. It's the opposite of what 1 think it is. It takes all my
   struggle, power, and strength to possess it.

   When God told the Children of Israel to go into Canaan, He said, "I
   have given it to you." In a little while He said also, "Go in to
   possess it." This was a potential term. They were not qualified yet to
   possess it. The land was full of giants, and walled cities, which
   required a struggle for its possession.

   I never have known more about the power of the devil than when I got
   the baptism. It was then that I found I couldn't make possession in
   there (Canaan) without a terrific struggle. "Whatsoever your foot
   (faith) possesses," that is yours. Possessing your land is Truth, which
   becomes personalized. "He will not suffer thy foot to be moved." (Psa.
   121:3) We have to get into the realm of God through many a trouble. The
   Children of Israel got into the land by a gift, but they didn't get
   possession of that land except by force. It is grasped by force.

   ". . . We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
   (Acts 14:22b) Through great distress, trouble, and suffering, we enter
   the kingdom, this realm of spiritual reality and living. That kingdom
   is entered through much tribulation, trouble and discipline. Why?
   Because that is necessary to release you and me from the bondages which
   would hinder and wreck the lovely design and objective that God has for
   your life and for mine. God's objective for man is to glorify Him and
   to give Him pleasure. How will one person glorify God? By bearing a
   cross which is almost impossible to share. How will another? By bearing
   that suffering with Him, which nobody knows but that one and the Lord.
   In the end he will see he has glorified God.

   "Though He slay me," yet God's grace is holding me; the Holy Spirit is
   holding me. "Though He slay me," yet will I hold on to Him, and move
   with Him. Life, if you want to know, is the most tragic thing; at least
   I found it so. You can love the will of God, but you can't always enjoy
   everything that is in the will of God. No, it says, "Jesus ENDURED"
   things. He endured how? "For the joy that was set before Him." He
   endured this life, the cross, and all for what? "For the JOY that was
   set BEFORE Him;" not the joy which He experienced.

                               Chapter 23 - Life

   Accept life--God knows all about it. Turn your life over to Him. Let
   Him show you how to work it out.

   If you learn to interpret life, you can accept it.

   Regarding high, ecstatic points in life, we can't maintain the
   emotional stimuli of that high point. We couldn't live under it. We are
   not made to; our spirits are made to go up, and become acquainted with
   the realm of spiritual reality, and then come down again, and live it
   out in practical life.

   Talents were given to each servant; not sinner, in Matthew 25:14-30.
   Talents here means the responsibility of life which He deposits in us.
   God is never partial. What have you done with the gift of your life? It
   can be wonderfully invested and multiplied--the life, light, truth,
   illumination, whatever He has deposited in you. I am only responsible
   for what I am. The capacity is varied in each. How many would like to
   have the burden and responsibility of the five talent man?

   The reward has nothing to do with a material thing; it was a spiritual
   thing. Some day He will hold me accountable for my use or abuse of it,
   i.e. life (talent). Will you invest it in a thing that will bring a
   return, and result to the glory of God? Or will you squander it so that
   it won't have a return? The responsibility of life and vision--what
   avenue will you use?

   I say to young people, "Make a good choice here which will carry you
   through the ages. We can't come back again and make it." What decision
   we make, guarantees, and puts a qualifying character mark on us, which
   is projected into the next age: He said it in the New Testament
   regarding faithfulness. "He that is faithful over a little--I will
   elevate that quality of faithfulness which I have worked in you--not
   the things you have been doing. All this work you did was the
   technique. I was not interested in that. That was the medium which I
   used: all that you did worked in you. I am bringing to pass in you a
   quality of faithfulness. It has taken your lifetime to accomplish in
   you what I was after, and that is what I will multiply tenfold in the
   next age.--I Will make you ruler over ten cities."

   Now that doesn't mean He is going to make you ruler in Timbuctoo over
   ten cities. I don't want you to think that. He is talking about
   spiritual things using the symbol of ten cities. Don't get hung up on
   that. No, He is looking for these qualities--they are abstract, but
   real.

   So He says, "I've found in you a quality called faithfulness, and you
   were faithful over the least thing; that's the thing I want projected,
   and multiplied tenfold."

   Won't it be wonderful to feel that all this living wasn't in vain after
   all! We had to have all the discipline to produce the quality of
   faithfulness. Then we say, "Look, Lord, what I did!" No. He said, "I'm
   not concerned with that." Did you notice in that story of those
   talents, when they came to deliver their response, and stand before
   Him, Jesus never said a thing about any of the works they did? I said,
   "Lord! You didn't even thank them."

   Do you know what the Lord said? He told me, "Whatever was worthwhile, I
   had to do it, because it was Spirit-wrought." He doesn't thank Himself
   for anything He does!

   How many can see the emphasis in our Christian world is completely out
   of order today? The emphasis is on: "To the work! To the work!" I say,
   "What are you building a church for unless the Lord is in it? If the
   Lord tells you to build a church, build it. If He doesn't tell you any
   such thing, then be still."

   He is looking at us; He is training us; disciplining us. God says, "I'm
   giving you these little things to teach you. I want them to work
   faithfulness, love, and charity in you through this medium. I let you
   go as a missionary. Now you thought you were going to bring all the
   world to the feet of the Lord."

   We aren't big enough to do that; we are too little. God is big enough,
   though. He may not call some other man to the mission field at all, but
   let him serve where he is. This same man may cry, and say, "That other
   man is over there saving the heathen, and I can't be over there." God
   says, "Don't worry," but we get worried about it, because we don't see
   God working in our everyday pattern of life. We don't seem to know much
   about Him. He only puts these activities into our pattern for their
   reflex action; not to encourage God, but as we react to these
   activities, we are changed. We are not the same creatures. God didn't
   even thank them for their works. No work is acceptable to Him except
   that which is wrought in the Spirit, and no work is acceptable to Him
   except that which has gone through death.

   So, for what has a man to be thanked? The very first word Jesus says to
   all those churches in Revelation is, "I know thy works. Now sit down. I
   have something to say to YOU. Don't come here with your arms filled
   with all the things you did. That's nice; it kept you busy; kept you
   out of jail, and some other things.--Well done, good, faithful
   servant." The emphasis is on the SERVANT and not the works: What is the
   work accomplishing in this man while he is engaged in these activities?
   It produces three qualities:

   1. "WELL DONE"--It has to be correctly motivated, and wrought in the
   power of the Spirit.

   2. "GOOD"--

   In Swedish or Norwegian the word for good, "good" is "God-like". It
   comes from the same root word.

   The very thing that has occupied you has wrought in you a God-like
   quality, which is reflected in your character.

   3. "FAITHFUL"--You can be faithful when you can't be successful. It
   isn't that you are so successful, but you are faithful. On the basis of
   this faithfulness, you have the quality that He wants to expand in the
   next age. (Matt. 25:14-30)

   If you are selling peanuts, sell them to the glory of God.

   If you are a carpenter, be a carpenter to the glory of God.

   If you are washing dishes, wash the dishes to the glory of God.

   Why? It isn't just washing the dishes--it's the spirit back of it.
   There are some people never called to go to the mission field, or to
   preach.

   In Luke 15, we read of an awful famine in a far country. The word
   prodigal' is not in the Bible, but "younger son" is. The phrase
   "riotous living", used in this story, means extravagant expenditure of
   living. The life was misspent, or didn't bring the return or meet the
   objective for which it was meant. It was squandered; it had no return;
   it was wasted. God received no return from His investment in the life
   of the younger son. Your life can be lost in its most cultured form,
   because it never yet functioned in the field where it was meant to be.
   Life had lost its aim, and never found it.

   No man fed him, because it is not in his nature to feed a spiritual
   desire; nothing in the world can feed that! We never find any
   satisfaction, or meaning to life until we come back to our first
   primary principle, and we enter into the thought that: "The heart was
   made for God; neither can it rest until it rests in God." (St.
   Augustine) The younger son never came to himself--that evasive ego; he
   never came to that until . . . (Luke 15:11, 32)

   If life doesn't obtain the objective for which it is intended, it is
   "riotous living". "Riotous living" doesn't bring back the income--the
   purpose for which it was intended. It's the wrong investment. Life has
   lost its objective and purpose in unfortunate, wasted living. But God
   is interested in its restoration; not its punishment.

   In John 4:5-42, we have the story of the woman at the well. She had had
   five husbands, and the one she was living with was not her husband.
   Five is suggestive; it is an incompletion; an exhaustion. It is always
   a five--five avenues in which the hungry heart moves out on--five
   senses too.--We have the avenue of five senses to move out on before we
   strike reality in God.

   We can almost name them:

   1. Intellectual research

   2. Love

   3. Service

   4., 5. Any kind of aimless pursuits toward which we push and focus our
   lives.

   She had had five husbands, but never found what her heart wanted. We
   have all these husbands to which our hearts are united, but there is no
   marriage; no union; no completion, because the heart was never made for
   it. But when she says, "Come, behold a MAN!--I have found THE MAN.
   Behold, here is the Answer to my life problem! My life has been pushing
   out through all these avenues." These five men represent various things
   in an individual life. Think of the pursuits we have made before we
   find THE MAN!--THE Answer!--The ONE! Come behold HIM!--He is the
   Center. I feel any testimony or any life which is organized and
   centered about anything but the Presence, and the Personality of that
   dynamic Christ is miscentered.

   Everything that God brings, and permits to come into our lives, has an
   objective; it has a reason. We have to learn to interpret it.

   We will never grow without a conflict and battle. Where there is life;
   there is opposition. Note the flowers, as they push through the hard
   soil.
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Chapter 24 - Love of God

   The first vocation of personality is expression; it is basic. Man is to
   love; to live; to get out; he is made with potential powers. Out in the
   world, man has never found the proper avenue through which he can
   express himself, to really live.--No Christ--no essential element of
   Life. He came to bring Life.

   Oh, the persistency of the love of God in seeking; the social instinct
   of God! We see it in the Trinity--God the Father, God the Son, and God
   the Holy Spirit. There is an interchanging, reciprocating, oneness
   relationship among Them. We see the social God in creation; He is
   always after us. He is interested; He persists. Note the first question
   in the Bible: "Adam, where art thou?" He is still asking our lost,
   broken down, alienated Adam, "Oh, heart, where are you? Oh, soul, where
   are you?" Oh, the persistency of the love of God! In Genesis He is a
   seeking God, and in Revelation He is still pursuing, seeking: "Behold,
   I stand at the door and knock . . ." Oh, the persistency of the heart
   of God in seeking! God is not defeated, even though man may fail.--He
   comes and visits Abraham--still comes to him. He comes to Moses; the
   longing, loving heart of God.

   Then He comes to the Tabernacle. The purpose of the Tabernacle in the
   wilderness was, as God said, "Let them make Me a Sanctuary that I may
   dwell among them." (Ex. 25:8) God gets a little bit nearer; He tries to
   get just as near to broken humanity as He can. He desires to bring us
   back to our original purpose, and glorious destiny. We were made for
   the purpose of glorifying Him, and having communion and fellowship with
   Him. By and by, there is a temple--a place where God manifests Himself.

   Then comes Jesus; the Son from the Father's bosom--God manifesting
   Himself in the flesh. "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."
   (John 1:14) He walks again with man on earth, and comes oh, so near!
   Again we see the persistency of the love of God.

   God, in the power of the Spirit, will come even closer to the heart,
   and live in the very body of the individual who will let Him. The sweet
   Spirit of God; the breath of God; the Third Member of the Trinity, has
   only your body and mine. I had to apologize to Him for it.

   Have you ever apologized to Him? Jesus had a body given Him: "A body
   Thou hast prepared for Me." But the Holy Spirit has none but ours to
   live in.

   Now it is the Body, the Church, that becomes the spiritual house of
   God, built of living stones. (Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5)--It is the
   individual heart that is the present dwelling place of God on earth.
   "He dwelleth not in temples made with hands."

   Oh, the persistency of the love of God to come, and touch a life; to
   get hold of a man! The love of God comes to this poor, distorted, human
   being, and says, "I can save; cleanse; fill you, bring you back to
   coordination, and live in you, if you will let Me." Think of Him living
   in our bodies today! Some day the Holy Spirit will have our glorified
   bodies to live in!

                                Chapter 25 - Man

   Man was made for God's pleasure and glory. God is seeking the glory
   which is due His name. He is seeking the pleasure which His loving
   heart has long sought in humanity. So, He always came in the cool of
   the evening, and He said to Adam, "Possess the earth; I have given you
   all the potentials for it. I have blessed you; given you all the
   intelligence that is necessary; cooperate with me, and possess this
   world. Bring it into subjection; release all its secrets of nature.
   Release all of these glorious, hidden things that are mysterious and
   strange." All that glorious, marvelous concept of life was hidden away
   in the heart of God, and He wanted it to come forth in man.

   "Do My will, and it shall flow.

   Let your will be united with Mine;

   It will be one.

   I will show you.

   I will reveal to you.

   I will show you the secrets,

   and you, in obedience to Me,

   free from the hampering,

   and all the bondages of this horrible sin

   that's in the world,

   freed from it,

   thou shalt move out in a glorious,

   glorious pattern."

   God wanted this in His original thought and purpose. He says, "Adam,
   choose with Me; don't argue."

   But, you see, the enemy, long, long before creation here, missed the
   whole thing in heaven. Fallen, now this enemy who had been cast out of
   the heavens, with a third of the angels with him, in the enemy's
   resistance to God, and in his defiance, says, "Will you have a
   creation? I'll damn it!" That's the eternal, everlasting purpose of
   Satan; to defeat the things of God; to blast; to ruin; to steal; to
   kill; to destroy.

   But we have a Redeemer; Oh, glorious Christ! Eternal Redeemer! You have
   paved the way back. You have defeated him. He is a defeated foe. He is
   defeated. You told us a little about the redemption. Help us to receive
   it in all simplicity.

   The highest vocation of any spiritual manifestation is worship and
   adoration; not service,

   You can't define man; you describe him.

   The tree of life causes us to know that in us dwelleth no life. God
   made man dependent and limited.

   The tree of knowledge of good and evil is for our development; to
   release all the potentials that are hidden in us.

   "Adam, I have blessed you, and am pleased with the product of your
   creation. Now I want to be pleased with a performance of it. That will
   come by a law of testing and proving." Probationary law governs all
   growth. "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of
   the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest
   thereof thou shalt surely die." (Gen. 2:16, 17) Just in the command
   there is a temptation, a testing. The subjects here, Adam and Eve,
   should not consider whether it is a good command or not; the command
   comes from an all-wise God. God cannot do anything that is not fair. He
   can do no injustice. He cannot lie; steal; Or do evil. He is all holy
   love in His essence. His foreknowledge does not compel Adam to sin. In
   his foreknowledge, He already had a Lamb slain,

   His foreknowledge doesn't destroy my individuality or personality, but
   the rest of my days He works, transforming, remaking, converting,
   recasting, until I can become partaker of the image and likeness of the
   Son of God.

   It is so secure to be in a place of dependence.

   Man is not to live by bread alone, but because he is a spiritual being,
   he, first of all, has to have contact in the spirit with God. Man is,
   first of ail, spirit, and should live under the power and inspiration
   of the Spirit.

   Spirit--soul--body. Man always says: body--soul--spirit. Why? Because
   man is body conscious first, and knows little about this spirit, but
   knows a lot about the body. God always says: "Spirit; soul; and body"
   because His concern is primarily with the spirit. He is not too
   concerned about the body. It's only the house that we live in: the
   vehicle.

   The body, the flesh, is a sacred, holy instrument, and the redemption
   of God covers every aspect of our being. There is a trinity of being:
   spirit--soul--body. There is a trinity of personality:
   intellect--emotions--will.

   There are two characteristic marks which govern in our human nature
   capacity, and in the structural law of being:

   1. We are limited.

   2. We are utterly dependent upon God. We have no independence outside
   of Him. He never gives His power (in the Greek --"exousia" and
   "dunamis") to anyone. He lent His power to Adam.

   We are not on a picnic; we are in a warfare. We are engaged in a
   battle. We are in a tremendous process of being extricated, and
   conformed. God is dealing with us drastically; sometimes most
   ferociously, and sometimes very tenderly, He wants to extricate us; to
   get us on the grounds where we belong, with our vision where it should
   be, and to teach us how to walk with Him in the Spirit.

   The discipline I may call forth from God takes a life-time. It is good
   we don't see very much before; He can't trust us with it. If I had
   known what I would have to go through the last twenty-five years, I
   don't know if I would have had the courage to face it.

   Adam was perfect in his potential: untouched by sin when he stood there
   at creation, but he was not perfectly developed. "Adam, I don't expect
   you to know it all, but I will reveal to you the secrets, and you can
   possess this whole place down here. I'll keep revealing to you the
   secrets; the knowledge; the whys; the hows; and as you abide in Me;
   come to Me; and deal with Me, and I deal with you, you will grow and
   develop."

   Never get your nature, and character confused. Adam had a perfect,
   God-given nature, but the character he built himself. How? By all the
   ten thousand choices he made.

   We are too tied up with this ego-centric thing that we have been living
   with here. If we could just step over there, and judge it with the
   Lord, that would be a little sign of maturity. ". . . Lord, will You
   hold me while You look at it?" We have to be held, because sometimes we
   are quite faint when we know what this ego is like. Then we can side
   with Him against that ego. We choose to side against it; our choice is
   with Him. When we are in agreement with His choice, we are perfectly
   safe, but our own choice is not safe.

   I am not what I am in my intellect, or in my emotions, but I am what I
   am in my WILL!

                               Chapter 26 - Music

   I don't always enjoy hymns and music used in some places. Some songs
   annoy me. They have a rhythm, and a tempo that is not in rhythm, and in
   gear with what I feel in my spirit, and it annoys me.

   We have so few hymns going back to God. Most of them are salvation
   hymns.

   There are three kinds of hymns:

   1. Experience hymns center on self.

   2. Prayer hymns are for something or someone.

   3. Worship hymns are directed to Him.

   He knows our limitations, but when the Spirit keeps moving, He makes
   one lovely song--our songs, our singing seem very shallow as against
   the melodies, and the glory, and worship in heaven. Of course, it's
   very broken, and seems very shallow, but it's the best that we have.
   "Dear Lord, look on our hearts, and read them; receive from us what
   little we have."
     __________________________________________________________________

                             Chapter 27 - New Birth

   In this dispensation, the Holy Spirit brings us into a relationship
   with God as sons. We have an heavenly Father. In the Old Testament, He
   is never revealed as a Father, and we as His little children. When
   Jesus comes, He makes a new relationship with the Father, and now we
   are to be born of the Spirit into a new family relationship. Israel
   never was born of the Spirit. The new man is birthed on Calvary.

   The new birth is birthing us into a new conscious contact with divine
   reality. It releases us from that old Adamic setup. We are launched
   into orbit; space; and how big is space? Don't try to answer! The Holy
   Spirit, Who brought this marvelous Truth, is the only One Who can
   reveal it, and interpret it.--With all the background I have had, I
   have to sit down, and become a child, and say, "Lord, You have to tell
   me . . ." I find in the Word a continuity, a way, or thought, or a
   scheme.--He is a wonderful God, but an heavenly Father. Jesus is a
   great Redeemer, but He says, "I am your Brother."

   When it comes to salvation, we have to start with the knowledge of the
   Truth; then faith reaches out its hands, and takes that Truth from its
   mental processes, and "with the HEART man believeth".
     __________________________________________________________________

                           Chapter 28 - New Creation

   We go home under the overshadowing of His wings, and when the pressures
   come, remember that the overshadowing is where He works His miracle. It
   is not in the open. How shall these things be of bringing forth the
   Christ Child? How shall these things be that a new creation be birthed
   in us unto its fullness? It will be birthed under the shadow of the
   Almighty. Shadows are rather dark, but if Jesus puts us in the shadows,
   say, "Lord, work a miracle".

   "In the beginning God." Now we don't know how many million years have
   gone by between that and the next verse in Genesis. We don't know. "In
   the beginning He created the heavens and the earth," but it "BECAME" a
   chaotic wreck through some cataclysm. "And the earth was (became)
   without form and void." (Gen. 1:2) We don't know what judgment ever
   came upon the earth to bring it to the chaos that God started with.

   God doesn't start, and make crazy things. They become crazy, ugly, and
   disturbed through sin. He never makes a thing imperfect. What He does
   is perfect. He made, in the beginning, a perfect world; marvelous;
   beautiful; and some cataclysm, which He is not pleased to tell us, took
   place. I never snoop to find out; I keep my nose out of business that
   He doesn't want to talk to me about. I don't tease God. If God wants me
   to know some things, He will tell me.

   The earth BECAME that chaotic mass; that great chasm; that terrifying
   chasm and darkness, through some judgment of God. Millions of ages
   passed, and there was an upheaval between the two forces of right and
   wrong; good and bad.

   The sea is always the consuming, rasping, restless thing that would
   consume, but the earth becomes victorious. God blesses the EARTH. He
   brings the EARTH out of that chaotic mass. When He brings forth
   creation, the Word says the "Holy Spirit moved upon the deep". The Holy
   Spirit "BROODED" (in Hebrew) over the deep. It is the same word that
   carries the thought of incubation, and brings life. This brooding is
   like to a hen setting on her eggs. The Holy Spirit "BROODED" over the
   deep, and God's creative Word brought forth the glorious creation that
   we have through the power of the Spirit. This Holy Spirit has been
   brooding over this universe long before we had the world. The eternal
   urge of the Spirit, the consuming urge of the Spirit, is the pulse of
   God.

   Even though God saves us, how many know He doesn't throw away the old
   nature. That's left intact, because He said, "Likewise reckon ye also
   yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus
   Christ our Lord." The fact that I am to reckon myself out of that old
   creation is evidence that it is still there. We don't have to live
   under its power. We have one personality, but we have two fields for
   its demonstration: (1) an old creation in which we can move if we want
   to; and (2) a brand new creation, and a new nature in which we may
   move. The old creation is still intact, but we have the victory of the
   Holy Spirit to keep identifying ourselves as a new creature in Christ
   Jesus, independent of the old creation. It's still there, however.

   As to my new creation, He says, "Walk in newness of life; reckon; count
   yourself dead unto the old nature, even though it's still there." How
   many ever heard of a Christian stepping back into the old creation? If
   it isn't there, what did he step into? We don't have to step there; we
   don't have to live there. We have a new creation. How many ever have
   some haunting memories of what lived in that old creation? Even in the
   new creation, however, we aren't born complete in all its perfection.
   We are born with all the glorious potential.

   We are creatures of an entirely different world. Don't fuddle with this
   old person. This new creature is only built under the dynamic of the
   power of the Spirit.

   Detach yourself from the thing you were, and attach yourself to the new
   creation.

   The "mixed multitude" which tagged along with the Israelites out of
   Egypt, and murmured in the wilderness, represents all the entanglements
   that impede our progress in the Spirit, and should be dropping off.

                            Chapter 29 - Overcoming

   An overcomer is one that comes over and not around the difficulty.

   I want the theory that disciplines me most thoroughly, and demands of
   me all that it possibly can; not one that makes it all so easy that
   there is no overcoming necessary in me; that does not minister anything
   to me.

   There is a time to resist evil; that makes us strong in faith. There is
   a time, though, when He says to resist not evil, because He has
   permitted it to teach us how to overcome.

   You say, "I want to be a real strong Christian for the Lord! I want to
   be all God would have me to be, I want to be an overcomer for Him in
   this world!" The Lord says, "That's good, I'll accept you as a
   candidate." Well then what happens? He is going to send you to the
   school of the Spirit. He sends us to the school for our training and
   education. He does all that for our welfare, for our education, for our
   well-being. Now we have to learn to overcome. Well then, do I have to
   overcome something big? No, you have to overcome something small. The
   Holy Spirit takes you in hand and through a process of discipline and
   training and education you are going to learn to overcome. If you can't
   get the victory over something mundane, you need not worry about being
   a great overcomer and knowing the things of God and a deep relationship
   with Him.

                             Chapter 30 - Personal

   I am spiritually minded; my feet are upon the earth, but my heart is in
   heaven. It is good to be in both realms, and to adjust yourself. That
   is really living.

   When I teach, I am teaching out of my heart; not out of a book. I teach
   out of my life. This gives me authority to preach and teach things I
   wouldn't otherwise. "Out of the abundance of my heart", I dare to say
   and do things that I wouldn't if I were teaching theory, or teaching
   something I read about in some one else's pattern.

   He has given me vision, illumination, and discernment in the Word. I
   can't tell you how I know Truth; I just know. The Holy Spirit in me
   knows. I can tell Truth the minute I hear it. It took me fifty years to
   dig it all out and organize it. I can only hope to get you intrigued
   and hungry so that you will venture in. All I hope to do is try to open
   the Word.

   Teachers are a gift of the Holy Spirit to the Church. I am a
   disciplined spirit; discipline is my middle name. The Lord had to put
   me through a lot of schooling. He had to let me go through a lot of
   things, so that now I know what I am talking about. I don't tell about
   the tragedies; that is nobody's business. You don't publish your
   sufferings; you mask them. That is scriptural: "You annoint your head."
   (Matt. 6:17, 18)

   The revelation of God and Truth is very delicate, and fleeting, and
   sensitive; I can discern it in a person, or a church, or anywhere.

   Truth that I give you is not mine; I've discovered it. I am not
   original in these things at all. I have had training--I don't use that;
   it's all right in its field--but Truth, you see, doesn't always come
   that way. Truth is a matter of spiritual revelation, and the process
   for becoming receptive for the Truth is very terrible. But I mustn't
   tell you that, because that is so negative! Truth is not mine in its
   originality. Truth has come to me in these many, long years by patient
   waiting upon God, and looking, observing, studying, praying,
   surrendering, dying. A thousand things are united to bring about the
   technique required for receiving the revelation. So what I have would
   be Truth which has become possessive in the sense of my own life being
   held under its power. Truth is never yours; never mine, until it is
   personalized in our hearts and lives.

   I want to help you. I have lived a little longer than some of you, and
   God has seen good to discipline me, and take me on into the realm of
   the Spirit, with revelation of light and help. Out of that field, I
   have made my discoveries, and I want to share them with people-- those
   who are open and desire help. So keep your heart open, and very likely
   God will drop in a portion of Truth.

   I remember the quotation of an old mystic: "The way to heaven is
   through hell." I believe it. How many are beginning to believe it too?
   Yes, it's true. God gives us the taste of it--not in all its
   fullness--the horror of it; the feeling of it, before we are released
   into the light. We have to go through the darkness in order to
   appreciate the light. The first reaction to Truth is negative--it will
   slay us. The second reaction is that it's the only thing God has to
   quicken us; we have to be slain before we're quickened.

   There is no Easter morning, with a resurrection, unless there has been
   a Friday of crucifixion. We all want the Easter morning, but we can't
   have our Easter morning in our hearts until we have the tragedy of a
   Friday. No one wants the ordeal, but that is God's order. I found that
   even though it was most penetrating, most disastrous, and I suffered
   tremendously through it, still I said, "Lord, I see that. It's so
   tremendous that I don't want it any other way."

   Can you see how this can be possible? It becomes possible for me,
   because I begin to sense the fruitage of it, and, though it means going
   through hell, what I am getting on this side is so tremendous, I'll go
   through two hells! I don't want to surrender the process, and get it by
   any other way--that's not legitimate.

   Heaven, to me, is to have that strange thing He has awakened in my
   heart, and has left wounded, tired, and sick, completed in Him.

   The power of the Word of God, and the cross of Jesus Christ have been
   the two instruments that have released me more than anything on God's
   earth. The revelation of that Word, and the ministry of the cross of
   Christ, canceling, slaying, but resurrecting into life, have been the
   most liberating agencies I can give as a testimony of anything that has
   touched me.

   Half the time, I don't live in time here. It's too terrible, but I do
   live in God; in His Word, which is the Truth. If it were not for the
   Truth to hold me, I wouldn't be here. That Truth has gripped my heart
   and life, and has unveiled the Christ to me; unveiled God to me, and
   helped me to see a little bit of who I am. I don't know yet who I am;
   maybe I'll find out in some other age. I find all these strange things
   in and about me that I don't know anything about. How many of us know
   who we are? How many think we know anything of the essence of what we
   are; or its light; or its illumination? Very little. We have contact
   with the Infinite in God through the Holy Spirit, but, as to finding
   out the essence of this new creature, we are just babes, just little
   babes coming along, and He wants us to grow.

   Aren't you glad for all these people, like Jacob and Peter, that lived
   before us? They got through, so now I can go through too. I am a
   normal, natural, human being, but I am a new creature and my emphasis
   is upon this new creation.

   The definition of the word "believe" is: "to adhere to; cleave to
   Truth; to have faith in an Absolute Person --reliance on the Lord Jesus
   Christ." He will bring us into a place where no one else can help us.

   In a crisis, one time, everybody was trying to tell me what to do, and
   not one ever helped me. I said, "Lord, why?" He said, "I didn't want
   them to. They never have the answer." I am glad sometimes God gets us
   into a place where nobody can counsel us; then we will get to God where
   we belong! The Word He gave me was in Song of Songs 2:3: "I sat down
   under His Shadow, (the apple tree) with great delight, and His fruit
   was sweet to my taste." He told me, "I AM your apple tree."

   I think sometimes the mason why I love Him is, because I am conscious
   of such a reduction of this thing called Follette. I am the most
   helpless creature who walks the earth; the most dependent creature;
   that is why I love Him so tremendously. It is because I have nothing to
   offer Him, but the desperate need in the depths of my being, and I
   expose it to Him like that. I have nothing to offer. I am silenced. I
   am learning how to lean.

   I am 80 years old now. When one comes up to this part, one can
   naturally see he doesn't have a terrific future, fifteen or twenty
   years ahead of him. I can remember when I used to look 5, 10, 15, 20
   years--even 50 years ahead of me, but when one gets to be 80 years old,
   he doesn't look 20 years ahead. That is past. That doesn't disturb me,
   because I am now more conscious of the things which are pushing ahead
   of me into my new age. That is why the things of time don't bother me
   as they do other people. I am not blaming you if you are disturbed over
   things of time; you are still related to time; you are thinking of your
   houses, lands, property, and work. When you have exhausted those
   things, and you feel your projection is moving into this other realm,
   you can't come back and be all fuddle duddled with this.

   I am living now more and more with the idea of projection in my
   praying. How many times I've said, "Lord, I'll never see here what I am
   praying about." Last year I was Very much in intercession and prayer.
   Sometimes I would stop and say, "Lord, this is terrific praying; I'll
   never live to see its fulfillment." He said, "You don't need to." The
   power of prayer penetrates, and pushes on ahead.

   I said, "How could I be praying for people and conditions that I will
   never see?" Do you know what He said to me? He said something sweet. He
   said, "You look into the 17th chapter of John." There you will find the
   Lord praying: "Oh Father, I pray not only for these (that's the
   immediate); I pray for those whom Thou wilt yet (that's in the future)
   give Me." And God said to me, "The Lord Jesus prayed for you two
   thousand years before you were born." Did you ever stop to think of
   that? Jesus prayed for you and me two thousand years before we were
   born. Then I Said, "You can pray, and intercede through me whatever You
   want, because I am only an instrument." Isn't it nice to be in touch
   with an infinite God like that!

   I keep living all the time in a projection. I am more concerned with
   it--its relation to what lies ahead --than with the immediate. That's
   why it will be wonderful to be released. I haven't a thing here that I
   would hang on to ten minutes; not at all. I am not morbid, but I sense
   things, and see through things. My! To be released!

   I have a freedom in God--I live detached; free from bondages. If He
   wants the house--fine! It was His to begin with. I'm detached. Paul
   said he not only counted the loss of all things, but suffered
   it.--First: Consent. Second: Actual experience.

   I am praying all the time; I sing to Him, and Pray to Him. Why? Because
   my heart has found that attitude while I am going about my work. "Pray
   without ceasing." (1 Thes. 5:17) Prayer is going on all the time in me.
   Then when I sit at my table, do I say, "Excuse me, Lord, I have to say
   grace now?" No, that is a religious habit. How many know I am saying
   grace by the hour!

   I don't stay on my knees just to be religious. When the spirit is on
   me, I pray; if not, I get up and go.

   I live all the time by faith, but I'm not conscious it is faith.

   I have a God who tells me an awful lot of good things, just lots of
   them, which I never read in a book.

   The Lord and I don't live in a push-button age--it won't work.

   I am a realist; there is nothing artificial about me.

   I live in the Spirit, but my feet are on the earth. I can tell beans
   from buttons, but at the same time I live with the Lord. I live in the
   world, but I am not of it. We are to learn to do that--we have to learn
   a detached life. I live here, but all the time my heart is quite
   detached.

   The Lord saw to it that I have a picture window looking into the
   mountains. He caters to our weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and to our
   temperaments. He knows I am a poet, and an artist, and I do all that
   business in the aesthetic, or philosophic world. There I am at home,
   but don't give me an automobile! I would be crazy with it, and
   mechanical things, and figures. There is something in the realm of art
   and philosophy, and the aesthetic realm that give me a second youth. I
   am eighty years old, and I feel as though I were thirty-five. It seems
   like a hundred years ago since I was a Hebrew and Greek student.

   I enjoy the trees and the mountains. I am in love with God's
   out-of-doors. The whole display of His creative mood in nature is like
   a holy sacrament. When we are still, the Holy Spirit gives us some
   interpretation, and intimation of its message.

   Those who know me can read between the lines, and sense the basic Truth
   in all my songs and poetry that God gives me, about life, joy, sorrow,
   hopes, tragedy, pain, and ecstasy--all make my material.

   My poems have plenty of gospel; only served in a little different form.

   The poetic urge is heavy in me. I didn't make it; I discovered it.

   I can feel with a brokenhearted mother; God has made me that way--I can
   feel with an aged person, or a retarded one. I suffer with them; I feel
   it all through me.

   To me, heaven is a consummation, a sublimation, and a satisfaction of
   this eternal, terrific urge in my heart for the love of God eternal.
   And you can have all your heaven and harps etc. . . . . that's good,
   but that will never satisfy me.

   There is something in my heart that is broken, and it will be satisfied
   only in Him. When I touch that; that's it. He has wounded my heart, and
   has broken it. There is just no mending, so let it be. He is the
   Answer, and He has purposely wounded some of us. If He has taken the
   time to wound your heart, even though it is a distressing thing, love
   Him anyway, because the Sequel to that will be revealed in heaven.

   I've nothing in which I am original. I have discovered Truth. I have
   found it, and have dedicated my life to it. I asked God to make me one
   who is receptive. I discover the Truth; it isn't mine. I don't sit down
   and make up Truth. When I discover it, then I ask God to give me the
   power of transmitting it, releasing it, and giving it out. Then there
   must be receptivity. The teaching ministry is unique, and different
   from any other. The Holy Spirit will witness to Truth in us whenever we
   find it. Build a shelf in your heart for Truth you cannot at present
   fit into things; don't discard it; in time you will need it.

   I have made fresh, little discoveries of Truth; discoveries of how God
   does things; discoveries of how a human being will act, and react when
   God does this, and when He does that, and by and by I find out how God
   works.

                              Chapter 31 - Prayer

   Touch Him when you don't know how to read the Bible, but touch the
   Word--touch Him; know His will; know God; know His purpose. Keep up a
   wonderful fellowship with the Son of God.

   You can read a lot of books on prayer, some of which are quite
   materialistic, but no one has a form of prayer which is adequate for
   you. Every soul has to develop, and work out his own technique and
   method of prayer. Don't try to work it out by somebody else's
   method--it is good only for suggestions. We learn to pray by
   praying.--We can't change God by prayer. Prayer never made God do
   anything. Prayer helps us become more adjusted to His will.

   Look at Jesus; talk to Him; if you dare to, be informal with Him. Don't
   be stilted and pray, "Oh, Thou, My God!" You can't get very far that
   way. How many know He is very real; very tender. Do you know that the
   best prayers you ever prayed never had words in them? They are so
   clumsy; they don't have words, because there is an understanding there;
   a deep, lovely, rich, inner fellowship that needs no words.

   We don't know prayer: the vocal prayers, and prayers of contemplation,
   all the different types of prayers. It is such a vast field! We just go
   clattering along, saying the best we can . . . "for Jesus' sake, Amen!"
   To me it's such a lovely, open field we ought to get into.

   He loves His children, but some don't know who they are, or what He is
   doing; they .don't seem to know the basic, simple things that He is
   doing. These people know that prayer does things, so they use that as a
   weapon for everything under the sun, but there are a lot of things that
   just prayer won't do. It means a terrific lot of intelligent
   cooperation with Him. We can pray our heads off, but if we don't have
   the prayers channeled properly, with correct motivation, prayers are
   just like a lot of wings.

   What prayers are answered? Prayers that fall into the category of the
   will of God. We can pray all we want to, but John says, "When we pray
   according to the will of God He heareth us."

   Now there is this: if we will persist, God has a permissive will which
   He will allow. If we keep teasing, and teasing, there is a permissive
   will of God which He will let us have if we persist, but He will send
   leanness to our souls. We have no growth; no blessing; no reward, but
   we will have our desire, and as a result, we will have leanness in our
   souls. So, we have the will of God; the permissive will of God; the
   good will of God; the good and perfect will of God. These are all
   degrees of the will of God in this operation. The best thing to do is
   to submit it to Him. (Rom. 12:2)

   In the end, all that great big prayer has to be censored in the will of
   God. The Holy Spirit prays according to His will.

   Jesus said, "Peter, Satan hath desired to sift you . . ." This should
   actually read: "Satan hath obtained permission of God to sift you--all
   of you, but I'll stay over here and pray for you:"--Don't pray now, and
   ask the Lord to kill the devil. He is going to use him. On the power of
   Jesus' prayer, Peter got through.

   Prayer is never wrestling with God, but wrestling with the powers of
   darkness. The "unjust judge" is not a picture of God. Our heavenly
   Father wants to answer us; His whole heart wants to bless us. He is not
   the "unjust judge". (Luke 18:1-8)

   Another prayer pattern we find, is the man asking for bread at
   midnight. (Luke 11:5-10) Sometimes we have to ask many times before the
   answer comes, but we must ask in faith. Hungry? He doesn't tease us; He
   feeds us.

   Jesus prayed because He had to, to keep that contact with the Father.

   "I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which Thou
   hast given Me; for they are Thine." (John 17:9) I said, "Why Lord, your
   great intercessory work is not for all those sinners out there!" He
   said, "No, for this reason. The sinner must come under the power of My
   redemption before he is a fit subject for My intercessions. My
   intercession covers those who have already been brought through the
   redeeming processes. Those who have not yet accepted My redemption,
   have no access to My prayer, but as soon as they have come through My
   redeeming processes, they become a subject of My intercessions."

   That is why He said those strange words: "I pray not for the world--I
   have died for them--and if they can't come in under My death, what do
   My prayers mean for them? I can't do more than die! If they will come
   under My death purposes, then they will become subject to My prayers.
   So, I pray not for them--let them take the good of My death; then they
   will be accepted for My prayers, and I will intercede for them."

   Think of Jesus interceding for us this morning before we got out of our
   beds! That is how I wrote that hymn: "My High Priest is Interceding for
   Me." He said to me, "You have faith that I am your Savior, so if you
   have faith in Me as your High Priest, My intercessory prayer will carry
   you."

   There is no prayer just like intercessory prayer. It is not saying
   prayers; nor is it just weeping, but He says, "With groanings that we
   can't utter." It is past words. Why? Because the Holy Ghost makes
   intercession in us, and through us according to the will of God, and we
   can't make Him do anything else than that. We are yielded as an
   instrument; the Holy Ghost is praying--we aren't praying. He has a
   vehicle that is pliable, surrendered, and He comes in and takes
   possession of us. Isn't it sweet how He dares to do that? Very costly,
   and terrifying at times, but it's real. How is this intercessory prayer
   formed? It is formed according to the will of God, "with groanings
   which cannot be uttered"; it cannot be expressed in our language; not
   even with tongues, because it becomes too intense. For whom is this
   intercession made? It is made for the saints.

   Did you ever have the Holy Spirit moving through you? What did He say?
   I haven't the slightest idea. He speaks secrets to the Lord. That's
   scriptural. I don't have to have an interpretation of what the Holy
   Ghost is saying to God through me. We don't have to have an
   interpretation every time He speaks through us. It is unto the Lord.

   PRAYER: In the next age Thou wilt give us a name; help us to spell it
   now, Lord. Oh, grant that, by Thy Spirit, Thou shalt find it etched
   upon our immortal spirits, long after these fading, little bodies have
   gone, and we move into a new age with Thee; for what Thou has
   accomplished here, will reflect through the ages to come.

   Did you ever try to put yourself in somebody else's place to get his
   reactions? You haven't lived long in God unless you can dare to do
   that. Most people are too egocentric; tied within the confines of their
   own little life, and it's impossible for them to sense how another
   person might feel, because they are wrapped up in the big I, ME, and
   MY.

   If they would get out of themselves and over in the other person's
   situation, and feel what they feel for a little while, there would be
   some charity released; some love would flow. But when people haven't
   any sense when the love should flow; there is none. When we become
   identified with that awful, desperate need over there, the love of God
   flows right to it. In Hebrews 13:3, it says: "When ye pray, (real
   prayer), pray as though you were bound with the one you are praying
   for." But we pray nice' prayers!

   Did you ever get into the agony of prayer when you were identified with
   another's need? That is intercessory prayer. We, in the Spirit, become
   identified with a need until we are united with it, or with a soul, or
   with a condition. No one in the flesh can pray a prayer like that. This
   is where intercessory prayer comes in. The Holy Spirit can pray prayers
   like that, because we can't. He wants the vehicle; He wants the
   instrument tied up with the condition. That is real intercessory
   prayer.

   There are all kinds of prayer. The best prayers never have words.
     __________________________________________________________________

                          Chapter 32 - Realm of Spirit

   The most real thing in the world is a life in the Spirit; most
   detaching, because our spirit is released. Keep that spirit open, as a
   sensitized plate that's exposed continually to God. Then that
   application of God, flowing and moving over us continually, does
   something to this plate. It has the power to capture, to hold, and to
   retain after it has been moving. Finally, we will find a deposit
   there--not tomorrow, or the next day. We may not find some of the
   reaction of these movings of God for six months, or a year, but this
   has been a time of His visitation. He desires the flow of that Spirit
   continually over us to bring the deposit of God-likeness: of Spirit and
   Reality in our inner consciousness of life. I believe He will do this
   so that we won't be the same any more.

   People are utterly starved to death. For what? Food; not milk, but for
   some meat, and some strong meat. They need it; they need it badly. God
   can't take a Body that is just a whimpering baby to sit on the throne
   with Him and share--He can't do things like that. There will be a place
   for babes; I imagine heaven will have a tremendously large nursery!

   Many have never come into an inner consciousness of a birth; it is a
   potential matter with them. We are birthed into a vast realm. When we
   say "kingdom", then right away we are thinking of horses, bugles, and
   banners, but it is a vast field; a realm. When He was talking about
   coming into the kingdom, He was not talking about heaven. He called the
   kingdom a vast realm.

   Now by the power of the Spirit, He will gradually bring us into an
   inner consciousness of that realm; maybe not the first day, nor the
   first year. I have had to deal with souls who have been filled with the
   Spirit ten, twenty years, who have not yet come into the consciousness
   of that! Now what is in this realm? All spiritual reality.

   In the natural, there are laws which He has established for our
   well-being in order that we can live a comfortable life. It would be a
   great aid to us if we would discover the laws in the realm of Spirit,
   and come under the power of the laws which God has placed there.

   He doesn't want us so super doodle in the Spirit that we can't know
   beans from buttons. He wants us perfectly practical, and able to
   discern that, and yet all the time saying, "That is not my realm; that
   natural realm is not my realm. Here is my realm; I live with Him in
   spirit." Now in this spiritual realm I have been making discoveries of
   troths, principles, laws, methods, and facts which are just as real as
   those in the natural realm, but they are abstract, and spiritual.
   Therefore, most people never bother with them at all.

   Of course, if you want to live on that natural plane, live on it; go to
   heaven, and play on a harp. But you will never yet find the thing that
   God intended us to have in the Spirit. In that spiritual realm I make
   discoveries; I find how God works; I watch Him work here; watch Him
   work there, and then as I go around in the Word, I twig it. I am like a
   hound dog in the Word. Sometimes I am in it a year, sometimes two,
   chasing that Truth down; and so I make my discoveries.

   He didn't bring in the kingdom then, but He introduced a brand new
   order--not an earthly kingdom, but a life in the Spirit.

   In Luke 24:13-35, we read of Emmaus; the house by the side of the road.
   This little cottage is our inner chamber, the inner recesses of this
   strange creature that you and I are. On the dusty road of escapism He
   expounded to the two disciples the Truth, but though their hearts
   burned within them; their eyes were not yet opened as to Who He really
   was. They had not yet come into the proper place for the unveiling. He
   was waiting to bring the revelation to its consummation, but He
   couldn't do it on the dusty road while they were reasoning in their
   agitated hearts--not even in the presence of the exposition of Truth
   which made their hearts burn. But when they constrained Him to come
   into the inner recesses of their being--their whole soul and being--He
   went in. The door was closed to every external contact with which they
   had thus far been familiar.

   The breaking of bread was an old custom; it was a covenant that one
   entered into for fellowship.--Our life is a loaf of bread. He takes the
   bread, worships, breaks it, and gives it back to us. His hands have
   received it; His hands have touched it, and we will never live the same
   again. He is made known to us as to the two disciples in the breaking
   of our hearts and lives; He is unveiled to us through that.--We heard
   Him; we saw Him; we had an inner vision of Him, but now we KNOW Him.

   We learn the laws of living in the realm of spiritual reality, by
   living.

   Education is good, but I want it to be where it belongs. It is the
   mechanism, the mechanics, the world of flesh and time. It does not
   belong in the realm of Spirit. Therefore, the things of the Spirit of
   God are not known, nor understood by these mechanics. They cannot be;
   they are diametrically opposed.
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Chapter 33 - Redemption

   Paul, with regard to his body, spoke of its majesty as a "temple of
   God", a sacred, wonderful thing. Paul gave it the elevation it needed.
   "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" He will dwell in it, and
   there will be temple worship. He will dwell in us; He will sing in us;
   He will have real temple worship, because we are a temple of the Holy
   Ghost. God let me see that picture to show me the dignity of the body
   as a temple.

   Now look at another picture. Peter talked about the body as "a little
   collapsible tent" in which we live. Note the contrast between the two:
   the majesty in one; the frailty in the other. In Scripture our bodies
   are called "tabernacles," but in Greek the word means "a little
   collapsible tent". It is a limited thing. But, if this little
   collapsible tent falls down and perishes, that is not the end! We have
   a dwelling place with God in the heavenlies, for we shall always have a
   habitat.

   Now remember, in the scheme of redemption, redemption will cover all
   these features: spirit, soul, body. How do we know the body is
   included? In the redemptive scheme of God, even our bodies which are
   laid to rest upon Old Mother Earth are included, and she opens her arms
   and puts us to sleep in them. I am never afraid of the grave--never
   think of it. I shall be happy to go back to my Old Mother Earth. I like
   my Mother Earth. She has given me what I have. Everything I have of
   this physical has come out of the earth. So I wrote a little poem about
   it and I call it:

  "Recompense"


   Give me of thyself, O gentle earth,

   Food for my body while I live.

   We have much in common, you and I,

   You kept me living since my birth.

   Some day in return to you I'll give

   Dust of my body--when I die.

   I offer back to Mother Earth this instrument that she has built for me,
   and I say, "I am all through with it, Mother Earth, I give it back to
   thee,"--recompense. I always feel as if Mother Earth opens her arms and
   puts me to sleep against her breast. Grave? Oh, no, don't say that!
   Will redemption come? Yes, He will even bring bodies that have been
   laid away under the redemptive work of Christ, and we will have a
   resurrection. So you see the redemption of Christ comes even after the
   body is disposed of. The body too shall have the power of redemption,
   and it shall be changed and glorified. This is the work of the Holy
   Spirit.

   God slew an animal. In Genesis 3:21 we read: ". . . the Lord God made
   coats of skins, and clothed them." The skin is inclusive; everything in
   us is inside the skin. Biologically, skin holds all that there is of
   us. He showed me that it was an inclusive redemption. The skin includes
   the whole redemption process. All that there was of the animal was
   hidden away in the skin. He says, "I'll give the skin, the all-over,
   the whole inclusive covering of the redemption of Christ", and He
   covers them.

   You can't exhaust the triumph and the victory of the Calvary
   experience; the redemption of His universe and the putting it back in
   order. You can push out the redemption as far as you want to; it
   covers.

   Redemption brings us into great privileges. It brings us into the
   intercessions of Christ, and into the image of Christ, which is His
   supreme objective.

   To me redemption is for Him to revolutionize us; overhaul us; revive
   and possess us, so that in every field He will have the dominion, and
   the right, and the way.

Chapter 34 - Resurrection

   The resurrection of Jesus was God's seal and act of approval signifying
   that His death was sufficient. Jesus never resurrected Himself--God
   raised Him from the dead. God the Father was pleased, and satisfied
   with His victorious life and death. In raising Him from the dead, God
   gave testimony that all was satisfactory.

   In I Corinthians 15, Paul, in speaking of the resurrection, says, "I
   will show you a mystery." He didn't say, "I will define it, or explain
   it." As there are so many different glories of stars, SO is the
   resurrection of the dead! Everyone will be raised according to his own
   rank and glory. There is classification and order.

   Concerning resurrection, we read in Hebrews 11:35b: ". . . others were
   tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better
   resurrection." Those who have suffered correctly are waiting for a
   better resurrection.

   In Acts 1:8, the Lord is not using the word "witness" about someone who
   gets up and gives a testimony; He is saying that a person coming up
   from the power of the Spirit, is willing to let his life be slain in
   order that the life of the Christ may be lived through him. He becomes
   a witness, a testimony of the power of God. That is when the individual
   life becomes a witness; a testimony. The word "witness" here means
   "martyr"; one who is willing to let his very life go for the sake of
   the Truth.

   The power of His resurrection possessed the disciples, and the power of
   the resurrection is always a witnessing power. The resurrection was a
   witness. The power that God used in raising Jesus from the dead was
   resurrection power unto a witness. When does He say, "I will pour the
   Holy Spirit upon you"? After the resurrection, for now there is
   resurrection quality in the power that is to come upon them. They are
   now ministering in resurrection power. The LIFE is the witness.

   The bread and wine sacrament is a type of regeneration and
   resurrection. These emblems decompose, ferment, speaking of death. Then
   comes a higher form of life both in the bread and wine. The process is
   the same in both. In the bread we have the yeast, the leaven, which
   speaks of sin. This is no longer active as it decomposes, and is
   changed. In the wine there is also fermentation--death. It has no
   longer form as before.

   On the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested
   on Ararat. This is the anniversary of the resurrection!

                               Chapter 35 - Satan

   When the devil looked at Calvary, he saw his Waterloo--his defeat.
   That's what is the matter with him. The devil is conscious of his
   defeat. That is why, in the closing of this dispensation, the wroth of
   the enemy is being felt all the time in more intense form, because he
   sees the net drawing in. In the end, he will become fairly frantic. He
   will possess, and move through every instrument he can find, in
   politics, in society, in art and music, in every form that he can get
   in. In the last days he is going to be captured in his own net. He sees
   his utter defeat at Calvary.

   A demon is as evasive and subtle as a snake.

   I never reason with the devil. He is unreasonable.

   The devil is a servant, after all, and God uses him when He wants to.
   With Paul, He let a demon loose, "a messenger of Satan to buffet him."

                           Chapter 36 - Second Coming

   In regard to the Second Coming, the believer does not need the external
   signs such as the Jew returning to Israel. Those are for the ones who
   need to be aroused by great signs--but the believer is looking for
   these spiritual signs:

   1. When the cup of iniquity is full. (That's the negative sign.)

   2. When the Bride has made herself ready. (That's the positive sign.)

   "Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man
   take thy crown." (Rev. 3:11) "I come quickly" --not in the sense of
   time, but in the manner--like a flash; "That no man take thy crown"--in
   the sense of a bird snatching the seed (Truth) as in the parable of the
   sower; (Mark 4:4) "Hold fast the Truth--keep and guard My Word and
   message; hold; grasp the deposit of Truth, for it relates to a crown
   ("That no man take thy crown").

                       Chapter 37 - Spiritual Development

   I keep warning young people, and I often say to them, "Listen, this is
   the only time you will have to make certain decisions, surrenders, and
   choices in your life. These decisions and choices that you make now
   govern marvelously things which will happen thousands of years in the
   next age. This is the period in which you make the choice; not the
   period in which it is going to be exhausted. After you are released,
   and you are on the other side, you can't come back here, and make the
   choices you should make now. This is the period in which He plows the
   heart, which is like a Plot of ground, with the Word, which is the
   Eternal Truth."

   The plowshare is the Eternal Truth that tears my inner heart and life;
   and exposes it to the sun and air. Truth plows us; we have to be plowed
   before He can even sow the seed. He plows; then He sows the seed. He
   only gives it a little while to root, and push through, enough to give
   identification. It pushes up through the soil of my whole life, and
   shows what it is. I will have the eternal ages for it to mature; to
   grow; to glorify God, and to live.

   Life is projected upon planes. We are on a journey back home to the
   heart of God where we belong. We don't belong here. We are only here
   for a period of training and culture; a little period of spiritual
   exercise to bring adjustment in spiritual living, which may be
   projected upon another plane in ages yet to come.

   This little period we call time is just a little probation time in
   which we are able to make the elementary and fundamental adjustments of
   spiritual living. That is all we can hope to do here. There is not too
   much maturity. The real, vital thing He is after, is a spiritual
   adjustment to reality; a spiritual conception of Truth and God. It
   takes some years to reach His objective. Don't expect it in a minute.
   There will be something of the life of Christ in us that can adapt
   itself to another age.

   Why not learn the voice of God; we have to live with it the rest of our
   lives. Why not take a little time to be keen enough to detect His
   leadings, and know the whispers of the Spirit; know the intimation of
   the Spirit in our inner being. It need not be in words--just that
   strange, mystical, impact of Spirit in us that knows. We are to develop
   that. Take time to learn how to do that, because that is living, and
   that is living in the Spirit. We can't get it in a minute. There are no
   short-cuts, and there are no gadgets with buttons we can press so that
   out pops the answer. This miserable way we have today: press a button,
   and that comes on, and press a button, and on and on . . . What a way
   to live! No originality in it; no loveliness of your own life coming
   through. It is a mechanical sort of riggamaroo, I don't like it.

   We take that sort of a thing right into the Spirit, and we think that
   we are going to get things from God that way, and that we are going to
   overcome that way, and we begin to live in the Spirit that way, but we
   can't. We just can't.

   The life in the Spirit holds a lot of drudgery. But if we become keen
   enough to detect His leadings, then when tragedy comes we have the
   consciousness of this inner life; the Presence of the Lord; the voice
   of God; the courage of the Spirit. Take time out to learn these
   elementary things consisting of the power of the Word, and Truth,
   because that is what we have to live by as we move on.

   I want you to have the Truth, and when God begins to deal with you and
   me to accomplish in us these lovely things which will pass through time
   into the ages yet to come, let us not be fearful, let us not be afraid.
   We are in the hands of the living God, and He will see us through. "He
   Who hath begun a good work in you will also finish it." Let Him finish
   it!

   Just as soon as the ground is fairly settled, and in any way
   comfortable, He will put His Truth in there and plow it all up again.
   He doesn't want it settled and static.

   "And when His disciples, James and John, saw this (that they would not
   receive Him) they said, Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come
   down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he turned,
   and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are
   of." (Luke 9:54, 55) The difficulty with the disciples was not in love,
   or in power, but in spirit. The territory that yet has to be discovered
   in my heart sometimes amazes me! Did you ever feel that there is
   territory in you that has to be taken yet; possessed by Him? Sure,
   there are territories in my being that I have not become conscious of,
   but God knows, and I know that He has to triumph in those fields. He
   has to go in and make conquest in the territories of this creature.

   I accept the discipline, and trying things He tosses into my pattern.
   They are so necessary. They are not punishment for failure, or sin, but
   the only means He has of developing us.--Never let the devil get you
   down when God is working in and for you.

   Jesus grew, and He learned through a law of suffering. We can grow just
   as much as we want to, and we can learn just as much as we want to. It
   takes a lifetime. (Heb. 5:8; 2:10) This is my little schoolroom down
   here, called "time"--a little segment of the eternal circle. This is my
   period of discovery, education, training, etc. We don't have to do a
   lot of research work; get a little from this or that; we remain with
   Him Who IS THE TRUTH. There are vast fields of Truth yet to be ventured
   upon. We must go in. My emphasis is on learning how to live.

   He launches us into a new realm of spiritual reality, called "kingdom."
   Jesus uses the word "realm" instead of "kingdom." I like that better--a
   vast realm. We have all the eternal ages into which this light and
   Truth can be projected.

   When the Holy Spirit begins to work with you, offer to Him, with all
   the abandonment that you have, that little "attrae",--that aptitude;
   that urge; just that little flickering hunger for more of
   God--cultivate that. That is, to me, the choicest thing there is in us.
   Why? Because it is the root of all the possibilities in the ages to
   come. They are hidden potentially in that little, quivering urge in
   your heart. That's true. All that we will carry over into the next
   realm is the amount of spiritual life; understanding; spiritual
   opening; yieldedness; awareness; the amount of that spiritual life that
   we have; that's what we carry over into the next age. God begins to
   work with us from that angle. When we are translated, or brought into
   heaven, we are not matured. He takes us exactly where we are now in our
   spiritual development. If we are a babe in Christ, translation never
   makes us into a matured saint; neither does death, because God has a
   law that governs in that field, just as much as in the field of
   gravitation. That's scriptural.

   This little hunger that is in our heart--this little urge--has to be
   trained, and educated. The fact that we are brought into heaven doesn't
   mature us. We have all the eternal ages in which we may grow in God.
   Why? Because He is Infinite. Do you think we are going to get to the
   end of Infinity? We can't exhaust it; neither can we exhaust the
   revelation of light and Truth that shines in God--the Ancient of Days.
   This is the little conception we have of Him here in time, but what
   will be the conception when we move out of time?

   When Jesus takes us home, all we will take with us is what we have
   acquired here of spiritual value. This is a little time of schooling.
   Don't become too satisfied with the seat that you are holding in school
   while you are being taught; (your automobile, your house, how many
   dollars, a name, a reputation); it all goes to the wind like that! He
   doesn't consider it. That has been the mechanics which operated in your
   heart and life while you, as a dynamic spirit; a conscious entity; born
   of God; filled with Him; illuminated by Him, are pushing your way
   through; pushing your way through to where? Home, back to God; this
   should be your attitude.

                          Chapter 38 - Spiritual Food

   ". . . Lord, feed me with food convenient for me." (Prov. 30:8b) People
   are choicy, they want the things they want. They may not need a thrill;
   they may need a pill! A child can't diagnose his need; the wise parent
   has to feed him. ". . . Lord feed me with food convenient, (or even
   better) food which is my allotment, or my portion." When we pray that,
   we take our hands off the table, and put them under it! (I am very
   polite; my hands are under the table!) Sometimes He gives us a portion
   we don't like, but it will do us good. Cultivate your appetite.

   The children of Israel, in the wilderness, "gathered Manna, every man
   according to his eating"--his capacity. (Ex. 16:18) How much have you
   gathered this day; enough to slake your hunger? There is enough for the
   thimble capacity, and the dishpan capacity. It is readily available;
   close at hand; at your tent door. Some of you are looking for Manna
   without a night.

   It comes to my "dust" (my humanity).
     __________________________________________________________________

                          Chapter 39 - Spiritual Laws

   I want to help you so that when trouble comes, or when you have
   difficulties, you will not cast away your faith, but be able to have it
   stabilized in God, and take of the grace of God, which He has freely
   given, and does give to tide us along. I want you to have some of these
   basic Truths in your hearts and minds, and be able to apply, what I
   call Christian philosophy, to your daily walk.

   If we can do that, we get through. But if we are ignorant of the ways
   of life, and the laws and principles which God has given us, our lives
   become sometimes quite tragic. This need not be. Even though tragedy
   may come as a means of discipline to us, He gives us power and grace to
   interpret it, so that it doesn't leave a scar and mar our spirits. We
   receive it; get our discipline out of it, and what God wants; then lay
   it aside as some accommodation which He gave. "That was a tragedy that
   soured my life;" we say, "and I'll never be the same." Don't do that.
   That is a very strange and wrong reaction. MEET IT!

   As a child of God, I have come back to my Paradise place, where God is
   responsible for my wherewithal. God was responsible when He made Adam,
   but Adam, as a creature, didn't like God's way of managing. Now he is
   dead spiritually, and by the sweat of his brow, he has to get out under
   the burden of living--see if you can "pay your taxes . . ."

   God cursed the EARTH. What good would it have done to curse a dead man?
   The earth now resists man. So many of us that have come back to God--to
   our original place--having been lighted; (for "he has lighted my
   candle" Psa. 18:28) have been able to sense that He is all we need.

   As a real child of God, we have come back again to the first place, and
   position in Him where God provides. Paul says so;--even if it is just
   clothes and fish, God will provide. He likes to because we are His
   children. I think He likes to do it, but He is also obligated to! Why?
   Because we have met a law of spiritual adjustment, in the realm of the
   Spirit. it was about the very first thing Jesus taught the disciples:
   "If you seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, all these
   things shall be added unto you." (Matt. 6:33)

   A life is not safe in itself unless it is surrendered to God. Neither
   are the things which He permits or brings to us, unless they first go
   through His hands. That is why He calls us so many times to surrender
   certain things to Him, and we have a terrific time, as we say, dying
   our death and surrendering the things to God. That is necessary, but it
   isn't because He wants them. They can't enrich Him; they can't make Him
   more God because of it. The enrichment comes back as a reflex in us,
   because we have surrendered them. That which is most choice must be
   surrendered to Him to its death so that it can come back again safe and
   sound in its resurrection--in time, when we are ready. He only wants
   them in His hands: the cleansing medium. We bring the quivering
   sacrifice which is torn from our hearts, and we think we will die
   because of it, and we put it with trembling hands into the hands of
   God. He says, "Thank you." Now that kiss of God upon the sacrifice
   takes the danger element out of it, and when He gives it back it is
   safe. Sometimes, though, He keeps it.

   So if He sees it is wholesome for us to have it, He cancels the danger
   point by bringing us to a place of surrender where we can allow it to
   go to its death. Then He says, "Thank you, I don't want it, really, you
   can have it." Unless it goes through His hands first, it is still a
   dangerous element for us to have. Paul, in order to actually maintain
   what God desired in his pattern, had to SUFFER the loss to make it
   good. "If there be first a "willing spirit" over a situation, IT (that
   willing spirit) is accepted as though the whole deed were done. To one
   He says, "You are not safe with it; it is not good for you; you give
   that to Me." To another He says, "I can trust you with it. I have not
   come to rob; I have come to give LIFE--and that more abundantly."

   Too many interests are detrimental to real spiritual life.

   All ministry, whether we are preaching or teaching, or whatever our
   vocation, which is in the will of God, is purely reactionary. It is not
   to get something done; it is to get something done in you, and in me
   through the media of our immediate task. God is after you, and after me
   first. He lets us ride along quite a long time, and then: woe to the
   flesh; woe to the old creation; woe to this old ego. But I tell you
   something, there will be life, life, life, but it has to come through
   that process. Through the ministries and service which is given to us,
   we are changed, released, and conformed to the image of Christ.

   To the disciples, who were under a tradition of a King, quarreling
   about reigning and ruling over this city and that city, He Would say,
   "Don't be too sure about that. Have you exhausted the study of a
   Paschal Lamb? Do you know all that pertains to the Lamb before you get
   so intrigued about reigning and ruling?"

   That Kingship will come, but we surely have to know a Lamb before we
   know a King--a Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world. How
   liberating that is; how broad; what a universal thing!

   "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world." Some
   day it will be: "Behold the Bridegroom cometh." You will never have a
   Bridegroom without a Lamb.

   Life only comes through death. That is a spiritual law. Character takes
   time to build, under a law of testing and proving.

   God works with indirect methods; not from frontal attacks. In Paul's
   time, as now, the world was just as rotten everywhere. We don't find
   him making a direct attack on one of those existing conditions. It has
   to come indirectly through the life of the individual. "Overcome evil
   by good"--and good is the life manifested continually in such an
   individual, overpowering the other. But you can't legislate it. It is
   slow, but it is His way.

   Peter and all the rest of the disciples were fishing all night in
   disobedience after Jesus' crucifixion. Jesus knew every nail in the
   boat, and every scale on the fish. Jesus saith unto them, "Children,
   have ye any meat?" (John 21:5) He wasn't asking for information at all
   Why was He asking? Here we have a little principle: a question asked,
   provokes an answer. The answer becomes the platform upon which the
   blessing is released.

   "Have ye any fish?"

   "No."

   "No" is one of the most difficult words to pronounce in the English
   language!

   The two disciples on the Road to Emmaus had sold out everything. They
   had followed Him, but didn't get Him on the throne. They loved the
   Lord, but they loved their own lives too. They were afraid of losing
   their investment, and so, when He spoke of death, Calvary: "I must
   go"--they didn't want that. They wanted a kingdom. But He died! He was
   not going to make a kingdom. The kingdom had become a fixation in them.
   The resurrection was the most profound thing that had happened. Do you
   think that moved them? No, not at all. The very last question those
   disciples ever asked the Lord, after the tragedy of Calvary, and the
   miracle of the resurrection, was: "When wilt Thou restore the kingdom?"
   Even that marvelous resurrection did not budge the fixation. It still
   held until the very hour He was taken up. They still "grab at His
   garments and ask, "Will we now have a kingdom?"

   I think those are the most tragic words in the New Testament as far as
   the disciples are concerned. What a picture of their attitude of heart!
   He has a marvelous Substitute, (the Holy Spirit), but if we are not
   willing to wait for the revelation of a Substitute, we move out under a
   poor premise, and collapse. Peter went back, (they all did), to the
   nets. Misery loves company. One disciple could not bear it alone. When
   we fail in the Spirit, we always react in the natural. If we can't move
   in the power of the Spirit, in faith, we will revert to the natural--it
   is a law.

   The law for building the temple-- the building which we are--is testing
   and proving. He has no other way. It is an established law by which we
   grow. Salvation is a gift; the baptism of the Spirit is purely on the
   gift level; healing is on a gift level; all those lovely, elementary
   things, the first principles which are presented to us at the base of
   our mountain climb, all those are purely on the basis of gifts. But we
   cannot remain there, and be on the mountain. Paul says, "Leaving
   behind; forgetting; dropping these elementary' first principles, (not
   in the sense of value, but in their position). Don't forsake them;
   don't belittle them; don't throw them out the window; let them be
   exactly where they are, but "Let us go on to completion." (Heb. 6:1)
   How will we get there? A law works right away. We will never get away
   from it; we might just as well own and accept it. If you have to
   quarrel, go to the Lord with your quarrel, and say, "Lord, You could
   have made it easier."--A stone has to be chiseled and hammered before
   it can be put in the building. (Eph. 2:19, 20, 22)

   A spiritual need cannot be satisfied by a natural application, as was
   the case with Adam and Eve making aprons. Man has a material outlook
   today, extremely too much so; so that he has very little appreciation
   or understanding, not only of spiritual things pertaining to God, but
   of spiritual Values in the world. We know there are spiritual values in
   the world, as well as spiritual values in God. We fall back upon nature
   to supply a spiritual need. Wherever there is a spiritual need, nature
   always comes in, though broken down, trying to remedy it. "That which
   is spiritual is not first, but natural, afterward that which is
   spiritual." (I Cor. 15:46) Man (the flesh) has to have a fling at the
   natural first, as shown in the disciples first counting the bread and
   fish, and in Adam bringing out a natural display of fig leaves. First
   the natural, fig leaves, then the spiritual, a lamb.

   Don't be afraid of your limitations (five loaves, two fishes). Let God
   get hold of them; put your limitations in the hands of the Miracle
   Worker. Five thousand are fed and blessed!

                             Chapter 40 - Suffering

   Suffering brings us into the fellowship of the Trinity:

   1. Father--Disciplines us as sons, and we recognize Him as our heavenly
   Father. Discipline entails or spells suffering, which is necessary and
   needed; otherwise we are bastards.

   2. Son--Jesus, as Son of Man, learned obedience by the things He
   suffered. So will we as He conforms us to his image. Again, this
   entails suffering.

   3. Holy Spirit--We will suffer in our spirit. Jesus suffered in His
   spirit. The physical suffering really is nothing compared to what the
   spirit suffers.

   He is a suffering God--a God of love, but a suffering God. So we, as
   cells in that Body, partake of the same. There are hidden treasures in
   Christ; He is a wonderful Redeemer, but He is a suffering Redeemer. The
   Body is being formed and shaped, and we are the cells, and members.
   This Body will have to partake of the same characteristics that we find
   in our wonderful Lord.

   Paul said, "I die daily." Paul knew something of the program of God.

   There is no getting into God without suffering. In school, there is no
   education without studying. Without discipline, there is no getting
   into God. Obedience--we never know real obedience Unless we know these
   three: suffering, discipline, obedience. They, as the media by which We
   enter into God, are interrelated.

   In our hearts, we feel perfectly sure He is right in permitting the
   suffering, though we cannot answer the "why" every time. "When I came
   into the house of the Lord, I understood." We will have a spiritual
   consciousness of reality and Truth; it does not come by natural
   reasoning. Where revelation ceases, speculation begins.

   I can give as my personal testimony that these deeper revelations of
   Truth, and Clear understanding of the things of God, have come only
   through suffering.

                             Chapter 41 - Teachers

   The reason why Paul taught as earnestly as he did, was because his
   great field was that of a teacher. He was a missionary--that was the
   external manifestation of the work which he did, but underneath all of
   that, there was the most profound urge and drive in that man as a
   teacher; absolutely!

   What did those early teachers teach? They introduced the people into a
   new realm of Spirit with contact with God. The Jews hadn't had that in
   the old order. Teachers were chosen, illuminated spirits, with
   personality gifts; illuminated in the field of spiritual reality. Their
   ministry was to bring from that field the knowledge, the Truth, the
   revelation; all that would feed this Body; instruct it; give it its
   place.

                             Chapter 42 - Teaching

   "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will
   not depart from it." (Prov. 22:6) I have learned a lot of things you
   parents don't know. Your proximity hinders you. Does it say tell' a
   child what he should do, and when he is old, he will not depart from
   it? It does not say tell' a child, for you can tell a child ten
   thousand times, but the telling has to take another step. It is not in
   the telling. If you tell Tommy to do something, and he doesn't do it,
   see to it that he does, even if you have to let the beans burn on the
   stove. You told him an hundred times, but you didn't see to it that he
   did it once! See to it that he does it the once. It will save you the
   ninety-nine times. Take time.

   Here are the three "T's":

   TELL,

   TEACH,

   TRAIN.

   He moves from the first "T" which is to tell; then he must be taught
   the thing which has been told him. The telling is not the teaching. Did
   you give him a lesson in the things you told him? Some day he will be
   really vexed with you because you didn't teach him. He will say, "Why
   didn't you ever correct me on that?" After he has been taught the thing
   which he has been told, he has to be trained in the thing, In other
   words, he has to be trained in the thing he has been taught, in the
   thing he has been told, by everlasting drilling, and training, which
   should follow the lesson, which has been once learned; or else he will
   have lost the application, if he has not been drilled, and trained in
   the lesson which he first learned.

   God's method is the same in the school of the Holy Spirit. He takes us
   up, as pliable material, to build personalities in God; men and women
   in God Who know spiritual life and values, The HOLY SPIRIT dwells in us
   as a great Tutor Who instructs us in the great university.

   A pianist first has to be told a lot. He may have the potential
   possibilities first, but all the knowledge which he has about that
   music, doesn't make him a great pianist. It gives him the equipment
   necessary, but all the lovely values have never come out yet. He must
   learn by a lesson, and be taught the scales first. Then he has to be
   drilled and trained in the lesson he has learned.

   The word education comes from: e = "out, evacuate," duco = "to leave";
   acqua = "velvet water, smooth, aqueduct, watering duct, leading out
   into". He is not educated until that knowledge has come down into
   livable portions. How does he know how to act in certain circumstances?
   Education is to "lead out." It is unto a purpose. He has his head all
   filled with a lot of facts, but he is not yet educated. That which he
   has received has never acquired an adequate expression in life.
   Education involves a process. The telling; the lessons; growth;
   training involves doing and executing.

   Telling is the storing up; teaching, its power; training makes the
   doing substance; "that he can't depart from it." It makes it a part of
   his life; there is no separation. It is a part of him. It is not
   something he heard, for he can slip away from that. If he doesn't learn
   his lessons faithfully, he forgets them. So training is unto the
   doing--the application.

   Jesus went up and down the country telling the good news. He told
   everybody; multitudes heard Him, but all the multitudes, having heard
   that glorious Truth, were not wonderful spiritual people just because
   they were told. "He spoke not to the multitude but by a parable." They
   had the multitude power, capacity, and receptivity. But when He was
   alone, "He expounded all things to His disciples." A disciple is a
   taught-one. All Christians who are saved are not disciples. A disciple
   requires qualification. ". . . And seeing the multitude, He said: If
   any man will be My disciple, let him deny himself and take up his cross
   and follow Me." Take up the cross which will kill the old creation,
   lest it would hinder the new creation. Disciples are called-out ones
   from the believing multitude; they are taught and disciplined. They can
   be disciplined in very many measures aside from using a stick! "For
   whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, child-trains, and scourgeth every
   son whom He receiveth." (Heb. 12:6)--(See also Prov. 15:5, 31, 32;
   13:18-24; 19:1-8; 22:15; 23:12, 14; 29:15)

                        Chapter 43 - Testing and Proving

   I always deal with God. I never deal with the devil. We say: "I defy
   the devil!" It takes the LORD to rebuke him! He is loose, but God is
   back of him. I get right behind Jesus; He is my Elder Brother. He will
   take me through, and He is my glorious High Priest Who intercedes for
   me. I am conscious of the devil, but I know better than to get into a
   squabble with him.

   My garden has something besides roses in it. It has a tree of the
   knowledge of good and evil, and a serpent. God had to have the tree,
   because He is building a man. Who takes possession of the tree? The
   enemy does tempting to divert us. In the Name of Jesus, refuse it!
   Character is built through a law of testing and proving. Nature is a
   gift. We have to do with the shaping of character, but we don't have to
   do with the nature that God gave us. Accept the law of testing and
   proving if the life of Christ is to be manifested. Grow like Him, and
   grow with Him. We are only safe when we choose the will of God.

   All life, wherever it is manifested, is a manifestation of God. It may
   run in terrifying channels, and it may be used to horrible destruction,
   but every bit of life and power that is manifested, is of God. He is
   the one Who originates life. The devil uses it, and misuses it,
   terrifies the world with it, and he swings it out in all kinds of
   fashions, but he is not the author of it, for he has life originally
   from God.

   What would have happened if Adam and Eve had refused the subtle
   arguments of the enemy? They would have met another tree. Why? Because
   the strength of that which they had gained in the first testing would
   have had to go through a crucible, and come out tested. The tree was to
   build them, and to release, not destroy them. If they had not failed,
   they would have had enough trees, (testings) to do something. It would
   have perfected them, and brought them through to a lovely
   glorification, as it did the Last Adam, Jesus, on the Mt. of
   Transfiguration.

   I want to help you with this question of trouble, trials, testings, and
   provings. Since our lives are full of them, we should not be disturbed
   if we can't pray them all out of our pattern. Because, if we are
   consecrated spirits, dedicated to God, He is very familiar with every
   bit of the paraphernalia that is thrown into our life pattern. He knows
   it before we do. He never permits anything to come, unless it touches
   Him first. Even the devil can't touch us unless God permits him. God
   knows all about it. That should encourage us if the testings and
   provings come--they have to come as a part of our economy as
   Christians.

   I will show you a reason for the necessity of testings and provings by
   going back to Genesis. "And God breathed into his nostrils the breath
   of life." In Hebrew, "life" is plural; "lives". Why? The minute that
   breath of God strikes this human creature, who is made to function with
   God On that level, he would have that life flowing in two directions.
   In its first direction, it is to flow back again to God, and make this
   man a unit--one with God. He is created of God, and he is created for
   God. His life (lives) becomes a spiritual manifestation, and also a
   physical manifestation, and his body begins to function. His life
   (lives) strikes in two directions:

   1. It brings this creature into a conscious relation with God. Keep
   this communion open; keep that alive.

   2. It is responsive to the world, because it has the life of God in it,
   which brings him in contact with the physical things of this world as
   well.

   Everything in him responds, because of the life element which sets free
   ten thousand things that are hidden in him. They were never, never
   manifested in Adam--they never had a chance, but they were them.

   God made man with two trinities:

   1. Spirit, soul, body.

   2. Personality; consisting of intellectual gifts; emotion al reactions;
   power to choose.

   God is working all the time in those two trinities. We have the power
   of the will to choose, and character is built under a law of testing
   and proving.

   We have no life in ourselves; we are dependent; therefore we must go
   daily to the Tree of Life, which symbolizes Christ. (Matt. 6:11) There
   are two forces in terrific conflict. The enemy hates God. He took
   one-third of the hosts of heaven with him. God told Adam, "This is the
   tree of the knowledge of good and evil; keep away from it, for in the
   day ye eat thereof, ye shall die. I will give you all the knowledge of
   good and evil that you need. I have all you need, and I will give to
   you. But that tree is a strange thing, and I am not explaining it to
   you--it is a tree symbolizing the knowledge of good and evil. I don't
   want you to be awakened to that. That is Satanic! For in the day that
   you do, you shall die."

   Death was not in the thought of God at all--translation was. "You keep
   your power of choice in Me, and say, Yes' with Me."--Now God planted
   that tree before the devil got in there. "When the power of choice
   comes, keep choosing with Me." Sin erased the spiritual aspect of
   Adam's being, and he became sub-normal; psychic; intellectual, and body
   conscious, and the majority of people are subnormal to this day.

   "In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Did He say:
   "You will go to hell?" No. We know there is hell and all that, but that
   isn't His proposition. He is coming to a proposition of life and death.
   It was an issue of life and death there in the garden. That issue has
   never changed. Theology changes; doctrines will change; church creeds
   will change; their philosophy will change, but God never changes. We go
   right back to the garden, and there it is; a law of testing and
   proving, with the issue--life and death. He still works on that basis
   today.

   God cannot be tempted, nor does He tempt anyone. But God tests us, and
   proves us, because we are His workmanship; He wants to develop us, and
   bring us into a place of victory and life in Him. He can only do it
   through the law of testing. Temptation is always unto defeat and death.
   Testing is always unto strength and life.

   Always remember when we meet this tree, don't have a united prayer
   meeting where all of the saints come with their axes, all ground and
   sharp with the Word of God, full of faith, and they say, "Now in the
   name of the Lord, we will deliver this poor saint," and we chop his
   tree down! But they say, "The tree has the devil in it!" Well of
   course, where would the devil be? He's in the tree. "Oh, Lord, kill the
   devil." "I can't! I want him. He is My shepherd dog, he is running
   around after the sheep, getting them in line. I am not going to destroy
   the very instrument that I am using.

   How will I ever get hold of Job? Can you imagine God, saying, "We'll go
   down tonight, and politely say, Dear Brother Job, there is something I
   have to say unto thee, and I really want you to understand this, Job
   . . . you are thus and so, but I think I can help you.'" How silly that
   would be! The Lord uses the devil to get at Job.

   He says, "No tree; no temptation has beset you, but what is common to
   man, but God has with the tree which He has made, also made a way of
   escape." He makes the situation, and He makes a way of escape, but we
   always want a short-cut through. "He hath also with the testing made a
   way of escape, that ye may endure it." Through the testing, God will be
   glorified in us.

   He can only make us mature saints through a life process. I want you to
   be students of the Word, students of life, and students of what God is
   doing; how He does it, and why He does it. Then we become what I call
   spiritually intelligent. Why do we have testings? Why do we have
   discipline? To release, and build this wonderful Christian character
   through our intelligent cooperation with Him, saying, "I Choose with
   God."

   I can give my whole life as a testimony of the Truth that I impart.
   Whoever gets anything from God without having a hard time? The great
   artist, Van Gogh, is an example: His Master Teacher told him, "I am
   glad you have to paint on an empty stomach; nothing in this world,
   worthwhile, has ever been done comfortably." Nothing worthwhile has
   ever been done comfortably, and nothing worthwhile that we have to give
   is due to a comfortable habit.--"Measure thy life by loss, and not by
   gain . . ."

   Don't let the glory of this present victory blind you to what is down
   the road, or around the corner, because the Lord is going to test the
   strength of this victory. The strength of this victory will be tried
   out again and again and again. He tries us continually in order to
   develop our spiritual strength.

   Usually in a test, even a long one, we become too involved and
   localized, and the pressure makes us so present conscious that at times
   we lose all sense of proportion. But after a while we get quiet, and
   look back, and get a perspective and view we missed before. So I am
   seeing now (3 yrs. later) at least a little of why things have to come
   our way.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               Chapter 44 - Truth

   I have given out plenty of Truth, and yet some say, "Oh, give us more."
   What have you done with what I have already given? You enjoy the Truth,
   but sometimes there is a fascination in its revelation that bewitches
   you, and you want to know more about that, but you don't want to know
   about the power of its reaction in you.

   That is where your trouble is. We must always remember that there is a
   reaction in this Truth business. We want it --that's good--the desire
   is there; that is wholesome. One day I said, "I want the Truth, Lord."
   But you see, if we really mean that, the entrance of Truth in our
   hearts and lives is the most disastrous thing we could ask for; that
   is, if we let it accomplish its features and purposes. It isn't
   something that liberates us, and makes us happy. That is one aspect of
   its reaction, but Truth, in its power, in its essence, is the most
   terrifying thing I have found, but I didn't know it in the beginning.

   Truth has a two-fold action in us. It will begin pleasing us, of
   course; that is good psychology; quite agreeable; it has a great charm.
   We say, "Truth, how wonderful!" Now, if we embrace it; if we actually
   open our hearts to that, and we say, "Lord, I want the Truth," we
   better be very careful what we pray about. He might come in with the
   power of Truth. What does it do? It becomes devastating since we have
   to have it in this negative aspect first. Truth will slay us, because
   the Lord is not interested in this carnal, natural setup. It has to go
   by a way of death before it can be released in life. That is a law in
   the realm of Spirit, and the realm of Spirit is filled with laws as
   real as the law of gravitation.

   People, however, would rather have a manifestation they can look at:
   grow a leg on Susie . . . see how He did that! We get caught on some
   item, an experience, and we cannot move. Use them as most fleeting,
   most fleeting; value them; appreciate them; give them their full value,
   but move on.

   He says, "If I come in that negative power, it will slay you, but there
   is a reaction; I only slay that I may bring resurrection and life." So
   Truth will slay us, but Truth is the only medium He has for its
   resurrection.

   I like Peter because he is aggressive, and I like John because he is a
   mystic. I work with all people, because Truth is too big for one
   church. No one has a corner on it. If I found a bunch of people who
   thought they had all the Truth, I'd leave them. Nobody has all the
   Truth; we have the Bible, but I mean the revelation of its contents.

   Truth is not only objective, but when people yield their hearts and
   lives to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit can take this Truth, and
   incorporate it into their lives until the things which are purely
   judicial may be brought down to actual living. The Holy Spirit takes
   that which is purely objective and judicial, and makes it a reality in
   your life until it is incorporated into your being; it will then be a
   subjective realization.

   SUBJECTIVE--It is not produced by external stimuli, resulting from
   condition within brain and sense organs. The subjective side of Truth
   means how much of the Truth, so refreshing in comtemplation, is
   actually, by experience, ours. The subjective side of Truth is the
   realization of it; it has been personalized; it is experimental Truth
   vs. judicial or objective Truth.

   OBJECTIVE--It is external; apart from self-consciousness; an end of
   action to be reached (not subjective). While contemplating, and
   meditating on Truth, we may be blest and refreshed. This is the
   objective aspect of Truth, sometimes called judicial Truth. For
   example: Someone gives us a lovely statement of Truth which is purely
   objective; a little later God brings a little crisis, and says, "Now I
   am going to take that Truth, and make it a demonstration, (subjective
   realization) in your life.

   Truth is never ours until it is personalized. It is never ours until we
   have laid ourselves open to God in our inner being, and the Spirit has
   been able to bring that Truth in, and we have, by faith, taken hold of
   it, and allowed that Truth to do the thing in us that it should. It may
   be creative, or perhaps corrective, but whichever it is, it is the
   material we will be using.

   Truth is purely progressive in all forms. The heart has to be
   conditioned continually for its reception. It is an invisible miracle
   in the heart. Ten years from now it will have a fuller meaning.

   There are fields of Truth not yet possessed. It takes a lifetime to
   have Truth converted in us.

   All revelation, I don't care what field we may move in, is purely a
   progressive matter. It is eternally evolving; it is eternally moving.
   Why? Because it is inexhaustible. That is the center of all which is in
   God. God is infinite; Truth is infinite. Nobody can exhaust it. Nobody
   has a corner on Truth. It is just too big.

   What you get out of a revelation is what you have brought to it. What
   we bring to Truth governs very much what we get out of it. Our
   testimony is what we have gotten out of the revelation. It will be
   governed by our own personal experience.

   No conversations in the Word of God are accidental--not the words; nor
   the arrangement of the choice of words; nor their combination. That is
   what makes it so powerful.

   Truth is very exacting and precise; it is settled forever. But the
   doctrines which we build on Truth may be very loose, and still be based
   on Truth. Truth comes by revelation; not by mental processes. I have
   tried that field of mental processes; I could define a lot of things,
   and analyze a lot of things; I know doctrine, and have taught it in
   college--that is fine intellectually, but that doesn't get us through.
   Truth comes by revelation. The mental processes are beautiful;
   wonderful; scholastic; intellectual; but we don't know God; we don't
   know Spirit; we don't know reality through that technique at all. It
   moves on a level here, and is good here;-- don't depreciate it; value
   it, but keep it in its place: on the level where God has placed it.

   I can't make Truth. No one is original in that. God alone is its
   Author. But one may discover it, and it may become an obsession, or
   something of that nature. It is LIFE, and gives meaning to life. His
   will becomes the pattern, or design for living. The blessed Holy Spirit
   is Guide, and instructs, and furnishes the power, or dynamics for the
   out-working of His holy and precious purpose in the life of the one
   given to Him. In many ways it is like a dramatic adventure, full of
   heavenly interest, and material for the development of the new life in
   Him. So let us all move along patiently with Him. The agitated spirit
   only hinders. Faith is rest. But it is so difficult to reduce the
   natural man, and teach him to walk patiently with God.

   After three years, Jesus could say, "Now are ye clean through the
   Word." The blood of Jesus will cleanse us from sin, but the power of
   the Word will cleanse us from all these strange, traditional things.
   There is a double cleansing continually. I have about nine places in
   the Word where Jesus washed his disciples from tradition by the Word.

   Unless we learn to make a balance in the Truth, we will never have
   equipoise to stand in the Spirit. The disciples were continually
   feeding themselves on one side of Truth, i.e. Christ in exaltation, but
   the other side of that Truth is Christ in humiliation.

   Examples of the balance in Truth:

   The brazen altar, and mercy seat were the same height.

   Jesus fed four to five thousand, but could pick up the fragments.

   There is a balance, an equipoise, in Truth. Properly, Truth has two
   legs:

   1. Right foot = Light and life--the positive teaching is of the Word of
   God, as victory, joy--it is creative.

   2. Left foot = Discipline, suffering, death--all the negative sides of
   the Truth--it is corrective.

   Jacob's ladder was set on earth;-- angels ascending and descending. Why
   use a ladder? There are two sides of Truth. The ladder is not suspended
   from heaven. Its feet are attached to the earth.

   There is no one original in Truth. Truth is quite original in itself.
   We don't make Truth; we discover it.

   Truth only confirms; it never disturbs Truth. When an impact of Truth
   comes to you, it will never disturb, or dislodge anything that is
   Truth, but if there is something traditional, that becomes uneasy. If
   you have some things in there that are getting kind of jittery,
   something traditional, then that is disturbed. If it will upset
   anything, it won't be Truth that will be upset.

   The Word of God is yet dead until the Spirit of God breathes Life
   through it. The letter of the Word is dead. The Word is Spirit and
   Life.

   Discern the Truth, and live under the power of it. I think that is
   terrible not to be inwardly aroused to, what I call, the inner
   consciousness of Truth.

   We can take a bit of Truth God gives us, and apply it over our initial,
   elementary experience in God, but, by and by, as we grow older, we can
   take that same Truth, and apply it over our lives, and we will find it
   will minister to us all over again. We have had this experience at one
   period in our lives, when he gave us a Scripture for our encouragement,
   strength, or vision, and maybe five years later when we read it, it
   ministers entirely differently to us. That is a sign we have been
   growing. Truth has that power; the application of the Word is repeated
   over and over--here a little, and there a little; precept upon precept.
   It involves a process.

   In our journey back to His loving heart, where we belong, He will have
   to use Truth over and over for our edification. Truth is corrective,
   but it is also illuminating; it has strange powers within us. Sometime
   it will bring a terrifying disappointment, but with it, a marvelous
   moving of the grace of God, so that in the end we would prefer the
   loss, the disappointment that we might have the grace which only comes
   through that method.

   I can give you Truth in one lesson that will take a lifetime to work
   out.

   I want you to find that He is adequate for your need, and I want you to
   have a fresh revelation of Him so that He might strengthen your
   capacity, and enlarge your powers of receptivity. This Truth has
   revolutionized my thinking, and, absolutely, my living. It has made an
   impact on me. The first reaction to Truth is devastating; the second is
   creative, and begins an illumination and a freedom and generosity in
   God which we are too cramped to receive at first. It takes great
   pressure to make capacity. This Truth will project itself to ages and
   ages. Why not pay a little bit now for a correct adjustment to God;
   correct adjustment to the things of God, so that when the time comes
   for our transition, we will not be too horribly surprised. We just
   can't go to glory--we have to be prepared.

   I move in three realms continually: spiritual; soulish;
   physical--that's the way it should be; the way it was designed.

   Our character is the sum total of our choices and decisions through
   life. When we hear Truth, it has made its impact; we cannot erase it.

   Life will have some heartaches and headaches, but in God we have such
   wonderful victory. He is the Answer.

   A mystery is a Truth that comes not by reasoning, but by revelation. It
   is not disclosed to us by a process of reasoning.

   In the garden, Adam and Eve made girdles (aprons). What is your girdle
   as a Christian? It is the girdle of Truth. The earth is cursed today,
   and it cannot bring forth a thing that will make a girdle.

   Anything new that denies the Truth which is given in the Bible, I have
   nothing to do with.

                               Chapter 45 - Types

   There are no non-essentials in God's Word. The Word is full of types,
   symbols, Pictures; all have deep, peculiar, spiritual meaning.

   The Tabernacle in the wilderness is a revelation of Truth--an object
   lesson of spiritual Truth. It is the revelation of Christ and His
   redemptive work; the story of the gospel. It teaches how God can meet
   His People, and how His people can come into the Presence of their God.

   The first five books of the Bible are mostly types. Jesus is pictured
   as Lamb, Altar, Priest; varied glories of His Person, and varied
   aspects of His work. Jesus taught in types. The believer who has most
   acquaintance with Jesus, who loves Him best, will see the most beauties
   in the types.

                              Chapter 46 - Vision

   The world is geared so that it wants everything done right now. But you
   can't do the work of God that way.

   We need perspective in our thinking; in our studying; in our approach
   to God.

   I am so thankful for what I call perspective in my vision of Truth. I
   know now His purpose, and only as I look away, and not too closely at
   the present, am I able to move on at all. "We look not at things seen."
   I must see them all in their logical purpose, but not park on anything
   too transitory.

   We are all made to follow a vision of some sort, or pattern. All life
   and activity is due to motivation toward some desired end or purpose.
   What is our vision; or for what are we living? "Where there is no
   vision (no restraining power in life), the people cast off restraint."
   (Prov. 29:18)

                            Chapter 47 - Will of God

   The highest expression of our spiritual life is, in the last analysis,
   back again to God. That is what we were made for. In the pattern and
   design for our living, God said He made us in His OWN IMAGE and
   LIKENESS. We were created for His glory and His pleasure - all things
   were created for this. We, the effect of His creation, ultimately, are
   unto the pleasure of God.

   We were made to know the will of God, and to swing out in that norm.
   His will may take any pattern; plowing beans or potatoes, or preaching
   the gospel; it doesn't matter. The fact is, the soul has found an
   adjustment in God; embraces the will of God, and, if the will of God is
   for us to work on a farm, that is holy! Why? Because it is the farm?
   No. That work is an holy rendering because it is the will of God being
   performed. God is honored and blessed and glorified where His will
   finds expression.-- Wherever the will of God is being done, He is
   automatically glorified. "The heavens declare the glory of God." We get
   the benefit of the light and all that, but it was to the glory of God
   first.

   When His will is executed, it is a reflection of His glory. This is
   true in the inanimate creation; in the mundane, the material world;
   wherever He produces a bit of His creative desire, it is always to His
   glory. Man's great objective, too, is to glorify God. How can we
   glorify God? By surrendering our will to His, and letting His will be
   wrought in us. Then we cannot help but glorify God.

   Paul says, "I want to focus your thoughts, your prayers, your desires,
   every feature of your being, bound together in a strange cable toward
   one thing--glorifying God." God is setting before us an objective:
   "Whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do, do all
   . . ."--that ye might enter the pearly gates? No. Do all that the
   kingdom of God shall come upon the earth? NO! "Do all to the glory of
   God!"

   He never changed the objective for man. Man was made to glorify God and
   to give him pleasure. "And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in
   the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God . . ." (Col. 3:17) It
   all moves toward God. "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles
   of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
   giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
   to Whom be praise and dominion forever and ever, Amen." (1 Pet.
   4:11)--How do we glorify God? We can only glorify God by doing His
   will, and wherever the will of God is done, He is automatically
   glorified.

   I have the joy of doing the will of God, but I don't always have the
   joy of doing the THING which is in the will of God.

   In our life patterns, it we are dedicated spirits doing the will of
   God, He says, "I can make all these things work together for good, even
   the devil. Because I am God, and in My permissive will, I introduce all
   these foreign, strange elements. But I am God, and I can cause them to
   work together for good to you who are called by Me according to My
   purpose." What is His purpose? "For whom He did foreknow He also did
   predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son that He may be the
   Firstborn among many brethren." (Rom. 8:29) Paul goes on to say, "Be
   not conformed to this world." (Rom 12:2) Don't be molded into the
   popular world mold; don't allow your life to be cast into that popular
   world mold, and become molded into a worldling, because that is a world
   mold. He says it will press. We know in the world they have a lot of
   troubles, but, you see, they don't let their troubles do them any good.
   It brings them to a place of defeat, and sometimes suicide.

   When we do the will of God, we feed Him. "My meat and My drink is to do
   the will of God." (John 4:34) When did you feed Jesus last?

   It always pleases me to see how God can work when we let Him do what He
   wants to do. He can establish a work; He can defend a work; and He can
   do anything He wants to, if we would only get in with His "want to",
   and not say, "Lord, I want to," but "Lord, what do You want to do?"
   Then we get through.

   Most people think the will of God is the most superficial thing.
   Sometimes the will of God is so complicated, and intricate, and
   involved, that it takes prayer to get us in a place where we can
   receive, or even discern it. Paul found this so. (Col. 1:9-11) The will
   of God is the safest place in the world, but sometimes the most
   difficult.

   God still sits on the throne. It is His world. He has a program. He has
   an infinite will that is pushing down through the centuries, and on
   over into the ages. How sweet and lovely when my little will, and your
   little will is swallowed up in that magnificent one of God!

   The basic sin in all the world is self-will against the will of God.
   When we bring it down to its last analysis, it may take ten thousand
   forms; every sin that is committed is a form of self-will over against
   God's.

   All of us have sinned, because we have not perfectly glorified God; all
   have missed the mark.

                               Chapter 48 - Word

   Oh, the majestic, untouched will of God moving down through the ages!
   When we move in the will of God, it answers the thousands of questions
   we may ever have.

   The most marvelous prayer we can ever pray is: "Have your way. Thy will
   be done. Speak, Lord, thy servant heareth Thee. Bring me the
   intimation; that Word; what is it You want?"--Walk that way. Learn to
   do that. It takes a little time, but it takes such a burden off us.
   Now, when lie speaks that Word, it has all the authority of heaven back
   of it, and it has a creative power when He speaks it in our hearts. A
   grain of faith always comes with it. Our faith will lay hold of it, and
   we ought to have it, because we are obedient to a law.

   Always be careful that the Word, the promise, the intimation which is
   governing you today, and you hold in confidence and faith, as a power
   for your prayer authority,--be sure that Word is something which God
   speaks, or brings to your heart, lie may bring it to you by reading the
   Word; lie may bring it through a message; He may bring it by
   literature; He may bring it by intimation of Spirit; He may bring it by
   speaking to your inner heart, even without words. He talks to me many
   times without words as I walk along with Him.

   Never approach the Word asyou would any other literature. The Holy
   Spirit is needed for its revelation. When we deal with the mysteries of
   God, don't expect to understand them with your natural mind; it is a
   divine thing, Come to the Word with:

   1. A clean heart

   2. An unbiased spirit,

   3. An open mind.

   There is nothing casual in the Word. Everything in the Word is full of
   God; full of the Spirit and Life; every bit of it; it is not an
   accidental thing. It is perfectly designed, and purposely designed, but
   we read it so casually.

   In the Old Testament, He gave us our letters. In the New Testament He
   puts them together, and, in the ages to come, we will read them.

   You say you read the Word, but you sense something in it you have never
   really touched yet. You have gotten hold of the letter of the Word; you
   never yet have gotten hold of the fire, or the Spirit of it. You have
   to keep your spirit open, not your brains, to get the Spirit and Life
   of the Word.

   As soon as the Spirit takes hold of the Word, He makes it a throbbing
   reality. The Word, through which Spirit and Life can vibrate and move,
   is the vehicle. The Word that Jesus brings is, in essence, Spirit and
   Life.

   The Bible is the written letter of the Word, but Truth is tremendous.
   The Bible is the vehicle inspired of God; there is nothing in the world
   like it. No man could write it. It is divinely inspired. It is the
   instrument through which Life and Light vibrate. It is the Word of God,
   but Life moves through it. Life is not in this paper; it vibrates
   through it, through its message. We have to learn this. Keep your heart
   open. He is able to speak to you in a thousand ways, and a thousand
   tongues.
     __________________________________________________________________

                              Chapter 49 - Worship

   Isn't it nice when we do things in the Spirit without being told: "Now
   we will lift our hands etc. . . ." No, lift them in the Spirit when He
   lifts them.

   Worship isn't conducted by machinery; it is born of the Spirit. It is
   not mechanical, but uplifting, and ascending to God; to a holy
   God--holy, holy, holy--something fresh we offer from our hearts. If you
   don't have that kind of God, I'd trade Him off! He is white-heated
   holiness and purity--a fire that consumes. No flesh can stand in His
   Presence. "That no flesh should glory in His Presence." (I Cor. 1:29)
   These days this needs to be brought out and emphasized, because people
   try to pull Him down to their level. "Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous,
   and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness." (Ps. 97:12)

   Our highest vocation is not our ministry; it is adoration and worship.
   Man was made for the glory of God originally. Our attitude in God is
   what counts. Worship is a tremendous SELF-GIVING to God; something that
   comes from within, and is going fight up to God; fight back to God. We
   can't worship in ourselves. Worship is born of the Spirit. He can
   worship through us. We can't automatically worship. True worship is
   born of the Spirit.

   There is a difference between praise and worship. Praise is something
   we do. Worship is of the Spirit. The nearer we come to Him, the more we
   feel like going down, down before Him; not this "Hello, Jesus"
   business, but like a dog by his master, who has such a sense of
   security and rest: "I just feel that I want to push up by You. You
   don't have to talk to me."

   There are times, if the Lord could .get certain spirits into a place of
   just worship and adoration, that would mean more to Him than a thousand
   things they could do. If we could just come into the swing of the
   Spirit that enters into worship;--walk all day worshipping the Lord,
   while souls are going to hell?--I tell you something; they went to hell
   before we were born, and will after we are gone. We get so entangled
   into these traditional patterns and things that we forget God. If God
   can be blessed and honored by being loved and worshiped all day, then
   love Him and worship Him all day!

   You say, "We will have all the eternal ages in heaven to worship Him."
   You better practice a little down here. Get in tune with the Infinite,
   and learn the quietness of His heart. How far we are from this in so
   much we see and hear! When we get into God, we find He is just about a
   thousand miles away from so much stuff we have here, but that holds us;
   it fascinates us.

   Churches in the book of Revelation have a work complex instead of a
   worship complex.

   How many know when the judgment of God will be lifted off this earth,
   it will be like a great musical; a powerful instrument of praise. The
   morning stars will be singing together! Do trees sing? Yes, to a poet,
   and anyone in God, they do. The scientific approach to God is always so
   ghastly to me. They want God in capsule form t prescription. He doesn't
   move that way; He is Spirit.

                           Chapter 50 - Miscellaneous

   My mother used to say: "To discipline a child, you have to go back to
   its mother and grandmother: (wise) I never had a problem child in
   school.

   Anything we hold and retain becomes a snare. The enemy came to Jesus,
   but had nothing to hang on to.

   You can listen and not hear, and you can look, and not see! What do you
   see when you look?

   Signs are for unbelievers to arouse them to a consciousness that there
   is something dramatic around. We, as believers, don't need an
   earthquake.

   A mystic is one who has discovered a life in God--independent of his
   natural life. That is mystical, because it is above the natural.

   The first place we find fear in the Bible is in Gen. 3:10. Fear doesn't
   belong in the vocabulary of a Christian. It is a word that has been
   added to our vocabulary through sin and failure. Fear is the
   disorganizing element. The love of God is creative. "Perfect love
   casteth out fear." Love will beget and beget. When Peter walked on
   water--fear broke down the whole thing. Fear is always the
   disorganizing element in any field in God. "Fear hath torment", because
   it is the antithesis of love. Love is trust.

   "For we know that all things work together for good . . ." (Rom. 8:28)
   He can make sickness, death, all things, even hell; He can make even
   the wrath of the devil to praise Him!

   I am always afraid of the magnitude of a thing. He deals with a
   minority, a remnant, etc.

   Things of the Spirit are mystically sweet.

   Things of God in creation are silent, usually; filled with mystery;
   sweet.

   Things of the enemy are most always destructive and noisy!

   Satan is walking around seeking whom he may devour. The Lord is walking
   around finding somebody who would be interested in Him.

   "God has made us what we are, creating us in Christ Jesus for the good
   deeds which am prepared beforehand by God as our sphere of action."
   (Eph. 2:10 Moffatt's Tr.)

   In regard to dealing with a wayward minister, I feel I am not touching
   the Lord's anointed; I am correcting a piece of flesh!

   The books of Revelation and Daniel are cryptic writings which take a
   peculiar, special adaptation for. an interpretation in that field.

   Duplicate idea: Jacob constrained the angel to bless him, and on the
   Emmaus Road, the disciples constrained Jesus to come in.

   God's way: (1) Opens prison door for Paul and Silas.

   (2) Puts John on Patmos--not out.

   One He delivers, the next one He doesn't--that's God's way.

   "Two things have I required of Thee; deny me them not before I die:
   Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches;
   feed me with food convenient for me: Lest I be full, and deny Thee, and
   say, Who is the Lord? Or lest I be poor, and steal and take the name of
   my God in vain." In other words: Deliver me from the abundance which
   would make me too independent, so I would forfeit my dependence. But
   don't let me be so starved that I can't live.

   Never be afraid of your limitation, but don't try with all your might
   and main where it won't stretch. Give it to God. He can take a
   limitation, and make it to bless five thousand. That is the kind of God
   we have. Put your limitation of five loaves and two fishes into the
   hands of God, and say, "Oh, Lord, here it is."

   Mary at Cana. (She is always present, and His disciples; she is always
   there!) Mary: "They have no wine." (John 2:1-4)--There is no "Mother"
   in Jesus' answer to her! He calls her: "woman"--flesh. She is an
   ambitious mother, patriotic, and defends the Lord, and tries to shine
   up His glory;--proving God!

   Don't stand there to explain God, and defend God. We are not called to
   defend Him; we are called to worship God, and love Him. But it is so
   much easier to try to defend Him than it is to worship Him. It is so
   much easier to prove Him, than to walk with Him.

   DAY: what does it mean in the Genesis creation? We get into trouble if
   we are not careful. The Hebrew word for "day" in Genesis is "Yom"--It
   really means an indefinite period of time. It does not set a time limit
   at all; it merely means a period. It may be twenty-four hours; a year;
   a thousand years. We say, "that day" meaning twenty-four hours. We
   cannot always do that in Bible study.

   Once I had just a little wish; it made me think of David, when he was
   hunted as a partridge on a mountain, and he just gave a little
   expression of a secret wish, but God saw that secret wish in him which
   desired to have a drink of water from his own home well in Bethlehem.
   Soldiers heard it, endangered their lives, and went way back in there
   and got it. It broke David's heart; he didn't feel worthy even to drink
   it. He poured it out as a libation, giving it to God. "l am not even
   worthy to drink it." It was a fresh touch he had with God; a fresh
   avenue was opened. That is like these little wishes we have sometimes.
   God is interested in the most casual and unlikely incidents; in most
   incidental things which would pass almost unobserved. He is concerned
   with them, and causes the things to work together.

   We are under a curse--God cursed the earth; "Cursed be the EARTH" for
   man's doings, and all the animals had to go into a subjection for which
   they were not accountable. I never go to a zoo, and see a poor lion,
   but I always feel apologetic. I say, "Poor thing; God never made you
   like that, never in the world; your ferocity; your ugliness; your blood
   thirst; all is a result of sin in the world. God never created you to
   jump on something and kill it--never in the world." A curse--a judgment
   is upon ALL creation for man's sake.

   "I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content."
   Philippians 4:11 should read, "I have learned in whatsoever state I am
   to be independent of it--I have learned in any condition to be
   independent of it"--I will not allow it to harass me, torment me, or
   disturb me. I will gain out of it what God wants me to have, but I will
   be above it. I will in any kind of a condition be released from it.

   Psychiatrists can pull it all apart, but they can't put it back
   together, because they have no kingpin. The Lord can put it together,
   because lie is the greatest Psychiatrist, Psychoanalyst, and
   Psychologist in the universe. He can analyze us perfectly. He can take
   us all apart, and He can !to step by step in every item in our beings.
   Then He says, "I can put you all together"--not around the ego, but
   around the Christ; not ego-centric--that would damage the whole
   thing--but Christ-centered. He says, "Now let Me have all your
   faculties, and I will even put them together in the power of the
   Spirit, in a new-formed personality, in its correct shape."

   He redeemed the nation Israel out of Egypt--a separation to God. The
   Red Sea opened to let them out of Egypt's power, and closed behind them
   to keep them out! As long as a man is governed by the world Spirit, he
   can know but little of communion with God. "I will dwell in them" is
   closely followed by the precept, "Come out from among them and be ye
   separate." (2 Cor. 6:16, 17)

   God spoke to Moses, and under the authority of God, the children of
   Israel could go right through the Red sea, because they were in divine
   order, under a special word. The Egyptians "assayed" to do likewise.
   They saw how the Israelites got along beautifully, BUT they didn't have
   any "spoke". God had spoken to the Israelites--God had not spoken to
   the Egyptians. Therefore, they couldn't have the miracle, although they
   assayed to do likewise. They didn't have any Word from God. You have to
   have the Word from God for your authority. The Egyptians Said, "Why,
   they went through, why can't we?" They tried it, and drowned!

   Don't make things synonymous which are not Synonymous, such as nature
   and character. The lovely new nature is a gift, but the character which
   He is after, is built. How? Through testing and proving. That is why
   gradation is all through the New Testament. Gradation is mentioned with
   regard to food, milk, meat, strong meat, and there is gradation when it
   speaks of babes, children, little children, grownup sons, fathers and
   mothers in Israel.

   People right in this city can't be alone five minutes nor still five
   minutes. We've got to get a TV going, and a radio going, and a band
   going, and a hum dum going and a . . . . They live in that environment.
   Why? Because they would be scared to death to be five minutes in the
   Presence of God. There is no adjustment for them. They have become so
   exposed to these horrible things that they don't know what's the matter
   with them. So they take pills, and jump off bridges, and do anything.

   The enemy cannot touch us as redeemed property, abiding in Him, walking
   consciously with God, only as God sees good.--It was God Who gave the
   permission that Peter should be sifted. It was God Who gave the
   permission that Job should be tested. That was all under the permissive
   providence of God. The devil hath desired . . . but God hath given him
   permission, the power, to test and prove them.

   1 Cor. 1:30: "But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, Who of God is made
   unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
   redemption."--The Holy Spirit is seeking to conform us to His image.
   All the victories He won belong to me now because I am in Him. He is
   made unto me all that. So we don't have to struggle too hard.

   "For with God nothing is ever impossible, and no Word from God shall be
   without power or impossible of fulfillment." (Luke 1:37 A.N.T.) We have
   to have the Word from Him first.

   Never take the initiative in moving into anything unless you have the
   Word of God to garrison you.

PRAYER

   O, faith, thou glorious means of reaching, help us to see the desire
   and purpose of God. Teach us to relate in this Lazarus-hour of our
   experience--the tomb--to God's glory, and anoint our eyes to trace
   God's leading over the pressure, and through the distress until we may
   see God's glory.
