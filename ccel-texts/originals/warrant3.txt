Preface

   This book is about the intellectual or rational acceptability of
   Christian belief. When I speak here of Christian belief, I mean what is
   common to the great creeds of the main branches of the Christian
   church, what unites Calvin and Aquinas, Luther and Augustine, Menno
   Simons and Karl Barth, Mother Teresa and St. Maximus the Confessor,
   Billy Graham and St. Gregory Palamas--classical Christian belief, as we
   might call it.

   Classical Christian belief includes, in the first place, the belief
   that there is such a person as God. God is a person: that is, a being
   with intellect and will. A person has (or can have) knowledge and
   belief, but also affections, loves, and hates; a person, furthermore,
   also has or can have intentions, and can act so as to fulfill them. God
   has all of these qualities and has some (knowledge, power, and love,
   for example) to the maximal degree. God is thus all-knowing and
   all-powerful; he is also perfectly good and wholly loving. Still
   further, he has created the universe and constantly upholds and
   providentially guides it. This is the theistic component of Christian
   belief. But there is also the uniquely Christian component: that we
   human beings are somehow mired in rebellion and sin, that we
   consequently require deliverance and salvation, and that God has
   arranged for that deliverance through the sacrificial suffering, death,
   and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who was both a man and also the
   second member of the Trinity, the uniquely divine son of God. I shall
   use the term Christian belief' to designate these two components taken
   together. Of course, I realize that others may use that term more
   narrowly or more broadly. There is no need to argue about words here:
   the beliefs I mentioned are the ones I shall discuss, however exactly
   we propose to use the term Christian'. I also recognize that there are
   partial approximations to Christian belief so understood, as well as
   borderline cases, beliefs such that it simply isn't clear whether they
   qualify as Christian belief. All of this is true, but as far as I can
   see, none of it compromises my project.

   Accordingly, our question is this: is belief of this sort
   intellectually acceptable? In particular, is it intellectually
   acceptable for us, now? For educated and intelligent people living in
   the twenty-first century, with all that has happened over the last four
   or five hundred years? Some will concede that Christian belief was
   acceptable and even appropriate for our ancestors, [1] people who knew
   little of other religions, who knew nothing of evolution and our animal
   ancestry, nothing of contemporary subatomic physics and the strange,
   eerie, disquieting world it postulates, nothing of those great masters
   of suspicion, Nietzsche, Marx, and Freud, nothing of the acids of
   modern historical biblical criticism. But for us enlightened
   contemporary intellectuals (so the claim continues) things are wholly
   different; for people who know about those things (people of our rather
   impressive intellectual attainments), there is something naive and
   foolish, or perhaps bullheaded and irresponsible, or even vaguely
   pathological in holding onto such belief.

   But can't we be a little more precise about the objection? What,
   exactly, is the problem? The answer, I think, is that there are alleged
   to be two main problems. Western thought since the eighteenth-century
   Enlightenment has displayed at least two distinct styles of objection.
   First, there have been de facto objections: objections to the truth of
   Christian belief. Perhaps the most important de facto objection would
   be the argument from suffering and evil. This objection goes all the
   way back to Democritus in the ancient world but is also the most
   prominent contemporary de facto objection (see chapter 14). It has
   often been stated philosophically, but has also received powerful
   literary expression (for example, in Dostoevski's The Brothers
   Karamazov). The objection goes as follows: according to Christian
   belief, we human beings have been created by an all-powerful,
   all-knowing God who loves us enough to send his son, the second person
   of the divine Trinity, to suffer and die on our account; but given the
   devastating amount and variety of human suffering and evil in our sad
   world, this simply can't be true.

   The argument from evil may be the most important de facto objection,
   but it isn't the only one. There are also the claims that crucial
   Christian doctrines--Trinity, Incarnation, or Atonement, for
   example--are incoherent or necessarily false. Many have argued that the
   Christian doctrine of three divine persons with one nature cannot be
   coherently stated; many have claimed that it is not logically possible
   that a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, should also be the second person
   of the divine Trinity, and many have thought it impossible that one
   person's suffering--even if that person is divine--should atone for
   someone else's sins. Indeed, there are claims that the advance of
   science has somehow shown that there really isn't any supernatural
   realm at all--no God who has created us and governs our world, let
   alone a Trinity of divine persons, one of whom became a human being,
   died, and rose from the dead, thereby redeeming human beings from sin
   and suffering.

   De facto objections, therefore, are many, and they enjoy a long and
   distinguished history in Western thought. Even more prevalent, however,
   have been de jure objections. These are arguments or claims to the
   effect that Christian belief, whether or not true, is at any rate
   unjustifiable, or rationally unjustified, or irrational, or not
   intellectually respectable, or contrary to sound morality, or without
   sufficient evidence, or in some other way rationally unacceptable, not
   up to snuff from an intellectual point of view. There is, for example,
   the Freudian claim that belief in God is really a result of wish
   fulfillment; there is the evidentialist claim that there isn't
   sufficient evidence for Christian belief; and there is the pluralist
   claim that there is something arbitrary and even arrogant in holding
   that Christian belief is true and anything incompatible with it false.
   De facto and de jure objections are separate species, but they
   sometimes coincide. Thus there is a de jure objection from suffering
   and evil as well as a de facto: it is often claimed that the existence
   of suffering and evil in the world makes it irrational to hold that
   Christian belief is, in fact, true.

   De facto objections are relatively straightforward and initially
   uncomplicated: the claim is that Christian belief must be false (or at
   any rate improbable), given something or other we are alleged to know.
   Quite often the claim is that it is something we now know, something
   our ancestors allegedly did not know, as in Rudolf Bultmann's widely
   quoted remark that "it is impossible to use electrical light and the
   wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical
   discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world
   of spirits and miracles." [2] De jure objections, by contrast, while
   perhaps more widely urged than their de facto counterparts, are also
   much less straightforward. The conclusion of such an objection will be
   that there is something wrong with Christian belief--something other
   than falsehood--or else something wrong with the Christian believer: it
   or she is unjustified, or irrational, or rationally unacceptable, in
   some way wanting. But what way, exactly? Just what is it to be
   unjustified or irrational? No doubt it is a bad thing to hold beliefs
   that are rationally unjustified: but what precisely is the problem?
   Wherein lies the badness? This is ordinarily not made clear. According
   to the evidentialist, for example, the evidence for Christian belief is
   insufficient: but insufficient for what? And suppose you believe
   something for which the evidence is insufficient: what, exactly, is the
   matter with you? Are you thereby subject to moral blame, or shown to be
   somehow incompetent, or unusually ignorant, or subject to some kind of
   pathology, or what? According to Freud and some of his followers,
   Christian and theistic belief is a product of wish fulfillment or some
   other projective mechanism. Well, suppose (contrary to fact, as I see
   it) that is true: just what is the problem? Is it that such a belief is
   likely to be false? Is it that if you accept a belief formed on the
   basis of wish fulfillment, you have done something that merits blame?
   Or are you, instead, a proper object of pity? What, precisely, is the
   problem?

   These questions are much harder to answer than one might think. One
   project of this book is to try to answer them: I try to find a serious
   and viable de jure objection to Christian belief. That is, I try to
   find a de jure objection that is both a real objection and also at
   least plausibly attached to Christian belief. But there is a prior
   question: is there actually any such thing as Christian belief,
   conceived as Christians conceive it? Some thinkers (often citing the
   authority of the great eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant)
   argue that we couldn't so much as think about such a being as the
   Christian God, infinite and transcendent as he is supposed to be. That
   is because our all-too-human concepts could not apply to such a being;
   our concepts can apply only to finite beings, beings who are not
   transcendent in the way Christians take God to be. But if it is really
   true that our concepts cannot apply to an infinite and transcendent
   being, if we cannot so much as think about such a being, then we human
   beings also have no beliefs about such a being. Indeed, we can't have
   beliefs about such a being. ANd then the fact is there isn't any such
   thing as Christian belief: Christians think they have beliefs about an
   infinite and transcendent being, but in fact they are mistaken. In part
   I, "Is There a Question?" (chapters 1 and 2), I argue that there is no
   reason at all to accept this skeptical claim: Kant himself provides no
   reason, and those contemporaries who appeal to his authority certainly
   do no better.

   That conclusion clears the deck for the main question of the book: is
   there a viable de jure objection to Christian belief? One that is
   independent of de facto objections and does not presuppose that
   Christian belief is false? There are, I believe, fundamentally three
   main candidates: that Christian belief is unjustified, that it is
   irrational, and that it is unwarranted. These candidates will be
   introduced in due course; for the moment, note just that three of the
   main characters of this drama, therefore, are justification,
   rationality, and warrant. In part II, "What Is the Question?" (chapters
   3-4), I ask first whether a viable de jure criticism can be developed
   in terms of justification and rationality; I conclude that it cannot.
   Then I turn (chapter 5) to the objections offered by Freud, Marx, and
   Nietzsche; and here we finally find an initially promising candidate
   for a de jure objection. This complaint is in the vicinity of warrant.
   To see what warrant is, note that not all true beliefs constitute
   knowledge. You are an ardent Detroit Tigers fan; out of sheer bravado
   and misplaced loyalty, you believe that they will win the pennant,
   despite the fact that last year they finished last and during the off
   season dealt away their best pitcher. As it happens, the Tigers
   unaccountably do win the pennant, by virtue of an improbable series of
   amazing flukes. Your belief that they will, obviously, wasn't
   knowledge; it was more like an incredibly lucky guess. To count as
   knowledge, a belief, obviously enough, must have more going for it than
   truth. That extra something is what I call warrant'. As I see it, if
   there are any real de jure objections to Christian belief, they lie in
   the neighborhood of warrant.

   That may not come as much of a surprise, given that this book is a
   sequel to Warrant: The Current Debate and Warrant and Proper Function.
   [3] In the first of those books I introduced the term warrant' as a
   name for that property--or better, quantity--enough of which is what
   makes the difference between knowledge and mere true belief. I went on
   to examine the various contemporary theories of warrant: what exactly
   is the property that distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief? I
   canvassed the contemporary theories on offer: is it justification?
   coherence? rationality? being produced by reliable belief-producing
   faculties or processes? The answer, I argued, is none of the above;
   none of these theories is right. In Warrant and Proper Function I went
   on to give what seems to me to be the correct answer: warrant is
   intimately connected with proper function. More fully, a belief has
   warrant just if it is produced by cognitive processes or faculties that
   are functioning properly, in a cognitive environment that is propitious
   for that exercise of cognitive powers, according to a design plan that
   is successfully aimed at the production of true belief. (For
   explanation of that perhaps baffling formula, see chapter 5.)

   According to Freud and Marx, therefore, the real problem with theistic
   (and hence Christian) belief is that it lacks warrant. In part III,
   "Warranted Christian Belief" (chapters 6-10), I address this objection.
   As it turns out, this de jure objection is really dependent on a de
   facto objection. That is because (as I argue) if Christian belief is
   true, then it is also warranted; the claim that theistic (and hence
   Christian) belief is unwarranted really presupposes that Christian
   belief is false. Freud and Marx, therefore, do not give us a de jure
   objection that is independent of the truth of Christian belief; their
   objection presupposes its falsehood. I go on (in chapter 6) to offer a
   model, the Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model, for theistic beliefs having
   warrant and argue that if theistic belief is in fact true, then
   something like this model is in fact correct.

   In chapters 7 through 10, I extend the A/C model to cover full-blown
   Christian belief (as opposed to theistic belief simpliciter), beginning
   (in chapter 7) with an account of the place of sin in the model. Next
   (in chapters 8 and 9), I propose the extended A/C model; according to
   this model, Christian belief is warranted because it meets the
   conditions of warrant spelled out in Warrant and Proper Function. That
   is, Christian belief is produced by a cognitive process (the "internal
   instigation of the Holy Spirit" [Aquinas] or the "internal testimony of
   the Holy Spirit" [Calvin]) functioning properly in an appropriate
   epistemic environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at
   truth. Chapter 8, "The Extended A/C Model: Revealed to Our Minds," sets
   out the cognitive side of this process. The process involves the
   affections as well as reason, however (i.e., it involves will as well
   as intellect), and chapter 9, "The Testimonial Model: Sealed upon Our
   Hearts," explains some of the connections between reason and the
   affections. Chapter 10 concludes part III by considering various actual
   and possible objections to the model; none is successful. What I
   officially claim for the extended A/C model is not that it is true but,
   rather, that it is epistemically possible (i.e., nothing we know
   commits us to its falsehood); I add that if Christian belief is true,
   then very likely this model or something like it is also true. If I am
   right in these claims, there aren't any viable de jure criticisms that
   are compatible with the truth of Christian belief; that is, there
   aren't any viable de jure objections independent of de facto
   objections. And if that is so, then the attitude expressed in "Well, I
   don't know whether Christian belief is true (after all, who could know
   a thing like that?), but I do know that it is irrational (or
   intellectually unjustified or unreasonable or intellectually
   questionable)"--that attitude, if I am right, is indefensible.

   Finally, in part IV, "Defeaters?" (chapters 11-14), I confront the
   following claim. Someone might concede that Christian belief could in
   principle be warranted in the way the model suggests; she might go on
   to insist, however, that in fact there are various defeaters for the
   warrant Christian belief might otherwise enjoy. A defeater for a belief
   A is another belief B such that once you come to accept B, you can no
   longer continue to accept A without falling into irrationality. In the
   present case, then, these alleged defeaters would be beliefs a
   knowledgeable Christian can be expected to have; they would also be
   beliefs such that one who accepts them cannot rationally continue in
   firmly accepting Christian belief. After exploring the nature of
   defeaters, I examine the chief candidates: first, the alleged abrasive
   results of historical biblical criticism; second, a recognition of the
   variety and importance of religions incompatible with Christian belief,
   together with certain related postmodern claims; and third, a deep
   recognition of the facts of suffering and evil. I argue that none of
   these succeeds as a defeater for classical Christian belief.

   This book can be thought of in at least two quite different ways. On
   the one hand, it is an exercise in apologetics and philosophy of
   religion, an attempt to demonstrate the failure of a range of
   objections to Christian belief. De jure objections, so the argument
   goes, are either obviously implausible, like those based on the claim
   that Christian belief is not or cannot be justified, or else they
   presuppose that Christian belief is not true, as with those based on
   the claim that Christian belief lacks external rationality or lacks
   warrant. Hence there aren't any decent de jure objections that do not
   depend on de facto objections. Everything really depends on the truth
   of Christian belief; but that refutes the common suggestion that
   Christian belief, whether true or not, is intellectually unacceptable.

   On the other hand, however, the book is an exercise in Christian
   philosophy: in the effort to consider and answer philosophical
   questions--the sorts of questions philosophers ask and answer--from a
   Christian perspective. What I claim for the extended A/C model of
   chapters 8 and 9 is twofold: first, it shows that and how Christian
   belief can perfectly well have warrant, thus refuting a range of de
   jure objections to Christian belief. But I also claim that the model
   provides a good way for Christians to think about the epistemology of
   Christian belief, in particular the question whether and how Christian
   belief has warrant. So there are two projects, or two arguments, going
   on simultaneously. The first is addressed to everyone, believer and
   nonbeliever alike; it is intended as a contribution to an ongoing
   public discussion of the epistemology of Christian belief; it does not
   appeal to specifically Christian premises or presuppositions. I shall
   argue that, from this public point of view, there isn't the faintest
   reason to think that Christian belief lacks justification, rationality,
   or warrant--at least no reason that does not presuppose the falsehood
   of Christian belief. The other project, however--the project of
   proposing an epistemological account of Christian belief from a
   Christian perspective--will be of special interest to Christians. Here
   the project is that of starting from an assumption of the truth of
   Christian belief and from that standpoint investigating its
   epistemology, asking whether and how such belief has warrant. We might
   think of this project as a mirror image of the philosophical
   naturalist's project, when he or she assumes the truth of naturalism
   and then tries to develop an epistemology that fits well with that
   naturalistic standpoint.

   I hope Christians will find this second project appealing; I hope
   others as well may be interested--just as those who don't accept
   philosophical naturalism might nevertheless be interested to see what
   kind of epistemology would best go with naturalism. The centerpiece of
   each of the two projects--the apologetic project and the project in
   Christian philosophy--is the extended A/C model. Taken the first way,
   that model is a defense of the idea that Christian belief has warrant
   and an effort to show that if Christian belief is true, then (very
   likely) it does have warrant; taken the second, it is a recommendation
   as to how Christians can profitably understand and conceive of the
   warrant they take Christian belief to have.

   The reader is owed an apology for the inordinate length of this book.
   All I can say by way of self-exculpation is that its length is due to a
   determination not to commit a tetralogy: a trilogy is perhaps unduly
   self-indulgent, but a tetralogy is unforgivable. (I suppose a cynic
   might question the difference between a tetralogy and a trilogy, the
   last member of which is twice as long as the preceding members.) In any
   event, not every reader need read every page. For example, those
   readers who are not tempted to think that our concepts could not apply
   to God can safely skip part I, and those readers who want to read only
   the central part of the story line can confine themselves to chapters 6
   through 9. Furthermore, even though the book is long, I am aware that
   it covers a shameful amount of ground, and that in nearly every chapter
   (but in particular chapters 8 and 12) a really proper job would go into
   considerably more detail. My excuse is that it is important to see the
   forest as well as the trees; God may be in the details, but God is also
   in the whole sweeping vista of the epistemology of Christian belief.

   Trained observers may note two styles of print: large and small. The
   main argument of the book goes on in the large print; the small print
   adds further analysis, argument, or other points the specialist may
   find of interest. This book is not written mainly for the specialist in
   philosophy. I hope and intend that it will be intelligible and useful
   to, for example, students who have taken a course in philosophy or
   apologetics, as well as the fabled general reader with an interest in
   its subject. Although it is the third member of a trilogy, the book is
   designed to be relatively independent of Warrant: The Current Debate
   and Warrant and Proper Function (and it therefore sometimes contains
   brief accounts of what goes on in them).

   Most books, of course, are to one degree or another cooperative
   enterprises; every author is heavily indebted to others in a thousand
   profound ways. (This is, if anything, especially evident in those
   authors--one thinks of a long line of modern and contemporary
   philosophers, beginning perhaps with Descartes--who apparently believe
   that they have jettisoned all that has already been thought and
   written, starting the whole subject anew.) The present book is no
   exception; it is very much a cooperative enterprise. This is so for the
   usual reasons, but also for a special reason. At several junctures, I
   have simply appealed to the work of others--most often William P.
   Alston and Nicholas Wolterstorff--for a particular building block of
   the argument. This is especially so when I have little or nothing to
   add to what they have already said on the topic in question, but
   sometimes also when I might myself have a mildly different slant on the
   topic in question.

   The book is also something of a cooperative enterprise by virtue of the
   advice, instruction, and criticism I have received from others--an
   embarrassingly large number of others (I am entirely sensible of the
   fact that with so much help, I should have done better). I'm grateful
   to all those who helped me with the first two volumes and also to
   Jonathan Kvanvig and the authors of the essays in his Warrant in
   Contemporary Epistemology: Essays in Honor of Plantinga's Theory of
   Knowledge. Among those to whom I am particularly grateful for help with
   this third volume are Karl Ameriks, Jim Beilby (who also kindly
   prepared the index), David Burrell, Kelly Clark, John Cooper, Kevin
   Corcoran, Andrew Cortens, Fred Crosson, Paul Draper, Steve Evans,
   Ronald Feenstra, Fred Freddoso, Richard Gale, Lee Hardy, John Hare, Van
   Harvey, David Hunt, Hugh McCann, Greg Mellema, Ric Otte, Neal
   Plantinga, Bill Prior, Tapio Puolimatka, Philip Quinn, Del Ratzsch, Dan
   Rieger, Robert Roberts, Bill Rowe, John Sanders, Henry Schuurman, James
   Sennett, Ernie Sosa, Michael Sudduth, Richard Swinburne, Bill Talbott,
   James VanderKam, Bas van Fraassen, Calvin Van Reken, Rene van
   Woudenberg, Steve Wykstra, and Henry Zwaanstra. (I've undoubtedly
   omitted people who belong on this list; to them, I express both my
   gratitude and my apologies.) William Alston, Dewey Hoitenga, Eleonore
   Stump, and Nicholas Wolterstorff read and commented on the entire
   manuscript; to them, I am especially grateful. One of my most
   significant debts is to a rotating cadre of Notre Dame graduate
   students who, as a group and over a period of several years, read the
   entire manuscript and submitted it to the sort of searching and
   detailed criticism that only aroused and contentious graduate students
   can muster. This group includes, among others, Mike Bergmann, Tom
   Crisp, Pat Kain, Andy Koehl, Kevin Meeker, Trenton Merricks, Marie
   Pannier, Mike Rea, Ray Van Arragon and David VanderLaan. I am similarly
   indebted to Nicholas Wolterstorff's fall 1997 graduate seminar at Yale
   (especially Andrews Chignell and Dole), who (with their mentor) read
   the manuscript and provided illuminating and valuable comments. And
   once again I thank Martha Detlefsen, whose valiant efforts to keep me
   and this manuscript properly organized have been ingenious and
   untiring.

   These three volumes began life as Gifford Lectures at the University of
   Aberdeen in 1986 and 1987 and Wilde Lectures at Oxford in 1988. I am
   grateful to both sets of electors; I am equally grateful for the
   hospitality my wife and I enjoyed while visiting Aberdeen and Oxford.
   Thanks are also due to the University of Notre Dame for a sabbatical in
   1995 and 1996 and to the National Endowment for the Humanities for a
   fellowship that same year. A couple of bits of this volume have already
   seen the light of publication: chapter 13 contains a few pages from
   "Pluralism: A Defense of Religious Exclusivism" in The Rationality of
   Belief and the Plurality of Faith, ed. Thomas Senor (Ithaca: Cornell
   University Press, 1995), and chapter 14 contains a few paragraphs from
   "On Being Evidentially Challenged," in The Evidential Argument from
   Evil, ed. Daniel Howard-Snyder (Bloomington: Indiana University Press,
   1996).

   Finally, I make special mention of William P. Alston. Bill was my
   teacher when I began graduate school in 1954 (if I wasn't able to
   understand Alfred Whitehead's Process and Reality, the subject of that
   first seminar, the fault was mine [or maybe Whitehead's], not Bill's.)
   I learned much from him then and much more from him since. His
   generosity in reading this entire manuscript was characteristic; so was
   the trenchancy and penetration of his comments. Alston's contributions
   to contemporary philosophy and philosophy of religion (his leadership
   in establishing the Society of Christian Philosophers and the journal
   Faith and Philosophy, his splendid works in epistemology and philosophy
   of religion) are, of course, well and widely known; there is no need to
   enumerate them here (and in any case they are nearly indenumerable). It
   is to him that I dedicate this book.

  I. The Problem

   Our interest, in this book, is the de jure question: [4] is it
   rational, reasonable, justifiable, warranted to accept Christian
   belief--Christian belief as outlined in the preface? Or is there
   something epistemically unacceptable in so doing, something foolish, or
   silly, or foolhardy, or stupid, or unjustified, or unreasonable, or in
   some other way epistemically deplorable? But there is a prior question:
   is the very idea of Christian belief coherent? Can there really be such
   a thing as Christian belief? Well, why should that be a question? Isn't
   it obvious that many people hold just those beliefs mentioned in the
   preface? Here is the problem. To accept Christian belief, I say, is to
   believe that there is an all-powerful, all-knowing, wholly good person
   (a person without a body) who has created us and our world, who loves
   us and was willing to send his son into the world to undergo suffering,
   humiliation, and death in order to redeem us. It is also to believe, of
   course, that no more than one being has these properties. And Christian
   belief involves not only that there is such a being but also that we
   are able to address him in prayer, refer to him, think and talk about
   him, and predicate properties of him. We have some kind of cognitive
   access to and grasp of him. We can refer to him, for example, as the
   all-powerful, all-knowing person who has created and upholds the world,
   and we can predicate of him such properties as being all-powerful,
   being all-knowing, and having created the world. We can use a definite
   description like this to refer to this being, to pick him out, to
   single him out for thought; and we can give a proper name to the being
   thus singled out. For example, we can use the term God' as his name.

   Accordingly, Christians ordinarily take it for granted that it is
   possible to refer to God by such descriptions as the all-powerful,
   all-knowing creator of the universe', and possible, furthermore, to
   predicate properties (wisdom, goodness) of the being thus referred to.
   Of course, such a description succeeds in actually naming something
   only if there really is a being who is all-powerful and all-knowing and
   created the universe. Furthermore, it must be possible, if I can think
   about God and predicate properties of him, not only that there be such
   a being but also that my concepts apply to it. If not, then I am not in
   a position to assert or believe or even entertain any of the
   propositions mentioned above, if indeed there are any such
   propositions.

   Now Christians also take it for granted that God is infinite,
   transcendent, and ultimate (however, precisely, we gloss those terms).
   And just here is the alleged problem. It seems many theologians and
   others believe that there is real difficulty with the idea that our
   concepts could apply to God--that is, could apply to a being with the
   properties of being infinite, transcendent, and ultimate. The idea is
   that if there is such a being, we couldn't speak about it, couldn't
   think and talk about it, couldn't ascribe properties to it. If that is
   true, however, then, strictly speaking, Christian belief, at least as
   the Christian understands it, is impossible. For Christians believe
   that there is an infinite, transcendent, ultimate being about whom they
   hold beliefs; but if our concepts cannot apply to a being of that sort,
   then there cannot be beliefs about a being of that sort. This idea
   often sees the light of publication; it is even more heavily present in
   the oral tradition. In the spirit of interdisciplinary ecumenism,
   therefore, I want to begin by looking into this question.

   Consider, for example, the theologian Gordon Kaufman:

   The central problem of theological discourse, not shared with any other
   "language game" is the meaning of the term "God." "God" raises special
   problems of meaning because it is a noun which by definition refers to
   a reality transcendent of, and thus not locatable within, experience.
   [5]

   In particular, it seems to be widely accepted, among theologians, that
   Kant showed that reference to or thought about such a being (even if
   there is one) is impossible or at least deeply problematic, [6] or at
   any rate much more problematic than the idea that we can refer to and
   think about ourselves and other people, trees and mountains, planets
   and stars, and so on. Those theologians who think or suspect Kant
   showed this do not ordinarily develop the point in detail; [7] they
   ordinarily content themselves with a ritual bow in his direction. They
   do not explain how they think these things were shown or what the
   arguments establishing them are; perhaps they think (quite properly)
   that that is the job of philosophers. Some of these theologians then go
   on to suggest that language ostensibly about a transcendent God isn't
   what it looks like at all; it really serves some quite different
   purpose. Alternatively, perhaps, it really serves no useful purpose as
   it stands; what we have to do is find a useful purpose for it to serve.
   Perhaps it can be used, somehow, to further or promote human
   flourishing and humaneness, [8] or religious tolerance, [9] or
   liberating praxis, or the rights of women, [10] or the fight against
   oppression.

   But what is important for my present purposes is not an exploration of
   the ways in which religious language might be reconstrued or
   restructured, once we see (as we think) that it cannot function the way
   ordinary believers think it does; I want, instead, to examine the prior
   claim that, indeed, it cannot function as ordinary believers assume it
   does. Is there really something especially problematic about referring
   to or thinking about God? Did Kant show that if there were such a
   person as God, we couldn't refer to or think about him? Or if show' is
   too strong a word, did he give us powerful or even decent reason to
   believe that our concepts couldn't apply to God, if there is such a
   being? Or if he didn't do that, do some of his contemporary
   followers--Gordon Kaufman, for example, or John Hick--give us a reason
   to think this is indeed true? And is the claim in question--that our
   concepts do not apply to God--a coherent one? (Or rather, is there a
   coherent claim somewhere in the nearby bushes, since clearly there are
   several different claims lurking in these bushes?)

   Initially, the answer seems to be no; one who makes the claim seems to
   set up a certain subject for predication--God--and then declare that
   our concepts do not apply to this being. But if this is so, then,
   presumably, at least one of our concepts--being such that our concepts
   don't apply to it--does apply to this being. Either those who attempt
   to make this claim succeed in making an assertion or not. If they don't
   succeed, we have nothing to consider; if they do, however, they appear
   to be predicating a property of a being they have referred to, in which
   case at least some of our concepts do apply to it, contrary to the
   claim they make. So if they succeed in making a claim, they make a
   false claim.

   Note how difficult it is, initially, to state the claim in question,
   the claim that if there is a being with the properties Christians
   ascribe to God, our concepts would not apply to that being. Consider
   the proposition

   (1) If there were an infinite, transcendent, and ultimate being, our
   concepts could not apply to it.

   But now suppose (1) were true. The idea, one takes it, is that we do
   have at least some grasp of the properties of being infinite,
   transcendent, and ultimate (else we shouldn't be able to understand the
   sentence or grasp the proposition it expresses). An infinite being, we
   might say, is an unlimited being--unlimited, that is, with respect to
   certain properties. Among these properties might be power, knowledge,
   goodness, love, and the like. (A being is unlimited with respect to
   power and (propositional) knowledge, for example, if there is a maximal
   degree of power and knowledge, and the being in question enjoys that
   maximal degree of those properties. It might be hard to say precisely
   what the maximal degree of these properties is; with respect to
   knowledge, we might begin by saying that a being displays that maximal
   degree if it knows all true propositions and believes no false
   proposition.) Perhaps we can also give an explanation of what it is for
   a being to be transcendent: such a being transcends the created
   universe; and a being transcends the created universe if it is not
   identical with any being in that universe (if it is not created) and if
   it depends on nothing at all for its existence. So we do have the ideas
   of transcendence and being infinite (and if not, then (1) makes no
   sense). And the idea behind (1) is that if there is such a being (i.e.,
   if there is an infinite and transcendent being), then none of our
   concepts could apply to it. In particular, then, the concepts being
   infinite and being transcendent could not apply to it. But how could
   that be? How could it be that there is a being that is infinite and
   transcendent (i.e., falls under our concepts infinity and
   transcendence) but is nevertheless such that the concepts infinity and
   transcendence do not apply to it? Is the idea, perhaps, that these
   concepts are impossible, incoherent, like the concept of a round
   square, a concept such that we can just see a priori that it couldn't
   apply to anything, that there couldn't be a thing to which it applied?
   [11] That would make (1) trivially true, at least if a conditional with
   an impossible antecedent is thereby true. Of course, it would also make
   (1*) true:

   (1*) If there were an all-powerful, all-knowing being, our concepts
   would apply to it.

   So presumably that is not the idea here. What, then, is the idea? I
   think the best we can do in trying to state such a view coherently is
   to say with John Hick (see below, pp. 47ff.) that there is a being to
   which none of our positive, nonformal concepts apply (a being that has
   none of the positive, nonformal properties of which we have concepts)
   and that this being, somehow, is the one with which Christians and
   others are in touch in religious practice. This is perhaps the best we
   can do; I shall argue below (pp. 59ff.), however, that it isn't good
   enough; it suffers from serious, indeed fatal difficulties.

   So the suggestion is that Kant showed us, somehow, that there are real,
   perhaps insurmountable problems in the idea that there is a being like
   that acknowledged in traditional Christianity, to whom we can refer and
   to whom our concepts apply. This is a question of considerable import
   for our present project, for if this suggestion is right, then there
   really isn't any such question as the one I say I propose to discuss;
   then, the sentences Christians use to express (as they think) their
   beliefs, do not really express the kinds of propositions or thoughts
   Christians think they express. Indeed, perhaps, they don't express any
   propositions or thoughts at all but are a sort of disguised nonsense:
   they look as if they express propositions but in fact do not.

   Before we explicitly turn to Kant, however, it is worth reminding
   ourselves that the claim in question is by no means a new claim in the
   present historical context. Beginning in the 1930s, the logical
   positivists were fond of insisting that the sentences Christians
   typically use--God loves us' or The universe was created by God' or God
   was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself'--do not, as they are
   ordinarily used, say anything at all; they express no propositions at
   all; they are really disguised nonsense. [12] They look like they say
   something, and Christians and others think they say something; in fact,
   however, they altogether fail to express a proposition, just as does an
   obvious nonsense sentence like "'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves /
   did gyre and gimbol in the wabe." The positivists appealed to the
   dreaded "Verifiability Criterion of Meaning," according to which a
   sentence makes sense, is literally significant, or is cognitively
   meaningful only if it is empirically verifiable' (or falsifiable)--only
   if, that is, its truth (or falsehood) can be established by something
   like the methods of natural and empirical science. Beginning in the
   1940s or so, the main questions asked and answered by philosophers of
   religion in the English-speaking world were whether it is possible to
   refer to God at all and whether the sentences typically uttered by
   Christians and other believers in God really make sense or are,
   instead, nonsense, cognitively insignificant. [13] Of course it doesn't
   follow that such meaningless sentences are altogether useless; perhaps
   they serve some other function. Rudolf Carnap, for example, wondered
   whether the meaningless sentences of metaphysics and theology might not
   really be a form of music. [14] (It isn't known whether he expected
   them to supplant Mozart and Bach, or even Wagner. I myself doubt that
   metaphysics will ever replace Mozart, but perhaps we could see it as a
   peculiarly avant-garde form of rock.)

   By now, logical positivism has retreated into the obscurity it so
   richly deserves. [15] There still persists, however, the widespread
   impression that reference to God is problematic; it is time to turn
   explicitly to Kant, the main source of this idea. Does his work offer
   cause for concern to those who propose to think about, refer to, pray
   to, or worship a being described the way Christians describe God--as a
   personal being who is transcendent and infinite?

   [6] The whole medieval tradition of negative theology also finds
   reference to God problematic. The difference is that the medievals took
   it for granted that, of course, we can refer to God; the problem is to
   explain just how this can be accomplished. For the contemporaries I am
   thinking of, however, the difficulties (whether apparent or real) lead
   them to doubt that we can, in fact, refer to and talk about a being
   that is ultimate and transcendent.

   [7] As we shall see in chapter 2, however, John Hick constitutes an
   exception.

   [11] Thus some philosophers have claimed that the notion of omnipotence
   is incoherent; others have paid the same compliment to the notion of
   omniscience (see Patrick Grim and Alvin Plantinga, "Truth, Omniscience,
   and Cantorian Arguments: An Exchange," Philosophical Studies 70 [August
   1993]); still others have argued the same point with respect to the
   idea that God is a person without a body.

   and Alasdair MacIntyre (London: SCM Press, 1955).

   [14] Perhaps metaphysics can have other aesthetic functions as well, as
   can Carnap's own work. Although, as far as I know, no one has ever used
   Carnap's writings as music (or even set them to music), in 1976 the
   Museum of Modern Art in Oxford displayed a page of Carnap's Logical
   Syntax of Language magnified about 20x and posted on the wall. No doubt
   a piece of metaphysics could serve the same purpose.

   Criterion, see Carl Hempel, "Problems and Changes in the Empiricist
   Criterion of Meaning," in Semantics and the Philosophy of Language, ed.

   and Other Minds (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), chapter 7.
   Something like it lingers on, not only among some theologians who
   propose to reconstrue religious language in such a way that it no
   longer refers to God but also in the Wittgensteinian fideism of D. Z.
   Phillips and others, which is a sort of continuation of positivism by
   other means. Although some of this work is eminently worth discussing,
   I will not discuss it here, referring the reader instead to Nicholas
   Wolterstorff's perceptive "Philosophy of Religion after Foundationalism
   I: Wittgensteinian Fideism" (presently unpublished), to which I have
   little to add.

  II. KANT

   Immanuel Kant was a virtual titan of philosophy, with an absolutely
   enormous influence upon subsequent philosophy and theology. This is no
   doubt due to his great insight and raw philosophical power; it is
   perhaps also due to the grave hermeneutical difficulties that attend
   study of his work. The British philosopher David Hume writes with a
   certain surface clarity that disappointingly disappears on closer
   inspection. With Kant, there is good news and bad news: the good news
   is that we don't suffer that disappointment; the bad news is that it's
   because there isn't any surface clarity to begin with. We can't turn to
   a settled interpretation of Kant to see whether he showed or even held
   that our concepts don't apply to God; there is no settled
   interpretation.

   The first thing to note, however, is that Kant often writes as if we
   can perfectly well refer to God. In the Critique of Practical Reason
   and elsewhere (Religion within the Boundary of Pure Reason; Lectures on
   Philosophical Theology), Kant regularly seems to refer to God and
   clearly takes himself to be doing exactly that. Even in the Critique of
   Pure Reason, his work most heavily influential in this skeptical
   direction, Kant often seems to suggest that we can indeed refer to and
   think about God. He often seems to suggest that the problem is not that
   we can't think about God but that we can't come to speculative or
   metaphysical knowledge of God. His aim in this Critique, he says, is to
   curb knowledge in order to make room for faith. [16] The faith in
   question, presumably, is like that expressed in the Critique of
   Practical Reason and elsewhere; it would certainly involve referring to
   God and taking his existence and attributes as a postulate of practical
   reason, a presupposition of the reality and seriousness of the moral
   life. Indeed, some who understand him this way believe that Kant was
   himself a theist, holding that the things in themselves are just things
   as they appear to God, that is, things as they really are. [17] Of
   course if this way of thinking about Kant is correct, then on his view
   it is perfectly possible to refer to God; if that is possible, it is
   also possible to ascribe properties and attributes to him; and if that
   is possible, then our concepts do, indeed, apply to him. For example,
   the negative concepts not being in space and time and not being
   dependent on human beings for his existence would thus apply to him.
   Further, on this understanding of Kant, such positive concepts as
   having knowledge and having power would apply to God, as would having
   created the world. On this understanding, it would be an error to
   suppose that Kant showed that our concepts can't apply to God--unless
   one were prepared to hold that Kant showed this but failed to notice
   that he did, thus mistakenly taking himself to be referring to that to
   which he himself showed it was not possible to refer. This latter is,
   of course, a possibility, although it would require an unusually high
   level of absentmindedness.

   Still, the idea that according to Kant our concepts couldn't apply to
   God is no mere fabrication, no merely thoughtless misunderstanding--or,
   more exactly, if it is a misunderstanding, it is one with considerable
   basis in the Kantian text. There is much in the Critique of Pure Reason
   to suggest this or something like it; at any rate, there is much to
   suggest that the categories of the understanding, which are concepts of
   the first importance, do not apply to the things in themselves (and
   thus not to God). For example:

   If, therefore, we should attempt to apply the categories to objects
   which are not viewed as being appearances, we should have to postulate
   an intuition other than the sensible, and the object would thus be a
   noumenon in the positive sense. Since, however, such a type of
   intuition, intellectual intuition, forms no part whatsoever of our
   faculty of knowledge, it follows that the employment of the categories
   can never extend further than to the objects of experience. (A353,
   B309, Kant's emphasis)

   Here and elsewhere, Kant suggests that the categories of the
   understanding do not apply beyond the realm of appearance, the world of
   phenomena. ("Suggests," I say; these passages, like all the others,
   contain more than a hint of possible ambiguity.) But if those
   categories do not apply to the noumena, the Dinge an sich, then perhaps
   the same goes for the rest of our concepts. And if our concepts do not
   apply beyond the world of experience, the world of appearance, then
   they do not apply to God, who, of course, would be a noumenon in
   excelsis. So the claim would be that Kant shows or believes (at any
   rate in the Critique of Pure Reason) that our concepts do not apply to
   God, in which case we cannot refer to or think about him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Two Worlds or One?

   What is to be said for this understanding of Kant? Hermeneutical
   obstacles of formidable proportions loom. First, how are we to think
   about this distinction between the noumena and the phenomena, the
   things in themselves and the things for us? Unfortunately, the
   commentators are not of one mind. There is a huge interpretative
   watershed, a continental divide, between two fundamentally different
   interpretations or basic pictures of what Kant had in mind, each with
   several variations when it comes to detail. According to the first and
   more traditional picture, Kant held that there are two realms of
   objects, two fundamentally different kinds of things. These are the
   phenomena, on the one hand, and the noumena, on the other; the things
   in themselves and the things fÃ¼r uns. (These two distinctions don't
   exactly coincide in Kant; the ways in which they don't aren't relevant
   to our present inquiry.) On the one hand, on this picture, there are
   tables and chairs, horses and cows, stars and planets, the oak tree in
   your backyard, just as we ordinarily think. These things really exist
   and are really there. They are phenomenally real, real parts of the
   world of experience. But they are also transcendentally ideal: that is,
   they are not part of the world as it is independent of human
   experience. On the other hand, there are the noumena, which are
   transcendentally real. These are the things as they are in themselves;
   they do not depend for their existence or character upon human beings
   or human experience. These two realms are disjoint: none of the
   phenomenal objects is a noumenon, and none of the noumenal objects is a
   phenomenon. Here are a couple of passages supporting this
   interpretation:

   Now we must bear in mind that the concept of appearances, as limited by
   the Transcendental Aesthetic, already of itself establishes the
   objective reality of noumena and justifies the division of objects into
   phaenomena and noumena and so of the world into a world of the sense
   and a world of the understanding (mundus sensibilis et intelligibilis)
   and indeed in such manner that the distinction does not refer merely to
   the logical form of our knowledge of one and the same thing, according
   as it is indistinct or distinct, but to the difference in the manner in
   which the two worlds can be first given to our knowledge, and in
   conformity with this difference, to the manner in which they are in
   themselves generically distinct from one another. (A249, Kant's
   emphasis)

   Appearances are the sole objects which can be given to us immediately,
   and that in them which relates immediately to the object is called
   intuition. Appearances are not things in themselves; they are only
   representations, which in turn have their object--an object which
   cannot be intuited by us, and which may, therefore, be named the
   non-empirical, that is, transcendental object = x. (A109)

   These phenomena are objects, objects that exist in space and time. The
   noumena, by contrast, are neither temporal nor spatial; space and time
   are forms of our intuition rather than realities that characterize the
   things in themselves. Noumena and phenomena, therefore, are distinct.

   Still further, we have experience only of the phenomena, not of the
   noumena:

   We have sufficiently proved in the Transcendental Aesthetic that
   everything intuited in space or time, and therefore all objects of any
   experience possible to us, are nothing but appearances, that is, mere
   representations,

   Further still, the phenomena, the world of stars and planets, trees and
   animals, depends on us for existence. The above passage continues:

   which in the manner in which they are represented, as extended beings,
   or as series of alternations have no independent existence outside our
   thoughts. (A491, B519)

   Elsewhere:

   That nature should direct itself according to our subject ground of
   apperception, and should indeed depend upon it in respect of its
   conformity to law, sounds very strange and absurd. But when we consider
   that this nature is not a thing in itself but is merely an aggregate of
   appearances, so many representations of the mind, . . . (A114)

   Now to assert in this manner, that all these appearances, and
   consequently all objects with which we can occupy ourselves, are one
   and all in me, that is are determinations of my identical self, is only
   another way of saying that there must be a complete unity of them in
   one and the same apperception. (A129)

   This is the more traditional way of understanding Kant, the way Kant
   was taken by his great successors. To put it briefly and all too
   baldly, there are two realms of objects; our experience is only of one
   realm, the realm of phenomena, which themselves depend on us for their
   existence; if we should go out of existence, so would they. That is
   because the phenomenal realm is somehow constructed by us out of the
   given, the data, the raw material of experience. The noumenal realm,
   however, is not thus dependent on us but is also such that we have no
   intuition, no direct experience of it. Finally, there is nevertheless a
   connection between the two worlds in that something like a causal
   transaction between the noumena and the transcendental ego (itself a
   noumenon) produces in us the given out of which we construct the
   phenomenal world.

   Call the above the two-world picture; this has been the dominant
   interpretation. There has always been another basic interpretation of
   Kant, however, one that more recently has perhaps achieved majority
   status. According to this other picture, there really aren't two worlds
   after all, a world of phenomena and underlying it another world of
   noumena. There is only one world and only one kind of object, but there
   are (at least) two ways of thinking about or considering this one
   world. All objects are really noumenal objects, and talk about the
   phenomena is just a picturesque way of talking about how the noumena,
   the only things there are, appear to us. The phenomena-noumena
   distinction is not between two kinds of objects but, rather, between
   how the things are in themselves and how they appear to us.

   So, for example, Graham Bird:

   Such phrases [e.g., transcendental objects and empirical objects']
   should be understood to refer not to two different kinds of entity, but
   instead to two different ways of talking about one and the same thing.
   [18]

   And Michael Devitt:

   It is tempting to equate an appearance with the foundationalist's sense
   datum, taking the thing-in-itself as the unknowable external cause of
   this mental entity. Kant's writing often encourages this temptation.
   Nevertheless, scholars seem generally agreed--and have convinced
   me--that this two-worlds interpretation is wrong. What Kant intends is
   the following influential, but rather mysterious, one world view.

   An Appearance is not a mental sense datum, but an external object as we
   know it. In contrast the thing-in-itself is the object independent of
   our knowledge of it; it is not a second object, and does not, indeed
   could not, cause an appearance. . . . [19]

   Although this second picture is perhaps now the majority opinion, it
   seems a bit difficult to reconcile it with Kant's own view that his
   thought constituted a revolution--his famous second Copernican
   revolution. [20] After all, much of this second picture would be
   accepted even by such staunch prerevolutionaries as Aristotle and
   Aquinas. Both would agree that there is or can be a difference between
   the world (or any less impressive object) as it is in itself and the
   world as it appears to us; this is to admit no more than that we can be
   mistaken about the world or things in the world, and of course
   Aristotle and Aquinas would hardly deny that. Both would agree to
   something much stronger: that the world might have many properties of
   which we have no conception, so that our way of thinking about the
   world, the properties we ascribe to it, are not necessarily all and
   only the properties it has. For Aquinas or any other theist, this would
   be close to a truism: God, obviously enough, has many properties we
   don't know about, and presumably many of which we could not so much as
   form a conception. The essential elements of the one-world view seem
   perhaps a bit too uncontroversial, at least with respect to Kant's
   predecessors, to constitute a revolution, Copernican or otherwise.

   According to Merold Westphal:

   Finally, all twelve categories insofar as they constitute the world of
   human experience and are not merely formal features of judgment, are
   schematized with an essential reference to time. Thus the object and
   property that would disappear from the world in the absence of human
   knowers are not object and property per se, but substance and accident
   as defined by human temporality. Similarly, the truth and falsity that
   would disappear derive from the categories of reality and negation as
   essentially linked to our experience of time. Thus we are back to the
   tautology that in the absence of human cognition the world as
   apprehended by human minds would disappear. [21]

   That does, indeed, seem to be a tautology, or at least a trivially
   necessary truth; we could add that in the absence of bovine cognition,
   the world as apprehended by bovine minds would disappear. But how could
   Kant think of this as constituting a revolution, one according to which
   objects must conform to our minds (rather than, as previously thought,
   our minds to objects) if we are to have knowledge? Could a tautology
   constitute a revolution?

      1. The One-World Picture and Reference to the Noumena

   Our main interest here does not lie in trying to resolve the question
   of what Kant intended: that is perhaps necessarily beyond our powers.
   Instead, we are looking to see if there is good reason, either given by
   Kant or constructible from materials given by him, for the conclusion
   that our concepts do not apply to God. And how does the difference
   between these two interpretations of Kant bear on this question?
   Consider the second picture first, and note that on this picture, if
   our concepts apply to anything, they apply to the Dinge, those being
   the only things there are. Similarly, if we manage to refer to and
   think about anything at all, we succeed in referring to and thinking
   about the Dinge, because they are all that there is. So how could it be
   that the categories and our other concepts do not apply to them?

   Well, what is it for a concept to apply to something, for something to
   fall under a concept? Consider the concept being wise. That concept
   applies to something (a thing falls under that concept) only if that
   thing is wise, only if, that is, it has the property of being wise.
   Properties and concepts are thus correlative. I have the concept being
   wise only if I grasp, apprehend, understand the property being wise. I
   have the concept being a prime number if and only if I grasp or
   apprehend the property being a prime number. For each property or
   attribute of which I have a grasp, I have a concept. Of course there
   are properties of which I have no concept. Small children often lack
   the concept of being a philosopher; that is to say, they have no grasp
   of the property being a philosopher. Large philosophers often lack the
   concept of being a quark; that is to say, they have no grasp of the
   property being a quark. No doubt there are properties none of us human
   beings grasps.

   One further familiar fact about properties and concepts: they have
   negations or complements. There is the property being red; there is
   also its complement, which, naturally enough, is being unred, not being
   red. There is the property of being wise but also the property of being
   unwise, failing to be wise. So if one of my concepts (e.g., being wise)
   does not apply to a thing, then the complement of that concept (being
   nonwise, not being wise) does apply to it.

   Perhaps you want to point out that this way of putting the matter
   presupposes that there are negative properties, such properties as
   being nonred, being unwise, and the like; you might object that in fact
   there are only positive properties, not negative ones. (You might also
   object to disjunctive and conjunctive properties.) This is no place to
   try to settle that issue. Clearly, there is the concept of a thing's
   failing to be wise (I know what it is for a thing not to be wise), even
   if there is no negative property nonwisdom. So if you object to
   negative properties, say that a thing falls under the concept nonwisdom
   just in case it does not fall under the concept wisdom; more generally,
   for any property P, a thing falls under the concept P if and only if it
   has the property P; it falls under the concept not-P if and only if it
   does not fall under the concept P.

   Given this elementary lore about concepts and properties, how could it
   be that the categories and our other concepts do not apply to the
   Dinge? Take the categories first--the category of causality, for
   example. What would it mean to say that this category does not apply to
   the Dinge? So far as I can see, what this would mean is that the
   noumena do not stand in causal relations to each other or anything
   else. Consider the property stands in causal relation to something; if
   the category of causality does not apply to the noumena, then it must
   be that none of them has that property. So our concept standing in
   causal relation to something wouldn't apply to things as they are in
   themselves. It follows, however, that the complement of that category
   or concept would apply to things as they are in themselves: each of
   them would be such that it does not stand in a causal relation to
   anything else. The same would go for our other concepts. On this way of
   thinking of the matter, our positive' concepts, you might say, do not
   apply to things as they are in themselves, which is really to say that
   there is no positive property we grasp that characterizes a thing as it
   is in itself. As it stands, however, this needs more work: there are
   problems about this distinction between positive and negative
   properties. There are also problems of other sorts: what about such
   positive properties as being self-identical, for example? Are we to
   suppose the Dinge are not self-identical?

   Well, perhaps these matters can be straightened out. (See chapter 2, p.
   48.) For present purposes, what we need to see is that on this way of
   thinking, it would not really be the case that our concepts fail to
   apply to God in such a way that we cannot refer to and think about him.
   What would follow, given that he is a noumenon (of course, in this way
   of thinking, everything is a noumenon), is that God would not have any
   of the positive properties of which we have a grasp. It would not be
   the case that we couldn't refer to God and predicate properties of him:
   we could perfectly well do so, but we would be mistaken if we
   predicated of him a positive property of which we have a grasp. Thus we
   would make a mistake if we said that God is wise, or good, or powerful,
   or loving. That would be because nothing is wise, good, powerful,
   loving, and the like. (On the one-world picture, the Dinge are all
   there is; so if positive properties can't be ascribed to the Dinge,
   they can't be ascribed to anything.) Here there would be nothing at all
   special about God; what holds for him also holds for everything else.
   But those theologians who suggest that Kant showed we cannot refer to
   and think about God presumably believe that Kant showed there was a
   special problem about God; they don't think that what Kant really
   showed is that we can't talk or think about anything. As Kaufman puts
   it in the passage I quoted above (p. 4), "The central problem of
   theological discourse, not shared with any other language game,' is the
   meaning of the term God.'?" So Kant, taken this way, doesn't fill this
   particular bill; it doesn't give us a relevant way of seeing that our
   concepts do not apply to God.

      2. The Two-World Picture and Reference to the Noumena

   Now suppose we consider the other main interpretation of Kant: the
   two-world picture. This is the more traditional way to understand Kant
   and still, perhaps, deserves the nod. (Here I am not interested in
   which picture most accurately represents Kant, but whether Kant, taken
   any plausible way, gives support to the idea that we cannot refer to
   and think about God. [22] ) On this picture, there are two disjoint
   realms: phenomena and noumena, the Dinge and the things of experience.
   To add another quotation:

   Accordingly, that which is in space and time is an appearance; it is
   not anything in itself, but consists merely of representations, which,
   if not given in us--that is to say, in perception--are nowhere to be
   met with. (A494, B522)

   Now when we think about the application of our concepts to the noumena,
   we see that this two-world picture divides into two subpictures.

   (a) The Moderate Subpicture. On the one way of thinking, (some of) our
   concepts apply to the things in themselves; we can think about them and
   refer to them, all right, but we can't have any knowledge of them. When
   we think about them, predicate properties of them, what we have is just
   speculation, mere transcendental schein, and we deceive ourselves if we
   think we have more. Our knowledge doesn't extend beyond experience;
   hence, it does not extend to the realm of the things in themselves.
   This would explain that bewildering variety and proliferation of
   metaphysical views Kant found so shocking. The reason, fundamentally,
   is really that all the metaphysicians have been just guessing, whatever
   their pretensions to apodictic conclusions and conclusive certainty.
   Our reason can't operate in the rarefied atmosphere of the noumena, and
   the result of trying to do so is a mere beating of wings against the
   void.

   Of course Kant also represents his own work in the Critique of Pure
   Reason as knowledge and as certain and conclusive. And in that Critique
   he seems to tell us a fair amount about the Dinge: that they are not in
   space and time, that the world of experience is (in part) a result of a
   causal transaction' [23] between the Dinge and the transcendental ego,
   and that the latter has no intellectual intuition into the former. So
   the picture isn't wholly coherent. Coherent or not, however, this
   picture doesn't even suggest that we cannot think about and predicate
   properties of God. What it suggests, instead, is that when we do, we
   are not on the sure path of knowledge but on some much more hazardous
   climber's trail of mere opinion. So the moderate subpicture, too, gives
   no aid and comfort to the claim that our concepts do not apply to God.

   (b) The Radical Subpicture. There is a more striking version of the
   two-world picture, however, on which we do get the result that we can
   neither refer to God nor predicate properties of him (call it the
   radical subpicture'). On both versions of the two-world picture, the
   appearances are distinct from the things in themselves. The appearances
   are objects; they exist; they are empirically real. But they are also
   transcendentally ideal. And what this means, in part, is that they
   depend for their existence on us (on the transcendental ego[s]) and our
   cognitive activity. We ourselves are both noumena and phenomena: there
   is both a noumenal self and an empirical self. The things in themselves
   somehow impinge on us (taken as transcendental ego), causing experience
   in us; there is a productive interaction between the transcendental ego
   and the Dinge (the other Dinge, since the transcendental ego is itself
   a noumenon), the result of which is experience, the manifold of
   experience.

   As it is initially given to us, this manifold of experience is a
   blooming, buzzing confusion with no structure. Perhaps it contains
   among other things what Kant calls representations' (Vorstellungen);
   these are of more than one kind, but among them might be phenomenal
   qualia, something like sense data, or Humean impressions and ideas. The
   manifold must be worked up' (Kant's term) and synthesized by the
   application of the categories and other concepts. Thus we impose
   structure and form on it, and in so doing we construct the phenomena,
   the appearances. So the phenomena, the things fÃ¼r uns, are constructed
   out of the manifold of experience.

   Well, how do we do a thing like that? How do we construct a phenomenon
   (a horse, let's say) from the manifold of experience? At this point,
   the radical subpicture diverges from the more pedestrian version of the
   two-world picture, for on the radical subpicture, we construct objects
   by applying concepts (representations, Vorstellungen) to the manifold.
   The world of appearance gets constructed by virtue of our synthesizing
   the manifold, which proceeds by way of our applying concepts--both the
   categories and other concepts--to the manifold. We can't perceive or in
   some other way witness this construction; Kant says we are largely
   unconscious of the activity whereby we structure the manifold and
   construct the phenomena. Still, it proceeds by way of the application
   of concepts to the blooming buzzing manifold of experience.

   This would require a way of thinking about concepts and their function
   that is very different from the way of thinking about them I outlined
   above (a way according to which a concept is fundamentally a grasp of a
   property). And Kant suggests a different way of thinking of concepts:
   he sometimes calls them rules. Kant says that the understanding is the
   faculty of concepts; it is the source of our concepts. But he also says
   of the understanding, "We may now characterize it as the faculty of
   rules. . . . Sensibility gives us forms (of intuition) but
   understanding gives us rules" (A126, Kant's emphasis). And he goes on
   to say,

   Rules, so far as they are objective . . . are called laws. Although we
   learn many laws through experience, they are only special
   determinations of still higher laws, and the highest of these, under
   which the others all stand, issue a priori from the understanding
   itself. They are not borrowed from experience; on the contrary, they
   have to confer upon appearances their conformity to law, and so to make
   experience possible. Thus the understanding is something more than a
   power of formulating rules through comparison of appearances; it is
   itself the lawgiver of nature. (A127)

   I don't for a moment pretend that this passage or others that could be
   cited are easy to interpret. Still, the passage does seem to suggest
   that concepts are rules and rules are laws. What sort of rules and what
   sort of laws? Perhaps they are rules for synthesizing the manifold,
   rules for constructing the phenomena. This is the heart of the radical
   subpicture. Again, I don't mean to suggest that this is Kant's view,
   but some of what he says suggests it. (Some of what he says also
   suggests that it is false; that is part of his charm.) For example:
   "What is first given to us is appearance. When combined with
   consciousness, it is called perception. . . . "

   Interpretative difficulties abound; the basic idea, however, is that
   concepts are rules, rules for the synthesis of the manifold and the
   construction of phenomena. (They are also laws, laws whereby the
   phenomena are constructed from the manifold of experience.) These rules
   apply to portions or bits of experience and, by way of their
   application, the phenomena are constructed. A rule of this sort perhaps
   specifies that certain portions of the manifold are to be combined or
   thought together' as an object. So, for example, consider your concept
   of a horse: it instructs you to associate, think together a variety of
   representations, a variety of items of experience, thus unifying that
   bit of the manifold into an empirical object: a horse. It is a rule
   which would say something like: think that particular congeries of
   representations together as a unity.

   Now again, I don't mean to claim that this is a coherent picture or a
   coherent way of thinking about concepts; on the contrary, I believe
   that it is not. But note that if it is coherent, then (at least if all
   of our concepts have this function [24] and only this function) our
   concepts will not apply to the noumena. Consider the concept being a
   horse. Understood this way, this concept is a rule for constructing
   phenomenal objects out of the manifold of experience. Of course it does
   not apply to the noumena: it cannot be used to construct an object out
   of them; they are not given to us (experience, the manifold, is what is
   given to us), and in any event they aren't the sorts of things out of
   which phenomenal objects could be constructed. So it isn't just that
   the concept being a horse does not apply to the Dinge in the sense that
   none of them, as it happens, is a horse (all are nonhorses), for then
   the complement of that concept--being a nonhorse--would apply. But that
   concept doesn't apply either: it, too, is a rule for constructing
   objects from the manifold. It is another way of unifying, synthesizing
   the manifold. So thought of, a concept could no more apply to the Dinge
   than a horse could be a number.

   On the radical subpicture, therefore, our concepts surely wouldn't
   apply to God, if there were such a person. For God would be a noumenon.
   God would not be something we have constructed by applying concepts to
   the manifold of experience (God has created us; we have not constructed
   him.) So, on the radical subpicture, we can't refer to, think about, or
   predicate properties of God.

   This way of thinking clearly displays a deep incoherence: on this
   picture, Kant holds that the Dinge stand in a causal or interactive
   relationship with us, taken as transcendental ego(s); [25] and he also
   says that they are not in space and time. But on the radical
   subpicture, Kant (at least if his intellectual equipment is like that
   of the rest of us) should not be able to refer to the Dinge at all, or
   even speculate that there might be such things. He certainly shouldn't
   be able to refer to them and attribute to them the properties of being
   atemporal and aspatial, or the property of affecting the transcendental
   ego(s), thereby producing experience in them. He shouldn't be able to
   refer to us (i.e., us transcendental egos), claiming that we don't have
   the sort of godlike intellectual intuition into reality that would be
   required if we were to have synthetic a priori knowledge of the world
   as it is in itself. (On this picture, we might say, Kant's thought
   founders on the fact that the picture requires that he have knowledge
   the picture denies him.) If this picture were really correct, the
   noumena would have to drop out altogether, so that all that there is is
   what has been structured or made by us. The idea that there might be
   reality beyond what we ourselves have constructed out of experience
   would not be so much as thinkable. [26]

   [22] Of course, I do not mean to suggest that the one- and two-world
   pictures as I present them are the only possible (or actual)
   interpretations of Kant; clearly, there are various complications and
   extensions of each. What I claim is that none of them offers aid and
   comfort to the claim that our concepts do not apply to God.

   [23] We need the scare quotes because Kant's official view is that the
   concept of causality doesn't apply to the Dinge.

   [24] As Karl Ameriks (private communication) reminded me, Kant's
   metaphysical deduction certainly seems intended to reveal concepts
   which are rules for judgments of any sort, whether limited to items of
   experience or not.

   [25] How many of those transcendental egos are there, anyway? Like many
   questions of Kantian exegesis, this question is vexed. Indeed, on the
   radical subpicture, it is more than vexed. If the category of number
   doesn't apply to the noumena, then there is presumably no number n,
   finite or infinite, such that the right answer to the question "How
   many of those transcendental egos are there?" is n.

   [26] In addition, of course, there is the problem that it takes a great
   deal of effort to believe that we are really responsible for the
   existence of sun, moon, and stars, not to mention dinosaurs and other
   things, that (as we think) existed long before there were any human
   beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Arguments or Reasons?

   Clearly, there are problems of coherence here. Suppose we ignore them
   for the moment: what kinds of reasons does Kant give for the contention
   that we can't think about, refer to, predicate properties of the Dinge?
   Or, if he gives no such reasons (perhaps because he thinks we can think
   about them), what sorts of reasons or arguments does his work suggest
   for that conclusion? This conclusion--that our concepts are really
   rules for synthesizing the manifold into phenomenal objects and that
   the only things we can think about are objects we ourselves have
   somehow constructed--is, to say the least, rather startling. Some
   pretty powerful arguments would be required.

   Argument for this view is distressingly scarce. It is extremely
   difficult to find much that could pass muster as an argument, or even
   as one of those "considerations determining the intellect" John Stuart
   Mill sometimes gave when, as he conceded, he didn't have an argument.
   There is nothing here like the ontological or cosmological arguments
   for the existence of God, or Descartes' argument that a person is not
   identical with her body (but is, instead, an immaterial substance), or
   the argument for the conclusion that propositions, the things we
   believe and assert, are not contingent objects. [27] Perhaps one must
   think of the radical subpicture as a sort of hypothesis proposed as
   best explaining certain phenomena. More likely, those who urge it are
   simply overwhelmed by what they see as its sheer intellectual beauty
   and power; they don't feel the need of argument. Indeed, they find the
   picture so dazzling they are willing to put up with a strong dose of
   incoherence in addition to absence of argument. Well, if you find the
   radical subpicture overwhelmingly attractive, then (incoherence aside)
   I guess you'll have to go with it. Then again, that doesn't constitute
   much of a reason for the rest of us--those of us more impressed by the
   incoherence of the picture than its beauty--to accept it.

   There is, however, a set of Kantian considerations that some might see
   as taking us partway to the conclusion. These are to be found in what
   he says about the antinomies: allegedly powerful arguments on both
   sides of a given question. Thus there is an allegedly compelling
   antinomical argument for the thesis that the world had a beginning in
   time, but an equally compelling argument for the antithesis that it did
   not. In the same way, there are compelling arguments for the theses
   that the world is composed of simples, that there is such a thing as
   agent causation (where an agent cause is a being that freely originates
   a new causal series), and that there is an absolutely necessary being;
   sadly enough, however, there are equally compelling arguments for the
   antitheses that the world is not composed of simples, that there is no
   such thing as agent causation, and that there is no absolutely
   necessary being. Here we seem to be in a nasty fix; we can prove four
   (everything in the Critique comes in fours) important theses, and for
   each of these four, we can also prove its denial.

   Now Kant apparently intends these antinomies to constitute an essential
   part of the argument for his transcendental idealism, the doctrine that
   the things we deal with (stars and planets, trees, animals and other
   people) are transcendentally ideal (depend upon us for their reality
   and structure), even if empirically real. We fall into the problem
   posed by the antinomies, says Kant, only because we take ourselves to
   be thinking about things in themselves as opposed to the things for us,
   noumena as opposed to mere appearances:

   If in employing the principles of understanding we do not merely apply
   our reason to objects of experience, but venture to extend these
   principles beyond the limits of experience, there arise pseudo-rational
   doctrines which can neither hope for confirmation in experience nor
   fear refutation by it. Each of them is not only in itself free from
   contradiction, but finds conditions of its necessity in the very nature
   of reason--only that, unfortunately, the assertion of the opposite has,
   on its side, grounds that are just as valid and necessary. (A421, B449)

   We solve the problem by recognizing our limitations, realizing that we
   can't think, or can't think to any good purpose, about the Dinge.

   In presenting the antinomies, Kant does not explicitly argue for the
   radical subpicture. But suppose we try to find something like an
   argument there, either for the radical subpicture or for the conclusion
   we have been deriving from the radical subpicture, the conclusion that
   our concepts do not apply to the noumena, so that we cannot refer to
   and think about them. Perhaps the premises would be:

   (2) If we are able to think about and refer to the Dinge, then the
   premises of the antinomical arguments (the premises of the arguments
   for the theses and for the antitheses) are about the Dinge and are all
   true,

   and

   (3) If those premises are all true, then the theses and antitheses
   would all be true, so that contradictions would be true.

   Naturally enough, however,

   (4) No contradictions are true.

   Therefore:

   (5) We cannot think about or refer to the Dinge.

   We could perhaps weaken the first premise (2) to make it a bit more
   plausible:

   (2*) If we can refer to and think about the Dinge, then each of the
   premises of the antinomical arguments will be about the Dinge and have
   overwhelming intuitive support.

   (This is weaker, of course, because it says, not that the antinomical
   premises are true, if we can think about the Dinge, but that they
   strongly seem true to us.)

   The second premise would then be:

   (3*) If each of the premises has overwhelming intuitive support, we
   will have overwhelming reason to accept each of the theses and
   antitheses, and we see that each thesis is contradicted by its
   antithesis.

   If, however, we weaken the first premise, we must strengthen one of the
   other two. Perhaps we could strengthen the third as follows:

   (4*) It couldn't be that we should have overwhelming reason to accept a
   proposition p and also its contradictory not-p.

   And the conclusion would be as before.

   Is it really true that (as (4*) claims) we couldn't have overwhelming
   reason to accept both a proposition p and also its denial not-p? [28]
   This would be an interesting inquiry but would take us too far afield;
   in any event, it isn't necessary for our present purposes, for there
   are at least two impressive problems with these arguments, one
   debilitating and the other fatal. I shall briefly outline the first and
   then look into the second in more detail. The first, the debilitating
   objection, is that even if we are not able to think of the noumena, we
   can think of the phenomena; and if the first premises of these
   arguments are true for the noumena, what is to prevent their being true
   for the phenomena as well? The two versions of the first premise ((2)
   and (2*)) of the argument claim the following: if it is true that we
   can think about the noumena, then the antinomical premises are about
   the noumena and either are true or have overwhelming intuitive support.
   Isn't it equally apparent that if we can think about the phenomena,
   then the antinomical premises are about the phenomena and are either
   true or have overwhelming support? If so, however, the argument would
   also prove that we can't refer to the appearances. What it would really
   prove, then, if it proved anything, is that we can't refer to or think
   about either noumena or phenomena. Because noumena and phenomena are
   all the things there are, the conclusion would be that we can't think
   about anything; and that seems a bit strong.

   Much more should be said about this objection to the argument, but I
   want to turn to the fatal objection. That is just that the antinomical
   arguments are not, to put the best face on it, at all compelling. Here
   I will argue this only for the premises of the first antinomy; exactly
   similar comments would apply to the others. In the first antinomy,
   there is an argument for the conclusion that "The world had a beginning
   in time and is also limited as regards space" (A426, B454); this is the
   thesis. There is also an argument for the antithesis: "The world has no
   beginning, and no limits in space; it is infinite as regards both time
   and space" (A426, B454). And the idea (in accordance with premises (2)
   and (2*)) is that if we can think about and refer to the Dinge, then
   both of these would be true or would have overwhelming intuitive
   support.

   Well, what is the argument? I am sorry to say it is hard to take
   seriously. The argument for the thesis goes as follows:

   If we assume that the world had no beginning in time, then up to every
   given moment an eternity has elapsed, and there has passed away in the
   world an infinite series of successive states of things. Now the
   infinity of a series consists in the fact that it can never be
   completed through successive synthesis. It thus follows that it is
   impossible for an infinite world-series to have passed away, and that a
   beginning of the world is therefore a necessary condition of the
   world's existence. (A426, B454)

   This argument proceeds by reductio ad absurdum: show that the denial of
   your conclusion leads to a contradiction, thereby proving your
   conclusion. The first premise is that if the world had no beginning in
   time, then at any point in time an infinite stretch of time would
   already have elapsed. This is dubious because it is at least abstractly
   possible that time and the world began together, some finitely many
   years (or seconds) ago. If so, then we should say that the world didn't
   have a beginning in time, although it did have a beginning with time.
   But let that pass. According to the second premise, "the infinity of a
   series consists in the fact that it can never be completed through
   successive synthesis"; that is, it is characteristic of an infinite
   series that it can't be completed by starting from the beginning (or,
   more generally, some point only finitely far from the beginning) and
   adding things (events, say) one at a time (or more generally, finitely
   many at a time). This is true, provided the things (events) in question
   are added at a constant rate. If you start with the first event (or the
   nth, for some finite n) and add another event every second, you will
   never complete the series: at any subsequent time only a finite number
   of events will have occurred. According to current lore about the
   infinite, however, there is no bar of this kind to completing the
   infinite series in a finite time if the time taken for each event
   diminishes appropriately. For example, the first event takes one second
   to happen; the second event takes half a second; the third a quarter,
   the fourth an eighth of a second, and so on. At that rate, it won't
   take long at all for an infinite number of events to have elapsed--only
   a couple of seconds.

   But the real problem with the argument lies in a different direction.
   Kant points out that an infinite series can't be completed by starting
   from some point finitely far from the beginning and adding members
   finitely many at a time at a constant rate; fair enough. He then
   concludes, "It thus follows that it is impossible for an infinite
   world-series to have passed away, and that a beginning of the world is
   therefore a necessary condition of the world's existence." This doesn't
   follow at all. To claim that it does is to claim just what is to be
   proved: that the series in question had a beginning. The premise tells
   us that if you start from some finite point in a series--that is, some
   point finitely far from the beginning of the series--and add a finite
   number per unit time, then you will never complete the series. Fair
   enough; but if the world has existed for an infinite stretch of time,
   then there was no first moment, no first event, and no beginning either
   to the series of moments or the series of events; more generally, at
   any preceding moment an infinite time would already have elapsed. To
   conclude, as Kant does, that it is impossible that an infinite series
   of events has occurred is just to assume that the series in question
   had a beginning--that is, is finite--but that is precisely what was to
   be proved. So the argument really has no force at all. It is not as if
   it is an argument the premises of which have a certain limited amount
   of intuitive plausibility; it is rather that this transition to the
   conclusion completely begs the question by assuming what was to be
   proved: that the series in question has a beginning. The argument
   therefore fails to establish its conclusion; it merely assumes it. It
   therefore gives us no reason at all for accepting that conclusion.

   The argument for the antithesis is no more promising. Here is how Kant
   puts it:

   Let us assume that it [the world] had a beginning. Since the beginning
   is an existence which is preceded by a time in which the thing is not,
   there must have been a preceding time in which the world was not, i.e.,
   an empty time. Now no coming to be of a thing is possible in an empty
   time, because no part of such a time possesses, as compared with any
   other, a distinguishing condition of existence rather than
   nonexistence. . . . (A427, B455)

   Again, the argument is by reductio: assume the denial of your
   conclusion and show that it is impossible, thereby establishing the
   conclusion. Here the two premises are

   (6) The beginning of an event or a thing is always preceded by a time
   in which the thing is not, that is, a time at which the thing in
   question does not exist.

   and

   (7) In an empty time (a time at which nothing exists) nothing could
   come to be, because there would be no more reason for it to come to be
   at one part of that empty time than at any other part of it.

   Neither premise is at all compelling. As to the first, this is true
   only if it is not possible that time and the world (the first event)
   should come into existence together, simultaneously. Is it known that
   this isn't possible? Certainly not. Indeed, some of the most popular
   theories of time (relational theories) would assume, not merely that
   this is possible, but that it is true.

   As for the second premise, it is equally unpromising. Suppose (in
   accord with the picture governing the argument) an infinity of time had
   elapsed before the first event of the world took place--before its
   creation, say. The objection is that there would have been no more
   reason for God to create the world at one moment than at any other;
   hence he wouldn't or couldn't have created it at any moment at all.
   Again, why believe this? If God proposed to create the world, and no
   time was more propitious than any other, why couldn't he just
   arbitrarily select a time? [29]

   This argument is like those arguments that start from the premise that
   God, if he created the world, would have created the best world he
   could have; they go on to add that for every world God could have
   created (weakly actualized, [30] say) there is an even better world he
   could have created or weakly actualized; therefore, they conclude, he
   wouldn't have weakly actualized any world at all, and the actual world
   has not been weakly actualized by God. Again, there seems no reason to
   believe the first premise. If there were only finitely many worlds
   among which God was obliged to choose, then perhaps he would have been
   obliged, somehow, to choose the best (although even this is at best
   dubious). [31] But if there is no best world at all among those he
   could have chosen (if for every world he could have chosen, there is a
   better world he could have chosen), why think a world's failing to be
   the best is sufficient for God's being unable to actualize it? Suppose
   a man had the benefit of immortality and had a bottle of wine that
   would improve every day, no matter how long he waits to drink it. Would
   he be rationally obliged never to drink it, on the grounds that for any
   time he might be tempted to, it would be better yet the next day?
   Suppose a donkey were stranded exactly midway between two bales of hay:
   would it be rationally obliged to stay there and starve to death
   because there is no more reason to move to the one bale than to the
   other?

   The arguments for the other antinomies don't fare any better. In no
   case is there anything like a conclusive argument (given the assumption
   that we are thinking about the Dinge) for either the thesis or the
   antithesis. In some cases, we may not know or be able to tell which
   (thesis or antithesis) is true: but that doesn't constitute much of an
   argument for the conclusion that we can't think about the noumena. What
   would be needed for the argument to work would be a really powerful
   argument for the thesis and an equally powerful argument for the
   antithesis. In none of these cases do we have something like that.

   Suppose we think a bit further about antinomies and paradoxes in
   connection with this question of concluding that we simply can't think
   about a given area or topic. Consider the Russell paradoxes, in their
   simple set-theoretical guise. Like Frege, we are all initially inclined
   to think that for every condition or property, there exists the set of
   just those things that meet the condition or have the property. It is
   pointed out that there is such a property as being nonselfmembered, the
   property a thing has just if it is not a member of itself; hence there
   must be a set S of nonselfmembered sets, but then S is a member of
   itself if and only if it is not a member of itself, which is a
   contradiction. Here it would be unduly enthusiastic to conclude that we
   can't really think and talk about sets as they are in themselves and
   can instead think only about sets that we have ourselves constructed,
   sets as they appear to us. One takes the argument as proving only that
   there is no set of nonselfmembered sets and that, contrary to
   appearances, it is not true that for every property or condition, there
   exists the set of just those things satisfying the condition or
   displaying the property.

   Take, instead, the Russell paradox as specified to properties, rather
   than sets; in some ways, this is a more serious paradox. One is
   initially inclined to think that there are properties, that some
   properties (for example, the property of being a property) exemplify
   themselves, so that there is such a property as self-exemplification,
   and that every property has a complement. These together lead to
   trouble: they imply that there is such a property as
   non-self-exemplification, which inconsiderately both does and doesn't
   exemplify itself. [32] Once again, however, it hardly seems to follow
   that we simply can't think and talk about properties an sich. We
   needn't hold that if we can think about properties an sich, then there
   is a property that both does and doesn't exemplify itself. We can quite
   properly conclude, instead, that one of the group of propositions we
   are initially inclined to accept must be false, and we look for the one
   with the least intuitive warrant or support, the one we are least
   strongly inclined to believe. (We might be inclined to think, for
   example, that there really isn't such a property as
   non-self-exemplification [even though it seems as if there is] so that
   either there is no such property as self-exemplification, or it is
   false that every property has a complement.) This is mildly
   disquieting, and gives us reason for a bit of humility with respect to
   the deliverances of reason, but we certainly aren't forced into the
   position of holding that we can't refer to and think about properties
   an sich.

   In what conditions would this drastic conclusion be right? Perhaps in
   none at all, and if in some, it is hard to say which. At the least,
   however, it would involve our being very strongly inclined to accept
   each member of a set of propositions about some subject matter, which
   set (by argument forms we are very strongly inclined to accept) entails
   a contradiction. It would also involve there being several such sets of
   propositions about the subject matter in question. Each of the premises
   and arguments involved would have to have very powerful, maximal or
   near maximal intuitive support; otherwise, we could more reasonably
   hold that a premise (or argument form) with only moderate intuitive
   support is false (or invalid). If there were several such sets of
   propositions--about properties, say--and each of these propositions and
   argument forms had the degree of intuitive support enjoyed by, say, 2 +
   1 = 3 and modus ponens, then perhaps the right conclusion to draw would
   be that either there simply aren't any such things as the objects in
   the alleged realm, or that if there are, we are incapable of thinking
   about them.

   Even here, however, there would be reason to doubt the success of the
   argument. It would involve as a premise something like:

   (8) If there are several sets of premises about properties, each member
   of each set having maximal intuitive warrant, and the members of each
   set together entail a contradiction, then we cannot refer to and think
   about properties an sich.

   The next premise would be the antecedent of (8), and the conclusion
   would be the consequent of (8)--that is, the proposition that we cannot
   refer to and think about properties an sich. But if that conclusion
   were true, how could we grasp (8), the first premise? That premise
   seems to be, among other things, about properties an sich, and if we
   grasp it, we are able to think about properties an sich. The argument
   appears to be self-referentially self-refuting: if it is a successful
   argument, its first premise is both about noumena and such that we can
   grasp it, in which case that premise must be false.

   The sensible Kantian conclusion, so it seems to me, is that if, indeed,
   we can refer to and think about the Dinge, reason alone doesn't tell us
   such things as whether the world had a beginning in time or whether
   there are simple substances. It seems more likely than not, perhaps,
   that there are simple substances and that there are free agents who
   initiate new causal chains in the world, but the negations of these
   propositions are not demonstrably mistaken. Most certainly, it is not
   the case that both these propositions and their denials are
   demonstrable, so that each is both demonstrably true and, furthermore,
   demonstrably false.

   We must also recall that the whole scheme, the whole radical
   subpicture, seems incoherent in a familiar way. One who states and
   proposes this scheme makes several claims about the Dinge: that they
   are not in space and time, for example, and more poignantly, that our
   concepts don't apply to them (applying only to the phenomena), so that
   we cannot refer to or think about them. But if we really can't think
   the Dinge, then we can't think them (and can't whistle them either); if
   we can't think about them, we can't so much as entertain the thought
   that there are such things. The incoherence is patent.

   Would it be possible to induce coherence by refusing to make the
   distinction between phenomena and noumena, speaking only of what, if we
   did make that distinction, would be the phenomena, and claiming that
   whatever there is, is either a bit of experience or an object
   constructed by us from bits of experience by way of concepts (i.e.,
   rules for constructing things from experience)? That is extremely hard
   to believe: are the stars, for example, which, as far as we can tell,
   existed long before we did, either bits of human experience or objects
   constructed by us from bits of human experience? How are we supposed to
   make sense of that? On this view, furthermore, the objection to
   Christian belief would not be that serious Christians improperly take
   it that they can refer to God; the objection would be that there is no
   God. If there were such a person, he certainly wouldn't be either a bit
   of human experience or something we have constructed from it. Still
   further, on this picture we ourselves (because we are among the things
   there are) would either have constructed ourselves from bits of
   experience or we would just be bits of experience; but of course we
   couldn't have constructed ourselves before we existed, so we must have
   started off, at least, as bits of experience with the power to
   construct things. Not a pretty picture. And even if we could somehow
   induce coherence here, why should we feel obliged to believe it? What
   possible claim could such a bizarre scheme have on us?

   By way of conclusion then: it doesn't look as if there is good reason
   in Kant or in the neighborhood of Kant for the conclusion that our
   concepts do not apply to God, so that we cannot think about him.
   Contemporary theologians and others sometimes complain that
   contemporary philosophers of religion often write as if they have never
   read their Kant. Perhaps the reason they write that way, however, is
   not that they have never read their Kant but rather that they have read
   him and remain unconvinced. They may be unconvinced that Kant actually
   claimed that our concepts do not apply to God. Alternatively, they may
   concede that Kant did claim this, but remain unconvinced that he was
   right; after all, it is not just a given of the intellectual life that
   Kant is right. Either way, they don't think Kant gives us reason to
   hold that we cannot think about God.

   [28] It seems we could have good reason to accept each member of a set
   S of beliefs such that there is no possible world in which all the
   members of S are true (the conjunction of the members of S is
   impossible), as is shown by the paradox of the preface. I write a book,
   of course believing every proposition asserted therein. Past experience
   and self-knowledge, however, lead me to think that very likely the book
   contains at least one false statement. (All of my previous books, as
   I've discovered to my sorrow, contain false statements.) In the
   preface, therefore, I sadly concede that at least one statement in the
   book is false. The total set of my beliefs, therefore--the statements
   in the book plus the statement that at least one statement in the book
   is false--is such that it must contain at least one falsehood;
   nevertheless, I have good reason to accept each member.

Kaufman and Hick


   Our subject is the de jure question about Christian belief: the
   question whether it is rational, or reasonable, or rationally
   justifiable, or intellectually defensible to accept such belief. A
   previous question, as we saw in the last chapter, is the question
   whether there is any de jure question about Christian belief or,
   indeed, any de facto question either. Christian belief is belief, among
   other things, in the existence of God. And Christians believe that God
   is infinite: unlimited with respect to such important properties as
   knowledge, wisdom, goodness, and power. They also believe that God is
   transcendent: distinct from the created universe, in no way dependent
   on it, and such that it is dependent on him. Finally, they assume that
   it is possible to refer to God, talk and think about him, address him
   in prayer, and worship him. Many contemporary theologians, however,
   apparently believe that these ideas are excessively naive: they hold
   that there are profound problems in the very idea that we can refer to
   and think about a being characterized in the way Christians
   characterize God. In particular, they seem to believe that Immanuel
   Kant gave us excellent reason to be (at best) extremely suspicious of
   such naively realistic ways of thinking about God or religious
   language. As we saw in the last chapter, however, there is really
   nothing in Kant to suggest that in fact we can't think or talk about
   God. More generally, it is exceedingly hard to see how to construct an
   argument--an argument for the conclusion that we cannot refer to and
   think about God--from materials to be found in the work of Kant. Of
   course that doesn't show that no such argument can be found: but if one
   can be found, it is, I should say, up to those who think there is one
   to produce and develop it.

   In this chapter, I shall pursue this question into the present: if Kant
   gives us no reason to accept this conceptual agnosticism, do
   contemporary theologians (or writers in religious studies) do so? I
   choose two representatives: Gordon Kaufman and John Hick.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Kaufman
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. The Real Referent and the Available Referent

   According to Gordon Kaufman,

   The central problem of theological discourse, not shared with any other
   "language game," is the meaning of the term "God." "God" raises special
   problems of meaning because it is a noun which by definition refers to
   a reality transcendent of, and thus not locatable within, experience. A
   new convert may wish to refer the "warm feeling" in his heart to God,
   but God is hardly to be identified with this emotion; the biblicist may
   regard the Bible as God's Word; the moralist may believe God speaks
   through men's consciences; the churchman may believe God is present
   among his people--but each of these would agree that God himself
   transcends the locus referred to. As the Creator or Source of all that
   is, God is not to be identified with any particular finite reality; as
   the proper object of ultimate loyalty or faith, God is to be
   distinguished from every proximate or penultimate value or being. But
   if absolutely nothing within our experience can be directly identified
   as that to which the term "God" properly refers, what meaning does or
   can the word have? [33]

   So the claim is that God is not to be identified with any particular
   finite reality--on the grounds, presumably, that God is not in fact
   identical with any particular finite reality. From the Christian
   perspective, this is, of course, no more than the sober truth: God is
   infinite and therefore not identical with any finite reality. So far,
   so good. Kaufman apparently infers from this, however, that "absolutely
   nothing within our experience can be directly identified as that to
   which the term God' properly refers"; he adds that if this is so, then
   there is a real problem for the reference of our term God': if "nothing
   within our experience can be directly identified as that to which the
   term God' properly refers, then what meaning does or can the word
   have?" I realize this last is a question, but it looks like a
   rhetorical question; the idea is that if nothing within our experience
   can be directly identified as that to which the term God' properly
   refers, then the term God' doesn't refer to anything, or at any rate
   there is a real problem about its referring to something.

   Here, therefore, we have two claims:

   (a) if God is not a finite reality, then absolutely nothing within our
   experience can be directly identified as that to which the term God'
   properly refers.

   and

   (b) if nothing within our experience can be directly identified as that
   to which the term God' properly refers, then the term God' doesn't
   refer to anything, or at least it is problematic that it does.

   These claims awaken Kantian echoes--echoes that get stronger as we move
   further into Kaufman's thought. And surely both are initially dubious.
   Consider (a). First, we must ask what it means to say that "nothing
   within our experience can be directly identified as that to which the
   term God' properly applies." What is it, as Kaufman is thinking of it,
   for something to be within our experience, and to be such that it can
   be directly identified as that to which a certain term properly
   applies? What about my friend's cat Maynard: is Maynard something
   within our experience which can be directly identified as that to which
   the term Maynard' properly applies? I should think so: else the problem
   is not merely with reference to God, but with reference to anything at
   all; Kaufman's suggestion, I think, is that the problem is specifically
   with respect to God. According to (a) it is because God is infinite
   that the term God' doesn't properly apply to anything within our
   experience. Now why, precisely, is that true? Maynard, I take it, is
   something within our experience, and this is because we can experience
   Maynard. We can perceive him: we can see, hear, touch, and sometimes
   smell him. The idea must be, then, that if God is not a finite reality,
   then we cannot experience him; we cannot perceive him (we cannot see,
   hear, or touch him) or in any other way experience him. An infinite
   being--one that is omnipotent and omniscient, for example--cannot be
   perceived or experienced in any way whatever.

   Is that really true? How does the fact that God is infinite mean that
   we cannot experience him? Many Christians and Jews believe that God
   spoke to Moses from the burning bush; Moses heard him. He spoke to
   Abraham in a dream. He spoke to several people when he said, "This is
   my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased"; these people all heard him.
   Christians may also believe that the Holy Spirit works in their hearts,
   producing conviction and faith, as well as the religious affections of
   which Jonathan Edwards spoke; are they not then experiencing God? The
   term experience' (taken as either a noun or a verb) is notoriously
   slippery, but if these things do in fact happen, do not the people
   involved experience God? Christians may go still further and hold that
   in some circumstances some people perceive God, a theme that has
   received explicit and powerful treatment in William P. Alston's
   Perceiving God. If they are right, then in these cases too they
   experience God. Now Kaufman apparently thinks the fact that God is
   infinite--unlimited along several dimensions--means that these people
   are mistaken: whatever they think, they do not experience God. Again,
   why so? God is infinite with respect to power, that is, omnipotent: how
   does that so much as slyly suggest that God cannot make himself heard
   or that he cannot be experienced? He is infinite with respect to
   knowledge, that is, omniscient; does that somehow show that he could
   not speak to Abraham or anyone else? Is it perhaps the combination of
   omnipotence and omniscience that shows this? It is certainly hard to
   see how.

   If God is omnipotent, infinitely powerful, won't he be able to manifest
   himself in our experience, bring it about that we experience him? He
   will be unable to do so, presumably, under those conditions, only if it
   is logically impossible (impossible in the broadly logical sense) that
   an omniscient and omnipotent being should be able to make himself
   heard. But so far as I can see, there isn't even the slightest reason
   to think that; certainly Kaufman gives us none. I will go into the
   question of the nature of experience of God in more detail in chapters
   6, 8, and 9; here I only want to point out that it seems initially
   implausible to declare that God, if he is infinite and omnipotent,
   could not bring it about that we experience him.

   The second premise (b)--the claim that if nothing within our experience
   can be directly identified as that to which the term God' refers, then
   the term God' doesn't refer to anything (or it is at least problematic
   that it does)--also seems dubious. Cosmologists tell us of the Big
   Bang, an event that occurred several billion years ago in which an
   explosion of enormous energy caused an expansion from an initial
   configuration of enormous density. I suppose the Big Bang is not
   something within our experience, something that can be directly
   identified as that to which the term the Big Bang' correctly refers;
   does it follow that there is a profound problem with this term? Is the
   real problem with contemporary cosmology not just the speculative
   nature of those suggestions about many universes and what happened
   during Planck time, but rather the very idea that we can refer to and
   think about that initial Big Bang? It isn't easy to see why: at the
   least, a powerful argument would be required. And if there is no
   particular problem here, why is there a special problem in the case of
   God? [34]

   Well, then, someone might say, if there is no problem about referring
   to an infinite being, how do we refer to God? In chapter 1, I suggested
   that we could do so, first, by way of definite descriptions such as the
   creator of the heavens and the earth', the omnipotent and omniscient
   creator of the world', the divine father of our lord and savior Jesus
   Christ', the divine person who spoke to Abraham', the divine person I
   am presently experiencing,' and so on. Each of these descriptions will
   refer to something if there is exactly one thing exemplifying the
   properties mentioned in the description; if not, then the description
   will not refer. (If Christian belief is true, of course, then each of
   these terms does refer to something, indeed, to the same thing.)

   Furthermore, we can use the proper name God' to refer to the being
   denoted by those descriptions. That term can serve as a proper name,
   for me, of God, in several ways. For example, I might fix the
   reference' of the term God' by one of the above descriptions, such as
   the creator of heaven and earth'; if, indeed, just one person created
   the heavens and the earth, and if that person is also denoted by those
   other descriptions, then my name God' will be a proper name of the same
   being as that denoted by those descriptions. My name will be a proper
   name of a being who is omniscient, omnipotent, the creator of the
   world, the father of our lord and savior Jesus Christ, and the like.
   Under these conditions, my name God' will express an essence of that
   being. [35] Perhaps my name, introduced in that way, will not express
   the same essence of God as your name, introduced by way of a different
   description. Even so, however, they will express logically equivalent
   (even if epistemically inequivalent) essences of God. [36]

   Alternatively, I might not get my proper name of God by using a
   definite description to fix the reference and then officially baptize
   the thing to which the description refers: I might instead just catch
   the name, so to speak, from others. In fact, this is the more usual
   way. Proper names, like colds, are ordinarily caught from our
   associates. As a child, I hear talk of God, talk in which the name God'
   occurs; I pick up the name, tacitly or implicitly intending to use it
   to refer to the same being to which those from whom I get the name
   refer. If they do indeed succeed in referring to God by using that
   name, then so will I. (Here is another way in which the success of my
   noetic ventures depends on the success of similar ventures on the parts
   of those around me: see Warrant and Proper Function, pp. 77-78.)

   In any event, Kaufman holds that we can neither know nor experience
   what he calls the real referent' of the term God':

   The real referent for "God" is never accessible to us or in any way
   open to our observation or experience. It must remain always an unknown
   X. . . . (GP 85)

   When Christians use the term God', therefore, they do not refer to the
   real referent of that term (but then why call it "the real referent"?).
   To whom or what (if anything) do they refer when they say such things
   as that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, or that
   God created the heavens and the earth, or that God is our faithful and
   loving father? The answer, says Kaufman, is that when they say these
   things they are referring to the "available referent" of the name God',
   and the available referent is an imaginative construct, something we
   have somehow created:

   For all practical purposes it is the available referent--a particular
   imaginative construct--that bears significantly on human life and
   thought. It is the "available God" whom we have in mind when we worship
   or pray . . . it is the available God in terms of which we speak and
   think whenever we use the word "God." In this sense "God" denotes for
   all practical purposes what is essentially a mental or imaginative
   construct. (GP 85-86)

   God is a symbol--an imaginative construct--that enables men to view the
   world and themselves in such a way as to make action and morality
   ultimately (metaphysically) meaningful. (GP 109)

   So the available God, the God whom we have in mind when we worship and
   pray, the being to which we refer when we use the term God'--this being
   is a human creation, an imaginative construct, something we ourselves
   have created. The view seems to be initially that there is this
   available referent, but also a real referent of the term God', a being
   with whom we have no noetic contact and about whom we cannot speak. Or
   rather, the view is, I think, that there might be a real referent, and
   that if there is, it is a being we cannot think about:

   This fact, that the God actually available to people is an imaginative
   construct, does not necessarily mean that God is "unreal" or "merely
   imaginary" or something of that sort. That question remains open for
   further investigation. (GP 86)

   Does this mean, then, that the conclusion is, after all, that God
   really does not exist, that He is only a figment of our imaginations?
   If those words are intended to put the speculative question about the
   ultimate nature of things, then, as we have seen, there is no possible
   way to give an answer. (GP 111)

   In essence, then, Kaufman's view in God the Problem appears to be the
   following. The term God' has an available referent: this is a human
   construction, something we have created; when we speak of God in
   worship or to him in prayer, it is this available referent about which
   (or to which) we are talking. Perhaps the term also has a real
   referent. If so, however, it transcends our experience and is hence
   something to which our concepts do not apply: a mere unknown X, to
   adopt Kaufman's Kantian terminology.

   Now I've already argued that there seems no good reason to hold this
   position. Here I must go on to add that there is excellent reason not
   to hold it. As it stands, the view is incoherent. First, the available
   referent': the suggestion is that when Christians pray and worship and
   speak about God, they are talking about the available referent. When
   they say such things, for example, as God created the heavens and the
   earth', they are really attributing this property--the property of
   having created the heavens and the earth--to the available referent.
   But the available referent is a human construct, and hence presumably
   did not exist before there were human beings. How then did it manage to
   create the heavens and the earth? Could it somehow do this before it
   existed? In any event, an imaginative construct, a symbol, a structure
   of meanings of some kind is just not the sort of thing that could
   create the heavens and the earth or, indeed, anything else. A symbol,
   an imaginative construct, may have properties: being a construct, for
   example, or being a symbol, or being appropriately used by human beings
   for such and such a purpose; it certainly won't have such properties as
   being omniscient or creating the world. I suppose it could be that
   Christians are confused: they think they are referring to and talking
   about something that created them, but the fact is they are referring
   to something they themselves have created. Is it really plausible to
   think they are as confused as all that, however? Those who believe
   there is no such person as God will see Christians as mistaken in
   thinking there is, and perhaps it is at least sensible to think them
   mistaken in that way. Is it really sensible to think them mistaken in
   such a way that they predicate the properties of God of a mere
   construct? Well, perhaps that could happen; but surely a strong
   argument would be required to make this even reasonably plausible.

   Say that a property P entails a property Q just if it is necessary in
   the broadly logical sense that everything that exemplifies P also
   exemplifies Q; and say that a concept C contains a property P if the
   property of which C is a grasp entails P. Then it is clear that a
   concept might contain such properties as being omniscient or having
   created the world (even if it couldn't exemplify them), and equally
   clear that the concept corresponding to the definite description the
   omniscient creator of the world' contains the properties being
   omniscient and being the creator of the world. Could it be that what
   Kaufman really means is not that Christians assert that the available
   referent--which is something like a concept containing salient
   properties of God--exemplifies those properties, but rather that it
   contains them? This too seems wrong. It is indeed true that certain
   concepts, including some associated with descriptions of God, contain
   those properties. When Christians make their characteristic claims,
   however, they are not merely saying such things as that the concept
   being the omniscient creator of the heavens and earth contains the
   properties being omniscient and being the creator of the heavens and
   earth. That would, of course, be true; it would also be wholly trivial.
   It wouldn't be at all distinctive of Christians or theists: even the
   most hardened atheist would agree that this concept contains those
   properties. What Christians claim entails rather that these properties
   are exemplified, that there really exists a being who has them.

   The above seems to be the literal construal of Kaufman's words; of
   course there are other possibilities in the neighborhood. Perhaps, for
   example, he thinks of the available referent not as a being with the
   properties Christians ascribe to God, but as something like a certain
   type with which those properties are associated. [37] This may seem a
   more sympathetic construal of Kaufman; I doubt that it really is. If
   Kaufman's claim is that Christians ordinarily worship that type, then
   his claim is outrageous in just the way I suggest. If his claim,
   however, is only that Christians believe they worship a being having
   the properties associated with the type but are possibly mistaken, then
   is his claim more than the uninteresting suggestion that Christians may
   be wrong about whether there is such a person as God?

   Now consider the real referent. The idea is that our concepts do not
   apply to the real referent, if indeed there is such a thing. It follows
   that this being is not wise, almighty, or the creator of the heavens
   and the earth. For consider our concept of wisdom. This concept applies
   to a thing just if that thing is wise. So a being to which this concept
   did not apply would not be wise, whatever else it might be. If,
   therefore, our concepts do not apply to the real referent of the term
   God', then our concepts of being loving, almighty, wise, creator, and
   redeemer do not apply to it, in which case it is not loving, almighty,
   wise, a creator, or a redeemer. It wouldn't have any of the properties
   Christians ascribe to God. And of course so far this is in accord with
   Kaufman's intentions.

   I suspect, however, that his official position has other consequences
   Kaufman does not intend. If this being, this real referent, is really
   such that none of our concepts applies to it, then it will also lack
   such properties as self-identity, existence, and being either a
   material object or an immaterial object, these being properties of
   which we have concepts. Indeed, it wouldn't have the property of being
   the real referent of the term God' or any other term; our concept being
   the referent of a term will not apply to it. The fact is this being
   won't have any properties at all because our concept of having at least
   one property does not apply to it. Kaufman's view seems to entail that
   there could be a being that had no properties, didn't exist, wasn't
   self-identical, wasn't either a material object or an immaterial
   object, and didn't have any properties.

   Taken strictly, therefore, Kaufman's position is incoherent.

    B. The Function of Religious Language

   Perhaps it is for reasons like these that in more recent work, in
   particular The Theological Imagination, [38] Kaufman seems to have
   given up the real referent. Instead, he claims that "it is an error to
   reify God into an independent being" (TI 38), that "To regard God as
   some kind of describable or knowable object over against us would be at
   once a degradation of God and a serious category error" (TI 244), and
   that

   It is a mistake, therefore, to regard qualities attributed to God
   (e.g., aseity, holiness, omnipotence, omniscience, providence, love,
   self-revelation) as though they were features or activities of such a
   particular being. Rather, in the mind's construction of the
   image/concept of God, the ordinary relation of subject and predicate is
   reversed. Instead of the subject (God) being a given to which the
   various predicate adjectives are then assigned, here the descriptive
   terms themselves are the building blocks which the imagination uses in
   putting together its conception. . . . Contemporary theological
   construction needs to recognize that these terms and concepts do not
   refer directly to "objects" or "realities" or their qualities and
   relations, but function rather as the building blocks or reference
   points which articulate the theistic world-picture or vision of life.
   (TI 244)

   Why must we think these terms do not, in fact, denote an all-powerful,
   all-wise creator of the universe? As far as I can see, it is because
   Kaufman does not believe that there is any such thing: he thinks, so
   far as I can see, that the proper attitude toward this proposition is
   either disbelief or withholding, either atheism or agnosticism.
   Naturally enough, if there is no being of that sort, then none of our
   terms will denote a being of that sort. This is perhaps a surprising
   position for a theologian; a theologian who does not believe in God is
   like a mountaineer for whom it is an open question whether there are
   any mountains or a plumber agnostic about pipes: a beguiling spectacle,
   but hard to take seriously. [39]

   And why does he think there is no such person? Again, there is precious
   little by way of argument. He cites first "the rise of a new
   consciousness of the significance of religious pluralism"; [40] second,
   he says in the same article, "new theories about the ways in which
   cultural and linguistic symbolic or conceptual frames shape all our
   experiencing and thinking . . . have given rise in theologians to a new
   self-consciousness about the extraordinarily complex and problematic
   character of all so-called religious truth-claims,' including those
   that are made by Christian faith"; third, he refers to the traditional
   problem of evil but with a twist: Christians themselves are responsible
   for more of the evil the world displays than they would like to think.
   (This last, sadly enough, is true, and perhaps [to take just one
   example] part of the occasion for modern apostasy, in the West, was the
   unedifying spectacle of Christians at each other's throats in the
   sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.) It is an enormous leap, however,
   to the conclusion that probably there is no such person as God. In
   chapter 14, we'll examine the question whether evil constitutes a
   defeater for Christian belief, and in chapter 13 we'll do the same for
   the plurality of religions the world displays. As for the second
   suggestion--the claim that many now hold that "cultural and linguistic
   symbolic or conceptual frames shape all our experiencing and
   thinking"--perhaps this claim is true: but if it casts doubt on all of
   our experiencing and thinking, thus including Christianity, doesn't it
   do the same for every other way of thinking, including the thought that
   it casts doubt on what we think? If so, it would seem to leave
   everything as it was, not functioning as a reason for being doubtful
   specifically about theism (or, indeed, anything else).

   One might expect someone who is atheist or agnostic about God to move
   away from religion altogether, viewing religious devotion and belief
   with something of a jaundiced or a pitying eye. This is not Kaufman's
   course. Instead, he argues that religious practice and devotion "still
   has an important function to play in life." This function, of course,
   is not that of putting us in touch with a being with the properties
   traditionally ascribed to God or that of enabling us to appropriate the
   salvation in Jesus Christ that God has promised us. Rather, this new
   function requires that theologians should construct or reconstruct the
   concept of God. Religious language is still important, but it should be
   recast so as no longer to involve a forlorn attempt to refer to a being
   who isn't there. Instead, it should be used to promote human
   flourishing, "human fulfillment and meaning" (TI 34). The word God' is
   to be associated with a symbol or image or concept theologians
   construct; it is their job to reconstruct the concept or symbol God' in
   a way that is appropriate to our present historical situation. (Thus in
   Theology for a Nuclear Age, he suggests that in this modern nuclear age
   we should think of God as "the historical evolutionary force that has
   brought us all into being." [41] ) The word God', therefore, should no
   longer be thought of as referring to the all-powerful, all-knowing,
   all-loving person who has created the world; it is not to be thought of
   as referring to a person at all. Instead, this word is to be seen as a
   sort of symbol of certain states of affairs. For example, Christians
   have thought of transcendence as a property of God; Kaufman recommends
   that, in constructing the new symbol, we retain transcendence: [42]

   What seems to be at stake here is a claim that human individuals and
   communities need a center of orientation and devotion outside
   themselves and their perceived desires and needs if they are to find
   genuine fulfillment. (TI 35-36)

   God symbolizes that in the ongoing evolutionary historical process
   which grounds our being as distinctively human and which draws (or
   drives) us on toward authentic human fulfillment (salvation). . . . And
   ritualized devotion to God in religious cult as well as in the private
   disciplines of prayer and meditation still has an important function to
   play in life. (TI 41)

   More generally:

   "God" is the personifying symbol of that cosmic activity which has
   created our humanity and continues to press for its full realization.
   Such a personification has a considerable advantage for some purposes
   over abstract concepts such as "cosmic forces" or "foundation for our
   humanity in the ultimate nature of things": the symbol "God" is
   concrete and definite, a sharply defined image, and as such it can
   readily become the central focus for devotion and service. . . . "God"
   is a symbol that gathers up into itself and focuses for us all those
   cosmic forces working toward the fully humane existence for which we
   long. (TI 50)

   Speech about the Christian God as "real" or "existent" expresses
   symbolically this conviction that free and loving persons-in-community
   have a substantial metaphysical foundation, that there are cosmic
   forces working toward this sort of humanization. (TI 49)

   The Christian image/concept of God, as I have presented it here, is an
   imaginative construct which orients selves and communities so as to
   facilitate development toward loving and caring selfhood, and toward
   communities of openness, love, and freedom. (TI 48)

   The idea, so far as I can grasp it, seems to be this. Perhaps there is
   no such person as theists have traditionally believed in. Nevertheless,
   it is a good idea to continue to use the term God' and, in fact, to
   continue to utter many of the very same words and phrases and sentences
   as do those who believe in God; done properly, this will promote human
   flourishing. How, exactly? Perhaps as follows. We realize, first, that
   there is probably no such person as God. We are then free to select a
   concept/image God' and associate with it certain properties--existence
   and transcendence, perhaps--and use that symbol to symbolize such
   things as that the world is hospitable, to at least some degree, to
   distinctively human aspirations, goals, needs, and desires. We are to
   say such things as God is real', meaning that in fact there are forces
   in the world that contribute to human flourishing. (We should add, I
   suppose, that the devil is also real, thereby symbolizing that there
   are forces working against human flourishing.) We are to say God is
   independent of us,' meaning thereby that a community or person needs a
   focus of interest outside itself to flourish. (Perhaps we should add
   that We are justified by the suffering and death of Jesus Christ,'
   thereby symbolizing the fact that we do not always feel guilty, or God
   was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,' thereby meaning that
   things are now more propitious for human flourishing than they have
   been at some times in the past.) And saying these things will itself
   promote human flourishing.

   Can we take any of this seriously? This is not a matter of pouring new
   wine into old wineskins: what we have here is nothing like the rich,
   powerful, fragrant wine of the great Christian truths; what we have is
   something wholly drab, trivial, and insipid. It is not even a matter of
   throwing out the baby with the bathwater; it is, instead, throwing out
   the baby and keeping the tepid bathwater, at best a bland, unappetizing
   potion that is neither hot nor cold and at worst a nauseating brew, fit
   for neither man nor beast. Furthermore, this rehashing of secularity
   under the guise of reconstructing' Christianity encourages dishonesty
   and hypocrisy; it results in a sort of private code whereby one utters
   the same phrases as those who accept Christian belief but means
   something wholly different by them. You thereby appear to concur with
   those who accept Christian belief; in fact, you wholly reject what they
   believe. You can thereby patronize the person in the pew (who has not
   reached your level of enlightenment) but without paying the cost of
   unduly disturbing her. The fact is such double-talk is at best
   confusing and deceptive, contributing only to misunderstanding,
   dishonesty, and hypocrisy. Wouldn't it be vastly more honest to follow
   the lead of, for example, Bertrand Russell, A. J. Ayer, Daniel Dennett,
   Richard Dawkins, or even Madalyn Murray O' Hair, declaring forthrightly
   that there is no God and that Christianity is an enormous mistake?

  II. Hick

   John Hick's work is interesting both intrinsically and with respect to
   our topic; he too holds a view heavily indebted to Kant, and his view
   too can be put (with considerable qualifications) as the view that our
   concepts do not apply to God or The Real'. There are evocative echoes
   of Kant and also evocative echoes of some of the trials and
   tribulations dogging an effort to find a coherent interpretation or
   understanding of Kant.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. The Real

   The traditional doctrine of divine ineffability is to be found in
   Christianity, as well as other religious traditions. Hick believes that
   this doctrine is really the recognition of a quasi-Kantian distinction
   between God (the Real, the Ultimate [43] ) as it is in itself and as it
   is for us (as we know or experience it):

   In each of the great traditions a distinction has been drawn, though
   with varying degrees of emphasis, between the Real (thought of as God,
   Brahman, the Dharmakaya . . .) in itself and the Real as manifested
   within the intellectual and experiential purview of that tradition.
   (236)

   So far, so good; this claim--that there is a distinction between the
   Real as it is in itself and as it is for us--is relatively weak. It
   requires only that the way we think of God does not completely match
   what God actually is; it would be satisfied if, for example, there are
   things about God that we didn't know or, more strongly, if there were
   things about him we couldn't know.

   But Hick goes much further; the Real is such that we cannot say
   anything at all about it, in that none of our terms can be literally
   (and correctly) applied to it:

   Thus although we cannot speak of the Real an sich in literal terms,
   nevertheless we live inescapably in relation to it. (351)

   It is within the phenomenal or experienceable realm that language has
   developed and it is to this that it literally applies. Indeed the
   system of concepts embodied in human language has contributed
   reciprocally to the formation of the humanly perceived world. It is as
   much constructed as given. But our language can have no purchase on a
   postulated noumenal reality which is not even partly formed by human
   concepts. This lies outside the scope of our cognitive capacities.
   (350)

   This sounds like the two-world interpretation of Kant (above, pp.
   10ff.). There is the phenomenal realm, to which our language literally
   applies; this "humanly perceived world" is as much constructed as
   given, and it is constructed, in part, by virtue of our application of
   concepts. However, there is also a noumenal world (The Real'), "which
   is not even partly formed by human concepts," and as a result it is
   outside the scope of our cognitive capacities. And here some of the
   same questions arise as with the two-world interpretation of Kant: why
   think something is within the scope of our cognitive capacities only if
   it is partly formed by human concepts? Are horses and dinosaurs
   (partly) formed by our concepts? (Which parts?) And if the noumena lie
   outside the scope of our cognitive capacities, how is it that we know
   something about them, or even that there are any such things?

   More frequently, however, he adopts the one-world view:

   Kant distinguished between noumenon and phenomenon, or between a Ding
   an sich and that thing as it appears to human consciousness. . . . In
   this strand of Kant's thought--not the only strand, but the one which I
   am seeking to press into service in the epistemology of religion--the
   noumenal world exists independently of our perception of it and the
   phenomenal world is that same world as it appears to our human
   consciousness. . . . I want to say that the noumenal Real is
   experienced and thought by different human mentalities, forming and
   formed by different religious traditions, as the range of gods and
   absolutes which the phenomenology of religion reports. (241-42)

   Further, it is unclear whether Hick thinks we can or can't, do or don't
   perceive this being or in some other way experience it. On the negative
   side, we have

   If the Real in itself is not and cannot be humanly experienced, why
   postulate such an unknown and unknowable Ding as sich? The answer is
   that the divine noumenon is a necessary postulate of the pluralistic
   religious life of humanity. (249)

   On the positive side, we have, for example,

   Analogously, I want to say that the noumenal Real is experienced and
   thought by different human mentalities, forming and formed by different
   religious traditions, as the range of gods and absolutes which the
   phenomenology of religion reports. (242)

   and

   The noumenal Real is such as to be authentically experienced as a range
   of both theistic and nontheistic phenomena. (246-47)

   There are several more passages to quote on each side; clearly, Hick is
   ambivalent about the answer to this question. But perhaps this is not
   fatal; his answer, I should think, would be "In a way, yes, and in a
   way, no." The noumenal real makes a crucial causal contribution of some
   sort to our experience; perhaps it doesn't matter whether we say that
   we actually experience it or say, instead, only that it contributes to
   our experience.

   Another ambiguity, however, is not so easily dismissed. In chapter 19,
   Hick seems to say that our concepts do not apply to the noumenon, or,
   as he puts it there, none of our terms applies literally to it. He
   quotes the Buddha as saying, with respect to where or in what sphere a
   Tathagata (a fully enlightened being) arises after death, that none of
   the terms arises', does not arise', both arises and does not arise,'
   and neither arises nor does not arise' applies to the condition of the
   Tathagata (346). Hick apparently approves of this suggestion and adds,
   "We have here the idea of realities and circumstances which transcend
   the categories available in our unillumined thought and language. Their
   total elusiveness is signaled by the Buddha's rejection not only of the
   straight positive and negative assertions but also of their combination
   and disjunction" (347). Hick also claims that "we cannot speak of the
   Real an sich in literal terms" (351). If Hick really means that none of
   our terms applies literally to the Real, then it isn't possible to make
   sense of what he says. I take it the term tricycle' does not apply to
   the Real; the Real is not a tricycle. But if the Real is not a
   tricycle, then is not a tricycle' applies literally to it; it is a
   nontricycle. It could hardly be neither a tricycle nor a nontricycle,
   nor do I think that Hick would want to suggest that it could.

   In chapter 14, however, Hick makes a suggestion of quite a different
   kind. As he says, "it would not indeed make sense to say of X that none
   of our concepts apply to it" (p. 239); for example, at least our
   concept being such that we can refer to it would have to apply to any X
   of which we were properly prepared to say anything at all, including
   that our concepts do not apply to it. The idea is rather, says Hick,
   that among our concepts, only formal concepts and negative concepts
   apply to the Real. That is to say, of the properties of which we have a
   grasp, only those that are formal, such as having some properties,
   being self-identical, and being such that 7 + 5 = 12, and those that
   are negative, such as not being a horse, not being a tricycle, and not
   being good, would apply to it. Hick adds that there is a substantial
   tradition within Christianity and other religions, according to which
   we should distinguish

   between what we might call substantial properties, such as being good',
   being powerful', having knowledge', and purely formal and logically
   generated properties such as being a referent of a term' and being such
   that our substantial concepts do not apply'. What they wanted to affirm
   was that the substantial characterizations do not apply to God in God's
   self-existent being, beyond the range of human experience. They often
   expressed this by saying that we can only make negative statements
   about the Ultimate. . . . This via negativa (or via remotionis)
   consists in applying negative concepts to the Ultimate--the concept of
   not being finite, and so on--as a way of saying that it lies beyond the
   range of all our positive substantial characterizations. It is in this
   qualified sense that it makes perfectly good sense to say that our
   substantial concepts do not apply to the Ultimate. (239)

   Here Hick is apparently endorsing what he sees these traditions as
   delivering. I am not sure there is any way of harmonizing chapter 14
   with chapter 19; if not, I suggest we go with chapter 14.

   At some points in characterizing these traditions he is historically
   incorrect. For example, he claims that "Calvin taught that we do not
   know God's essence but only God as revealed to us" (250), and he refers
   to Calvin's Institutes, I: xiii: 21. But Calvin doesn't teach that we
   can't know anything of God's essence. In this chapter, he begins by
   arguing that

   The scriptural teaching concerning God's infinite and spiritual essence
   ought to be enough, not only to banish popular delusions, but also to
   refute the subtleties of secular philosophy. [44]

   He goes on to point out that we can't measure' God by our own senses'
   as he puts it:

   But even if God to keep us sober speaks sparingly of his essence, yet
   by those two titles that I have used [infinite' and spiritual'], he
   both banishes stupid imaginings and restrains the boldness of the human
   mind. Surely his infinity ought to make us afraid to try to measure him
   by our own senses. (p. 121)

   Calvin's next point is that because God is a spirit, we can't properly
   attribute corporeal characteristics to him. He concedes that Scripture
   does seem to attribute such characteristics (a mouth, an arm, ears,
   eyes, hands) to him, but those who therefore take it that he has such
   bodily characteristics fail to understand that "as nurses commonly do
   with infants, God is wont in a measure to lisp' in speaking to us" (p.
   121). Here Calvin clearly thinks we know that God in himself' is
   infinite, spiritual, and incorporeal; his essence includes infinity and
   incorporeality. In the passage to which Hick refers, furthermore,
   Calvin's point is to caution us not to try to figure out God's essence
   by way just of the resources of reason; given its limitations, that is
   bound to prove futile:

   For how can the human mind measure off the measureless essence of God
   according to its own little measure, a mind as yet unable to establish
   for certain the nature of the sun's body, though men's eyes daily gaze
   upon it? . . . Let us then willingly leave to God the knowledge of
   himself. . . . But we shall be "leaving it to him" if we conceive him
   to be as he reveals himself to us, without inquiring about him
   elsewhere than from his Word. (I, xiii, 1, p. 146)

   The point is that Scripture is a much better source of knowledge of God
   (including knowledge of his essence) than rational speculation. But
   Calvin didn't think for a moment that none of our positive substantial
   concepts applies to God; he clearly believed that God really is the
   creator of the heavens and the earth, that he really does love us, that
   he is incorporeal, wise, powerful, loving, and the like.

   On this view, Hick's claim about the Real is not that none of our
   concepts applies to it or that none of our terms literally applies to
   it; that is clearly incoherent. His claim, instead, is that only our
   formal concepts and terms and our negative concepts and terms apply to
   it. That is to say, the only properties it has of which we have a grasp
   are formal properties and negative properties. Consider first those
   formal concepts. Included here would be, first of all, concepts of
   properties which are such that everything has them and furthermore has
   them necessarily. [45] Hick is thinking (I take it) of properties such
   that it is necessary that everything has them: such properties as being
   self-identical, having properties, having essential properties, being
   either a horse or a nonhorse, and being such that 7 + 5 = 12. These
   properties are necessarily had by everything.

   We might add that they are essential to everything, where a property is
   essential to an object if it is not possible that the object exist but
   lack the property: the property of being self-identical would be an
   example. We could add still further that each of these properties is
   such that it is necessary that everything has it essentially. So take
   any of the properties under consideration: everything has it, it is
   necessary that everything has it, everything has it essentially, and it
   is necessary that everything has it essentially. Existence is another
   of those formal properties: everything exists, existence is an
   essential property of everything, and it is a necessary truth that
   existence is essential to everything.

   But these aren't the only properties that Hick means to include under
   the rubric formal'. Others are such properties as being referred to by
   human beings and being thought of by John. So the idea is not that we
   cannot talk or think about the being in question. On the contrary: we
   can think about it, refer to it, and say of it that it exists. We can
   say of it, furthermore, that we can refer to it.

   Second, in addition to formal properties, we can predicate negative
   properties of this being--that is, we can correctly predicate negative
   properties of it. This is implied by Hick's position as I have so far
   explained it. We can see this as follows. First, note that every
   property has a complement, where the complement of a property P is the
   property of not having P. Each of the properties of which we have a
   concept has a complement: the property of not having that property.
   Thus the complement of the property wisdom is the property of not being
   wise, a property enjoyed by everything that is not wise. And if we have
   a grasp, a conception, of the property in question (wisdom, for
   example) then we also have a grasp of its complement. Now consider any
   property P and its complement -P; the property P or -P is one of those
   formal properties every thing necessarily has. Of course, anything that
   has that property has either the property P or else has its complement
   -P. (For anything you pick, either it is wise or it is not wise.)
   According to Hick's position as so far explained, however, the Real
   doesn't have any positive nonformal property of which we have a grasp.
   It follows, then, that for all the positive properties P of which we
   have a grasp, the Real has -P.

   Here we are speaking of the properties the thing in question has, not
   about our abilities or lack thereof to know or warrantedly believe
   something or other about its properties. I say that every object has
   essentially the property of having P or -P for any property P; I say
   further that if a being has that property, then either it has P or it
   has -P. Still, a being might be known (or justifiably believed or
   warrantedly believed) to have P or -P without being known (justifiably
   believed, etc.) to have P and without being known to have -P. I do not
   know and have no view on the question whether Socrates ever owned a
   horse; nevertheless, either he did own a horse or he didn't. In
   developing Hick's view, then, I am taking for granted a sort of
   realism: the idea that things (some things) can be a certain way even
   if neither I nor any other human being knows whether they are that way
   or not. There is nothing in what Hick says to suggest that his position
   obliges him to take issue with this truism.

   So the idea is that we can predicate negative properties of this being.
   Furthermore, the idea is that we can correctly predicate negative
   properties of it: it has negative properties. Indeed, for each of the
   nonformal positive properties we grasp, the Real has the complement of
   that property (which is a negative property). Among our positive
   concepts, only the purely formal ones apply to this being; as for the
   rest of our concepts, only the negative ones apply to it. The Real
   doesn't have wisdom: therefore it has nonwisdom; it does not have love:
   therefore it has nonlove; and so on for all the other positive
   nonformal properties we grasp. But, you say: it is not possible that
   there be a being that has only formal and negative properties. No doubt
   that's true; still, it is neither here nor there, so far as Hick's
   claim goes. The being in question may very well have positive
   properties in addition to the formal properties; it is only required by
   Hick's position that those be positive properties of which we have no
   concept, properties of which we have no grasp. And we certainly don't
   know that there aren't any positive properties like that.

   We must ask two questions here: first, is this Hickian position
   coherent? And second, is there any reason to accept it?

   [45] A concept's meeting the first condition but not the second (i.e.,
   being such that everything falls under it but not such that everything
   necessarily falls under it) is not sufficient for its being formal. For
   example, the concept either not living on the moon or else not being
   human applies to everything (there are no human beings who live on the
   moon), but it isn't a formal concept in the intended sense.

    B. Coherent?

      1. Can There Be a Being with Only Formal and Negative Properties?

   This being, says Hick, has no positive, nonformal properties of which
   we have a concept; the only positive properties it has are those of
   which we have no grasp. This is not clearly incoherent. We can't just
   see, I think, that there couldn't be a being like that; that is because
   we have a very slim grasp of those properties we don't grasp. We just
   don't know enough about them to know that it isn't possible that there
   be a being like that. Of course, we also have no reason to think that
   there can be such a being: the fact that we can't see that there can't
   be a being like that is little or no reason for thinking we can see
   that there can be. (It is one thing to fail to see that something is
   impossible; it is quite another to see that it is possible.) In this
   case, so it seems, we don't know enough to be able to tell whether it
   is possible that there be such a being. So suppose we provisionally
   concede, at least for purposes of argument, that it is possible that
   there be such a being.

   But if there is such a being, how is it that we are able to refer to
   it, have some way of singling it out as a subject of predication? How
   can that be done? Not, to be sure, by way of the definite descriptions
   whereby Christians believe they can pick out God--such descriptions,
   say, as the all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the world'; such
   descriptions involve positive, nonformal properties of which we have a
   conception. Could we instead use the description: the being that has no
   positive, substantial properties of which we have a grasp'? No; for if
   there is one such being, then maybe there are several more, none with
   any positive, nonformal properties we can grasp but differing from each
   other in positive, nonformal properties we can't grasp. So we have no
   reason to think that that description will work either. (Of course once
   again we don't know that it doesn't work; for all we know or can tell,
   there is exactly one being with no positive nonformal properties of
   which we have a grasp.)

   Now Hick's idea, I think, is that those who practice the great
   religions really refer to this being (the Real, which has no positive
   nonformal properties of which we have a grasp) when (as it seems to
   them) they refer to God, Allah, Brahman, Shiva, Vishnu, the Dharmakaya,
   or whatever. So Christians think they refer to a being who is personal,
   loving, knowledgeable, and the like; the fact is, however, they do not
   refer to such a being, but to a being who doesn't have any of these
   properties or, indeed, any other positive properties of which we have a
   grasp. Is this really possible? Is it possible that we refer to a
   being, thinking it has properties P[1],. . .,P[n], when, in fact, it
   doesn't have any of those properties or any other positive properties
   of which we have a conception? This too is not at any rate clearly
   impossible. It can certainly happen that we refer to a being when we
   are very much mistaken about the properties it has. I have never met
   you; in a letter, I tell you that I am a world-class tennis player and
   an athlete of enviable talents; the fact is that I am a complete duffer
   at tennis and at every similar activity. I go on to claim that I have a
   tenor voice to rival Pavarotti's, have a Nobel prize in economics, am
   strikingly handsome, and write splendid poetry; all of this is
   whoppingly false. (In fact, I am unable even to appreciate any poetry
   above the level of William E. McGonagall, poet and tragedian, [46] know
   absolutely nothing about economics, can't sing a note, and am very
   plain.) Then I have few of the properties you ascribe to me; still, you
   can refer to me.

   Of course, there must be some kind of connection between us. You can't
   pick me out as that handsome tenor-cum-poet-cum-economist who lives in
   (say) Jamestown, North Dakota; that description doesn't apply to me.
   [47] However you can refer to me as the one who wrote you a letter
   claiming to be all these things (supposing you received only one such
   letter). And perhaps something similar would be so for the Real. How is
   the reference supposed to go? Well, presumably Hick's idea is that we
   can refer to the Real as the being that the practitioners of the great
   religions refer to when they think they are referring to beings with
   the properties ascribed to God, Allah, Brahman, Vishnu, and the like.
   Obviously, that just pushes the problem back a step: how do they refer
   to it? How does it happen that when Christians use the term God' they
   are, in fact, referring to this being that has no positive properties
   they grasp, despite the fact that they think they are referring to a
   being with a lot of positive properties of that sort? Again, there
   would have to be some connection between them and the Real. (It isn't
   the case, of course, that the practitioners of Christianity, say,
   hypothesize that there is a being with no positive properties of which
   we have a grasp to whom they refer when they think they are referring
   to an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good creator of the universe;
   that would make no sense.) So how do they refer to this being? Well,
   presumably this could happen only if they had some kind of experiential
   contact with it, experienced this being in one way or another (whatever
   precisely it means to say that one being experiences another). They
   think they are in contact with a being with the properties ascribed to
   God; they are mistaken, however--not in thinking they are in contact
   with something, but in thinking the something with which they are in
   contact has the properties they ascribe to God.

   Now perhaps this is possible: still, it does require a
   modification--and a significant modification--of Hick's position. If
   this is the way the wind blows, then the Real enjoys at least one
   positive nonformal property of which we have a conception: the property
   being experienced by us. It stands in at least one positive nonformal
   relation of which we have a conception: the relation being experienced
   by. (So the ambiguity we noted above, pp. 44-45, must be resolved in
   favor of the alternative according to which we do experience the Real.)
   And that may lead to more, for what is involved in something's being
   experienced by us or by the practitioners of the great religions? What
   is it for something to be experienced by us? Here there are several
   views. One is that the thing in question appears to us, in a way that
   defies further analysis. Another is that it causes us to be appeared to
   in a certain way, or causes some other kind of experience in us (and
   meets certain other conditions). What these have in common is at the
   least the idea that in order to experience the Real, we must be in
   causal contact with it, stand in a causal relation with it.

   There is perhaps one alternative to be found in the history of
   philosophy: that would be the idea that we could experience something,
   perhaps in an analogically extended sense of experience', if there were
   a preestablished harmony between experiential states of ours and states
   of the thing in question. [48] But that, too, would involve the thing
   in question's being in a causal relation to the thing or person (in
   Leibniz's thought, God) who arranges the preestablished harmony. Here,
   too, therefore, a causal relation would be required between the thing
   experienced and something else, so that here, too, that thing stands in
   causal relations and (perhaps at one or more removes) in causal
   relations to the experiencing subject.

   And this means that Hick or a Hickian (for perhaps we are going beyond
   Hick's position here) must also ascribe another positive nonformal
   property to the Real: the property of being causally connected with us
   human beings. This is not a merely formal property, and it is also not
   a negative property. Still further, it may involve additional
   properties: whatever properties are necessarily connected with standing
   in a causal relation to human beings. The thing in question could not,
   for example, be like numbers and propositions are ordinarily thought to
   be: abstract objects that are incapable of standing in causal
   relations. So the being in question must have the property of being a
   concrete object, as opposed to an abstract object. The property of
   being a concrete object is also a nonformal property (many things lack
   it); as we shall see below, it isn't easy to tell whether it is a
   positive or a negative property. And of course there may be still more
   properties necessarily connected with the property of standing in a
   causal relation with us human beings.

      2. Positive versus Negative Properties

   Should we perhaps say that this last property--being a concrete
   object--is really a negative property? Why can't we think of the
   property being concrete as simply the complement of the property being
   abstract, with the latter positive and the former negative? Perhaps
   being concrete is really just not being abstract. But this leads to a
   real difficulty: why go that way? Can't we just as well take the
   property being abstract as the property not being concrete, so that
   being concrete is the positive property and being abstract the
   negative? How do we determine which of the two properties really is
   positive, and which is really negative?

   Indeed, are we guaranteed that this distinction between positive and
   negative properties really applies to properties at all? Is there
   really such a distinction for properties? Of course, there is a
   distinction between positive and negative predicates, linguistic items
   or phrases such as is a horse', is not a cat,' and the like. (Both not
   being abstract' and not being concrete' are negative predicates; both
   is concrete' and is abstract' are positive predicates.) But do we know
   that this distinction between positive and negative extends beyond
   predicates to properties? What makes a predicate (in English) negative
   is the presence in it of some negative particle, such as not' or non'
   or un' (as in unlimited') or a' (as in asymmetrical') or dis' or anti'
   (as in antidisestablishmentarianism'). But properties presumably don't
   contain particles or other bits of language. What would distinguish
   positive properties from negative properties? Is there really such a
   distinction?

   This is not an easy question to answer. Can the Hickian perhaps claim
   that he really owes us no further answer? There is a distinction
   between positivity and negativity for properties, he says, and there is
   no way of getting behind this distinction, to say what it consists in,
   what it is that makes a property positive, or anything of that sort.
   This distinction is rock bottom and cannot be explained in terms of
   anything else. There are clear examples: wisdom is a positive property,
   and its complement, unwisdom (enjoyed both by those things capable of
   but lacking wisdom and by those not capable of it), is clearly a
   negative property; the distinction itself is ultimate and can't be
   explained in other terms.

   Well, maybe so, but can we say anything general about which properties
   are positive and which negative? Presumably the idea is that (1) every
   property is either positive or negative, (2) every property has a
   complement, (3) the complement of a property P has the opposite sense
   from P (that is, the complement of a positive property is negative and
   the complement of a negative property is positive), (4) a property
   equivalent [49] to a given property has the same sense as that
   property, and (5) the Real has no positive properties of which we have
   a conception. (We have already seen that there must be exceptions to
   this last principle, but let that pass.) Furthermore, (6) no negative
   property of which we have a conception entails [50] a positive property
   of which we have a conception; else the Real would have those positive
   properties entailed by those negative properties of which we have a
   conception. What about conjunctive and disjunctive properties? A
   conjunctive property P & Q is negative if and only if both P and Q are
   negative. (If P & Q were negative and either P or Q were positive, the
   negative P & Q would entail a positive property, in which case the Real
   would have that positive property.) What about disjunctive properties?
   A disjunction P v Q of properties of which we have a conception could
   not be positive if either P or Q were negative: else the positive P v Q
   would be entailed by the negative P or the negative Q.

   So far as I can see, there is nothing problematic about (1)--(6) at the
   level of logic alone. Indeed, note that we can give a truth table'
   (actually, a positivity table') for the complement of a property and
   for disjunction and conjunction among properties, and note further that
   the positivity table for conjunction is the truth table for disjunction
   and the positivity table for disjunction the truth table for
   conjunction. Mapping disjunction for properties onto conjunction for
   propositions, and conjunction for properties onto disjunction for
   propositions, we can help ourselves to some results from propositional
   logic and see that the logic of properties generated by (1)-(6) is
   consistent, complete, decidable, and so on.

   Nevertheless, there still remains a problem with coherence. It appears,
   initially at least, that some nonformal positive properties are
   entailed by negative properties (given that there is such a distinction
   for properties). For example, according to Hick, the Real is both
   ultimate and infinite:

   Unlimitedness, or infinity, is a negative concept, the denial of
   limitation. That this denial must be made of the Ultimate is a basic
   assumption of all the great traditions. It is a natural and reasonable
   assumption: for an ultimate that is limited in some mode would be
   limited by something other than itself; and this would entail its
   non-ultimacy. (237-38)

   But what about this property of being ultimate? First, what is it to be
   ultimate? Well, at the least it is to be independent of all other
   beings, not depending on any other beings for existence or for
   intrinsic properties. And that sounds appropriately negative.
   Nevertheless, it entails the property of being self-sufficient; and
   that sounds positive. So it looks as if the negative property being
   independent of all others entails the positive property being
   self-sufficient. Of course, it is perhaps possible to bite the bullet
   and maintain that the property of being self-sufficient, contrary to
   appearances, is really negative. Well, perhaps we can live with that.
   But what about infinity?

   According to Hick, the property of being unlimited, being infinite, is
   a negative property: it is the complement of the positive property of
   being limited or being finite. (Here is another case where it is far
   from obvious, initially, which of the pair in question is positive and
   which negative; let's just concede for purposes of argument that being
   limited is a positive property.) Here we run into a real problem. What
   is this property of being unlimited? It is the negative property not
   being limited. Well, what is it to be limited? In the spatial analogue
   from which the notion is taken, it is to have limits or borders. A
   country that is unlimited, therefore, would have no borders and occupy
   all of space. (Again, having no borders sounds negative while occupying
   all of space sounds positive.)

   Now of course the idea is not that the Real is spatially unlimited and
   occupies all of space. But then how does the analogy apply? In the
   spatial analogue, there are two features: an unlimited country is
   unlimited in a certain respect or along a certain dimension: space. It
   is also unlimited by any other country or space-occupying entity. In
   the same way, then, the Real, if it is unlimited, is unlimited along
   certain dimensions and is unlimited by any other being. Christians have
   traditionally thought of God as unlimited, infinite, in both these
   ways. To take the second first, God is unlimited by any other being:
   that is, he is unlimited in power or with respect to his being able to
   accomplish his will; no being can obstruct him, none can prevent him
   from doing what he wills. Clearly, this property, even if we think of
   it as negative, entails positive properties. If God is unlimited with
   respect to power, then he has power, which is certainly a positive
   property. If he is unlimited with respect to being able to accomplish
   his will, then he has the positive property of being able to accomplish
   his will. And if nothing can prevent him from doing what he wills, then
   he has the positive property of being able to do what he wills.

   Being unlimited along certain dimensions or in certain important
   respects is similar. God is not unlimited in every respect: that could
   presumably be so only if he had every property to the maximal degree,
   which is impossible. If, for example, he has the property of being a
   spirit, then he does not also have the property of being a material
   object--a tree, for instance. Rather, the traditional idea has been
   that God has every great-making property to the maximal degree. [51] So
   God is unlimited with respect, for example, to knowledge. And a being
   that is not limited with respect to knowledge has the maximal degree of
   knowledge, is omniscient, all-knowing. Such a being, of course, would
   have the positive property being a knower. [52]

   Is there a way out of this difficulty for the Hickian? Perhaps. He
   might try saying that this being is ultimate and unlimited, all right,
   but only with respect to properties of which we have no grasp. With
   respect to all the properties of which we do have a grasp, it is indeed
   limited, limited in the limiting sense of not exemplifying the property
   at all. It has the complement of every property we have a grasp of; it
   has other properties we have no grasp of; and the way in which it is
   infinite is that it has to the maximal degree some properties of which
   we have no grasp.

   Well, this sounds a little bizarre, but perhaps it avoids incoherence
   (and anyway, who promised us that reality would not be bizarre?). The
   idea is that there is a being that has no positive properties of which
   we have a conception, except for being involved in human experience and
   any properties that entails. This being is also unlimited in that it
   has to the maximal degree properties of which we have no conception.

   [47] But even this might be possible; if I have some other way of
   referring to you but also think that this description applies to you,
   then perhaps when I use that description, thinking it applies to you, I
   do, in fact, refer to you. Suppose God doesn't have some of the
   properties we think he has: suppose, for example, he isn't simple, in
   the classical sense, but composite, with a distinction to be made
   between him and his properties, between him and his existence, and so
   on. Even so, if a creed like the Belgic Confession refers to him as the
   spiritual, simple, creator of the universe, it still refers to him by
   that description, even if the description doesn't apply.

   [48] Kant's objection to this Leibnizian suggestion is that any such
   preestablished harmony would not be a cognitive relation; it couldn't
   support our having knowledge of the things in question. But it is very
   difficult to see why that should be so. Suppose God brings it about
   that our cognitive states appropriately match those of the world around
   us, and suppose the other conditions for warrant are met (as outlined,
   e.g., in Warrant and Proper Function): why wouldn't that be sufficient
   for our having knowledge of those things?

   [49] Where P is equivalent to Q if and only if it is necessary in the
   broadly logical sense that whatever exemplifies either P or Q
   exemplifies both P and Q.

   [50] Where a property A entails a property B if (and only if) it is
   necessary that any object that has A also has B.

   [51] This idea is what drives the ontological argument; see my The
   Nature of Necessity, chapter 10.

   [52] Indeed, the being in question would have at least uncountably many
   such properties: for each proposition P, the being in question would
   have the property of knowing whether P is true. Here I assume that
   there are at least uncountably many distinct propositions. This seems
   relatively uncontroversial in view of the fact that for each distinct
   real number r, there is the distinct proposition r is not identical
   with the Taj Mahal.

    C. Religiously Relevant?

   Even if the view is not incoherent, it pays another price. For suppose
   we believe there is a being of that sort. It is for us an empty idea;
   still, that is not to say that there couldn't be such a being. I don't
   know whether it is possible that there be a being like this, and have
   no grounds for making a judgment either way as to whether it is
   possible. Suppose we concede for the moment that it is. The basic
   question here is this: what reason is there for thinking such a being,
   if indeed there could be and is such a being, is in any special way
   connected with religion? According to Hick, "we can say of the
   postulated Real an sich that it is the noumenal ground of the
   encountered gods and experienced absolutes witnessed to by the
   religious traditions" (246). Why should we think so? What reason is
   there for thinking this being is connected in some way with
   Christianity or with any other religion? Why say that Christians are in
   fact referring to or witnessing to this being? Maybe it is, instead,
   connected with warfare, prostitution, family violence, bigotry, or
   racism. And why think this being, or contact with it, has anything to
   do with "transformation of human existence from self-centredness to
   Reality-centredness" (355)? Perhaps it is especially when human beings
   are in the grip of self-aggrandizement, hate, selfishness, and the like
   that they are most in contact with this being. If it has no positive
   properties of which we have a conception, why is the one assumption the
   least bit better than the other? The basic problem, here, is that if
   the Real has no positive properties of which we have a conception, then
   we have no reason at all to think that it is in religion that human
   beings get in experiential contact with this being, rather than in any
   other human activity: war or oppression, for example. This being has
   none of the properties ascribed by the practitioners of most of the
   great religions to the beings they worship: it is not good, or loving,
   or concerned with human beings, or wise, or powerful; it has not
   created the universe, does not uphold it, and does not pay attention to
   the universe or the creatures it contains. It is an unknown and
   unknowable X. But then why associate this unknowable X with religion,
   as opposed to warfare, violence, bigotry, and the horrifying things
   human beings often do to each other?

   We can put this question another way. Hick suggests that when
   Christians make their characteristic utterances, saying, for instance,
   "In Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself," what they say
   cannot be literally true but can be mythologically true. By literal'
   truth, he just means truth, ordinary truth: "The literal truth or
   falsity of a factual assertion . . . consists in its conformity or lack
   of conformity to fact: it is raining here now' is literally true if and
   only if it is raining here now" (348). The mythological truth of a
   statement is a horse of quite another color: "A statement or set of
   statements about X is mythologically true if it is not literally true
   but nevertheless tends to evoke an appropriate dispositional attitude
   to X" (348). So some dispositional attitudes toward the Real are
   appropriate and others (presumably) are not; some ways of responding to
   it are appropriate and others (presumably) not:

   Thus although we cannot speak of the Real an sich in literal terms,
   [53] nevertheless we live inescapably in relation to it, and in all
   that we do and undergo we are having to do with it as well as, and in
   terms of, our more proximate situations. Our actions are appropriate or
   inappropriate not only in relation to our physical and social
   environments but also in relation to our ultimate environment, the
   Real. True religious myths are accordingly those that evoke in us
   attitudes and modes of behaviour which are appropriate to our situation
   vis-Ã -vis the Real. (351)

   And now our question can be put in terms of this suggestion. Why think
   that "we live in relation to . . . the Real" at all? Either the
   relation living in relation to is merely formal or it is not. If it is,
   then it would have no connection with religion. So it isn't. But if it
   isn't, then (1) we have still another positive property had by the
   Real: the property of being such that we live in relation to it. And
   (2) (and more poignantly) why think we live in relation to the Real at
   all? After all, we don't live in relation to just any old thing--the
   highest mountain on Mars, for example, or the meanest shark in the
   Indian Ocean. If the Real has no positive properties of which we have a
   grasp, what is the reason for thinking we live in relation to it?

   Second, why think some ways of behavior are appropriate to the Real and
   others are not? Again, unless this is a purely formal relationship, not
   just anything is such that some ways of behaving are appropriate or,
   for that matter, inappropriate with respect to it. None of my behavior,
   I think, is either appropriate or inappropriate with respect to the
   highest mountain on Mars or the meanest shark in the Indian Ocean. If
   the Real has no positive properties of which we have a grasp, how could
   we possibly know or have grounds for believing that some ways of
   behaving with respect to it are more appropriate than others?

   Hick, of course, thinks that some ways of behaving with respect to the
   Real are more appropriate than others, and goes on to specify what
   those ways are: we are behaving appropriately with respect to the Real
   when we learn to turn away from self-centeredness and selfishness ("the
   transformation of human existence from self-centredness to
   Reality-centredness"). But why think that? This would, indeed, make
   sense if the Real had the attributes of God: if it were, in fact, a
   person who loves us, and wills that we turn from loving only ourselves
   to loving him above all and our neighbor as ourselves, and has so
   designed us that we attain our end and happiness when we do so. But the
   Real doesn't have any of those properties (they being positive
   properties of which we have a conception). And if it has no positive
   properties of which we have a grasp, why not suppose that hateful and
   selfish behavior are appropriate with respect to it? Or behaving in
   that weak, sniveling, envious way that Nietzsche thought characteristic
   of real Christians? We can't have it both ways. If this being is really
   such that we literally know nothing positive about it (if it has no
   positive properties of which we have a grasp), then there is no reason
   to think self-centered behavior is less appropriate with respect to it
   (granting, indeed, that some modes of behavior are more appropriate
   with respect to it than others) than living a life of love.

   We can put the question in still another way. Hick apparently thinks
   that some religious conceptions or ideas are authentic manifestations
   ("personae" or "impersonae") of the Real:

   And to the extent that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ' is
   indeed an authentic persona of the Real, constituting the form in which
   the Real is validly thought and experienced from within the Christian
   strand of religious history, to that extent the dispositional response
   appropriate to this persona constitutes an appropriate response to the
   Real. . . .

   and of the eternal Buddha nature, he says

   And to the extent that this is an authentic impersona of the Real,
   validly thought and experienced from within the Buddhist tradition,
   life in accordance with the Dharma is likewise an appropriate response
   to the Real. (353)

   Again, the main question here is obvious: if the Real has no positive,
   nonformal properties of which we have a grasp, how could we possibly
   know or have reason to believe that any such personae or impersonae are
   authentic or, for that matter, inauthentic? Authenticity implies a
   certain fit between the (im)persona in question and the Real; but if we
   have no positive idea what the Real is like, we have no reason to think
   some personae or impersonae fit it better than others. Again, Hick
   thinks not only that some do fit better than others but also that we
   have some idea what they are: the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, for example, and also others from other traditions. But how
   could we have reason to think a thing like that? If all we know about
   the Real is what Hick says we know, then for all we can tell, God,
   Vishnu and the Buddha are inauthentic and it is, for example, Ares, the
   god of war, Lucifer, and Stalin (or, for that matter, Uriah Heep or
   Beavis and Butthead) that are the authentic personae of the Real.
   Again, we can't have it both ways. If we know nothing about the Real,
   we have no reason to pick the personae Hick picks as authentic
   manifestations of it. The main point is that if the Real has no
   positive nonformal properties of which we have a grasp, then, for all
   we can see, any department of human life is as revelatory of the Real
   as any other. We don't have any way to pick and choose among them,
   thinking, for example, that the great world religions are where the
   Real manifests itself or where human beings experience it. For all we
   know, on this showing, it is in living like a thugee or like a member
   of the Ku Klux Klan that one is most authentically in touch with the
   Real.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [53] Recall that we are amending this claim from chapter 19 in the
   light of chapter 14; we can speak literally of the Real, but only to
   predicate negative and purely formal properties of it, together with
   those positive properties entailed by its being such that we human
   beings are in experiential contact with it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    D. Is There Such a Thing?

   So the view seems to be of dubious coherence. Stated carefully, it
   isn't initially incoherent. From Hick's point of view, however, the
   most important feature of this alleged being is that it is in some
   special way associated with religion; this being is what those who
   serve God, Brahman, and so on are really referring to; in the great
   world religions, people get into a special relationship to it. And that
   seems wholly gratuitous; perhaps the Real is really connected with
   those who serve themselves, or power, or white supremacy. But I come
   now, finally, to the question what reason Hick has for postulating such
   a being: why does he think there is a being with no positive properties
   of which we have a grasp? Hick's answer:

   The Real an sich is postulated by us as a pre-supposition, not of the
   moral life, but of religious experience and the religious life, whilst
   the gods, as also the mystically known Brahman, Sunyata and so on, are
   phenomenal manifestations of the Real occurring within the realm of
   religious experience. Conflating these two theses one can say that the
   Real is experienced by human beings, but experienced in a manner
   analogous to that in which, according to Kant, we experience the world:
   namely by informational input from external reality being interpreted
   by the mind in terms of its own categorial scheme and thus coming to
   consciousness as meaningful phenomenal experience. (243)

   Why should we want to postulate such a thing, a thing with no positive
   properties of which we have any grasp, but which is experienced by
   human beings in the great religions? More to the point, why does Hick
   postulate such a being?

   The answer, I think, must be explained dialectically. Hick began his
   spiritual odyssey as a traditional, orthodox Christian, accepting what
   I have been calling Christian belief'. He was then struck by the fact
   that there are other religions in which the claims of orthodox
   Christianity--trinity, incarnation, atonement--are rejected.
   Furthermore, so far as one can tell from the outside, so to speak, the
   claims of these other religions, taken literally, are as respectable,
   epistemically speaking, as the claims of Christianity. Still further,
   according to Jesus himself, "By their fruits you shall know them." The
   most important fruits, Hick thinks, are practical: turning away from a
   life of selfishness to a life of service; on this point, these other
   religions, he thinks, seem to do as well as Christianity. The
   conclusion he draws is that where Christianity differs from the others,
   we can't properly hold that it is literally true and the others
   literally false; that would be, he thinks, a sort of intellectual
   arrogance, a sort of spiritual imperialism, a matter of exalting
   ourselves and our beliefs at the expense of others. Instead, we must
   hold that the great religions are all equally valuable and equally
   true. How do we do this? Here is Hick's response:

   But if the Real in itself is not and cannot be humanly experienced, why
   postulate such an unknown and unknowable Ding an sich? The answer is
   that the divine noumenon is a necessary postulate of the pluralistic
   religious life of humanity. For within each tradition we regard as real
   the object of our worship or contemplation. If, as I have already
   argued, it is also proper to regard as real the objects of worship or
   contemplation within the other traditions, we are led to postulate the
   Real an sich as the presupposition of the veridical character of this
   range of forms of religious experience. Without this postulate we
   should be left with a plurality of personae and impersonae each of
   which is claimed to be the Ultimate, but no one of which alone can be.
   We should have either to regard all the reported experiences as
   illusory or else return to the confessional position in which we affirm
   the authenticity of our own stream of religious experience whilst
   dismissing as illusory those occurring within other traditions. But for
   those to whom neither of these options seems realistic the pluralistic
   affirmation becomes inevitable, and with it the postulation of the Real
   an sich, which is variously experienced and thought. . . . (249)

   Now this passage is apparently an argument of some kind, an argument
   for the conclusion that there is a being (the Real) of the sort Hick
   says there is. The argument seems to proceed from two premises: (1) all
   the great religions are "veridical," and (2) none of them is more
   veridical than the others. How does the argument go? The idea, I think,
   is that if we suppose there is a being of the sort Hick says there is,
   then, according to Hick, we can see how (1) and (2) could be true. I'm
   not sure I see just how that is supposed to go, but let that pass. What
   isn't as easily ignored, however, is a sort of incoherence. "Within
   each tradition," he says, "we regard as real the object of our worship
   or contemplation." So within the Christian tradition, we regard God as
   real; it is also "proper to regard as real the objects of worship or
   contemplation within the other traditions." This, of course, leads to a
   problem; for some of the personae and impersonae are such that if they
   are real, and have the properties ascribed to them, then other
   (im)personae are either unreal or do not have the properties ascribed
   to them. Well, perhaps the idea, as Hick seems to suggest elsewhere, is
   that we are to regard each of the (im)personae as empirically real, not
   transcendentally real (not really real); and perhaps we are to
   understand that as meaning that each being is such that by way of it,
   the practitioners of the religion in question somehow get in touch with
   the Real. The essential point, however, is that we are not to think of
   one or some of these as more valuable or closer to the truth than the
   others; that would be arbitrary and unwarranted. We should no longer
   regard as really real (or rather real simpliciter) the objects of
   worship of our own tradition. We must treat all traditions alike.

   Now the way Hick proposes to do this is to declare that all the
   traditions are actually mistaken; the beliefs in each tradition are
   mostly false. ("Literally" false, he says; but literal truth and
   falsehood, as Hick conceives them, are just truth and falsehood.)
   Still, there is something right or valid in religion--the recognition
   that there is something beyond the natural world, and the encouragement
   to live a life in which self-centeredness is overcome. So really, the
   bottom line is that Hick cannot find it in himself to think one
   religion--Christianity, say--is true and the others false, or that one
   is closer to the truth than the others. At bottom, there is a generous
   desire to avoid the self-aggrandizement and self-exaltation he sees as
   attaching to the declaration that one's own religious beliefs are true
   and those of others false.

   Here there are three comments or questions. First, is this posture in
   fact possible for a human being: can a person accept it, and accept it
   authentically, without bad faith or doublethink? I am to remain a
   Christian, to take part in Christian worship, to accept the splendid
   and powerful doctrines of traditional Christianity. However, I am also
   to take it that these doctrines are only mythologically true: they are
   literally false, although accepting them (i.e., accepting them as true,
   as literally true) puts or tends to put one into the right relation
   with the Real. And how can I possibly accept them, adopt that attitude
   toward them, if I think they are only mythologically true--that is,
   really false? I could, indeed, believe that they are mythologically
   true; believing that, however, doesn't move one toward the right kind
   of life; it is only believing the teachings themselves that allegedly
   has that salutary effect. Once I am sufficiently enlightened, once I
   see that those doctrines are not true, I can no longer take the stance
   with respect to them that leads to the hoped-for practical result. I am
   left, instead, in the position of a sad and disillusioned Gnostic. I no
   longer hold Christian belief; I recognize, as I think, that it is in
   fact false. I also see, of course, that those who do accept it as true
   are mistaken, deluded; but at any rate they are in the fortunate
   position of enjoying the comfort and strength and consolation these
   false beliefs bring; they are also being moved closer to the right kind
   of life by virtue of accepting them. Neither the comfort [54] and
   consolation nor the practical efficacy is available to me.

   Second, there is something wholly self-defeating, so it seems to me, in
   Hick's posture. If we take this position, then we can't say, for
   example, that Christianity is right and Buddhism wrong; as Christians,
   we don't disagree with the Buddhists; and we take this stance in an
   effort to avoid self-exultation and imperialism. But we do something
   from the point of view of intellectual imperialism and self-exaltation
   that is much worse: we now declare that everyone is mistaken here,
   everyone except for ourselves and a few other enlightened souls. We and
   our graduate students know the truth; everyone else is sadly mistaken.
   Isn't this to exalt ourselves at the expense of nearly everyone else?
   Those who think there really is such a person as God are benighted,
   unsophisticated, unaware of the real truth of the matter, which is that
   there isn't any such person (even if thinking there is can lead to
   practical fruits). We see Christians as deeply mistaken; of course we
   pay the same compliment to the practitioners of the other great
   religions; we are equal-opportunity animadverters. We benevolently
   regard the rest of humanity as misguided; no doubt their hearts are in
   the right place; still, they are sadly mistaken about what they take to
   be most important and precious. I find it hard to see how this attitude
   is a manifestation of tolerance or intellectual humility: it looks more
   like patronizing condescension.

   The basic problem is that, given our actual intellectual and spiritual
   situation, it simply isn't possible to avoid serious disagreement with
   others. If some people believe p and others believe something q
   incompatible with p, there is no way in which we can avoid serious
   disagreement. If we affirm p, we disagree with those who affirm q; if
   we affirm q, we disagree with those who affirm p; if we propose a
   higher resolution, saying that neither p nor q is true (though perhaps
   each is mythologically true'), then we disagree with both groups. [55]
   But if it is imperialistic or somehow out of order to affirm p, thus
   disrespecting the partisans of q, why is it better to disrespect them
   all by pronouncing them all wrong?

   Third, Hick doesn't, of course, produce an argument for the conclusion
   that no religion could be closer to the truth than others; it is more
   like a practical postulate, a benevolent and charitable resolution to
   avoid imperialism and self-aggrandizement. But is this the way to do
   it? Clearly, in most areas of life, some people are closer to the truth
   than others. If the nominalists are right, all of us realists are
   wrong; if the modal skeptics are right, we modal true believers are
   mistaken; if the white supremacists are right, many of the rest of us,
   bent as we are on toleration, are wrong, and seriously wrong. Why
   should it be different in religion? The idea that in religion we must
   all be equally right and all equally wrong seems no more compelling
   than the idea that in thinking about religion we must all be equally
   right and equally wrong. Hick's reason for thinking all religions
   equally right seems to be a desire to avoid self-aggrandizement;
   shouldn't the same desire lead him to hold that his views about
   religion--his view, for example, that they are all equally right and
   equally wrong--really have no more claim to truth than any other view
   here (for example, the view that Christianity alone, say, is correct)?
   He doesn't do that, and rightly so. We can't properly do so in
   religious belief either. In religious belief as elsewhere, we must take
   our chances, recognizing that we could be wrong, dreadfully wrong.
   There are no guarantees; the religious life is a venture; foolish and
   debilitating error is a permanent possibility. (If we can be wrong,
   however, we can also be right.)

   Our topic, in this book, is the de jure question with respect to
   Christian belief--not the question whether Christian belief is true
   (although, of course, that is the more important question) but whether
   it is reasonable or rational or rationally justifiable to accept it. We
   have been examining a preliminary matter: is there really such a
   question? Is there really such a thing as Christian belief? Or is it
   rather the case that even if there were such a person as God, we
   couldn't refer to and think about him, or predicate positive, nonformal
   properties of him? Our results, so far, have been that there isn't the
   slightest reason to think so. There is no reason at all to think it
   isn't possible to think about God; there is no reason at all to think
   that we cannot predicate such positive, nonformal properties of him as
   wisdom, knowledge, love, and all the rest. Obviously, there is
   enormously more to be said; this topic deserves a book in itself. There
   isn't room for that in this book; so we shall have to content ourselves
   with what we have. At any rate, we can rest in the assurance that if
   there is reason to think our question ill-formed or somehow logically
   out of order, it is at the least exceedingly well concealed. We can
   therefore go in reasonable confidence to the next question: what,
   precisely, is this de jure question?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] According to the Heidelberg Catechism (Q. 1), "My only comfort in
   life and in death is that I am not my own, but belong--body and soul,
   in life and in death--to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ." According to
   Hick, however, my only comfort in life and in death is that I know the
   sad truth: believing the great teachings of Christianity has beneficial
   effects, but those teachings are, in fact, false.

   [55] The same goes if we propose to remain agnostic about p and q; see
   below, chapter 13.

WHAT IS THE QUESTION?

Justification and the Classical Picture


   In part I, I considered a certain kind of objection to the de jure
   question with respect to Christian belief--the question, that is,
   whether it is rational or reasonable or intellectually respectable to
   accept Christian belief. This objection was that the de jure question
   is, to say the least, premature: strictly speaking, it isn't really
   possible to hold a belief of the sort traditional Christians think they
   hold. That is because Christians think of God as ultimate and infinite,
   and there is something conceptually out of order with the very idea
   that it is possible to have a belief about a being that is ultimate and
   infinite. I concluded that this objection isn't cogent; there is here
   no obstacle to raising the de jure question.

   But the next thing to see is that it is far from obvious just what that
   de jure question or objection is supposed to be; precisely what
   question (or questions) is it that critics mean to press when they ask
   whether Christian and theistic belief is rational, or rationally
   defensible, or rationally justifiable, or whatever? Critics claim that
   Christian belief is not rationally justified or justifiable: what,
   precisely, is the infirmity or defect they are ascribing to the
   Christian believer? What, exactly, is the question? Call this question
   the metaquestion'. One problem with contemporary discussions of the
   justification of Christian belief is that the metaquestion is almost
   never asked. People ask whether Christian belief is rational or
   reasonable or rationally justifiable; they turn immediately to
   answering that question, without first considering just what the
   question is. What is it? That is not easy to say; nevertheless, it is
   our subject in part II.

   This chapter is devoted to examining a certain answer to the
   metaquestion: that the de jure question is whether Christian belief is
   justified. That question is one that originates in classical
   foundationalism, a way of thinking about these topics that has
   historically been extremely influential and is still very much with us
   now. According to the classical foundationalist, the de jure question
   is really the question whether Christian belief is justified; but how
   is this term to be understood? I shall examine the seventeenth-century
   roots of classical foundationalism, explore the connection between
   justification and evidentialism that the classical foundationalist
   sees, and briefly outline some of its contemporary descendants. Then in
   the second half of the chapter, I'll argue both that classical
   foundationalism faces insuperable problems, and that the notion of
   justification does not offer a satisfying version of the de jure
   question.

   We must begin with some history--first, a look back into the relatively
   recent past and then a deeper look into the more remote past. With
   respect to the first, I can make my point most easily by referring to
   some earlier work of my own; please forgive the personal reference. The
   present book, as I said in the preface, is a sequel: to Warrant: The
   Current Debate (hereafter WCD) and Warranted Proper Function (hereafter
   WPF); it is also and perhaps more important a sequel to God and Other
   Minds [56] and "Reason and Belief in God." [57] The chief topic of God
   and Other Minds, as I put it then, is the "rational justification" of
   belief in God. I set out to address the de jure question; like everyone
   else, however, I didn't so much as raise the metaquestion. Following my
   elders and betters, I initially took it for granted that this question
   of the rational justification of theistic belief is identical with, or
   intimately connected with, the question whether there are proofs, or at
   least good arguments, for or against the existence of God. You discuss
   this question of the rationality of belief in God by consulting the
   evidence: does it on balance support theistic belief? (If it does [and
   does so strongly enough], such belief is rational; otherwise it is
   irrational.)

   And that question, in turn, was so taken that the way to answer it is
   by considering the arguments for and against the existence of God. On
   the pro side, there were the traditional theistic proofs, the
   cosmological, teleological, and ontological arguments, to follow Kant's
   classification. On the con side, there was, first of all, the problem
   of evil (construed as the claim that the existence of evil is logically
   inconsistent with the existence of a wholly good, all-powerful, and
   all-knowing God). Then there were also some rather opaque claims to the
   effect that the progress of modern science, or the attitudes necessary
   to its proper pursuits, or perhaps something similar lurking in the
   nearby bushes, or maybe something else that had been learned by "man
   come of age"--the idea was that something in this general neighborhood
   also offers evidence against the existence of God. And it was also
   clearly assumed that belief in God was rational and proper only if on
   balance the evidence, so construed, favored it. So here is a possible
   answer to the metaquestion and a candidate for the post of being the de
   jure question: does the evidence support Christian belief? In this
   chapter I want to think about this answer to the metaquestion. Does it
   give us a serious question for Christian believers or a serious
   criticism of Christian belief?

   In God and Other Minds, I argued first that the theistic proofs or
   arguments do not succeed. In evaluating these arguments, I employed a
   traditional but wholly improper standard: I took it that these
   arguments are successful only if they start from propositions that
   compel assent from every honest and intelligent person and proceed
   majestically to their conclusion by way of forms of argument that can
   be rejected only on pain of insincerity or irrationality. Naturally
   enough, I joined the contemporary chorus in holding that none of the
   traditional arguments was successful. (I failed to note that no
   philosophical arguments of any consequence meet that standard; hence
   the fact that theistic arguments do not is of less significance than I
   thought.) I then argued that the objections to theistic belief are
   equally unimpressive; in particular, the deductive argument from evil
   (the argument that there is a contradiction between the existence of
   God and the existence of evil), I said, is entirely unsuccessful. So I
   saw, as I thought, that neither the arguments for the existence of God
   nor the arguments against it are conclusive; but then where does that
   leave us with respect to the question of the rationality or rational
   justifiability of belief in God? Does it follow, as seemed to be the
   prevailing opinion, that agnosticism was the right response and that
   belief in God, under these conditions, is irrational, contrary to
   reason, not rationally justifiable? That seemed to me wrong, but where
   could we go to pursue this question? How could we carry the inquiry
   further?

   Faced with this impasse, I decided to compare belief in God with other
   beliefs, in particular, our belief in other minds. There is allegedly a
   traditional philosophical problem of other minds: since we can't
   perceive the thoughts and feelings of other people, do we know and how
   do we know they really have thoughts and feelings? More poignantly, how
   do we know that what we take to be persons (beings with thoughts,
   feelings, and intentions) really are persons and not, for example,
   cunningly constructed robots? [58] I noted that the dialectical
   structure uncovered in the case of theistic arguments is recapitulated
   in the case of other minds: the objections to belief in other minds
   don't seem at all formidable, but unhappily there also aren't any good
   arguments for other minds--particularly if we employ the same high
   standards of goodness as were ordinarily applied to theistic arguments.
   I claimed that the strongest argument for the existence of God and the
   strongest argument for other minds are similar and that they fail in
   similar ways. Hence my "tentative conclusion": "if my belief in other
   minds is rational, so is my belief in God. But obviously the former is
   rational; so, therefore, is the latter."

   Here two things are noteworthy. First, I was somehow both accepting but
   also questioning what was then axiomatic: that belief in God, if it is
   to be rationally acceptable, must be such that there is good evidence
   for it. This evidence would be propositional evidence: evidence from
   other propositions you believe, and it would have to come in the form
   of arguments. This claim wasn't itself argued for: it was simply
   asserted, or better, just assumed as self-evident or at least utterly
   obvious. What was then taken for granted has now come to be called
   evidentialism' (a better title would be evidentialism with respect to
   belief in God', but that's a bit unwieldy). Evidentialism is the view
   that belief in God is rationally justifiable or acceptable only if
   there is good evidence for it, where good evidence would be arguments
   from other propositions one knows. If it is accepted apart from such
   evidence or arguments, then it is at best intellectually third-rate:
   irrational, or unreasonable, or contrary to one's intellectual
   obligations.

   Second, I failed to ask why this question of rational justifiability is
   important or, indeed, what the question is. I didn't give that
   question--namely, the question what is this rational justifiability of
   which I am speaking?--so much as a passing glance. Further, why would
   rational justification, whatever precisely it is, require evidence?
   What is the connection between evidence and justification? And if the
   latter does require evidence, why would that evidence have to take the
   form of arguments (deductive or probabilistic), evidence from other
   propositions one already believes? And what sorts of propositions could
   properly function as the premises of these arguments? I didn't raise
   these questions. It wasn't, however, because their answers were
   well-known, so that further inquiry would be carrying coals to
   Newcastle. On the contrary: no one else asked or answered these
   questions either; instead, people turned directly to the arguments for
   and against theistic belief, taking it utterly for granted that this
   was the way to investigate its rational justification. [59] Taking
   evidentialism for granted was de rigueur then and is still popular now.
   But what is this rational justification? And why does it require
   evidence, propositional evidence? And how does it happen that everyone
   just took for granted this connection between justification and
   propositional evidence? These are some of the questions we must ask.

  I. John Locke

   Here what we need is another bit of history, some more of that
   archaeology of which Foucault speaks (although again [see WCD, p. 11] I
   doubt that we will uncover a hidden political agenda or a subterranean
   bid for power). This question as to the rational justifiability of
   Christian belief goes back to the Enlightenment response to the
   spiritual and intellectual ferment generated (in part) by the
   Reformation; the characteristically modern response to this ferment can
   be seen as getting its start in the works of RenÃ© Descartes and John
   Locke. Both Descartes and Locke were impressed by the enormous
   disagreement in religious and philosophical matters; this means, of
   course, that error pervades our belief in these areas. They were also
   impressed (along with their successors) with the meager progress made
   in philosophical matters. Philosophy, said Descartes, "has been
   cultivated for many centuries by the best minds that have ever lived,
   and nevertheless no single thing is to be found in it which is not a
   subject of dispute, and in consequence which is not dubious." [60]
   Descartes has his remedy (a characteristically modern remedy): start
   over. Discard anything that isn't certain, and rebuild your noetic
   structure on the basis of what is certain. Recall those famous words in
   the introduction to the Meditations:

   It is now some years since I detected how many are the false beliefs
   that I had from my earliest youth admitted as true, and how doubtful
   was everything I had since constructed on this basis, and from that
   time I was convinced that I must once for all seriously undertake to
   rid myself of all the opinions which I formerly accepted, and commence
   to build anew from the foundation. . . . [61]

   It is John Locke, however, not Descartes, who is probably most crucial
   for our understanding of the de jure question and the modern compulsion
   to ask it. [62] In the "Epistle to the Reader" prefacing his long,
   rambling An Essay concerning Human Understanding, Locke recounts a
   meeting with "five or six friends," in which they discussed a certain
   subject that Locke doesn't there identify:

   [They] found themselves quickly at a stand, by the difficulties that
   rose on every side. After we had awhile puzzled ourselves, without
   coming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it
   came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course; and that before we
   set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to
   examine our own abilities, and see what objects our understandings
   were, or were not, fitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company,
   who all readily assented; and thereupon it was agreed that this should
   be our first inquiry. [63]

   That discussion was the genesis of the Essay; it probably took place in
   the winter of 1670-71, [64] and a momentous meeting it was. The book
   itself wasn't finished (or at least published) for another eighteen
   years or so, which accounts in part for its length and rather
   disorganized, repetitious character.

   Locke doesn't tell us what the topic of discussion was, but James
   Tyrell, one of the five or six friends at the gathering, noted in the
   margin of his copy of the Essay (now in the British Museum) that the
   topic of discussion was "the principles of morality and revealed
   religion." [65] And Locke's Essay has been immensely influential in
   modern thought on this topic; it is perhaps not too much to say that
   his seminal work is the single most important source of the way of
   thinking on these topics that has dominated Western thought for the
   last three centuries. This book ushers in epistemology in the West. It
   is not, of course, that previous philosophers had nothing to say about
   epistemology. After all, Plato's Theaetetus asks one of the main
   questions in the theory of knowledge: what is it that must be added to
   mere true belief to get knowledge? What is that quality or quantity,
   enough of which makes the difference between true belief and knowledge?
   Aristotle and Aquinas, furthermore, had much to say about scientia,
   scientific knowledge, and also much to say about how the process of
   intellection works, what goes on when someone knows or believes
   something. Still, the questions Locke asked and the answers he gave
   have a peculiarly modern ring; we resonate to them, because his way of
   thinking about them became the modern way of thinking about them; and
   despite postmodern proclamations of the death or end of epistemology,
   this is still, for the most part, our way of thinking about these
   matters.

   Locke lived through one of the most turbulent periods of British
   intellectual and spiritual history; it was, in particular, the
   religious ferment and diversity, the enormous variety of religious
   opinion, that caught his attention. Of course he knew that in parts of
   the world other than Europe there were religions quite different from
   Christianity, but he was particularly impressed by the diversity of
   religious opinion in his own country. There was the Catholic-Protestant
   debate, and within Protestantism there were countless sects, countless
   disagreements and controversies; it was a time when every man thought
   what was right in his own eyes. Locke proposes to inquire into

   the grounds of those persuasions which are to be found amongst men, so
   various, different, and wholly contradictory; and yet asserted
   somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence, that he that
   shall take a view of the opinions of mankind, observe their opposition,
   and at the same time consider the fondness and devotion wherewith they
   are embraced, the resolution and eagerness wherewith they are
   maintained, may perhaps have reason to suspect, that either there is no
   such thing as truth at all, or that mankind hath no sufficient means to
   attain a certain knowledge of it. (Locke's Introduction to the Essay,
   para. 2, p. 27)

   One problem here, says Locke, is fideism; many oppose faith to reason,
   declaring both that faith prescribes what reason proscribes, and that
   it is faith that is to be accepted and followed:

   For, to this crying up of faith in opposition [his emphasis] to reason,
   we may, I think, in good measure ascribe those absurdities that fill
   almost all the religions which possess and divide mankind. For men
   having been principled with an opinion, that they must not consult
   reason in the things of religion, however apparently contradictory to
   common sense and the very principles of all their knowledge, have let
   loose their fancies and natural superstition; and have been by them led
   into so strange opinions, and extravagant practices in religion, that a
   considerate man cannot but stand amazed at their follies, and judge
   them so far from being acceptable to the great and wise God, that he
   cannot avoid thinking them ridiculous and offensive to a sober good
   man. So that, in effect, religion, which should most distinguish us
   from beasts, and ought most peculiarly to elevate us, as rational
   creatures, above brutes, is that wherein men often appear most
   irrational, and more senseless than beasts themselves (bk. IV, chap.
   xviii, para. 11, p. 426)

   Another source of riotous error and confusion in religion is tradition,
   believing a proposition just because you have been taught it or because
   those around you believe it:

   The great obstinacy that is to be found in men firmly believing quite
   contrary opinions, though many times equally absurd, in the various
   religions of mankind, are as evident a proof as they are an unavoidable
   consequence of this way of reasoning from received traditional
   principles. So that men will disbelieve their own eyes, renounce the
   evidence of their senses, and give their own experience the lie, rather
   than admit of anything disagreeing with these sacred tenets. (IV, xx,
   10, p. 450)

   Tradition, he says (in characteristic Enlightenment disparagement),

   keeps in ignorance or error more people than all the other [the other
   sources of error] together . . . I mean the giving up our assent to the
   common received opinions, either of our friends or party, neighbourhood
   or country. How many men have no other ground for their tenets, than
   the supposed honesty, or learning, or number of those of the same
   profession? (IV, xx, 17, pp. 456-57)

   Appeals to tradition to settle disagreement had become ineffective;
   there were just too many. One had to choose which of these many
   conflicting traditions to endorse. Locke thought this disorderly
   pluralism quite scandalous; it was even more scandalous that there
   seemed no rational way to put an end to the contentious disputes.

   The Essay was Locke's attempt to do what he could to put matters right.
   Book IV, "Of Knowledge and Probability," is the end of the book--both
   in comprising the last three hundred pages or so and in dealing with
   the question whose resolution is Locke's goal; and even in book IV he
   spends another two hundred pages before explicitly addressing it. That
   main question is: how should we regulate our opinion with respect to
   belief in general? In particular, how shall we regulate our opinion
   with respect to religious belief? As A. D. Woozley [66] says, this is
   the principal topic of the Essay. As he also says, readers often don't
   get to it, being a bit disheartened by having to wade through what
   amounts to a six-hundred-page preface. Still, it is what he says on
   this head that is most crucial to an understanding of Locke's
   enterprise, as well as to our metaquestion.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Living by Reason

   The initial problem, of course, is that disorderly crowd of opinions:
   "men, extending their inquiries beyond their capacities, and letting
   their thought wander into those depths where they can find no sure
   footing, it is no wonder that they raise questions and multiply
   disputes, which, never coming to any clear resolution, are proper only
   to continue and increase their doubts, and to confirm them at last in
   perfect skepticism" (Locke's Introduction to the Essay, para. 7, p.
   31). Like Hume and Kant after him, Locke thinks the remedy requires
   that we first make a juster and more accurate appraisal of our
   intellectual capacities and capabilities:

   Whereas were the capacities of our understandings well considered, the
   extent of our knowledge once discovered, and the horizon found which
   sets the bounds between the enlightened and dark parts of things;
   between what is and what is not comprehensible by us, men would perhaps
   with less scruple acquiesce in the avowed ignorance of the one, and
   employ their thoughts and discourse with more advantage and
   satisfaction in the other. (Locke's Introduction to the Essay, para. 7,
   p. 31)

   The aim is not to achieve Cartesian certainty (about which he makes
   several disparaging remarks). Rather, "If we can find out those
   measures, whereby a rational creature, put in that state in which man
   is in this world, may and ought to govern his opinions, and actions
   depending thereon, we need not to be troubled that some other things
   escape our knowledge" (Introduction, para. 6, p. 31). What we need to
   find out is how we may and ought to govern and regulate our opinion, or
   assent. And his answer, in prototypical Enlightenment fashion, is that
   we ought to govern our opinion by following reason. But what does that
   mean? What is opinion and what is reason, and how can we govern the
   former by following the latter?

      1. Opinion

   If we are to have any hope of overcoming the contentious and
   disputatious horde of conflicting opinion with which we are beset, says
   Locke, we must all learn to govern opinion and assent properly.
   Following Plato, Locke thinks of opinion as contrasting with knowledge;
   to see what he thinks opinion is, we must therefore look to his views
   about knowledge. He thinks we have four kinds of knowledge, all of them
   involving certainty. First, there is what he regards as the paradigm of
   knowledge: perceiving the "agreement or disagreement of our ideas." It
   isn't easy to see precisely what he had in mind here, but the principal
   sort of knowledge involved here is the knowledge of self-evident
   propositions, such propositions as 2 + 1 = 3. [67] A properly
   functioning human being can simply see that these propositions are true
   (and further, that they couldn't possibly be false). There is no issue
   of regulating this kind of belief, says Locke, because a properly
   formed human being simply can't withhold belief from self-evident
   propositions: "This part of knowledge is irresistible, and like bright
   sunshine, forces itself immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever
   the mind turns its view that way; and leaves no room for hesitation,
   doubt, or examination, but the mind is presently filled with the clear
   light of it" (IV, ii, 1, p. 177). Such knowledge is certain; it is
   "beyond all doubt, and needs no probation, nor can have any; this being
   the highest of all human certainty" (IV, xvii, 14, p. 407).

   Second, there is knowledge of propositions about the contents of your
   own mind, that is, propositions about the ideas of which you are the
   subject. An example would be your knowledge that you have a mild pain
   in your left elbow, or that you seem to see something white (i.e.,
   things look to you the way they look when you are in fact seeing
   something white). This knowledge, says Locke, is infallible (IV, i, 4,
   p. 169, and elsewhere). This means at least that you cannot mistakenly
   believe such a proposition; if you believe that you seem to see
   something white, it follows that you do seem to see something white
   (though, of course, you may be mistaken in thinking there really is
   something white there). Following later custom, let's say that
   propositions of this sort about my own mental states are incorrigible
   for me.

   Third, there is also a kind of knowledge of "other things," of external
   objects around you:

   And of this, the greatest assurance I can possibly have, and to which
   my faculties can attain, is the testimony of my eyes, which are the
   proper and sole judges of this thing; whose testimony I have reason to
   rely on as so certain, that I can no more doubt, whilst I write this,
   that I see white and black, and that something really exists that
   causes that sensation in me, than that I write or move my hand; which
   is a certainty as great as human nature is capable of, concerning the
   existence of anything, but a man's self alone, and of God. (IV, xi, 2,
   pp. 326-27; see also IV, ii, 14, p. 186)

   It isn't wholly clear just what it is I know here: do I know that the
   piece of paper is white, that my hand is moving, and that the ink is
   black? Locke vacillates. Sometimes (for example, when commenting on the
   relation between faith and reason) he speaks as if our knowledge of
   external objects includes the sort of everyday knowledge we get from
   perception: that my hand is moving, that the trees in the backyard are
   budding, and so on. Other times, and perhaps when he's being more
   careful or at least more official, he suggests that what we know of the
   external world is much sparser, more like My current ideas of treehood
   and green are caused by something external to me. I may not know what
   these external objects are like (I don't know that they include trees,
   or buds, or objects that are green), but I do know that there is
   something external causing me to have these ideas.

   And fourth, there is demonstrative knowledge. I can come to know a
   proposition by deducing it from or seeing that it is entailed by
   propositions of the above three sorts (where a proposition p entails a
   proposition q just if it is not possible, in the broadly logical sense,
   that p be true and q false. [68] Accordingly, some propositions that
   you can deduce from propositions that are self-evident, incorrigible,
   or evident to the senses are also certain for you; among these
   propositions, Locke thinks, is the existence of God (IV, x, 1-6, pp.
   306-10). Indeed, he adds, "From what has been said, it is plain to me
   we have a more certain knowledge of the existence of a God, than of
   anything our senses have not immediately discovered to us."

   When it comes to knowledge, therefore, we have no control over our
   giving assent; assent is elicited willy-nilly, and the question of how
   we should regulate assent in this area therefore does not arise. (We
   can't regulate it at all, anymore than I could regulate the direction
   in which I fall, if I fell off a cliff.) Of course, knowledge forms
   only a part of the beliefs to be found in a human noetic structure and,
   according to Locke, a relatively small part ("Our knowledge, as has
   been shown, being very narrow," IV, xv, 2, p. 364). It is opinion that
   includes the bulk of what we ordinarily believe; and it is with respect
   to opinion--that which we believe but do not know--that the question of
   regulation does arise.

      2. Reason

   Locke's crucial claim is that we must be guided, in the formation of
   opinion, by reason. Well, what is reason? First, it is "a faculty in
   man, that faculty whereby man is supposed to be distinguished from
   beasts, and wherein it is evident he much surpasses them" (IV, xvii, 1,
   p. 386). Second, reason is the power whereby we can discern broadly
   logical relations among propositions (IV, xviii, 3, p. 417), which, of
   course, are the candidates for our assent, the things we believe. In
   particular, by virtue of employment of reason, we distinguish two kinds
   of relations among propositions:

   The greatest part of our knowledge depends upon deductions and
   intermediate ideas: and in those cases where we are fain to substitute
   assent instead of knowledge, and take propositions for true, without
   being certain they are so, we have need to find out, examine, and
   compare the grounds of their probability. In both these cases, the
   faculty which finds out the means, and rightly applies them, to
   discover certainty in the one, and probability in the other, is that
   which we call reason. For, as reason perceives the necessary and
   indubitable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another, in
   each step of any demonstration that produces knowledge; so it likewise
   perceives the probable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to
   another, in every step of a discourse, to which it will think assent
   due. (IV, xvii, 2, p. 387)

   It is by reason, therefore, that we perceive deductive and
   probabilistic relations among propositions. We needn't say anything
   here about deductive relations between propositions; and while much
   needs to be said about probability, Locke doesn't say it. He does say a
   little, however, beginning rather inauspiciously by declaring,
   "Probability is likeliness to be true" (IV, xv, 3, p. 365). The
   uninformative character of this, however, is ameliorated by his
   pointing out [69] that probability has to do with what occurs for the
   most part' in our experience; and he adds that testimony from others
   also establishes probability (IV, xv, 4, pp. 365-66). Locke seems to
   think of probability as an objective relation among propositions; he
   probably also thinks that it is a quasi-logical relationship among
   them; his views, therefore, may be precursors of those of J. M. Keynes,
   Rudolf Carnap, and others. [70] Probability, furthermore, comes in
   degrees: "Upon these grounds depends the probability of any
   proposition: and as the conformity of our knowledge, as the certainty
   of observations, as the frequency and constancy of experience, and the
   number and credibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree
   with it, so is any proposition in itself more or less probable" (IV,
   xv, 6, p. 367). Here he seems to suggest that a proposition is probable
   to some degree "in itself"; he is better understood, I think, as
   holding that probability is a relation between propositions. A
   proposition has a certain degree of probability for me' (i.e., relative
   to those propositions that are certain for me); what counts with
   respect to the formation of my opinion is the probability of the
   candidate in question with respect to what is certain for me.

      3. Regulating Opinion by Reason

   Locke's claim is that we should regulate our opinion or assent by
   reason; but what does this mean? How do you do a thing like that? His
   answer, fundamentally, is that I must regulate my opinion in such a way
   that I opine only that which is probable with respect to that which is
   certain for me. I have no control over my assent when it comes to
   knowledge, what is certain for me; however, I do have control over my
   assent when it comes to opinion, what isn't certain. And the rule here
   is that I must not assent to a proposition unless it is probable with
   respect to what is certain for me. Assent, furthermore, comes in
   degrees [71] (IV, xvi, 1, p. 369). More exactly, then, the rule is that
   I should proportion my degree of assent to the probability of the
   proposition in question: "The grounds of probability we have laid down
   in the foregoing chapter: as they are the foundations on which our
   assent is built, so are they also the measure whereby its several
   degrees are, or ought to be regulated" (IV, xvi, 1, p. 369). More
   specifically, for any proposition that comes to my attention, I should
   proportion my degree of assent to it to the degree to which that
   proposition is probable with respect to what is certain for me. Proper
   procedure here is "not entertaining any proposition with greater
   assurance than the proofs [deductive or inductive] it is built upon
   will warrant" (IV, xix, 1, p. 429) (probabilistic proofs as well as
   deductive proofs). Another way to put this: I should proportion degree
   of assent to the evidence; that is, I should believe a proposition p
   with a firmness that is proportional to the degree to which p is
   probable with respect to what is certain for me. This is what it is to
   regulate or govern opinion according to reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] For an account of self-evidence, see WPF, chapter 6.

   [68] I do not and cannot know all propositions entailed by those of the
   above sort, of course; some might be much too complicated and difficult
   for me to grasp, and others might be such that I simply can't see the
   connection between them and propositions of the above three sorts. For
   still others, the argument for them is so long and complicated that I
   lack the certainty required by knowledge.

   [69] As Aristotle also did; see WPF, p. 159.

   [70] What he says is consistent with other views, however, including
   the one proposed in chapter 9 of WPF.

   [71] Here I think he means to point to two phenomena: first, that one
   believes some propositions more firmly than others, and second, that we
   judge some propositions more probable than others. To illustrate the
   first, I believe that 7 + 5 = 12 more firmly than I believe that
   Glasgow is west of Aberdeen, but I do believe both of these
   propositions. As for the second, I believe it is reasonably probable
   that all the continents of Earth once formed a supercontinent; I also
   believe that it is more probable that the works attributed to
   Shakespeare were really written by Shakespeare, not by Bacon.

    B. Revelation

   The question that started off the whole discussion issuing in the nine
   hundred pages of the Essay was on "the principles of morality and
   revealed religion." But now we see that we are to regulate our opinion
   by reason, that is, proportion our belief in a proposition to the
   degree to which it is probable with respect to what is certain for us.
   Does this mean, then, that divine revelation, "revealed religion," is
   to play no role in the right regulation of opinion? If that regulation
   demands that we proportion degree of assent to the evidence, what room
   is there for assenting to "the great things of the Gospel," as Jonathan
   Edwards calls them, the incarnation, atonement, and other central
   features of Christianity? Must we conclude that God could not reveal to
   us propositions unavailable by the use of our natural faculties? Surely
   not: "God, in giving us the light of reason, has not thereby tied up
   his own hands from affording us, when he thinks fit, the light of
   revelation" (IV, xviii, 8, p. 423). Even if he does afford us the light
   of revelation, however, must we not regulate assent in such a way as to
   believe what he reveals, only if the latter is probable with respect to
   what is certain for us? If so, how can we accept what he teaches by way
   of revelation? Incarnation, atonement, and trinity don't seem
   particularly probable with respect to what is self-evident or about my
   own mental states.

   Locke answers, first, that God indeed can and does reveal such truths
   to us, and that what he reveals should certainly be believed: "we may
   as well doubt of our own being, as we can whether any revelation from
   God be true" (IV, xvi, 14, p. 383); "Whatever God hath revealed is
   certainly true: no doubt can be made of it" (IV, xviii, 10, p. 425).
   But then does he think these great truths are probable with respect to
   what is certain for us? First, he declares repeatedly that we can't
   properly believe what goes against reason in the sense of going
   contrary to the principles of knowledge:

   a man can never have so certain a knowledge, that a proposition which
   contradicts the clear principles and evidence of his own knowledge was
   divinely revealed, or that he understands the words rightly wherein it
   is delivered, as he has that the contrary is true, and so is bound to
   consider and judge of it as a matter of reason, and not swallow it. . .
   . (IV, xviii, 8, p. 424)

   However, it is not required that to be worthy of assent, such a
   teaching must be probable with respect to what is certain for me.
   Rather, what has to be probable, in this way, is that the doctrine in
   question is indeed revealed, really is proposed for our assent by the
   Lord:

   So that faith is a settled and sure principle of assent and assurance,
   and leaves no manner of room for doubt or hesitation. Only we must be
   sure that it be a divine revelation, and that we understand it right:
   else we shall expose ourselves to all the extravagancy of enthusiasm .
   . . (IV, xvi, 14, p. 383)

   and

   Whatever God hath revealed is certainly true: no doubt can be made of
   it. This is the proper object of faith: but whether it be a divine
   revelation or no, reason must judge. (IV, xviii, 10, p. 425)

   Locke's constant question is how do you know that this is from God?'
   "How do I know that God is the revealer of this to me; that this
   impression is made upon my mind by his Holy Spirit; and that therefore
   I ought to obey it? If I know not this, how great soever the assurance
   is that I am possessed with, it is groundless; whatever light I pretend
   to, it is but enthusiasm" (IV, xix, 10, p. 435). "Reason," he says,
   "must be our last judge and guide in everything" (IV, xix, 14, p. 438,
   his emphasis). He goes on:

   I do not mean that we must consult reason, and examine whether a
   proposition revealed from God can be made out by natural principles,
   and if it cannot, that then we may reject it: but consult it we must,
   and by it examine whether it be a revelation from God or no: and if
   reason finds it to be revealed from God, reason then declares for it as
   much as for any other truth, and makes it one of her dictates. (IV,
   xix, 14, p. 439)

   Overall, then, the view is this: God can certainly reveal truths to us.
   We are not obliged to accept as revealed, however, anything that would
   go contrary to what we would otherwise know, even with respect to the
   lowest level of knowledge. Furthermore, a given candidate p for
   revelation, if it doesn't have evidence from what is certain, cannot
   have any more epistemic probability than is enjoyed by the proposition
   that p is indeed a revelation from God (IV, xvi, 14, p. 383). So we are
   to follow reason, in the formation of religious opinion, but so doing
   does not preclude accepting certain propositions as specially revealed
   by God, and accepting them on that basis.

  II. Classical Evidentialism, Deontologism, and Foundationalism

   In God and Other Minds, I took for granted what was then axiomatic:
   that belief in God is rationally justifiable only if there are good
   arguments for it, and only if the arguments in favor of it are stronger
   than the arguments against it. The origin--at least the proximate
   origin--of this idea is to be found in the work of Locke I've been
   outlining. A belief is acceptable, he says, only if it is either itself
   certain or else probable (i.e., more probable than not) with respect to
   propositions that are certain for me. Christian belief, clearly enough,
   is not certain for me: it is not self-evident, incorrigible, or a
   deliverance of the senses. Hence, if it is to be acceptable, it must be
   probable with respect to propositions of these sorts. Locke doesn't, so
   far as I know, explicitly raise the question whether I must know or
   believe that the belief is thus probable, if it is to be acceptable for
   me; I think he assumes that it must be. He thinks of the matter in
   terms of applying a test: a certain belief p comes within your purview;
   you are to determine whether it is probable with respect to what is
   certain for you in order to determine whether it is acceptable for you.
   But then you will accept the belief only if you see or believe that it
   does pass this test.

   Evidentialism is the claim that religious belief is rationally
   acceptable only if there are good arguments for it; Locke is both a
   paradigm evidentialist and the proximate source of the entire
   evidentialist tradition, [72] from him through Hume and Reid and Kant
   and the nineteenth century to the present. Locke's classical
   evidentialism is one element of a larger whole that also includes
   classical foundationalism and classical deontologism. This connected
   complex of theses and attitudes has been enormously influential in
   epistemology since the Enlightenment, and enormously influential
   especially with respect to our question, the question of the rational
   justifiability of religious belief: call it the classical package. The
   classical package includes ways of thinking about faith, reason,
   rationality, justification, knowledge, the nature of belief, and other
   related topics. It is hard to overemphasize the importance of these
   ways of thinking for the de jure question. We have seen how Locke is
   the fountainhead of the evidentialist tradition, one of the elements in
   the classical package; but he is also a main source, for us moderns
   (and postmoderns), of the other two elements: classical foundationalism
   and classical deontologism. I now turn to them. [73]
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Classical Foundationalism

   First, classical foundationalism is foundationalism. Here the crucial
   notion is that of believing one proposition on the evidential basis of
   others. Like any important philosophical notion, this one has its
   problems, complications, and perplexities. Let's ignore them. The
   notion is serviceable even if it is less than wholly clear, and at any
   rate there are clear examples. I believe that 32 Ã 94 is 3008 (I've
   just calculated it); I believe this proposition on the evidential basis
   of others, such as 4 Ã 2 = 8, 4 Ã 3 = 12, 8 + 2 = 10, and so on.
   However I don't believe those latter on the evidential basis of any
   other propositions at all; instead, they are basic' for me. I simply
   see that they are true, and accept them. I accept many propositions in
   this basic way: that there is snow in my backyard, for example, and
   that it is still white. I also believe, in the basic way, that it seems
   to me that I am seeing something white (I am being appeared to
   whitely), that I had cornflakes for breakfast, and a thousand other
   things. The propositions I accept in the basic way are, so to say,
   starting points for my thought. (This is not to say, of course, that
   what you take as basic doesn't depend on what else you know or believe.
   I believe in the basic way that what I see coming toward me is a truck;
   someone with no acquaintance with trucks or motor vehicles couldn't
   form that belief at all, let alone hold it in the basic way.)

   The propositions that I accept in this basic way are the foundations of
   my structure of beliefs--my noetic structure', as I shall call it for
   ease of reference. [74] And according to the foundationalist, in an
   acceptable, properly formed noetic structure, every proposition is
   either in the foundations or believed on the evidential basis of other
   propositions. Indeed, this much is trivially true; a proposition is in
   the foundations of my noetic structure if and only if it is basic for
   me, and it is basic for me if and only if I don't accept it on the
   evidential basis of other propositions. This much of foundationalism
   should be uncontroversial and accepted by all. [75] Further (and still
   properly uncontroversial), for every proposition in my noetic structure
   that is not in the foundations, there is an evidential path terminating
   in the foundations: that is, if A is nonbasic for me, then I believe it
   on the basis of some other proposition B, which I believe on the basis
   of some other proposition C, and so on down to a foundational
   proposition or propositions. [76]

   Now Locke clearly accepts this much; but he also accepts more. A
   foundationalist will also typically claim that not just any belief is
   properly basic; some propositions are such that if I accept them in the
   basic way, there is something wrong, something skewed, something
   unjustified about my noetic structure. Imagine, for example, that
   because of an inordinate admiration for Picasso, I suddenly find myself
   with the belief that he didn't die; like Elijah, he was directly
   transported to heaven (in a peculiarly warped sort of chariot with a
   great misshapen eye in the middle of its side). If I don't believe this
   proposition on the evidential basis of any others, it is basic for me.
   But there is something defective, wrong, unhappy in my believing this
   proposition in the basic way; this proposition is not properly basic.
   Noting that only some propositions seem to be properly basic, a
   foundationalist may go on to lay down conditions of proper basicality,
   admitting some kinds of propositions to this exalted condition and
   rejecting others. And the classical foundationalist holds that the only
   propositions that are properly basic for me are the ones that are
   certain for me.

   Certainty is another difficult and much contested notion; again, let us
   ignore the difficulties and contests, noting that classical
   foundationalists don't always agree as to which propositions are indeed
   certain in this way. Descartes admits only propositions that are
   self-evident or incorrigible. Locke accepts these as properly basic; he
   also adds, as I said earlier, propositions that are evident to the
   senses'--at least such propositions as something is causing me to have
   the ideas I do in fact have, and possibly also more robust
   propositions, such as that the ground is showing through the snow in my
   backyard. Let's say, a bit vaguely, that according to classical
   foundationalists, a proposition is properly basic, for a person S, if
   and only if it is self-evident for S, or incorrigible for S, or evident
   to the senses for S.

   Further, according to the classical foundationalists (and everyone
   else), you can't properly believe just any proposition on the basis of
   just any other. I can't properly believe, for example, the proposition
   that Abraham lived around 1800 b.c. on the basis of the proposition
   that Brutus stabbed Julius Caesar; the latter has nothing to do,
   evidentially speaking, with the former. Rather, I properly believe A on
   the basis of B only if B supports A, is in fact evidence for A. Again,
   this notion of evidential support is difficult and controversial; [77]
   once more, let us ignore the difficulties and controversies and note
   that different classical foundationalists propose different evidential
   relationships as being what is required if my belief of A on the basis
   of belief B is to be proper. Descartes seems to suggest that a
   proposition is acceptable in the superstructure of my noetic structure
   only if I have deduced it from or seen it to be entailed by those in
   the foundations. This is an extremely strenuous standard (and in fact
   very few of our beliefs turn out to be acceptable on this standard.)
   Locke admitted probabilistic support or evidence, and he also admitted
   testimony. Later on, Charles Sanders Peirce and others went further
   still and admitted also what he sometimes called abduction'--something
   like the relationship between a scientific theory and the evidence on
   which it is based. Stating classical foundationalism at its most
   capacious, therefore, suppose we put it as follows:

   (CF) A belief is acceptable for a person if (and only if) it is either
   properly basic (i.e., self-evident, incorrigible, or evident to the
   senses for that person), or believed on the evidential basis of
   propositions that are acceptable and that support it deductively,
   inductively, or abductively.

   In a properly run noetic structure, therefore, if you take any belief B
   that is not basic (not in the foundations), B will be accepted on the
   basis of other beliefs that are acceptable and that support B (either
   deductively, inductively, or abductively); if those others are not in
   the foundations, they will be accepted on the basis of still others
   that are acceptable and that support them, and so on, down to the
   foundations--that is, down to propositions that are self-evident,
   incorrigible, or evident to the senses for you.

   Classical foundationalism, as I say, has been enormously influential
   from the Enlightenment to the present. For many philosophers and others
   (for myself earlier on), it has amounted to a sort of unquestioned
   assumption, unquestioned because it isn't seen clearly enough even to
   recognize as an assumption. Locke's views here, particularly with
   respect to religion, have achieved the status of orthodoxy, and most
   discussions of the rational justification of religious belief have been
   and still are conducted in the unthinking acceptance of that framework.
   There may be modifications of one sort or another, analogical
   extensions of the original framework, departures of one sort or
   another; there may be a sort of unease with it, a dimly felt sense that
   not all is well with it; still, for most of us, the basic framework
   remains in the near neighborhood of classical foundationalism.

    B. Classical Deontologism

   We must now ask a question that has been clamoring for attention all
   along. Suppose your beliefs don't correspond to the standards the
   classical foundationalist or evidentialist holds before you: so what?
   Exactly what is the matter with you? You will be told that your belief
   structure is unacceptable and not rationally justified, and that you
   yourself are irrational; but again, so what? What is wrong with being
   irrational or with holding beliefs that are not rationally justified?
   It certainly sounds reprehensible, but what, exactly, is the problem?
   That is what we must know if we are to understand our de jure question.
   Consider, for example, John Mackie in The Miracle of Theism. [78] He
   believes he has shown that the central doctrines of theism are not
   rational or "rationally defensible" because (as he thinks) he has shown
   that they are not probable with respect to what he takes to be the
   relevant evidence. What does he mean here by "rational"? How is he
   using this protean term? Suppose he is right in thinking that it would
   be irrational to be a theist if theistic belief is not probable with
   respect to the evidence (whatever precisely that is): what is this
   property of irrationality that would then afflict theism or theists?
   Mackie doesn't say. And Mackie is not alone in failing to say. Many
   evidentialist objectors argue that theistic belief is irrational
   because there is insufficient evidence for it; they clearly think being
   irrational is a bad business; but they seldom say what's bad about it.
   Instead, they move immediately to the task of showing, as they think,
   that there is insufficient evidence for belief in God. This prior
   question, nevertheless, remains crucial: insufficient for what? What is
   supposed to be bad about believing in the absence of evidence?

   Contemporary evidentialist objectors don't (for the most part)
   explicitly say; their progenitor Locke, however, does say. His
   question, you recall, is how "a rational creature, put in that state in
   which man is in this world, may and ought to govern his opinions, and
   actions depending thereon." And his answer, as we have seen, is that a
   rational creature in our circumstances ought to govern his opinions by
   reason--that is, proportion his belief to what is certain for him. But
   how are we to understand the may' and ought' and should' that Locke
   employs in stating his project?

   At first sight, his words have a deontological ring; they are redolent
   of duty, obligation, permission, being within your rights and the rest
   of the deontological stable. Closer inspection reveals that this is,
   indeed, how they are to be taken. It is Locke's idea that we have a
   duty, an obligation to regulate opinion in the way he suggests. We
   enjoy high standing as rational creatures, creatures capable of belief
   and knowledge. Noblesse oblige, however; privilege has its obligations,
   and we are obliged to conduct our intellectual or cognitive life in a
   certain way. Our exalted station as rational creatures, creatures with
   reason, carries with it duties and requirements:

   faith is nothing but a firm assent of the mind: which, if it be
   regulated, as is our duty, cannot be afforded to anything but upon good
   reason; and so cannot be opposite to it. He that believes without
   having any reason for believing, may be in love with his own fancies;
   but neither seeks truth as he ought, nor pays the obedience due to his
   Maker, who would have him use those discerning faculties he has given
   him, to keep him out of mistake and error. He that does not this to the
   best of his power, however he sometimes lights on truth, is in the
   right but by chance; and I know not whether the luckiness of the
   accident will excuse the irregularity of his proceeding. This at least
   is certain, that he must be accountable for whatever mistakes he runs
   into: whereas he that makes use of the light and faculties God has
   given him, and seeks sincerely to discover truth by those helps and
   abilities he has, may have this satisfaction in doing his duty as a
   rational creature, that, though he should miss truth, he will not miss
   the reward of it. For he governs his assent right, and places it as he
   should, who, in any case or matter whatsoever, believes or disbelieves
   according as reason directs him. He that doth otherwise, transgresses
   against his own light, and misuses those faculties which were given him
   to no other end, but to search and follow the clearer evidence and
   greater probability. (IV, xvii, 24, pp. 413-14)

   Here Locke isn't speaking about specifically religious faith (faith as
   contrasted with reason, say), but about assent or opinion generally;
   and his central claim here is that there are duties and obligations
   with respect to its management or regulation. In particular, you are
   obliged to give assent only to that for which you have good reasons,
   good evidence: you are to accept a proposition only if it is probable
   with respect to what is certain for you. Someone who doesn't regulate
   opinion in this way "neither seeks truth as he ought, nor pays the
   obedience due to his Maker" (emphasis added); God commands us to seek
   truth in this way and to regulate opinion in this way. Someone who does
   seek truth in this way, even if he should happen to miss it, still "may
   have this satisfaction in doing his duty as a rational creature." You
   govern your assent "right," he says, you place it as you "should" if
   you believe or disbelieve as reason directs you. And if you don't do
   that, then you transgress against your own lights. One who governs his
   opinion thus is acting in accord with duty, is within his rights, is
   flouting no obligation, is not blameworthy, is, in a word, justified.

   The English terms justified', justification', and the like, go back at
   least to the King James version of the Bible. We are justified, in this
   use, if Christ's atoning sacrifice for sin has applied to us, so that
   we are now no longer blameworthy and our sin has been covered, removed,
   obliterated, taken away; we are no longer guilty; it is as if (so far
   as guilt is concerned) our sin had never existed. As a matter of fact
   the term taken in that sense goes back to Wycliffe's 1382 translation
   of the Bible; the Oxford English Dictionary cites especially Romans
   5:16. And Locke is really claiming that you are justified in this sense
   (guiltless, conforming to your obligations and duties) in believing a
   proposition p only if p is either certain for you or such that it is
   probable with respect to propositions that are certain for you. More
   precisely, your assent to p is justified only if the degree of your
   assent to p is proportional to the degree to which p is probable with
   respect to what is certain for you. If you believe in some other way,
   then you are going contrary to your epistemic obligations; you are
   guilty; you are flouting epistemic duty. This is the aboriginal and
   basic idea of the justificationist tradition, the palimpsest in terms
   of which other justificationist notions are to be understood by way of
   analogical extensions. And of course there are analogical extensions.
   For example, if you follow Locke in thinking we have such a duty, then
   you will be inclined to transfer the term justified' from the believer
   to the believed, and speak, as in fact we do speak, of a proposition's
   being justified, or justified for someone, meaning that the person in
   question has a good bit of evidence for the proposition in question.
   You will also say, no doubt, that there is a good deal of justification
   or rational justification for a given proposition, meaning thereby that
   there is a good deal of evidence for it. [79]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [72] In "Reason and Belief in God," I suggested that Aquinas was also
   an evidentialist in this sense; various people (Alfred Freddoso, Norman
   Kretzmann, Eleonore Stump, Linda Zagzebski, and John Zeis in "Natural
   Theology: Reformed?" in Rational Faith: Catholic Responses to Reformed
   Epistemology, ed. Linda Zagzebski [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame
   Press, 1993], p. 72) remonstrated with me, pointing out that things
   were much more complicated than I thought. The fact is that Aquinas is
   an evidentialist with respect to scientia, scientific knowledge. But it
   doesn't follow that he thought a person could properly accept belief in
   God, say, only if he had (or there are) good theistic arguments. On the
   contrary, Aquinas thought it perfectly sensible and reasonable to
   accept this belief on faith.

   [73] I examine classical foundationalism in detail in WCD and "Reason
   and Belief in God"; here I shall be brief and schematic.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III. Back to the Present

   Locke's thought initiates the classical package: evidentialism,
   deontologism, and classical foundationalism. It is according to the
   first two that Christian belief requires evidence; that is, Christian
   believers are within their intellectual rights and conforming to
   intellectual duty, only if they have evidence for that belief. It is
   according to the third that the evidence must trace back, finally, to
   what is certain for them: what is self-evident or incorrigible or
   evident to the senses. This connection between justification and
   evidence has been at the center of the whole justificationist tradition
   in Western epistemology; it has been of particular importance for
   subsequent thought about the de jure question for Christian belief.
   According to this tradition, the de jure question is really the
   question whether Christian belief is rationally justified--that is,
   whether believers are justified in holding these beliefs, and whether
   they are conforming to intellectual duty in holding them. The main
   intellectual duty, however, is that of proportioning belief to the
   evidence, to what is certain. Hence the first version of the de jure
   question gets transformed into a second: do believers have sufficient
   evidence for their beliefs? We now see the connection between these two
   forms of the de jure question: the first is the basic question, but if
   we add (with Locke and the classical tradition) that the main duty here
   is that of proportioning belief to evidence, then we get the second
   question.

   I say Locke's influence--and that of the classical package--has been
   paramount in discussions of the de jure question. If I am right, we
   should expect at least two things. We should expect, first, that those
   who raise the de jure question would put it in terms of evidence,
   argument, propositional evidence, evidence from other things one
   thinks. And we should expect, second, that they also put it in terms of
   justification--justification construed deontologically or in terms of
   some analogical extension of deontology. Both of these expectations are
   amply fulfilled. Of course I don't expect you just to take my word for
   it, and I don't have the space for extensive documentation; I shall
   instead just give a bit of corroborating evidence.

   For the last hundred years, W. K. Clifford's essay "The Ethics of
   Belief" has been cited in discussions of the de jure question; Clifford
   (that "delicious enfant terrible," as William James called him) claimed
   (with charming and restrained understatement) that "it is wrong,
   always, everywhere, and for anyone to believe anything upon
   insufficient evidence." [80] Here we have the combination of
   deontologism and evidentialism. This passage doesn't display classical
   foundationalism as well (it doesn't say what the evidence must consist
   in), but no doubt Clifford was a classical foundationalist; at least he
   thought that belief in God requires evidence. William James's essay
   "The Will to Believe" [81] has been a sort of companion piece to
   Clifford's; it has been cited for almost as long in discussions of our
   question, and because James comments on and criticizes Clifford, the
   two essays have often been anthologized in tandem. James titled his
   essay "The Will to Believe"; "The Right to Believe" would have been
   more accurate. His central claim is that under certain conditions it is
   not contrary to duty to believe a proposition (a proposition that isn't
   certain) even if one has no evidence for it. If believing this
   proposition is a forced option and a live option, for you, and if there
   is no evidence against it, then you have a right to believe it, even
   though you don't have evidence for it. In this way James tries to make
   room for belief in God (even if not full Christian belief) by inserting
   it in the gaps of the evidence. The evidentialism and deontologism,
   again, are evident. [82]

   James and Clifford wrote a hundred years ago and more; but the last
   half-century has seen a host of evidentialist objectors to Christian
   belief, thinkers who hold both that this sort of belief, if it is to be
   rational, must be accepted on the basis of propositional evidence, and
   that the evidence is insufficient. (Among them would be Brand
   Blanshard, [83] Bertrand Russell, [84] Michael Scriven, [85] Antony
   Flew, [86] Wesley Salmon, [87] J. C. A. Gaskin, [88] Anthony O'Hear,
   [89] to some degree Richard Gale, [90] and John Mackie in his
   posthumous book, The Miracle of Theism. [91] ) Although the
   deontological component in these positions is often more muted than the
   evidentialism, it is clearly present and sometimes wholly explicit.
   Thus Blanshard:

   everywhere and always belief has an ethical aspect. There is such a
   thing as a general ethic of the intellect. The main principle of that
   ethic I hold to be the same inside and outside religion. That principle
   is simple and sweeping: equate your assent to the evidence. [92]

   Of course it isn't only evidentialist objectors to theistic belief who
   embrace evidentialism. John Locke himself was an evidentialist, but no
   evidentialist objector. Locke thought that religious belief is evidence
   essential' [93] in the sense that it can be rationally accepted only if
   believed on the basis of good evidence; he also thought the requisite
   good evidence was available. Several contemporary writers follow in his
   footsteps: they accept evidentialism, but believe the evidence is
   forthcoming (or at least aren't sure that it isn't). Among them would
   be, for example, Basil Mitchell [94] and William Abraham; [95] Stephen
   Wykstra defends a "more sensible" evidentialism. [96] Anthony Kenny
   displays some sympathy for evidentialism; [97] as does Richard
   Swinburne: "the use of symbols . . . enables me to bring out the close
   similarities which exist between religious theories and large scale
   hypotheses." [98] Terence Penelhum is no evidentialist, but evidential
   considerations play a large role in his God and Skepticism; [99] the
   same can be said for Gary Gutting's Religious Belief and Religious
   Skepticism. [100]

   Still, it is the evidentialist objectors that most clearly display
   evidentialism. John Mackie's The Miracle of Theism is evidentialism at
   its most formidable; by way of conclusion, then, suppose we briefly
   note the form evidentialism takes in that book. Mackie proposes to
   "examine the arguments for and against the existence of God carefully
   and in some detail, taking account both of the traditional concept of
   God and of the traditional proofs of his existence and of more recent
   interpretations and approaches." He goes on:

   If it is agreed that the central assertions of theism are literally
   meaningful, it must also be admitted that they are not directly
   verified or directly verifiable. It follows that any rational
   consideration of whether they are true or not will involve arguments. .
   . . it [whether God exists] must be examined either by deductive or
   inductive reasoning or, if that yields no decision, by arguments to the
   best explanation; for in such a context nothing else can have any
   coherent bearing on the issue. (pp. 4, 6)

   Mackie assumes that the rational acceptability of theistic belief
   depends on the outcome of this examination: if, on balance, the
   evidence favors theism, then theistic belief is rationally acceptable;
   if the evidence favors atheism, then theism is not rationally
   acceptable. The evidentialism, of course, is palpable.

   Now Mackie takes it that theism is a hypothesis, something like a very
   large-scale scientific hypothesis (the theory of evolution, perhaps, or
   general relativity). He assumes further that its rational acceptability
   depends upon its success as a hypothesis. Speaking of religious
   experience, he makes the following characteristic remark: "Here, as
   elsewhere, the supernaturalist hypothesis fails because there is an
   adequate and much more economical naturalistic alternative" (p. 198).
   Clearly, this remark is relevant only if we think of belief in God as
   or as like a scientific hypothesis, a theory designed to explain some
   body of evidence, and acceptable to the degree that it succeeds in
   explaining that evidence. On this way of looking at the matter, there
   is a relevant body of evidence shared by believer and unbeliever alike;
   theism is a hypothesis designed to explain that body of evidence; and
   theism is rationally defensible only to the extent that it is a good
   explanation thereof.

   Now Mackie thinks it is not a good explanation: he concludes, "In the
   end, therefore, we can agree with what Laplace said about God: we have
   no need of that hypothesis" (p. 253); he goes on to claim, "The balance
   of probabilities, therefore, comes out strongly against the existence
   of a god." He clearly takes it for granted, furthermore, that if the
   balance of probabilities comes out as he says it does, then there is no
   case for theism, and the theist stands revealed as somehow irrational
   or intellectually deficient or perhaps intellectually out of line; as
   he puts it, "It would appear from our discussion so far that the
   central doctrines of theism, literally interpreted, cannot be
   rationally defended." [101]

   But why make assumptions like that? Why think that theism is rationally
   acceptable only if there are good arguments for it? Why think that it
   is, or is significantly like, a scientific hypothesis? Of course these
   assumptions form part of the classical package: well, why should we
   accept that package? Clearly there are sensible alternatives. Consider
   our memory beliefs, for example: obviously, one could take a
   Mackie-like view here as well. I believe that I had a banana for
   breakfast; one could hold that a belief like this (and indeed even the
   belief that there has been such a thing as the past) is best thought of
   as like a scientific hypothesis, designed to explain such present
   phenomena as (among other things) apparent memories; if there were a
   more "economical" explanation of these phenomena that did not
   postulate, say, the existence of the past or of past facts, then our
   usual beliefs in the past "could not be rationally defended." But here
   this seems clearly mistaken; the availability of such an "explanation"
   wouldn't in any way tell against our ordinary belief that there has
   really been a past. Why couldn't the same hold for theism or, more
   broadly, for Christian belief? What is to be said for (and against) the
   classical package, taken in particular with respect to Christian
   belief?

  IV. Problems with the Classical Picture

   The classical picture has been enormously influential in guiding
   thought about the de jure question; its near relatives still dominate
   discussion of it; in particular, the evidentialism of the classical
   picture persists. This picture, however, like some other big pictures,
   doesn't survive close examination; it is subject to powerful, indeed,
   fatal objections. After pointing out some of the problems, I'll
   consider contemporary analogical extensions of the various elements of
   the classical picture to see whether any of them supports the
   evidentialism that is still widely popular and finds such a comfortable
   home in the classical picture. I'll conclude that in fact there is no
   reason at all to think that Christian belief requires argument or
   propositional evidence, if it is to be justified. Christians--indeed,
   well-educated, contemporary, and culturally aware Christians--can be
   justified, so I shall argue, even if they don't hold their beliefs on
   the basis of arguments or evidence, even if they aren't aware of any
   good arguments for their beliefs, and even if, indeed, there aren't
   any. Indeed, it is obvious that they can be justified in this way; as I
   shall argue, that suggests that the de jure question we seek is not
   this question of justification; that question is too easy to answer.

   So, first, what are these problems attaching to the classical picture?
   Recent philosophy has not been kind to classical foundationalism; many
   objections have been raised, many problems pointed out. I shall confine
   my attention to two objections, both fatal. First, as I've argued
   elsewhere, [102] classical foundationalism appears to be
   self-referentially incoherent: it lays down a standard for justified
   belief that it doesn't itself meet. More exactly, the classical
   foundationalist, in asserting (and presumably believing) his classical
   foundationalism, lays down a standard for being justified, blameless,
   within one's intellectual rights: a standard which his own belief in
   the classical picture doesn't meet. Stated at slightly greater length,
   what he claims is that

   (CP) A person S is justified in accepting a belief p if and only if
   either (1) p is properly basic for S, that is, self-evident,
   incorrigible, or Lockeanly evident to the senses for S, [103] or

   (2) S believes p on the evidential basis of propositions that are
   properly basic and that evidentially support p deductively,
   inductively, or abductively.

   Here I ignore the fact that the believes on the basis of' relation is
   not transitive. The classical picture doesn't really require that all
   of one's nonbasic beliefs be believed on the evidential basis of basic
   beliefs; some nonbasic beliefs may be believed on the basis of other
   nonbasic beliefs that support them, provided those others are believed
   on the basis of still other beliefs that support them, provided those
   others. . . . To put this more accurately, say that a nonbasic belief
   is properly based if and only if it is believed on the evidential basis
   of beliefs that are either properly basic or properly based. Then,
   according to the classical picture, every nonbasic belief must be
   properly based.

   Further, I ignore another condition that is really part of the
   classical picture. Suppose I believe p on the basis of propositions
   q[1], q[2] . . . q[n] where the q[i] in fact support p, but I can't see
   that they do. (Perhaps I believe that there is no greatest cardinal on
   the basis of ordinary axioms for set theory, but don't know, can't see,
   and have no reason to believe that the latter support the former.)
   Then, presumably, on the classical picture I am not justified in this
   belief. My duty is to believe a nonbasic proposition on the basis of
   propositions that I can see support it, not just any old propositions
   that happen to support it, whether or not I can see it. Hence perhaps
   we should add what Locke and Descartes take for granted here: if S is
   justified in believing p on the basis of other propositions, it must be
   that those other propositions support p, of course; further, S must
   also recognize that they do so.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Self-Referential Problems

   Now consider (CP) itself. First, it isn't properly basic according to
   the classical foundationalist's lights. To be properly basic, it would
   have to be self-evident, incorrigible, or Lockeanly evident to the
   senses. But first, it isn't self-evident for the foundationalist (or
   for the rest of us). Even if someone claims it has some intuitive
   support, one couldn't with a straight face claim that it has enough
   intuitive support to be self-evident. For if it were self-evident, it
   would be such that it isn't even possible for a properly functioning
   human being to understand it without seeing that it is true. [104]
   Clearly (CP) isn't like that at all; for example, I understand it, and
   I don't see that it is true; and I'll bet the same goes for you. In
   this regard (CP) is wholly unlike 2 + 1 = 3 or If all cats are animals
   and Maynard is a cat, then Maynard is an animal. Second, it isn't about
   anyone's mental states and therefore isn't incorrigible for the
   foundationalist (or any of the rest of us). And third, it obviously
   isn't evident to the senses.

   According to (CP) itself, therefore, (CP) is not properly basic. That
   means that if (CP) is true, those who are within their rights in
   believing (CP) must believe it on the evidential basis of other
   propositions--propositions that are properly basic and that
   evidentially support it. And if they do, in fact, believe it in that
   way, then there will be good inductive, deductive, or abductive
   arguments to (CP) from propositions that are properly basic according
   to (CP). As far as I know, there aren't any such arguments. As far as I
   know, no classical foundationalist has produced any such arguments or
   proposed some properly basic propositions that support (CP). It is of
   course possible that there are such arguments, even if so far no one
   has produced them; but the probabilities seem to be against it. So
   probably one who accepts (CP) does so in a way that violates (CP); (CP)
   lays down a condition for being justified, dutiful, which is such that
   one who accepts it probably violates it. If it is true, therefore, the
   devotee of (CP) is probably going contrary to duty in believing it. So
   it is either false or such that one goes contrary to duty in accepting
   it; either way, one shouldn't accept it.

   But couldn't one who accepts (CP) perhaps find a sort of inductive
   argument for it? [105] Perhaps the defender of (CP) (the classicist',
   as I'll call her) reads Roderick Chisholm [106] and embraces
   particularism'; she proposes to develop a criterion of justified belief
   by assembling samples of justified and samples of unjustified belief
   and finding a criterion that best fits them. She assembles a reasonably
   large and representative sample J of cases of beliefs that, as she
   thinks, are justified, such that the believer is dutiful in accepting
   them, and another such sample U of beliefs that she takes to be
   unjustified, accepted in such a way as to flout intellectual duty. Then
   perhaps she notes that all of the beliefs in J but none in U conform to
   (CP); she conjectures that a belief is justified if and only if it
   conforms to (CP). This would be an inductive argument, of sorts, for
   (CP).

   Here is the question, however: are its premises properly basic
   according to the classical picture? The premises include, crucially,
   the propositions with respect to each member of J that it is justified
   and of each member of U that it is not justified. What form do such
   beliefs take? Well, presumably the sample classes would include such
   propositions as S[1] is justified in believing B[1] in circumstances
   C[1] and S[2] is not justified in believing P[2] in circumstances C[2].
   (The sample classes need not include only actual beliefs, so to speak;
   they should also include clear cases of beliefs that would be justified
   in certain circumstances, whether or not anyone has ever actually held
   such beliefs in those circumstances.) And presumably these are beliefs
   she accepts in the basic way. (She can't, of course, use (CP) to arrive
   at them; that would be blatantly circular.) Clearly, beliefs of these
   sorts aren't either incorrigible or evident to the senses for her; so
   if they are properly basic, then, according to (CP), they would have to
   be self-evident.

   Now here the classicist will be told that she has a really nasty
   problem: she will be told that there aren't any cases at all where it
   is self-evident that a belief is unjustified, such that the believer
   has gone contrary to duty and in fact warrants disapproval and blame.
   The alleged reason is that our beliefs are not within our direct
   control; one can't just decide to hold or withhold a belief. If you
   offer me $1,000,000 to believe that I am under 30, or even to stop
   believing that I am over 30, there is no way (short of mind-altering
   drugs, say) I can collect. Still, this is by no means the whole story.
   A full examination of this question would take us too far afield, but
   first some of my beliefs are indirectly within my control (in the way
   in which, for example, my weight is), even if I can't simply decide
   what to believe and what not to. I can train myself not to assume
   automatically that people in white coats know what they are talking
   about; I can train myself to pay more attention to the evidence, to be
   less credulous and gullible (or less cynical and skeptical), and so on.

   Furthermore, some of my beliefs or belief states are, in a way, within
   my direct control. I don't at the moment have a belief on the question
   of the year of George Washington's birth; a quick look at my
   encyclopedia or a call to my eighth-grade history teacher would remedy
   this deficiency. It is therefore directly within my power to bring it
   about that I have a belief on that topic. We might even go on to say
   that there is a belief on that topic (the one the encyclopedia reports)
   such that it is directly within my power to bring it about that I have
   that belief. Still further, I can be in a state of epistemic sin by
   virtue of failing to have a certain belief. If it is my responsibility
   to care for a child and I see her playing with a suspicious looking
   bottle but don't take the trouble to examine its label, I can't expect
   to deflect blame by claiming that I didn't know the bottle contained
   poison. I should have known. ("I didn't know the gun was loaded"
   doesn't always suffice for self-exculpation; it might be my
   responsibility to know.) And there are plenty of other ways to be in
   epistemic sin by virtue of the beliefs you hold or don't hold. I
   believe that you failed to pay your income taxes last year because X,
   whom I would have known to be irresponsible had I made any inquiries,
   said so; and I was in the wrong not to make further inquiries.) I am
   malicious and wish you ill; the speaker says your thought is deep and
   rigorous; by virtue of my ill will, I form the belief that what she
   said is that your thought is weak and frivolous. Out of vanity and
   pride, I may form the belief that my work is unduly neglected when the
   fact is it gets more attention than it deserves. And so on. Further, in
   these cases it is perhaps self-evident that the beliefs in question are
   unjustified, formed in a way contrary to duty; at any rate I am not
   prepared to dispute the claim.

   So suppose we accommodate the classical foundationalist by stipulating
   that at any rate there are some cases of self-evidently unjustified
   belief: there still remains a real problem for the classicist. That is
   because these cases, at least the ones I can think of, lend no support
   to the claim that it is unjustified to form a belief that is neither
   properly basic (according to classical standards) nor believed on the
   basis of such propositions. More important, aren't there cases where a
   belief is formed according to (CP), but is nevertheless unjustified? I
   shouldn't form the belief that you failed to pay your taxes last year
   on the basis of merely casual inquiry; the stakes are too high. But
   suppose I do just that: your false friend Myrtle tells me you didn't
   pay them; I believe this in the usual way, a way, let us assume, that
   conforms to (CP); I am nevertheless unjustified in that belief.

   And on the other side, aren't there any number of cases where it is
   self-evident that a belief not formed in accord with (CP) is justified?
   Someone asks you what you had for breakfast; you reply that it was an
   orange and some cornflakes. You can't really think of any propositions
   that are properly basic according to (CP) and support your memory
   belief; but isn't it self-evident that you are not guilty, not worthy
   of reproof or blame, in so believing? And of course there will be an
   enormous number of examples of this sort. And the relevance of this is
   as follows: if the samples are chosen in any responsible and plausible
   way (if they are appropriately random'), they will not support that
   conjecture that a person is conforming to intellectual duty if and only
   if her beliefs conform to (CP). Hence, I can't see how a devotee of
   (CP) could responsibly argue for it by way of such an inductive,
   particularist procedure; and hence I conclude that there is probably no
   way in which the classicist can argue for (CP). If so, however, then
   (because she also holds that (CP) is not properly basic) she will be
   unjustified in believing (CP) if it is true; it is therefore
   self-referentially incoherent for her.

    B. Most of Our Beliefs Unjustified?

   In his controversies with David Hume, Thomas Reid pointed out that the
   vast majority of our beliefs do not seem to conform to (CP): at least
   as far as justification is concerned, they are none the worse for that.
   This sentiment was echoed in the nineteenth century by others, in
   particular, Cardinal Newman. Says Newman:

   Nor is the assent which we give to facts limited to the range of
   self-consciousness. We are sure beyond all hazard of a mistake, that
   our own self is not the only being existing; that there is an external
   world; that it is a system with parts and a whole, a universe carried
   on by laws; and that the future is affected by the past. We accept and
   hold with an unqualified assent, that the earth, considered as a
   phenomenon, is a globe; that all its regions see the sun by turns; that
   there are vast tracts on it of land and water; that there are really
   existing cities on definite sites, which go by the names of London,
   Paris, Florence and Madrid. [107]

   But how much of this can be seen to be probable with respect to what is
   certain for us? How much meets the classical conditions for being
   properly basic? Not much, if any. I believe that I had cornflakes for
   breakfast, that my wife was amused at some little stupidity of mine,
   that there really are such external objects' as trees and squirrels,
   and that the world was not created ten minutes ago with all its dusty
   books, apparent memories, crumbling mountains, and deeply carved
   canyons. These things, according to classical foundationalism, are not
   properly basic; they must be believed on the evidential basis of
   propositions that are self-evident or evident to the senses (in Locke's
   restricted sense) or incorrigible for me. Furthermore, they must be
   probable and seen to be probable with respect to propositions of that
   sort: there must be good arguments, deductive, inductive, or abductive
   to these conclusions from those kinds of propositions.

   If there is any lesson at all to be learned from the history of modern
   philosophy from Descartes through Hume (and Reid), it is that such
   beliefs cannot be seen to be supported by, to be probable with respect
   to beliefs that meet the classical conditions for being properly basic.
   So either most of our beliefs are such that we are going contrary to
   epistemic obligations in holding them, or (CP) is false. It certainly
   doesn't seem that we must be flouting duty in holding these beliefs in
   the way we do. I believe in the basic way that there is a lot of snow
   in the backyard just now and that I met my class yesterday; I don't
   believe either of these things on the basis of propositions that meet
   the classical conditions for proper basicality; I do not believe there
   are any propositions of that sort with respect to which they are
   probable. Of course I realize I could be mistaken; but am I flouting
   duty in so believing? I reflect on the matter as carefully as I can; I
   simply see no duty here--and not because I doubt the existence of
   duties generally, or of epistemic duties specifically. Indeed there are
   duties of that sort: but is there a duty to conform belief to (CP)? I
   don't think so. But then how can I be guilty, blameworthy, for
   believing in this way?

   Could it be that I escape blame only because of ignorance? As we saw in
   WCD (pp. 15ff.), there is a distinction to be drawn between subjective
   and objective duty, a distinction that goes all the way back to the New
   Testament. The apostle Paul takes up the question whether it is wrong
   to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Paul holds that this isn't really
   wrong; however, if someone thinks (mistakenly) that it is wrong, then
   it is wrong for him to do so: "I am absolutely convinced, as a
   Christian, that nothing is impure in itself; only, if a man considers a
   particular thing impure, then to him it is impure" (Romans 14:14).
   Certain kinds of actions (e.g., eating meat sacrificed to idols) are
   objectively permissible: if what makes an action wrong is that God has
   prohibited it, then these actions have not been prohibited by God. But
   if I believe they are wrong--say I mistakenly believe they have been
   prohibited by God--then I am blameworthy if I perform them. Conversely,
   certain actions in certain situations are objectively wrong; they are
   not to be done. Still, if I don't know that they are not to be done and
   justifiably believe that they are permissible, then I am not
   blameworthy if I do one of them. My objective duty is what I
   objectively ought to do; my subjective duty is what I (nonculpably)
   take to be my objective duty.

   And perhaps the classical foundationalist can take advantage of this
   distinction as follows: "True," he says, "you are not blameworthy in
   failing to conform your beliefs to (CP). But that is only because of
   ignorance. Fortunately for you, you nonculpably can't see that you have
   a duty to conform your beliefs to (CP); that protects you from blame
   and guilt; nevertheless, you really do have an objective duty to
   regulate belief in the fashion I have described, even if you can't see
   that you do." Here discussion seems to come to an end. All I can do is
   ask my interlocutor why he thinks there is such an objective duty and
   how he came to the knowledge, as he thinks, that there is any such
   thing. Can he do more than to simply repeat that as a matter of fact we
   all have this duty? But why should we believe that? What reason is
   there for thinking it true? Further, I can't properly accept (CP), even
   if by some wild chance it happens to be true. For if it is true, then
   to do my duty with respect to accepting it, I must believe it only on
   the basis of properly basic propositions, and ones such that I can see
   that they evidentially support (CP). But I don't see that any such
   propositions support it (and the evidentialist apparently can't help me
   by, e.g., giving me an appropriate argument). So if it is true and I
   accept it, I will be going contrary to objective duty; but if I accept
   it, I will (naturally enough) think it is true, and will therefore
   believe I am going contrary to my objective duty; hence if it is true
   and I believe it, I will be going contrary both to objective and
   subjective duty.

  V. Christian Belief Justified

   The classical package taken neat, so to speak, can't be right: there
   simply doesn't seem to be a duty to form belief in accordance with
   (CP). Of course there may be other sorts of intellectual duties. There
   is a duty to the truth of some kind. It may be hard to state this duty
   exactly; [108] perhaps it is in the neighborhood of a requirement to do
   your best to believe as many important truths as possible and avoid as
   many important falsehoods as possible. Whatever precisely our duties to
   the truth, I want to argue next that Christian belief can certainly be
   justified and can certainly be justified when taken in the basic way.
   We are construing justification in a broadly deontological way, so that
   it includes being within one's epistemic rights and also includes being
   epistemically responsible with respect to belief formation. (Perhaps
   you will think the second follows from the first.) This is a perfectly
   reasonable requirement; if Christian belief cannot be held in such a
   way as to satisfy it, then there is something wrong with Christian
   belief. But it isn't at all difficult for a Christian--even a
   sophisticated and knowledgeable contemporary believer aware of all the
   criticisms and contrary currents of opinion--to be justified, in this
   sense, in her belief; and this whether or not she believes in God or in
   more specific Christian doctrines on the basis of propositional
   evidence. Consider such a believer: as far as we can see, her cognitive
   faculties are functioning properly; she displays no noticeable
   dysfunction. She is aware of the objections people have made to
   Christian belief; she has read and reflected on Freud, Marx, and
   Nietzsche (not to mention Flew, Mackie, and Nielsen) and the other
   critics of Christian or theistic belief; she knows that the world
   contains many who do not believe as she does. She doesn't believe on
   the basis of propositional evidence; she therefore believes in the
   basic way. Can she be justified (in this broadly deontological sense)
   in believing in God in this way?

   The answer seems to be pretty easy. She reads Nietzsche, but remains
   unmoved by his complaint that Christianity fosters a weak, whining,
   whimpering, and generally disgusting kind of person: most of the
   Christians she knows or knows of--Mother Teresa, for instance--don't
   fit that mold. She finds Freud's contemptuous attitude toward
   Christianity and theistic belief backed by little more than implausible
   fantasies about the origin of belief in God [109] (patricide in the
   primal horde? Can he be serious?); and she finds little more of
   substance in Marx. She thinks as carefully as she can about these
   objections and others, but finds them wholly uncompelling.

   On the other side, although she is aware of theistic arguments and
   thinks some of them not without value, she doesn't believe on the basis
   of them. Rather, she has a rich inner spiritual life, the sort
   described in the early pages of Jonathan Edwards's Religious
   Affections; [110] it seems to her that she is sometimes made aware,
   catches a glimpse, of something of the overwhelming beauty and
   loveliness of the Lord; she is often aware, as it strongly seems to
   her, of the work of the Holy Spirit in her heart, comforting,
   encouraging, teaching, leading her to accept the "great things of the
   gospel" (as Edwards calls them), helping her see that the magnificent
   scheme of salvation devised by the Lord himself is not only for others
   but for her as well. After long, hard, conscientious reflection, this
   all seems to her enormously more convincing than the complaints of the
   critics. Is she then going contrary to duty in believing as she does?
   Is she being irresponsible? Clearly not. There could be something
   defective about her, some malfunction not apparent on the surface. She
   could be mistaken, a victim of illusion or wishful thinking, despite
   her best efforts. She could be wrong, desperately wrong, pitiably
   wrong, in thinking these things; nevertheless, she isn't flouting any
   discernible duty. She is fulfilling her epistemic responsibilities; she
   is doing her level best; she is justified.

   And this is not only true, but obviously true. We may feel in some
   subterranean way that without evidence she isn't justified; if so, this
   must be because we are importing some other conception of
   justification. But if it is justification in the deontological sense,
   the sense involving responsibility, being within one's intellectual
   rights, she is surely justified. How could she possibly be blameworthy
   or irresponsible, if she thinks about the matter as hard as she can, in
   the most responsible way she can, and she still comes to these
   conclusions? Indeed, no matter what conclusions she arrived at,
   wouldn't she be justified if she arrived at them in this way? Even if
   they are wholly unreasonable, in some clear sense? An inmate of Pine
   Rest Christian Psychiatric Hospital once complained that he wasn't
   getting the credit he deserved for inventing a new form of human
   reproduction, "rotational reproduction," as he called it. This kind of
   reproduction doesn't involve sex. Instead, you suspend a woman from the
   ceiling with a rope and get her rotating at a high rate of speed; the
   result is a large number of children, enough to populate a city the
   size of Chicago. As a matter of fact, he claimed, this is precisely how
   Chicago was populated. He realized, he said, that there is something
   churlish about insisting on getting all the credit due him, but he did
   think he really hadn't gotten enough recognition for this important
   discovery. After all, where would Chicago be without it?

   Now there is no reason to think this unfortunate man was flouting
   epistemic duty, or derelict with respect to cognitive requirement, or
   careless about his epistemic obligations, or cognitively irresponsible.
   Perhaps he was doing his level best to satisfy these obligations.
   Indeed, we can imagine that his main goal in life is satisfying his
   intellectual obligations and carrying out his cognitive duties. Perhaps
   he was dutiful in excelsis. If so, he was justified in these mad
   beliefs, even if they are mad, and even though they result from
   cognitive dysfunction. [111]

   Our main quarry, of course, is the de jure objection or question. One
   prominent candidate is the question whether the Christian believer can
   be justified in believing as she does. Take that term in its original
   and basic deontological sense. Then the question is: can the Christian
   believer be within her epistemic rights and epistemically responsible
   in forming belief as she does? Can she be justified even if she doesn't
   believe on the basis of propositional evidence and even if there is no
   good propositional evidence? The answer to this question is
   obvious--too obvious, in fact, for it to be the de jure question, at
   least if that question is to be worthy of serious disagreement and
   discussion. Of course she can be justified, and my guess would be that
   many or most contemporary Christians are justified in holding their
   characteristically Christian beliefs. We must therefore look elsewhere
   for the de jure question.

   [111] Again, what I've really argued is that this believer is
   subjectively justified. Can the classical foundationalist concede this
   but claim that he is not objectively justified, that there really is a
   duty, whether he knows it or not, to believe only on the basis of
   evidence? But is there even the slightest reason to think there is any
   such duty? Here at the least the classicist owes us an argument.

  VI. Analogical Variations
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Variations on Classical Foundationalism

   The classical picture taken neat, therefore, is subject to devastating
   difficulty. Nowadays, however, it is seldom taken neat. Instead, there
   are many analogical extensions or analogically related alternatives for
   each of the three main components of the classical package: the
   evidentialism, the classical foundationalism, and the deontology. For
   example, John Mackie [112] retains the evidentialist component,
   claiming that Christian belief requires evidence on the part of the
   believer. But Mackie apparently construes evidence much more broadly
   than the classicist. In his view as in the classical picture, there is
   a body of knowledge--my evidence--with respect to which a belief must
   be probable, if it is to be justified; however, this evidence includes
   much more for Mackie than it does in the classical picture. It includes
   what is self-evident and incorrigible, of course, but it also includes
   ordinary perceptual judgments, memory beliefs, some basic science, some
   of the maxims of probability theory, and so on. Alternatively, we might
   follow Stephen Wykstra, who concedes that an individual Christian
   believer doesn't need evidence to be justified; still, Christian
   belief, he suggests, is evidence-essential in the sense that there must
   be propositional evidence for it in the Christian community. [113] Or
   we might go still further, following Norman Kretzmann [114] and
   broadening the classical requirement in such a way that what is
   required is only that the believer have evidence of some sort, even if
   the evidence in question isn't propositional. Sensuous experience might
   then be evidence for perceptual belief; other sorts of experience,
   perhaps some of the kinds of experience that go under the rubric
   religious experience', could also be evidence for Christian belief.
   These variations are all variations on the classical foundationalist
   component of the classical picture: according to Mackie and Kretzmann,
   the believer must have evidence, but evidence is more broadly
   construed; according to Wykstra, on the other hand, evidence is
   required, but it need not be possessed by the individual believer, so
   long as it resides somewhere in the believer's community. Mackie,
   Kretzmann, and Wykstra retain the evidentialism (with respect to
   Christian belief) of the classical picture, but modify the
   foundationalism.

   It isn't clear whether they accept the deontological component of the
   classical picture; suppose for the moment we keep that component fixed,
   modifying only the evidential requirement. It is then obvious, I think,
   that the believer can be justified even if there aren't good arguments
   from Mackie-style evidence, even if there isn't good propositional
   evidence in the community, and even if there isn't evidence in the
   broad Kretzmann sense. If it seems to me very strongly that the great
   things of the gospel are true, if upon reading the Scriptures I find
   myself convinced, and if after considerable reflection--on all the
   objections, for example--I still find myself convinced, how could I be
   properly blamed for believing as I do? Again, I could be wrong,
   deluded, a victim of wishful thinking, subject to some kind of
   cognitive disorder: nevertheless, there is no duty I am flouting. If
   the de jure question is whether the believer can be justified, or
   justified without evidence, the answer is still too easy: of course she
   can.

    B. Variations on the Deontology

   The above involved extensions of the classical foundationalist
   ingredient of the classical picture. Note that we can also ring the
   analogical changes on the deontological component, and we can mix and
   match the extensions in a dazzling variety of combinations. I can't
   possibly examine all these multifarious versions of evidentialism in
   all their permutations and combinations, [115] but I do wish to examine
   one particularly salient variety: Alston justification, which is
   believing on the basis of a reliable ground or indicator. Alston puts
   it as follows:

   to be justified in believing that p is to be in a strong position for
   realizing the epistemic aim of getting the truth. . . . I will begin by
   making the plausible assumption that to be in an epistemically strong
   position in believing that p is to have an adequate ground or basis for
   believing that p. Where the justification is mediate, this ground will
   consist in other things one knows or justifiably believes. Where it is
   immediate, it will consist typically of some experience. . . . [116]

   A belief is justified, therefore, if and only if it is formed on the
   basis of an adequate ground. Clearly, Alston justification differs
   radically from the original deontological notion. That is because it
   doesn't contain so much as a hint of the deontology of the classical
   picture: "I reject all versions of a deontological concept [of
   justification] on the grounds that they either make unrealistic
   assumptions of the voluntary control of belief or they radically fail
   to provide what we expect of a concept of justification." [117] Well
   then, why does he call what he proposes justification'? Or better, why
   do I consider it under the rubric justification'? How is it an
   analogical extension of that notion? The answer is that what it
   requires--that the belief in question be based on a truth-conducive
   ground--is an analogical extension of what, according to the classical
   picture, is the relevant duty. There is a complex and interesting
   relation between justification taken deontologically, as in the
   classical picture, and Alston justification (justification as
   truth-conducive evidence or ground). The latter discards the deontology
   of the former, but takes the term justification' to denote the
   condition which, according to the former, is sufficient for satisfying
   the duty that, according to the former but not the latter, is in fact
   laid on us human beings. (I'll leave as homework the problem of
   figuring out how to state this more intelligibly.)

   Now what sort of animal is a ground of belief? A mediate ground of a
   belief, according to Alston, is another belief, on the basis of which
   the belief in question is formed; an immediate ground of a belief is an
   experience, on the basis of which the belief is formed. And what is it
   for the ground of a belief to be adequate? "The ground of a belief will
   suffice to justify it only if it is sufficiently indicative of the
   truth of the belief. If the ground is to be adequate to the task, it
   must be the case that the belief is very probably true, given that it
   was formed on that basis." [118] The idea, therefore, is that the
   ground G of a belief B is adequate just if a certain conditional
   probability is high: the probability that B is true given that it has
   been formed on G. And here the probability in question is an objective
   probability [119] of some sort; if a belief B is justified, then it was
   formed on the basis of a ground G, such that the objective conditional
   probability of B on G (P(B/G)) is high. I form the belief that the
   largest oak in my backyard is now losing its leaves. I form this belief
   on the basis of experience of some kind--as Alston might state the
   matter, it seems to me that the tree is presenting itself to me as
   losing its leaves. Then that belief is justified if and only if it is
   objectively probable that the tree is losing its leaves, given that I
   undergo that experience. Putting these elements together, we can say
   that a belief B is justified--actually, prima facie justified--for S if
   and only if it is formed on the basis of a truth-conducive ground G--if
   and only if, that is, it is formed on the basis of some ground G, such
   that the objective probability that B is true, given that it has been
   formed on G, is high.

    C. Is This the de Jure Question?

   Have we found the (or a) relevant de jure question? Is the right
   question to ask the question whether Christian belief is Alston
   justified? More specifically, the question, for a given Christian
   belief B I hold--the belief, say, that in Christ, God was reconciling
   the world to himself--is whether there is some truth-conducive ground G
   such that I hold the belief in question on the basis of that ground.
   But is this really a viable de jure question? I want to suggest that it
   is not. When we ask the de jure question about Christian belief, we are
   asking whether Christian belief is acceptable, OK, such that a
   sensible, intelligent, rational, informed person in something like our
   epistemic circumstances could or would hold such beliefs. The question
   as to whether such belief sometimes or typically has a truth-conducive
   ground, however, seems to be a very different question. I have two
   reasons for thinking so.

   In the first place, several important sorts of beliefs--a priori belief
   and memory belief in particular--do not seem to have a ground in
   Alston's sense at all, but are nonetheless perfectly in order from an
   epistemic point of view. Consider memory. You remember what you had for
   lunch: lentil soup and a doughnut. This belief isn't based on
   propositional evidence. You don't infer it from other things you know
   or believe, such things, perhaps, as your knowledge that you always
   have a doughnut and lentil soup for lunch, or your knowledge that it is
   now shortly after lunchtime and there are doughnut crumbs on your desk
   and an empty plastic soup dish in your trash. So it doesn't have a
   mediate ground. But it also isn't based on an experience. At any rate,
   it is clear that memory beliefs are not based on anything like sensuous
   experience or phenomenal imagery. [120] There may be a bit of such
   imagery present (a fragmentary and partial image of a doughnut or a
   bowl, perhaps), but you certainly don't form the belief on the basis of
   that image. It is clear that you could remember without having that
   imagery--or, indeed, any other imagery; some people report that they
   have no phenomenal imagery associated with memory at all. So the
   imagery isn't necessary. It is also insufficient; you could also have
   that imagery without remembering. The reason is that the imagery that
   goes with imagining that you had a doughnut and lentil soup for lunch,
   or entertaining the proposition that you did, is indistinguishable (at
   least in my own case) from the imagery that goes with remembering that
   you had a doughnut and lentil soup for lunch. And even if you do have
   fairly explicit phenomenal imagery in connection with this memory, you
   surely don't know that it was lentil soup on the basis of that imagery;
   the image isn't nearly clear, detailed, and explicit enough to enable
   you to distinguish it from, for example, imagery of pea soup, or bean
   soup, or many other kinds of soup. [121]

   Accordingly, it isn't that you know it was lentil soup on the basis of
   this experience; you don't form the belief that it was lentil soup with
   that experience as ground. (The image seems to be more like a
   disposable decoration.) Instead, you simply remember, simply form that
   belief. Or, perhaps more accurately, that belief is formed in you: you
   don't yourself, so to speak, take much of a hand in forming it.

   The same goes (though perhaps more controversially) for a priori
   belief. [122] I believe the proposition Necessarily, if all men are
   mortal and Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. Now there is,
   indeed, a sort of imagery connected with this belief when I entertain
   it--perhaps something like a fragmentary image of the relevant English
   sentence written on a blackboard as in a logic class. But surely the
   belief isn't formed on the basis of that imagery; that imagery isn't
   anything like a ground for it; it doesn't stand to that imagery in
   anything like the way in which my belief that the snow in my backyard
   is melting stands to the visual imagery I now enjoy. Indeed, the
   imagery accompanying that proposition is the same, so far as I can
   tell, as that which accompanies entertaining Necessarily, if all men
   are mortal and Socrates is mortal, then Socrates is a man.

   So many memory and a priori beliefs are not formed on the basis of a
   ground in Alston's sense, either mediate or immediate. But of course
   many memory and a priori beliefs are eminently sensible, reasonable,
   rational, and the like. It therefore follows that a belief need not
   have a truth-conducive ground to be reasonable, sensible, or rational.

   Second, there are also beliefs that do have a truth-conducive ground
   (explained as Alston explains it) but are nonetheless not sensible or
   reasonable. A belief is based on an adequate ground, says Alston, if
   and only if it is based on a ground such that it is objectively
   probable that it is true, given that it is based on that ground. Note
   that (if objective probability conforms to the probability calculus) a
   necessary truth will have an objective probability of 1 on any other
   proposition whatever. Consider therefore the proposition 29 Ã 38 =
   1102: the probability of this proposition is 1 on any condition
   whatever. Any belief in this proposition on any ground, therefore, is
   automatically a belief on the basis of an adequate ground. More
   generally, any grounded belief in any necessary proposition p is
   justified on this account; for the objective conditional probability
   that p on any proposition will be 1. So suppose I am extraordinarily
   gullible when it comes to set theory and believe, say, Cantor's Theorem
   (according to which the cardinality of any set is always less than that
   of its power set), not because I have understood a proof or been told
   by someone competent that it is true, but just because I picked up a
   comic book on the sidewalk and found therein a character who claims it
   is his favorite theorem. Then this belief of mine has a truth-conducive
   ground, but isn't rational or reasonable.

   Further and closer to current concerns, according to the bulk of the
   theistic tradition, God is a necessary being who has his most important
   attributes essentially: there is no possible world in which he does not
   exist, and none in which he lacks such attributes as omniscience,
   goodness, love, and the like. If this is true, then the proposition
   that there is such a being as God (or that he is omniscient, or loving)
   will have an unconditional objective probability of 1, and consequently
   an objective conditional probability of 1 on any other proposition.
   Hence for any ground at all, the probability that one of those beliefs
   is true, given that it is formed on the basis of that ground, is 1. In
   asking the de jure question about belief in God, however, we presumably
   do not mean to ask a question to which an affirmative answer follows
   just from the fact that God is a necessary being who has his primary
   attributes essentially. Suppose God is indeed a necessary being; then
   if I believe in God just to please my friends, or because I am
   brainwashed or hypnotized, or because I am part of an evil social
   system, I will be justified in the Alston sense. If so, however, it is
   too easy to achieve justification in this sense.

   No doubt there are variations on Alstonian justification, and in a
   complete treatment we should have to deal with them. But vita brevis
   est, even if philosophia longa est. I tentatively conclude, therefore,
   that the de jure question is not the question whether Christian belief
   is Alston justified. The de jure question is still elusive.

   Longmans, Green, 1897), was widely anthologized and took the radical
   line (as it was then perceived) that if religious belief is a live
   option for you, and a forced option, then believing even without
   evidence is excusable. See below, p. 89.

Rationality


   We have seen that the relevant de jure question--the question whether
   Christian belief is justified, or rational, or reasonable, or
   intellectually respectable--can't be the question of justification
   strictly so called. That is, it can't be the Lockean, deontological
   question whether Christian believers are or can be epistemically
   responsible, within their epistemic rights, flouting no epistemic
   duties, in believing as they do. That question, we saw, is much too
   easy to answer: obviously, a believer--even an intelligent,
   well-educated, contemporary believer who has heard and considered all
   the objections--can be justified in this original sense. We saw also
   that there are analogically extended senses of the term justification';
   but none of them is such that it is clear that a Christian believer
   can't be justified, in that sense, in holding Christian belief.
   Believers may be mistaken; they may be deluded; they may be foolish;
   they may be insufficiently critical (in a way that doesn't involve
   blameworthiness); but there is no reason to think either that they are
   inevitably derelict in their epistemic duties or that they are
   unjustified in one of those analogical extensions of the term.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Some Assorted Versions of Rationality

   Of course there are other questions lurking in the nearby bushes, other
   ways to construe the de jure question. In particular, we can ask
   whether the believer is rational in believing as she does. Many who put
   the de jure question or urge a de jure criticism put it in terms of
   rationality, not justification. (More often, they put it both ways,
   sometimes just using the one as a synonym for the other.) So suppose we
   look into this matter: could it be that the appropriate de jure
   question is whether Christian belief (with or without evidence) is
   rational?

   But what is it for a belief to be rational? The first thing to note is
   that this term is multifarious, indeed, polyphonous, as our postmodern
   compatriots like to say. There are several importantly different ideas
   of rationality floating around, and the first thing we have to do is to
   specify the concept of rationality involved in our question. What are
   the main conceptions of rationality? In Warrant: The Current Debate
   (hereafter WCD), I specified some different but analogically related
   senses of the term. The basic sense is (1) Aristotelian rationality,
   the sense in which, as Aristotle said, "Man is a rational animal."
   Related to it in various ways are (2) rationality as proper function;
   (3) rationality as within or conforming to the deliverances of reason;
   (4) means-ends rationality, where the question is whether a particular
   means someone chooses is, in fact, a good means to her ends; and (5)
   deontological rationality. We must look briefly at these; after that,
   we shall turn at slightly greater length to William Alston's practical
   rationality. Our task will be lightened, however, by the fact that we
   have already dealt with (5) in the last chapter. [123]
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Aristotelian Rationality

   According to Aristotle, man is a rational animal. Fair enough--on this
   point as on others, Aristotle is no doubt right: but what specifically
   did he have in mind? Here the term rational' apparently points to or
   expresses a property that distinguishes human beings from other
   animals. As Aristotle saw it, this property is the possession of ratio,
   the power of reason. The idea is that human beings, unlike at least
   some other animals, have concepts and can hold beliefs; they can
   reason, reflect, and think about things, even things far removed in
   space or time; human beings are (or, at any rate, can be) knowers. This
   is what it is to be a rational creature; and this is what Aristotle saw
   as distinctive about human beings. Of course rational powers can come
   in degrees. We ordinarily think of ourselves (no doubt in a burst of
   specific chauvinism) as much more talented, along these lines, than
   other terrestrial animals, although perhaps we are prepared to concede
   that some of them display at least rudimentary powers of reason. We
   also realize there may be other creatures, perhaps in other parts of
   the universe, that put us absolutely in the shade when it comes to
   intellectual power. Now is the de jure question the question whether a
   creature rational in this sense can accept Christian belief? Presumably
   not: given the many millions of rational animals who do accept it, that
   question, like the question of justification, has much too easy an
   answer.
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Rationality as Proper Function

   If we agree that rational creatures do and therefore can accept
   Christian belief, we might ask whether it is only malfunctioning
   rational creatures that do so, creatures whose rational faculties are
   in some way dysfunctional. A person who suffers from pathological
   confusion, or flight of ideas, or the manic stage of bipolar disorder,
   or delusions (perhaps thinking the Martians are out to get him) is said
   to be irrational. Here the problem is dysfunction, malfunction of the
   rational faculties. The paranoid doesn't form beliefs in the way a
   normal, properly functioning human being does; some part of the
   cognitive apparatus fails to function properly. Pathologically confused
   people may not know what day it is or where they live. Such dysfunction
   can be long-term or episodic; if it is the latter, then after the
   episode is over, we say rationality is restored. This sense of
   rationality, therefore, has to do with proper function, the absence of
   dysfunction or pathology: you are rational if not subject to such
   pathology. Correlatively, irrationality, in this sense, is a matter of
   malfunction of (some of) the rational faculties, the faculties by
   virtue of which we are rational animals. So there is an analogical
   connection between Aristotelian rationality and rationality construed
   as proper function.

   We must distinguish two forms of rationality as proper function. On the
   one hand, there is what we might call internal rationality. We can
   initially characterize internal rationality as a matter of proper
   function of all belief-producing processes downstream from experience'.
   How can we explain this metaphor? We may begin by noting that
   experience comes in several varieties. First, there is sensuous
   imagery, the kind of experience you have most prominently in vision but
   in hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching as well. To use Roderick
   Chisholm's terminology, in this kind of experience one is appeared to
   in such and such a way. Sensuous imagery plays an enormously
   significant role in perception; perceptual beliefs are formed in
   response to sensuous imagery and on the basis of such imagery.

   Still, this isn't the only kind of experience that goes with belief
   formation. In chapter 3 (p. 106) and in Warrant and Proper Function
   (188-93, hereafter WPF), I pointed out that the formation of memory
   beliefs is often unaccompanied by phenomenal experience, or else
   accompanied only by fragmentary, fleeting, indistinct, hard-to-focus
   sensuous imagery. You remember that you went to a party in Novosibirsk;
   there is a bit of imagery, all right, although it is fleeting, partial,
   indistinct, and such that when you try to focus your attention on it,
   it disappears. But there is another kind of experience present: the
   belief that it was Novosibirsk (and not, say, Cleveland) seems right,
   acceptable, natural; it forces itself upon you; it seems somehow
   inevitable (the right words are hard to find). The belief feels right,
   acceptable, and natural; it feels different from what you think is a
   false belief. The same goes for a priori belief. You believe that no
   dogs are sets. This belief, too, involves little by way of sensuous
   imagery. When you consider that proposition, perhaps it is as if you
   catch a momentary and fleeting glimpse of part of a sentence expressing
   the proposition, or perhaps a fragmentary glimpse of a dog, or perhaps
   of a dog enclosed within braces; this imagery seems unimportant,
   however, more like mere decoration than something on the basis of which
   the belief in question is formed. And here, too, there is also this
   other sort of experience: it's just seeming true and indeed necessarily
   true that no dogs are sets. Thinking about this proposition feels
   different from thinking about the proposition that some dogs (your dog
   Tietje, for example) are sets. Still a third kind of example, also
   discussed in more detail in WPF (48ff.): the knowledge that it is you
   (as opposed to someone else) who is now perceiving the page in front of
   you. This too is not a matter of sensuous imagery: it is not on the
   basis of sensuous imagery that you believe it is you who are perceiving
   that page, rather than your cousin in Cleveland. Here too there is that
   other sort of phenomenal experience, that feeling that the proposition
   in question is the right one.

   Suppose we call this second kind of phenomenal experience doxastic
   experience because it always goes with the formation of belief. [124]
   Internal rationality includes, in the first place, forming or holding
   the appropriate beliefs in response to experience, including both
   phenomenal imagery and doxastic experience. With respect to the first,
   I will form beliefs appropriate to the phenomenal imagery I enjoy: for
   example, when appeared to in the way that goes with seeing a gray
   elephant, I will not form the belief that I am perceiving an orange
   flamingo. That sort of response is precluded by internal rationality.
   But perhaps the second--forming the right beliefs in response to
   doxastic experience--is more interesting. A pathological skeptic, for
   example, might have the same sort of doxastic experience as the rest of
   us, but still be unable to form the appropriate beliefs. I might be
   appeared to in the way that goes with seeing that Peter is running
   toward me; out of pathological caution, however, I am unable to believe
   that he is really running toward me (after all, it could be a cunningly
   contrived robot, or I could be dreaming, or a brain in a vat, or a
   victim of some other kind of illusion; and can I be certain that it is
   really me that he is running toward?). This sort of response is also
   precluded by internal rationality. By contrast, RenÃ© Descartes notes
   that there are people "whose cerebella are so troubled and clouded by
   the violent vapours of black bile, that they . . . imagine that they
   have an earthenware head or are nothing but pumpkins or are made of
   glass." [125] That sort of response is not (necessarily) precluded by
   internal rationality. Perhaps these madmen are subjected to
   overwhelming doxastic experience here. Perhaps this proposition--that
   their heads are made of glass--seems utterly obvious to them, as
   obvious as that 3 + 1 = 4. Then the problem lies with this seeming,
   with their having this kind of doxastic experience. Given this doxastic
   experience, what proper function requires (all else being equal) is
   forming this belief; and that they do. They display external
   irrationality, but not internal irrationality.

   There is more that internal rationality requires; we can deal with it
   briefly. A person is internally rational only if her beliefs are
   coherent, or at any rate are sufficiently coherent to satisfy proper
   function. If she is internally rational, then if she believes that her
   head is made of earthenware, she will not also believe that it is made
   of flesh and blood--or at least won't believe these both within the
   confines of the same thought, so to speak. Much more ought to be said
   about the coherence required by proper function; it will have to await
   another occasion. Further, an internally rational person will draw the
   right inferences when the occasion arises: for example, someone who is
   internally rational but believes that her head is made of earthenware
   will probably believe that playing football (at any rate without a
   really good helmet) is very dangerous. Still further, given the beliefs
   she has, she will make the right decisions with respect to her courses
   of action--that is, the decisions required by proper function. Given
   that you do believe you are made of glass, for example, the rational
   thing to do is to avoid bumps. And finally, if she is internally
   rational, she will do what proper function requires with respect to
   such things as preferring to believe what is true, looking for further
   evidence when that is appropriate, and in general being epistemically
   responsible.

   And now that we have internal rationality in hand, external rationality
   is easy to explain. It requires, first, proper function with respect to
   the formation of the sensuous experience on which perceptual belief is
   based. And it consists second in the formation of the right kind of
   doxastic experience--that is, the sort of doxastic experience required
   by proper function.

   I suppose it would be widely conceded that Christian belief can be held
   by people whose rational faculties are not malfunctioning, or at any
   rate not malfunctioning in a way that involves clinical psychoses.
   [126] The fact is many Christian believers are able to hold jobs, some
   even as academics. (Of course, you may think this latter guarantees
   little by way of cognitive proper function.) So presumably the de jure
   question is also not the question whether Christian belief can be held
   by people whose cognitive or rational faculties are functioning
   properly, at least in this clinical sense. But this by no means settles
   the issue; there are subtler forms of cognitive malfunction, and
   impedance of cognitive proper function. As a matter of fact, the (or a)
   sensible version of the de jure question does lie in the neighborhood
   of one of these subtler forms. We'll return to the notion of proper
   function in more depth and detail in the next chapter, where we explore
   the notion of warrant. In the meantime, however, suppose we turn to
   still another kind of rationality.

   their children such patent untruths as that "man' is not a product of
   evolution by natural selection" (519).
     __________________________________________________________________

    C. The Deliverances of Reason

   First, what are the deliverances of reason? Here we have to take the
   term reason' a bit more narrowly than we did in thinking about
   Aristotelian rationality. Among the things we know, some are
   self-evident. It isn't entirely easy to see what it is for a
   proposition to be self-evident; [127] the rough idea, however, is that
   a proposition is self-evident if it is so utterly obvious that we can't
   even understand it without seeing that it is true. Examples would be
   propositions like 7 + 5 = 12; if all men are mortal and Socrates is a
   man, then Socrates is mortal; and if Tom is taller than Sam, and Sam is
   taller than George, then Tom is taller than George. And the idea is
   that reason, taken in this narrower sense, is the faculty or power
   whereby we see the truth of self-evident propositions. Of course it is
   also reason whereby we see that one proposition entails or implies
   another: if I learn from the bartender that everyone at the party was
   drunk, and from you that Paul was at the party, I can conclude that
   Paul was drunk. The deliverances of reason, therefore, will be
   self-evident propositions, together with propositions that are
   self-evident consequences of deliverances of reason. (We might put this
   by saying that self-evidenceis closed under self-evident consequence.)
   And then we might say that a proposition is rational if it is among the
   deliverances of reason, and irrational if its denial is among the
   deliverances of reason. Note that many propositions--for example, the
   proposition that Caesar crossed the Rubicon--will then be neither
   rational nor irrational: neither they nor their denials are among the
   deliverances of reason. [128] And again, the connection with
   Aristotelian rationality is easy to see: reason taken in this narrow
   sense is one of the faculties the possession of which distinguishes us
   from other animals, and when it is functioning properly, what it yields
   are the deliverances of reason.

   There is a problem here. The deliverances of reason obviously come in
   degrees: some seem much more compelling than others, and only some have
   the overwhelmingly obvious nature of the propositions mentioned above.
   So, for example, it is obvious, I think, that there aren't any things
   that do not exist, although this has been disputed, and although it is
   not as obvious as the propositions mentioned in the above paragraph.
   Another example is serious actualism: the proposition that an object
   has properties only in worlds in which it exists. [129] This
   proposition has intuitive warrant, intuitive support, and can be
   deduced from actualism, together with other obvious principles; but it
   isn't just self-evident. You can understand it and nevertheless reject
   it, and indeed some philosophers do exactly that. [130] Should we admit
   these propositions that have at least some intuitive warrant to the
   august company of deliverances of reason, even if they are not
   self-evident? Indeed we should; if we do, however, we can no longer say
   that the deliverances of reason are closed under self-evident
   entailment. That is because of Russell-like paradoxes. It is a
   deliverance of reason that there are properties, that there is such a
   property as self-exemplification, and that every property has a
   complement, so that there is also such a property as
   non-self-exemplification. The rest of the sad story is well known.

   Is Christian belief rational in this sense? No; the central truths of
   Christianity are certainly not self-evident, nor, so far as anyone can
   see, are they such that they can be deduced from what is self-evident.
   Of course, that is nothing whatever against Christian belief; the same
   holds for, for example, what we are taught by historians, physicists,
   and evolutionary biologists. So the de jure question can't be the
   question whether Christian belief is rational in this sense. That is
   because a negative answer to the question is supposed to be a serious
   criticism of Christian belief; but it is no criticism of Christian
   belief (or the theory of evolution, or the belief that you live in
   Cleveland) that it is not a deliverance of reason in this sense.

   Well, is Christian belief irrational, in this sense? That is, are the
   denials of some of the propositions falling within Christian belief
   either self-evident or deducible from propositions that are
   self-evident? Could that be the de jure question? If Christian beliefs
   were irrational in this sense, that would certainly be something
   against them. Some have certainly argued that characteristic Christian
   belief is inconsistent. For example, it has often been claimed that the
   existence of God is incompatible with the existence of evil; Christian
   doctrine, however, embraces both. I believe it is clear, however, that
   there is no inconsistency here; [131] in fact those contemporaries who
   press the problem of evil against Christian or theistic belief no
   longer make that claim of inconsistency.

   Some atheologians have also urged that certain Christian doctrines
   (e.g., the doctrine of the trinity or the doctrine of the incarnation)
   are self-contradictory and hence inconsistent with the deliverances of
   reason. But these claims are at best inconclusive; everything depends
   on which precise formulation of these doctrines we consider. Some of
   these formulations may perhaps be inconsistent, although it is very
   hard to find any formulations of these doctrines that are both clearly
   inconsistent and also widely accepted. (In particular, the formulations
   to be found in the great creeds of the Christian church are not clearly
   inconsistent.) Other formulations clearly are not inconsistent.
   Further, Christians who come to realize that they have accepted an
   inconsistent version of one of these doctrines can easily replace that
   version by one that is not inconsistent. So if this were the de jure
   question, then even if some formulations of central Christian doctrine
   are contrary to the deliverances of reason, the unhappy condition of
   believing such a thing could be easily avoided: just move to a
   formulation that is not inconsistent. But those who urge the de jure
   question with respect to Christian belief do not, presumably, mean to
   claim just that Christian belief is inconsistent: even if it is
   perfectly consistent, they think, there is still something seriously
   wrong with it. We can't mollify them merely by pointing out that there
   are consistent versions of Christian belief. This, too, it seems, is
   not the de jure question.

   [128] Alternatively, we might say that a proposition is irrational if
   its denial is among the deliverances of reason, and rational if it is
   not irrational: then, of course, every proposition will be either
   rational or irrational.

     __________________________________________________________________

    D. Means-End Rationality

   What about means-end rationality, what our continental cousins
   sometimes call ZweckrationalitÃ¤t? This is the sort of rationality
   displayed by the actions of someone who aims to achieve a certain goal
   and chooses means that are effective for attaining that goal. Perhaps,
   more exactly, we should say that this kind of rationality characterizes
   the actions of a rational creature--one rational in the Aristotelian
   and proper function sense--who is aiming to achieve a certain goal; so
   once again we see the connection with the basic Aristotelian sense.
   Means-end rationality is a matter of knowing how to get what you want;
   we might think of it as the cunning of reason. [132] If I want to get
   to Los Angeles as quickly as possible, it would be irrational to take
   the bus or ride my bicycle: the rational thing to do would be to take
   the plane.

   Is the de jure question about this kind of rationality? Means-end
   rationality is a property of actions; hence it isn't initially obvious
   that belief is the sort of thing that can be rational and irrational in
   this sense, because it isn't initially obvious that beliefs are
   actions. In fact it seems initially obvious that beliefs (believings)
   are not actions. You don't ordinarily form a given belief because you
   think holding that belief would be a good means to some end or other.
   Still, suppose we did think of belief as a sort of action (perhaps in a
   limiting sense); then presumably the end in view would be believing or
   knowing the truth. And then Christian belief would be rational in this
   sense if and only if a rational person, one whose cognitive faculties
   were functioning properly, would or could choose this means to the end
   of believing the truth. But there is something very peculiar about this
   suggestion. What you rationally choose as a means to an end depends on
   what you believe--for example, on what you believe about the likelihood
   that a given course of action will yield the result you are aiming at.
   But what if your aim is to believe truth? Then (pretending for the
   moment that what you believe is within your power in the appropriate
   way) you will, of course, believe a proposition if you think it is
   true: for if it is true, then, naturally enough, believing it is a good
   way to believe truth. So taking the action of believing Christian
   teaching will be rational for you, if, in fact, you do believe
   Christian teaching. (This oddness brings out the way in which belief
   really isn't action or, if it is, at least isn't much like other forms
   of action.) The real question, then, will be whether a rational person
   can believe the claims of Christianity, whether a rational person can
   accept Christian belief. And that means that the question whether
   Christian belief is means-end rational really reduces to the question
   whether it is rational in some other sense: the Aristotelian sense or,
   more likely, the proper function sense. So we don't have here an
   independent sense of rationality; because we have already dealt with
   that sense, what we really see is that the de jure question can't be
   this question of means-end rationality either.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [132] Of course there are many variations on this notion of
   rationality. The rational action might be the one that would in fact
   lead to the achievement of your goal, or the one you think would, or
   the one you would think would, if your cognitive faculties were
   functioning properly, or the one you would think would if your
   cognitive faculties were functioning properly and you reflected long
   enough, or the one you would think would if . . . and you were
   sufficiently acute, or . . . and you were not distracted by lust, greed
   or ambition, and so on.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [123] Deontological rationality is really justification; see above,
   chapter 3, p. 87. It is worth noting the analogical connection between
   justification and rationality.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II. Alstonian Practical Rationality

   None of the varieties of rationality I have so far mentioned offers the
   resources for a sensible de jure question. In his magisterial book,
   Perceiving God, [133] William Alston proposes still another way to
   construe rationality (and the de jure question). Given the power and
   depth of Alston's account, this one merits a more careful look.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. The Initial Question

   The conclusion of Alston's book is really that it is
   rational--practically rational, as he says--for at least many of us to
   engage in what he calls Christian Mystical Practice' (CMP, for short):
   the practice of forming beliefs about God (or the Ultimate) on the
   basis of experience of God, or more exactly (putative) perception of
   God (or the Ultimate):

   My main thesis in this chapter, and indeed in the whole book, is that
   CMP is rationally engaged in [my emphasis] since it is a socially
   established doxastic practice that is not demonstrably unreliable or
   otherwise disqualified for rational acceptance. (194)

   The sort of rationality at issue here is practical' rationality; we
   shall therefore consider whether the de jure question might be the
   question whether Christian belief is practically rational in his sense.
   Now Alston himself does not really address specifically Christian
   belief--trinity, incarnation, atonement, and resurrection, for example.
   He is instead concerned with the sorts of beliefs that are produced by
   (putative) perception of God. These include such beliefs as that God is
   glorious, delightful, holy, majestic, all-powerful, loving, and the
   like, as well as such beliefs as that he is strengthening, supporting
   or comforting one. These are not specifically Christian beliefs, and,
   of course, our de jure question is about the rationality of
   specifically Christian beliefs. Nevertheless, perceptual beliefs about
   God could contribute support to Christian beliefs about God; in any
   event, it will be of interest to ask whether Christian belief is
   rational in the sense of rationality Alston identifies, even if he
   himself does not address that issue. Further, the question whether
   Christian belief is practically rational seems to me at any rate closer
   to the de jure question we seek than the candidates we have already
   canvassed. But what is this practical rationality'? How does Alston
   understand this protean notion, and how does he argue for the practical
   rationality of CMP and the beliefs it produces?
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Doxastic Practices

   Here we need a bit of stage setting. A distinctive feature of Alston's
   entire epistemology is its emphasis upon social doxastic
   practices--socially established ways of forming belief. (It makes a
   certain rough sense to think of Alston as judiciously blending Reid
   with Wittgenstein. [134] ) For example, there is sense perception
   (hereafter SP), the social practice of forming beliefs on the basis of
   perception of objects in our environment; there is also the practice of
   forming beliefs by way of reasoning, both deductive and nondeductive,
   as well as the practice of forming beliefs on the basis of memory.
   Together these three form what Alston calls "the standard package,"
   perhaps because they are shared by all properly functioning human
   beings. Further, there is the practice of attributing beliefs, desires,
   pains and pleasures, affective states, spiritual gifts, and the like to
   our fellow human beings. Thomas Reid calls this practice (or, rather,
   the faculty or power that underlies it) sympathy'; we may think of
   sympathy as part of SP or, if we prefer, as a practice intimately
   linked with SP, but nonetheless separate and semiautonomous. (If we
   think of it the latter way, we should consider it part of the standard
   package.)

   These are doxastic practices: they issue in the formation of beliefs.
   They are also social practices in that they contain a considerable
   component contributed by our social environment. SP, for example,
   involves a substantial social component in that what we learn from
   others by way of teaching and testimony becomes part of the practice.
   For example, what we learn from others is involved in the society of
   checks and tests whereby we determine whether a putative perception is
   a real perception; I had to learn from others (parents, for example)
   what it is that I perceive when I perceive a tree or house or star. The
   contributions of nature and nurture may vary over these different
   practices; the contribution of nurture is perhaps maximal with respect
   to SP and perhaps minimal with respect to our grasp of elementary
   arithmetic and logic.

   In addition to these universally shared practices, there is also what
   Alston calls MP, mystical practice', the practice whereby many but not
   all of us form beliefs about God (or the Ultimate) on the basis of
   experience or perception of God (or the Ultimate). CMP is a specific
   variant of mystical practice, where the beliefs formed are the
   specifically Christian beliefs held by Christians of all stripes in
   many different parts of the world and at all times since the beginning
   of the Christian era.

    C. Epistemic Circularity

   Clearly, we can raise many questions about these practices: in
   particular, we can ask whether they are reliable. We can also ask
   whether we can show that they are reliable. If we ask this latter
   question about SP, then we are asking whether we can show or
   successfully argue that the beliefs formed in this practice are for the
   most part true or, at any rate, close to the truth, or likely to be
   true or close to the truth. Our main target, of course, is CMP; but
   because Alston thinks of CMP as essentially involving perception of
   God, he attacks the question of the reliability of CMP in tandem with
   the counterpart question about SP.

   Alston concedes that we can't give a good noncircular argument for the
   claim that CMP is in fact reliable. He pays the same compliment to SP,
   however: we can't give a good noncircular argument for its reliability
   either. So that distressing fact about CMP is balanced by a
   complementary distressing fact about SP. The problem with arguments for
   the reliability of SP is typically what he calls epistemic circularity,
   a malady from which an argument for the reliability of a faculty or
   source of belief suffers when one of its premises is such that my
   acceptance of that premise originates in the operation of the very
   faculty or source of belief in question. If you give an epistemically
   circular argument for the reliability of a faculty, then you rely on
   that very faculty for the truth of one of your premises. An obvious
   example would be arguing that your intuitive arithmetical faculties are
   reliable by pointing out that your arithmetic intuitions seem to you to
   be intuitively sound. A less obviously circular project would be that
   of trying to determine if human cognitive faculties (including your
   own) are reliable by doing some science: you find out what human beings
   think, and then check to see whether what they think is true. Clearly
   enough, this procedure is epistemically circular, for you rely on human
   cognitive faculties--yours--in finding out what human beings think and
   also checking to see if what they think is true. Alston detects many
   examples of epistemic circularity (more than you might have thought),
   some obvious and some not so obvious. I believe he succeeds in
   establishing the important conclusion that it is not possible to show
   in a noncircular fashion that SP is reliable--at any rate he gets as
   close to establishing this conclusion as philosophers ever get to
   establishing any important conclusion. [135]

   So according to Alston, SP and CMP are in the same leaky
   epistemological boat. Indeed, the fact is, he argues, all of our basic
   doxastic practices are in the same epistemological boat; none of them
   can be shown in noncircular fashion to be reliable.

   Press, 1993).

    D. The Argument for Practical Rationality

   The unhappy developments just explained, says Alston, present us with a
   "crisis of rationality" and a "desperate situation": "The course of the
   argument led us to the conclusion that with respect to even those
   sources of belief of which we are normally the most confident we have
   no sufficient noncircular reason for taking them to be reliable" (146).
   What are we to do? Well, we are obliged to settle for second best:
   although we can't show that any of these practices is reliable, perhaps
   we can show that we are rational--practically rational--to engage in
   them. Alston offers two connected arguments for supposing that it is
   practically rational to engage in these practices. According to the
   first, in essence, it is perfectly sensible or rational to continue to
   form beliefs in the SP and CMP ways, because (1) those ways do not lead
   to massive inconsistencies, (2) there is no reason to think them
   unreliable, (3) we know of no alternative doxastic practices whose
   reliability we could demonstrate in an epistemically noncircular
   fashion, and (4) changing to some other practice would be massively
   difficult and disruptive. According to the second argument, any
   socially and psychologically established doxastic practice that meets
   certain other plausible conditions is prima facie rational (i.e., such
   that it is prima facie rational to engage in it); such a practice will
   be all-things-considered rational if, as far as we can see, there is no
   reason to abandon it. These two arguments are connected, as I shall
   argue below; it is only the second that he explicitly employs with
   respect to CMP.

   Suppose we begin by examining the second argument; as we shall see,
   this argument leads back to the first. Here is how Alston puts the
   matter:

   My main thesis . . . is that CMP is rationally engaged in since it is a
   socially established doxastic practice that is not demonstrably
   unreliable or otherwise disqualified for rational acceptance. If CMP
   is, indeed, a socially established doxastic practice, it follows from
   the position defended in Chapter 4 that it is prima facie worthy of
   rational participation. And this means that it is prima facie rational
   to regard it as reliable, sufficiently reliable to be a source of prima
   facie justification of the beliefs it engenders. And if, furthermore,
   it is not discredited by being shown to be unreliable or deficient in
   some other way that will cancel its prima facie rationality, then we
   may conclude that it is unqualifiedly rational to regard it as
   sufficiently reliable to use in belief formation. (194)

   The basic contention is that it is prima facie rational to engage in
   CMP . . . because it is a socially established doxastic practice; and
   that it is unqualifiedly rational to engage in it . . . because we lack
   sufficient reason for regarding it as unreliable or otherwise
   disqualified for rational participation. (223)

   The main premise of this argument, then, is:

   It is prima facie rational (practically rational) to engage in a
   socially established doxastic practice, and unqualifiedly rational
   (rational all things considered) to engage in a socially established
   practice that doesn't encounter severe internal or external
   incompatibilities.

   And in chapters 5 through 7 Alston goes on to argue that CMP is indeed
   a socially established doxastic practice, and that it does not
   encounter severe internal or external incompatibilities.
     __________________________________________________________________

    E. Practical Rationality Initially Characterized

   Turn now to the main premise. First, I don't know precisely how to
   state the second part, the part about rationality all things
   considered', but while this is mildly annoying, it isn't really
   serious, because I intend to comment only on the first part. How
   exactly are we to understand this proposition, and what is the sense of
   rational' in which it is prima facie rational to engage in a socially
   established doxastic practice? As to the second, we are talking about
   the rationality or lack thereof of taking a course of action, of doing
   something or other, of acting in a certain way. (That is why we're
   talking practical rationality.) Whether an action is rational for me
   will obviously have something to do with what it is I am aiming at in
   taking that action, what I am trying to accomplish, what my purpose,
   end, goal is. So the kind of rationality at issue is that means-ends
   rationality, that ZweckrationalitÃ¤t we came across above (p. 115). The
   rational action, for me, is the one that will contribute to the
   realization of my goal, or contribute more to it than any other action
   open to me. But is it the action that will in fact contribute to my
   goal that is rational for me, or the one I believe will so contribute?
   Presumably the second: I am not irrational, in taking a given line of
   action, if I make a perfectly sensible mistake about what the best
   means to my end is. [136] If I am thirsty and what I want is a drink of
   water, it will be rational for me to open the faucet and hold a glass
   under it; I believe that is a fine way to get a glass of water. It
   would be irrational for me, under these circumstances, to go (instead)
   for a walk in the desert; I know that water is hard to find in the
   desert. On the other hand, if I believed that the faucet isn't
   connected to any source of water, then the action of opening the faucet
   wouldn't be a rational way for me to get a drink; and if I believed the
   nearest water is in the Sonoran Desert just outside Tucson, the action
   of going for a walk in the desert would be rational.

   Now the case under consideration, of course, is the case of those
   doxastic practices; we are to ask whether it is rational to form
   beliefs by engaging in SP, CMP, or both. Here our relevant aim or goal,
   says Alston, is that of getting in the right relation to the truth,
   achieving some appropriate balance between avoiding error and believing
   truth. And now the question for us is whether a rational way to try to
   achieve that goal is to form beliefs as we always have, by employing
   SP, CMP, or both. Of course, this question has about it a certain air
   of unreality. It is up to me whether I open the faucet to get a drink
   of water, but it isn't really up to me whether I will form beliefs in
   accord with SP. I don't have any choice in the matter. And that means
   that the question of the practical rationality of continuing in SP is a
   little peculiar. I might as well ask whether it is rational for me to
   continue to be such that the earth attracts my body with a force that
   is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between us:
   this really isn't up to me. The same goes with respect to my major ways
   of forming belief: it isn't up to me whether I form beliefs in those
   ways. I can try as hard as I like, but (apart from such draconian
   measures as mind-altering drugs) I doubt that I could seriously alter
   my basic belief-forming proclivities. Offer me a million dollars to
   believe that I live in Wyoming or that I am really the president of the
   United States: I can strain my utmost, but I won't be able to collect.
   [137]

   Alston is perfectly well aware of the problem here, and what he
   suggests is that the interesting question is whether it would be
   rational to continue to engage in the practice in question if it were
   within my power to continue and within my power to refrain (168). The
   question is what it would be rational for me to do, if I were in a
   certain position: a position in which one of the things I believe, and
   believe truly, is that it is within my power to continue to form
   beliefs in the ways I have (by using the standard package and CMP), and
   also within my power to refrain from forming beliefs in those
   ways--either forming no beliefs at all of those sorts, or perhaps using
   some quite different belief-forming practice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [136] As we saw above in footnote 10, there are important distinctions
   within this category.

   [137] Well, perhaps I do have a bit more control over my belief-forming
   proclivities than over whether my body is attracted by the earth. The
   fact is there are rather standard ways in which I can influence, mold,
   or form my belief-producing tendencies.
     __________________________________________________________________

    F. The Original Position

   Suppose (with an apologetic bow to John Rawls) we call this position
   the original position'. Our question, specified to the standard
   package, is something like this. Suppose I am in the original position:
   I know (or at any rate believe truly) that it is within my power to
   stop forming beliefs in the ordinary way, via SP, memory, and reasoning
   (the standard package). Perhaps I also know that it is within my power
   to choose some other way of forming belief. Then what would be the
   rational thing to do: continue to form beliefs as I have all along, try
   some other way, or give up on this whole belief-forming enterprise?

   The answer, as we have seen, depends at least in part on my aims, ends,
   and goals. If my aim is psychological comfort, feeling really good
   about myself, perhaps I should choose some belief-forming mechanisms
   that lead me to think I am a really fine fellow. Perhaps I should
   choose a way that will bring it about that I believe I have just won
   the Nobel Prize in chemistry, heroically overcoming such serious
   obstacles as that I have no training in the subject and know next to
   nothing about it. Naturally I should carefully avoid any belief-forming
   practices on the basis of which I would come to see the true extent of
   my failures and ineptness, my sins and miseries, as the Heidelberg
   Catechism puts it. In the present context, of course, my aim, according
   to Alston, is not personal comfort, or happiness, or psychological
   well-being, but getting properly in touch with the truth.

   The rational course depends on my aims and goals; it also depends on
   what I believe--that is, what I believe at the time I take the decision
   in question. If my aim is to feel good about myself, it would be
   irrational to choose belief-forming mechanisms that, as I believe,
   would lead to a proper knowledge of my sins and miseries. To make the
   rational choice, I must figure out which course is most likely to lead
   to the accomplishment of my goal(s), and then act on that belief by
   taking that course. And this leads to an important question about the
   main premise. As you recall, it begins thus: It is prima facie rational
   (practically rational) to engage in a socially established doxastic
   practice. . . . But why this emphasis on socially established doxastic
   practices? True, if in the original position I think socially
   established practices are especially likely to yield true beliefs, then
   the rational thing for me to do, in that position, is to choose
   socially established doxastic practices. But what if I don't think
   that? I unwisely read Nietzsche, becoming convinced that the common
   herd is commonly wrong; I develop a lordly Nietzschean disdain for the
   ways in which the generality of humankind form their belief. Then
   presumably the rational thing would be to choose practices that are not
   socially established. I should, instead, choose practices that are
   enjoyed only by the fortunate few whose Promethean efforts have taken
   them far beyond hoi polloi. Why is social establishment important or
   relevant? What counts, for practical rationality, is what I think will
   achieve my goal; in the original position, it may or may not be the
   case that I think socially established practices are especially likely
   to achieve my goal of believing the truth.

   Here we see the connection between the first and second of Alston's
   arguments for the practical rationality of SP and CMP. The main premise
   of the second argument, we might say, takes it for granted that in the
   original position I believe that socially established practices are as
   likely to lead us to the right relationship to the truth as any
   alternative; and indeed I suppose most of us do in fact believe that.
   The main premise of the first argument is different; it is that I don't
   know that SP (or CMP) is subject to any massive unreliability, and I
   also don't know of any alternative practice I could adopt which is such
   that I could show with respect to it that it is reliable. In the
   original position (the first argument continues), I would have this
   belief (I would believe that I know of no better alternative practice);
   therefore, the rational thing to do is to stick with what I've got. (Or
   if that seems a bit strong, it is at any rate true that sticking with
   my present practices is a rational thing to do.) The first argument is
   the basic one; the second argument takes for granted the main premise
   of the first argument and then incorporates something else most of us
   are in fact inclined to believe, namely, that socially established
   doxastic practices have a good chance of being reliable, perhaps a
   better chance than idiosyncratic doxastic practices.
     __________________________________________________________________

    G. The Wide Original Position

   These thoughts lead to a crucial question: precisely what is it that I
   believe in the original position? In particular, what do I believe
   about the reliability of SP and CMP in that position? Is the idea that
   my beliefs, in the original position, are as much as possible like the
   beliefs I do in fact have, given that (in that position) I know or
   truly believe that it is within my power to give up SP, CMP, or both?
   (Call this the wide original position.) Perhaps that is the way to
   think of the original position. But this doesn't take us very far. The
   fact is that I now believe that both SP and CMP are reliable.
   Therefore, if my beliefs in the original position are the ones I do in
   fact have, the question as to the rational course is easily answered:
   obviously, I should continue to form beliefs in the way I have been
   forming them. My aim is to be in the right relationship to the truth; I
   propose to attain as good a mixture of achieving the truth and avoiding
   error as possible; but in fact I believe that SP and CMP offer a vastly
   better chance to achieve that goal than any alternative I can think of;
   therefore, the rational choice for me to make, obviously enough, is to
   continue both in SP and in CMP.

   Here there is a strong odor of triviality. I do in fact think both SP
   and CMP are reliable; so if, in the original position, I have the
   beliefs about SP and CMP that in fact I do have, then in that position,
   naturally enough, the rational choice would be to continue with SP and
   CMP. Given what I do believe about them, that would be the rational
   thing to do. This conclusion, while no doubt true, is pretty weak tea.
   Of course, if I knew I could refrain from forming beliefs in the SP and
   CMP way, and also believed that those ways were reliable, more reliable
   than any alternative way open to me, I would choose to continue to form
   beliefs that way. True, but not very interesting: how would this fact
   show or tend to show that my SP and CMP beliefs are in fact rational,
   in some interesting sense? We are told that if we knew it was within
   our power to continue to form beliefs in this way, and also within our
   power to abstain from so doing, then if we believed that SP and CMP are
   reliable, the rational thing to do would be to choose to continue to
   form beliefs in those ways. No doubt: nothing of interest follows. The
   same would go for any beliefs I have, no matter how crazy. The same
   would go, for example, for the insane beliefs of Descartes's madmen,
   who believed that they themselves were gourds--zucchini, perhaps, or
   summer squash--and that their heads were made of pottery. If I really
   do believe that I am a summer squash, then the rational thing for me to
   do, if offered the chance, is to continue to form beliefs in a way that
   yields (as I see it) this true belief. Still, that doesn't show that
   this belief itself is rational. We haven't yet located the de jure
   question.

   However we do have to consider another facet of the dialectical
   situation, one that so far I have been slighting: I am aware, in the
   original position, of the fact that neither SP, nor CMP, nor any other
   major doxastic practice can be noncircularly shown to be reliable.
   That, after all, is what, according to Alston, precipitated the crisis
   of rationality and called forth the question of rationality in the
   first place. It is after we realize this, he thinks, that we are in the
   desperate situation of which he speaks. So we must add that in the
   original position I am aware of the fact that we can't noncircularly
   establish that the practices in question are reliable. (We must also
   add, perhaps, that I have devoted some attention to this fact, have
   thought about it at least a bit; perhaps we should say that I am
   acutely aware of it.)

   This changes very little. In the original position as now conceived
   (the wide original position), I know that it is within my power to
   withhold perceptual and Christian belief; I also know that it isn't
   possible to give a good noncircular argument for the reliability of
   these sources of belief; but otherwise my beliefs are as much as
   possible like they are in fact. And our question remains: what would be
   the rational thing to do: continue with SP and CMP, or stop forming
   beliefs in those ways? Again, however, the answer is too easy: of
   course the rational thing would be to continue with SP and CMP. Once
   more, this is because I am in fact convinced that these sources of
   belief are reliable. True enough: I realize that I can't give a good
   noncircular argument for their reliability, but this gives me no pause.
   I can't see that this puts us in a desperate situation or that it
   should lead to a crisis of rationality: for this situation is a
   necessary feature of any doxastic condition. Not even God himself,
   necessarily omniscient as he is, can give a noncircular argument for
   the reliability of his ways of forming beliefs. [138] God himself is
   trapped inside the circle of his own ideas. About all we can say about
   God's ways of forming beliefs is that it is necessary, in the broadly
   logical sense, that a proposition p is true if and only if God believes
   p. [139] Of course God knows that and knows, therefore, that all of his
   beliefs are true. However (naturally enough), he knows this only by
   virtue of relying on his ways of forming beliefs. If, per impossible,
   he became a bit apprehensive about the reliability of those ways of
   forming beliefs, he would be in the same boat as we are about that
   question. He couldn't give an epistemically noncircular argument for
   the reliability of his ways of forming beliefs; for the beliefs
   constituting the premises of any such argument would themselves have
   been formed in those ways. But any epistemic debility that afflicts a
   necessarily omniscient being is hardly worth worrying about.

   In the wide original position, therefore, I would be convinced that SP
   and CMP are reliable sources of belief, despite the fact that I realize
   it isn't possible to give a good noncircular argument for their
   reliability; hence, in the wide original position, the rational thing
   to do, obviously, would be to continue with them. We are still mired in
   triviality. We still don't have either the de jure question or the
   original position quite right. The problem is that if, in the original
   position, we have the beliefs we actually have with respect to SP and
   CMP, then it is trivially obvious that the rational decision would be
   to continue to form beliefs in those ways. Unfortunately, the fact that
   this is the rational decision, given those beliefs, does nothing to
   show that the beliefs we form on the basis of SP and CMP are rational
   in any interesting sense. In particular, the atheologian who raises the
   de jure question with respect to Christian belief will not be mollified
   if told that it would be rational, given that you thought CMP reliable,
   to decide to continue to form beliefs in the CMP way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [138] Here I assume what Alston disputes: that God has beliefs. (Of
   course, on Alston's view, there would be something like beliefs in
   God.) But this is really irrelevant to the point I make here, which is
   that it is a necessary truth that no doxastic agent, no matter how
   exalted, could give a good, epistemically noncircular argument for the
   reliability of his doxastic faculties.

   Knowledge, ed. C. Stephen Evans and Merold Westphal (Grand Rapids:
   Eerdmans, 1993).
     __________________________________________________________________

    H. A Narrow Original Position?

   In any event, there would be something very peculiar about supposing
   that the original position includes the beliefs I actually have about
   the reliability of SP and CMP (as well as the beliefs I actually form
   on the basis of those practices). The whole question of the rationality
   or sensibleness of CMP and SP arises, after all, because we realize we
   can't successfully argue that those sources of belief are reliable. (It
   is this realization that precipitates the "crisis of rationality.") We
   need a term for those beliefs which are such that we can't successfully
   argue that the sources that produce them are reliable: say that such
   beliefs are uncredentialed. Then the crisis of rationality, with
   respect to SP and CMP beliefs, arises because we realize that they are
   uncredentialed. What to do? Alston suggests that at any rate we can
   argue that it is practically rational to form belief in the CMP and SP
   ways. That will give us something, even if it is settling for second
   best. So the idea is to show that there is something rational or
   reasonable about beliefs formed the SP and CMP ways, by showing that it
   would be rational to choose to form beliefs that way in the original
   position. But then presumably there would be something at best very
   peculiar about relying on the belief that CMP and SP are reliable; that
   belief itself, of course, is uncredentialed.

   And, in fact, Alston's idea, in Perceiving God, is that these beliefs
   are not to be included in the original position:

   But I was also thinking of this subject [the person in the original
   position] as realizing that s/he is unable to show that any of these
   practices are reliable, and believing that this implies that s/he is
   unable to use beliefs in that reliability, or beliefs that presuppose
   that reliability, to determine the most rational course to take
   vis-Ã -vis belief formation. [140]

   The suggestion is, I think, that in the original position we bracket
   our confidence in the practices in question; better, we simply don't
   have any beliefs of this sort in that position. In making this
   decision, we languish (or flourish) behind a veil of ignorance. This is
   a narrow original position. We are to engage in the following thought
   experiment: try to see what it would be rational to do if you didn't
   already believe in the reliability of SP or CMP, knew that there are no
   good noncircular arguments for their reliability, and (correctly)
   believed that it is up to you whether you engage in those practices:
   under those conditions, would it be rational to continue in forming
   beliefs the SP or CMP way? The idea here seems to be that the original
   position wouldn't include the belief that SP or CMP is reliable, or
   even any of beliefs formed on the basis of SP and CMP; for presumably
   those beliefs presuppose the reliability of SP and CMP (at least if I
   understand what Alston means here by presuppose'). [141]

   Well then, what beliefs are included in this narrow original position?
   Which of my beliefs could I sensibly use, in coming to a decision as to
   whether to continue with CMP, SP, or both? Alston holds, of course,
   that I can properly use the premises of his arguments for the practical
   rationality of CMP and SP; these are included in the original position.
   As you recall, the premises of the first argument include something
   like

   (1) SP and CMP do not lead to massive inconsistencies; there is no
   reason to think them unreliable; we know of no alternative doxastic
   practices whose reliability we could demonstrate in an epistemically
   noncircular fashion; and it would be disruptive to stop forming belief
   in these ways;

   the premises of the second include

   (2) SP and CMP are socially established practices that are not
   demonstrably unreliable or otherwise disqualified; and it would be
   disruptive to stop forming belief in these ways.

   Here (1) would be teamed with another premise according to which it is
   practically rational to decide to continue a practice that meets the
   conditions (1) says SP and CMP meet; there would be a similar premise
   to go with (2). And Alston's idea is that at any rate we can use these
   premises in coming to a decision as to whether to continue in SP and
   CMP. So even though the original position is narrow, it would still
   include the premises of his arguments.

   But why so? Why would it be appropriate to rely on these premises, in
   the original position? The problem with relying on the beliefs that CMP
   and SP are reliable and on the beliefs that are formed by way of CMP
   and SP, of course, is that it is these very beliefs that are
   uncredentialed. Doesn't the same go, however, for the doxastic
   practices that yield (1) and (2)? Can we do any better with respect to
   them? For example, both (1) and (2) include the belief that we have
   been engaging in CMP and SP, forming beliefs in the CMP and SP ways.
   But how do I know that we have been doing this for some time?
   Presumably, it is only by way, in part, of perception itself: I
   perceive other people (or, to be really finicky, their bodies), and
   that perception is necessary to my knowledge that they use CMP, SP, or
   both. But perceptual beliefs are also uncredentialed: so these beliefs
   of mine are uncredentialed. [142] And how do I know that we have been
   doing this for some time? Presumably by way of memory. Memory beliefs
   too, sadly enough, are uncredentialed; there is no way, as far as I can
   see anyway, in which one can show, in an epistemically noncircular way,
   that memory is reliable. And how do we know that it would be disruptive
   to stop forming beliefs in these ways? Presumably on the basis of our
   general knowledge of human beings and human nature, at least part of
   which comes by way of perception. And how do I know the truth of those
   additional premises, according to which it would be practically
   rational to continue with doxastic practices that meet the conditions
   laid down in (1) and (2)? Here presumably the idea is that these
   beliefs are self-evident, or obvious, or at any rate have a good deal
   of intuitive support. Therefore these premises would be among the
   deliverances of reason. Therefore they too are uncredentialed; we can't
   give an epistemically noncircular argument for the reliability of
   reason, for in giving such an argument, obviously enough, we would be
   obliged to rely upon reason. So (1) and (2) are no better off than the
   beliefs that SP and CMP are reliable: if the latter can't properly be
   used in the original position because they are uncredentialed, then the
   same is true of the former.

   Indeed, as Alston himself points out (146-47), it is easy to see that
   none of our beliefs is credentialed. Even if we could give an argument
   to show that a given source of belief was, in fact, reliable, in making
   that argument we would be obliged to rely on other sources of beliefs.
   In particular, we would have to rely on reason; but clearly we can't
   establish that reason is reliable without relying on reason itself; so
   beliefs that are produced by reason are uncredentialed. Hence, if we
   insist that the original position must include only credentialed
   beliefs, it won't include any beliefs at all. And if it doesn't contain
   any beliefs at all, then in the original position you wouldn't have the
   faintest idea what to do, whether to continue with SP and CMP or not.
   You might as well flip a coin; more likely, the rational thing to do
   would be to withhold judgment altogether. But why would that matter
   with respect to the question of the rationality of forming beliefs in
   the SP or CMP way? Obviously, if you had no beliefs to go on, you
   couldn't come to a sensible decision as to whether to continue with SP
   or CMP; why would that fact show that there is something irrational in
   forming belief in accord with SP and CMP? If you had no beliefs at all
   on the subject, you couldn't come to a sensible decision as to whether
   to continue with SP and CMP: but that fact is quite irrelevant to the
   question whether there is something wrong with forming beliefs in the
   SP and CMP ways. If so, however, the de jure question would not be the
   question whether it would be rational to continue with CMP (or SP) if I
   were in the narrow original position. [143]

   Should we perhaps consider a different possible narrow original
   position for SP and CMP? As for the first, take the original position
   to include the standard package minus perception: reason, memory, and
   introspection, the faculty (or means) whereby we know what our
   experience is (for example, how we are appeared to). Of course it would
   include only part of memory: in the original position thus conceived, I
   wouldn't have any memory belief that depends upon perceptual belief.
   (For example, I wouldn't have the memory belief that I saw a cat
   yesterday, but only the belief that it seems to me that I saw a cat.)
   What I would have to go on, therefore, would be just introspection,
   reason, and some fragment of memory. Then the original position with
   respect to SP includes (1) my knowing that it is within my power to
   form beliefs in the SP way and also within my power to withhold SP
   beliefs, (2) my knowing that it is not possible to give a good
   noncircular argument for the reliability of SP, (3) my having no views
   as to the reliability or unreliability of this practice, and (4) my not
   having SP beliefs or beliefs dependent on perceptual beliefs. My aim or
   purpose, of course, is to believe truth and avoid error. And now the
   question is: what would it be rational for me to do, if in fact I were
   in that position? Decide to continue to form beliefs the SP way? Or
   reject them?

   Again, however, the real question, it seems to me, is this: why is that
   question relevant? That is, why would the answer to the question what
   it would be rational to do in that position have anything to do with
   whether it is rational, or whatever, for me to form beliefs in the SP
   way in the position I am actually in? I doubt that anything
   epistemically interesting hangs on the answer to it. What we have left
   isn't much to go on, and I really can't see where the probabilities
   would lie. [144] Well, suppose the answer is that those probabilities
   lie with agnosticism. All things considered, from the perspective of
   the narrow original position with respect to SP, it looks as if the
   course most likely to produce the most favorable position with respect
   to the truth is agnosticism about the deliverances of SP; the rational
   thing to do would be to withhold these beliefs. How would that be
   relevant to the question whether it is in fact (in the situation in
   which in fact I find myself) rational, in some interesting sense of
   rational', to form belief the SP way? If we decide this question by
   asking whether it would be practically rational to do so in this narrow
   original position, we are entirely ignoring perception as a source of
   warrant. We are treating it as if it had no authority or credentials of
   its own, even with respect to the very area to which it seems to be
   addressed. We are treating it in the way Thomas Reid thinks Hume treats
   it.

   As Reid also asks, however, why should I trust reason (and that smidgin
   of memory) more than SP? [145] Why should SP have to prove itself
   before the bar of reason? [146] To descend from the level of metaphor:
   why is it rational (in the relevant sense of rational', whatever
   precisely that is) for me to form belief in the SP way only if it is
   more likely than not from the perspective just of reason, that fragment
   of memory, and introspection that SP is reliable? Perhaps, from that
   impoverished point of view, it is not more likely than not that SP is
   reliable; does that show anything of interest? I doubt it. Suppose our
   battery of ways of forming beliefs, our belief-forming faculties, are
   in fact reliable; suppose, indeed, that we have been created by God,
   who intended that we be able to know the sorts of things we think we
   know by virtue of just such a battery of faculties: reason, memory,
   sense perception, introspection, sympathy, the sensus divinitatis and
   the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit (see below, chapter 8), if
   there are such sources of belief, and all the rest. What reason is
   there to think that if these faculties are reliable, then it would
   appear that they are from the perspective just of reason, that bit of
   memory, and introspection? Maybe those three simply aren't able to give
   much of an answer: would that matter with respect to the rationality of
   forming perceptual beliefs? I can't see that it would. So it isn't
   clear to me that, in the case of SP, it matters much which answer we
   get here. The question was: would it be practically rational, in the
   narrow original position, to decide to engage in SP, to form beliefs in
   the SP way? The answer to that question, however, doesn't really matter
   with respect to the question whether it is rational for us to engage in
   SP; we don't have here a sensible de jure question about SP.

   The situation is a bit different with CMP. First, the narrow original
   position is different. It includes introspection, memory, and reason,
   as in the previous case, but it also includes perception and sympathy.
   So the narrow original position with respect to CMP includes my aiming
   at the truth, believing what I do, in fact, believe on the basis of the
   standard package; it also includes having no beliefs one way or the
   other about the reliability of CMP. I am to try to decide which among
   the courses open to me is the most likely to get me in the right
   relation to the truth. One option is to accept CMP. Another is to
   reject it in favor of some other systematic practice of forming beliefs
   on the questions to which CMP is addressed: for example, I could accept
   philosophical naturalism, or perhaps some non-Christian religious
   practice. Still another option, presumably, would be to continue in the
   agnosticism that is part of the original position, and yet another is
   to adopt a sort of ironic Rortian double-mindedness, a frame of mind as
   difficult to describe as it is intriguing, one in which at one level I
   believe these things; at another, I maintain a certain delicate
   distance, sheepishly conceding that I do in a way believe these things,
   but adding that officially I don't take these beliefs at all seriously,
   instead adopting toward them an attitude of irony and condescension.
   (In my study, when I reflect on it, I can see things straight; but in
   church, with all that liturgy, those hymns, those people I love and
   admire, that Bible reading and powerful preaching. . . .) And the
   question is, if I were in this situation, what would be the rational
   thing for me to do: adopt CMP, adopt some alternative to it, or remain
   agnostic?

   Here, it seems to me, agnosticism should probably get the nod. All
   things considered, the best road to avoiding error and believing truth
   on the topics of CMP as judged from this narrow original position is
   agnosticism. To establish this, of course, would require a lot of
   work--first, a canvass of all the rational arguments for and against
   the existence of God, and then an examination of the arguments for and
   against the thought that we human beings do, in fact, perceive God
   (given that there is such a person). From the point of view of the
   standard package, [147] I think, it is somewhat more likely than not
   that there is such a person as God. Although the standard arguments
   don't have anything like the probative force some have claimed for
   them, they do have (I think) some force; there are, in addition, a
   great number of other theistic arguments, all with at least a bit of
   force. [148] On the other side is the problem of evil, of course; on
   balance, however, it seems to me that the nod goes to theism. But what
   about the claim that we human beings do in fact perceive God? Here I
   think the appropriate attitude would be agnosticism: from the point of
   view of the resources included in the narrow original position, one
   simply can't determine whether we human beings perceive God. But to
   discuss this matter in proper detail would take us too far
   afield--particularly in view of the fact that the question put this way
   is, in any event, the wrong question.

   For why suppose that if CMP is sensible or rational (in some important
   sense of that multifarious term), then from the point of view of the
   standard package it must be more likely than not that CMP is reliable?
   Consider memory, and consider its credentials from the point of view of
   the rest of the standard package. Suppose you don't know that there's
   been a past; you know only what reason, perception, and introspection
   tell you. How likely is it, from that perspective, that the
   deliverances of memory are mostly true? Not very likely, I'd say. Would
   that be a reason for mistrusting it, regarding it as suspect, or
   believing that it was less than wholly rational to rely on it? Would it
   so much as slyly suggest that it isn't rational to form beliefs in the
   memory way? I don't see how. But then presumably the same thing goes
   for CMP. Suppose there is such a thing as perception of God; suppose
   that CMP is in fact reliable. Would it follow that it is more probable
   than not, just given the deliverances of the standard package, that CMP
   is reliable? I don't think so.

   So there is no reason to hold that it is rational to take part in CMP
   only if its reliability is more likely than not with respect to the
   standard package. To think otherwise is to arbitrarily assume in
   advance that if CMP is a source of warranted belief, it must be likely
   with respect to the standard package that it is reliable; but there is
   no reason to accept this assumption. Here things stand with CMP just as
   with SP. It seems entirely arbitrary to insist that it is rational to
   engage in SP only if the reliability of SP is more likely than not with
   respect to the deliverances of some group of epistemic powers that
   doesn't include SP; in the same way, it is not sensible to conclude
   that CMP is rational only if its reliability is more likely than not
   from the perspective of the standard package. Suppose God has created
   us with a battery of faculties aimed at our being able to acquire truth
   in different areas: it doesn't follow that the reliability of any of
   these faculties would be more probable than not with respect to the
   deliverances of some package of faculties that does not include the one
   in question.

   By way of summary, then: either the original position with respect to
   CMP is wide or it is narrow. If it is wide, then it will include my
   belief that CMP is reliable; in that case, the rational decision,
   clearly enough, would be to continue with CMP. But this does nothing to
   relieve any anxieties someone might have about the rationality or
   reasonability of CMP. If the original position is narrow, however, then
   it really doesn't matter whether from that position it would be
   rational to continue with CMP.

   Now suppose we return to specifically Christian belief. Our quarry is
   the de jure question: what is this rationality or rational
   justification Christian belief is alleged by its detractors not to
   have? Our current suggestion is that perhaps it is practical
   rationality. Perhaps the de jure question is the question whether
   Christian belief is in fact practically rational and the de jure
   objection is that it is not. But the same dialectic applies here as in
   the case of CMP. If we are thinking of the original position with
   respect to Christian belief as wide, then it will include Christian
   belief itself. From that point of view, obviously, the rational
   decision would be to continue to form and maintain belief in the way in
   which I do, in fact, form and maintain it (i.e., to form and maintain
   Christian belief); but that does little to show that Christian belief
   is rational in any interesting sense. So suppose, by contrast, that the
   appropriate original position is narrow. Then, to be sure, it will
   include only the standard package and it won't include Christian
   belief. Now perhaps from that perspective it isn't at all clear that
   the rational decision would be to endorse Christian belief; perhaps the
   rational decision would be to give it up. So what? Why should the truth
   of Christian belief (or the reliability of the sources producing it)
   have to be more likely than not from that standpoint for it to be
   rational? Why think that the rationality, in some interesting sense, of
   Christian beliefs requires that it be more likely than not from the
   standpoint of the standard package that it is reliably produced? No
   reason; hence we still haven't located the de jure question.

   So what is the question? Surely there is a sensible de jure question
   lurking somewhere in this neighborhood: what might it be? Where shall
   we look for it? Perhaps in the following locality. Go back to the wide
   original position, and recall that if, in that position, I accept SP
   and CMP beliefs, then, trivially, the rational thing to do is to decide
   to continue to form beliefs in those ways. Of course this would be true
   for other beliefs as well. In fact it would be true even for beliefs
   that are in some clear sense irrational. RenÃ© Descartes notes that
   there are people "whose cerebella are so troubled and clouded by the
   violent vapours of black bile, that they . . . imagine that they have
   an earthenware head or are nothing but pumpkins or are made of glass."
   [149] No doubt these people avoided bumps like the plague. Given that
   you do believe you are made of glass, the rational thing to do is to
   avoid bumps. In the same way, given that you do believe you are made of
   glass, the rational thing to do in the service of truth is (if you are
   given the choice) to continue in that belief. After all, you think the
   belief is true; so if your aim is to believe truth and avoid falsehood,
   you will continue to hold it.

   Fair enough: given that you think your head is made of glass, it is
   rational to wear your football helmet wherever you go, and rational to
   decide, if presented with the choice, to continue in that belief. But
   is it rational to hold that belief in the first place? Given that you
   hold the beliefs produced by SP or CMP and you don't know of any
   epistemically superior practice, it is indeed rational to continue to
   form beliefs in that way: is it or was it rational, reasonable,
   sensible to hold those beliefs in the first place?

   It is in this neighborhood, I suggest, that we must look for the de
   jure question with respect to Christian belief. What is it that
   determines whether a given way of acting or believing, given that your
   circumstances are thus-and-so, is rational or reasonable, in the
   relevant sense? Here is my suggestion: what determines this is what a
   creature of our kind with properly functioning reason (ratio) would do
   or believe, given that she was in those circumstances. Or perhaps it is
   what someone with ideal ratio--ratio ideal for our kind of
   creature--would do or think in the circumstances. The question is
   really about the human design plan; it has to do with what that design
   plan, or perhaps a slightly idealized version of it, dictates for the
   situation in question. The question is about the sorts of beliefs a
   properly functioning human being would have in the relevant
   circumstances. What kind of question is this? It isn't a question of
   practical rationality. The question is not: given that I am in
   circumstances C, have aims and beliefs A and B, and have raised the
   question whether or not to do X, how likely is it that doing X will
   contribute to my aims and goals? (How sensible would it be to do X?)
   It's a different kind of question altogether. In the next chapter we
   shall have to try to specify this question and get a closer look at it.

   Society of Christian Philosophers (concurrent with the meeting of the
   Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association) in Atlanta,
   December, 1993 (a published version can be found in The Journal of
   Philosophical Research 20 (1995), pp. 67ff.

   [141] Another reason for supposing SP and CMP beliefs are not to be
   included in the narrow original position: if they were, then, of
   course, in that position we would think them true, and we would know
   that they were delivered by SP and CMP. But then, obviously, we would
   have excellent reason to think SP and CMP are reliable, and it would be
   obvious that the rational thing to do would be to continue forming
   beliefs the SP and CMP way; we should be back at the previous condition
   of triviality.

   [142] Does the fact that the argument takes as a premise a belief that
   is a deliverance of the very practice under consideration show that the
   argument is epistemically circular? Not obviously: the conclusion of
   this argument is not that SP is reliable, but that it is practically
   rational to engage in it.

   [143] Do I know, however (in the narrow original position), that I have
   been forming beliefs all along in the SP and CMP way, and that it would
   therefore be inconvenient to change my way of forming beliefs, whether
   or not other people are involved? I think this leads to a puzzle,
   illustrating the limitations of this kind of counterfactual thought
   experiment. I am to imagine myself in the narrow original position, one
   in which I don't have any SP and CMP beliefs; but then, of course, I
   would have a different way of forming beliefs from the way in which I
   actually do form them. If I were in that position, it would not be true
   that if I were not to employ SP and CMP, then I would be changing my
   ways of forming beliefs; for in the narrow original position I don't
   form beliefs in those ways! What this shows, I think, is that this
   counterfactual way of trying to get at the de jure question, either
   about SP or about CMP, suffers from substantial limitations. For
   example, perhaps you endorse conservatism: all else being equal, you
   say, the sensible thing to do is to continue with the way you've been
   doing things. But in the narrow original position, the conservative
   thing would be to continue in the agnosticism that is part of that
   position; so if, in that position, you accept conservatism, then the
   rational thing to do would be to remain agnostic.

   [144] Another possibility is that in the narrow original position with
   respect to SP, I continue to form beliefs the CMP way (so that the
   narrow position with respect to SP includes the beliefs I actually form
   on the basis of CMP). In that case, I think the probabilities would be
   with SP, at least if one thing I know in that position is that I have
   an enormously powerful tendency or natural inclination to form beliefs
   the SP way. God, as Descartes insisted, is no deceiver.

   [145] "The sceptic asks me, Why do you believe the existence of the
   external object which you perceive? This belief, sir, is none of my
   manufacture; it came from the mint of Nature; it bears her image and
   superscription; and, if it is not right, the fault is not mine; I ever
   took it upon trust, and without suspicion. Reason, says the sceptic, is
   the only judge of truth, and you ought to throw off every opinion and
   every belief that is not grounded on reason. Why, sir, should I believe
   the faculty of reason more than that of perception? They came both out
   of the same shop, and were made by the same artist; and if he puts one
   piece of false ware into my hands, what should hinder him from putting
   another?" (An Inquiry into the Human Mind, in Thomas Reid's Inquiry and
   Essays, ed. Ronald Beanblossom and Keith Lehrer [Indianapolis: Hackett
   Publishing, 1983], pp. 84-85).

   [146] See WCD, pp. 97ff. Of course I don't mean to suggest that Alston
   thinks SP does have to prove itself before the bar of reason; I am
   exploring various answers to the question what do we know or believe in
   the original position?'

Warrant and the Freud-and-Marx Complaint

   The genius of a man capable of explaining religion seems to me to be of
   a higher order than that of a founder of religion. And that is the
   glory to which I aspire.

   Charles DuPuis

   What we have seen so far is what the de jure question and criticism are
   not: it is not the complaint that the believer is not within her
   intellectual rights in believing as she does; it is not the complaint
   that she has no good argument from propositions that are self-evident,
   about her own mental states, or evident to the senses for her; it is
   not the complaint that she has no good argument of some other sort; it
   is not the complaint that her Christian belief lacks Alstonian
   justification, or means-end rationality; and it is not the complaint
   that it isn't practically rational to decide to continue to form belief
   on the basis of experience. None of these criticisms has much of a leg
   to stand on.

   So the de jure criticism has proven elusive. In the last chapter,
   however, we did finally catch a glimpse of our quarry--no more than a
   glimpse, though--and in this chapter I want to look further into the
   nature of this style of criticism, in part by trying to come to an
   understanding of the rejection of religious belief associated with
   Freud and Marx. Then I will point out the connection between the de
   jure question, properly understood, and warrant, the subject of the two
   preceding books in this series. In the next few chapters, I will
   consider more explicitly the question whether Christian belief can have
   warrant even if it doesn't receive it by way of argument or
   propositional evidence. This is really the question (as I might have
   put it in "Reason and Belief in God" [150] ) whether belief in God and
   Christian belief more generally can be properly basic--properly basic
   with respect to warrant. (It is also the question I was raising [rather
   inchoately] in God and Other Minds. [151] ) Perhaps another way to put
   this question is to ask whether Christian belief can get warrant, not
   by argument but by virtue of (broadly construed) religious experience.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. The F&M Complaint

   As we have seen, atheologians (those who argue against Christian
   belief) have often claimed that Christian belief is irrational; so far,
   we have failed to find a sensible version of this claim. But perhaps we
   can make progress by exploring the animadversions on Christian belief
   proposed by Freud, Marx, and the whole cadre of their nineteenth- and
   twentieth-century followers. [152] We could also examine here
   Nietzsche's similar complaint: that religion originates in slave
   morality, in the ressentiment of the oppressed. As Nietzsche sees it,
   Christianity both fosters and arises from a sort of sniveling,
   cowardly, servile, evasive, duplicitous, and all-around contemptible
   sort of character, which is at the same time envious, self-righteous,
   and full of hate disguised as charitable kindness. (Not a pretty
   picture.) I've chosen not to consider Nietzsche for two reasons: first,
   he really has little to add to what Marx and Freud say; second, he is
   harder to take seriously. He writes with a fine coruscating brilliance,
   his outrageous rhetoric is sometimes entertaining, and no doubt much of
   the extravagance is meant as overstatement to make a point. Taken
   overall, however, the violence and exaggeration seem pathological; for
   a candidate for the sober truth, we shall certainly have to look
   elsewhere. [153]

   Now Freud, Marx, and their many epigoni (and anticipators) criticize
   religious belief; they purport to find something wrong with it; they
   are masters of suspicion' and (at any rate in their own view) unmask
   it. And in examining their critical comments on religious belief, I
   think we can finally locate a proper de jure question: one that is
   distinct from the de facto question, is such that the answer is
   nontrivial, and is relevant in the sense that a negative answer to it
   would be a serious point against Christian belief. The first order of
   business, therefore, is to try to get clear as to what the Freud-Marx
   critical project (the F&M complaint', as I shall call it) really is.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Freud

   There are several sides to Freud's critique of religion. For example,
   he was fascinated by what he saw as the Darwinian picture of early
   human beings coming together in packs or herds (like wolves or elk),
   all the females belonging to one powerful, dominant, jealous male, and
   he tells a dramatic story about how religion arose out of an
   extraordinary interaction among the members of that primal horde:

   The father of the primal horde, since he was an unlimited despot, had
   seized all the women for himself; his sons, being dangerous to him as
   rivals, had been killed or driven away. One day, however, the sons came
   together and united to overwhelm, kill, and devour their father, who
   had been their enemy but also their ideal. After the deed they were
   unable to take over their heritage since they stood in one another's
   way. Under the influence of failure and remorse they learned to come to
   an agreement among themselves; they banded themselves into a clan of
   brothers by the help of the ordinances of totemism, which aimed at
   preventing a repetition of such a deed, and they jointly undertook to
   forgo the possession of the women on whose account they had killed
   their father. They were then driven to finding strange women, and this
   was the origin of the exogamy which is so closely bound up with
   totemism. The Totem meal was the festival commemorating the fearful
   deed from which sprang man's sense of guilt (or original sin'). . . .

   . . . This view of religion throws a particularly clear light upon the
   psychological basis of Christianity, in which, as we know, the ceremony
   of the totem meal still survives, with but little distortion, in the
   form of Communion. [154]

   Strong stuff, this, displaying Freud's redoubtable imaginative powers
   and his ability to tell a sensational story; [155] all the
   elements--sex, murder, cannibalism, remorse--of a dandy Hollywood
   spectacular are here. Taken as a serious attempt at a historical
   account of the origin of religion, though, it has little to recommend
   it and is at best a wild guess, much less science than science fiction.
   [156] But perhaps Freud didn't intend it as sober and literal truth.
   (He himself calls it a vision'.) Perhaps it is something like a
   parable, maybe something like how some Christians understand early
   Genesis or Job, meant to illustrate and present a truth in graphic but
   nonliteral form. (Maybe here as elsewhere Freud is under the spell of
   biblical ways of writing and thinking.) And just as it isn't always
   easy to draw the right moral from a biblical parable, so it isn't easy
   to see what Freud intends us to gather from this gripping if grisly
   little tale.

   In any event, Freud offers quite a different account of the
   psychological origins of religious (theistic) belief:

   These [religious beliefs], which are given out as teachings, are not
   precipitates of experience or end-results of thinking: they are
   illusions, fulfillments of the oldest, strongest and most urgent wishes
   of mankind. The secret of their strength lies in the strength of those
   wishes. As we already know, the terrifying impressions of helplessness
   in childhood aroused the need for protection--for protection through
   love--which was provided by the father; and the recognition that this
   helplessness lasts throughout life made it necessary to cling to the
   existence of a father, but this time a more powerful one. Thus the
   benevolent rule of a divine Providence allays our fear of the dangers
   of life; the establishment of a moral world-order ensures the
   fulfillment of the demands of justice, which have so often remained
   unfulfilled in human civilization; and the prolongation of earthly
   existence in a future life provides the local and temporal framework in
   which these wish-fulfillments shall take place. [157]

   As we see, there is more to Freud's critique than phantasmagoric fables
   about the primal horde. The idea is that theistic belief arises from a
   psychological mechanism Freud calls wish-fulfillment'; the wish in this
   case is father, not to the deed, but to the belief. Nature rises up
   against us, cold, pitiless, implacable, blind to our needs and desires.
   She delivers hurt, fear, and pain; in the end, she demands our death.
   Paralyzed and appalled, we invent (unconsciously, of course) a Father
   in Heaven who exceeds our earthly fathers as much in power and
   knowledge as in goodness and benevolence; the alternative would be to
   sink into depression, stupor, paralysis, and finally death. According
   to Freud, belief in God is an illusion in a semitechnical use of the
   term: a belief that arises from the mechanism of wish-fulfillment. This
   illusion somehow becomes internalized. [158]

   An illusion (as opposed to a delusion), says Freud, is not necessarily
   false; and he goes on to add that it isn't possible to prove that
   theistic belief is mistaken. Nevertheless, there is more here than a
   mere antiseptic comment on the origin of religion. Although religion
   originates in the cognitive mechanism of wish-fulfillment, Freud
   apparently believes that it is within our power to resist this
   illusion, and that there is something condemnable, something
   intellectually irresponsible, in failing to do so:

   If ever there was a case of a lame excuse we have it here. Ignorance is
   ignorance; no right to believe anything can be derived from it. In
   other matters no sensible person will behave so irresponsibly or rest
   content with such feeble grounds for his opinions and for the line he
   takes. . . . Where questions of religion are concerned, people are
   guilty of every possible sort of dishonesty and intellectual
   misdemeanour. [159]

   Psychoanalysis, furthermore, provides arguments against the truth of
   religious belief: "If the application of the psycho-analytic method
   makes it possible to find a new argument against the truths [sic] of
   religion, tant pis for religion . . . ." (p. 37). Once we see that
   religious belief takes its origin in wishful thinking, we will
   presumably no longer find it attractive; perhaps this will also induce
   in us a certain pity for those benighted souls who will never rise to
   our enlightened heights:

   The whole thing is so patently infantile, so incongruous with reality,
   that to one whose attitude to humanity is friendly, it is painful to
   think that the great majority of mortals will never be able to rise
   above this view of life. [160]

   Freud hopes and expects that we human beings will eventually give up
   religious belief, once we are clear about its origin, in favor of a
   view of the world that is closer to the actual facts of the matter:

   I am reminded of one of my children who was distinguished at an early
   age by a peculiarly marked matter-of-factness. When the children were
   being told a fairy story and were listening to it with rapt attention,
   he would come up and ask: "Is that a true story?" When he was told it
   was not, he would turn away with a look of disdain. We may expect that
   people will soon behave in the same way towards the fairy tales of
   religion. . . . [161]

   The fundamental theme here, therefore, is that religious belief arises
   from wish-fulfillment. We shall have to try to see more exactly what
   this amounts to and what bearing, if any, it has on the rationality of
   Christian belief; first, however, we should briefly note Marx's rather
   similar criticism.

   [155] Freud tells a similarly fantastic story about how we human beings
   tamed fire--"a quite extraordinary and unexampled achievement," he
   says--and turned it to our use: Psychoanalytic material, incomplete as
   it is and not susceptible to clear interpretation, nevertheless admits
   of a conjecture--a fantastic-sounding one--about the origin of this
   human feat. It is as though primal man had the habit, when he came in
   contact with fire, of satisfying an infantile desire connected with it,
   by putting it out with a stream of his urine. The legends that we
   possess leave no doubt about the originally phallic view taken of
   tongues of flame as they shoot upwards. Putting out fire by
   micturating--a theme to which modern giants, Gulliver in Lilliput and
   Rabelais' Gargantua, still hark back--was therefore a kind of a sexual
   act with a male, an enjoyment of sexual potency in a homosexual
   competition. The first person to renounce this desire and spare the
   fire was able to carry it off with him and subdue it to his own use. By
   damping down the fire of his own sexual excitation, he had tamed the
   natural force of fire. This great cultural conquest was thus the reward
   for his renunciation of instinct. Further, it is as though woman had
   been appointed guardian of the fire which was held captive on the
   domestic hearth, because her anatomy made it impossible for her to
   yield to the temptation of this desire. (Civilization and Its

    B. Marx

   Marx's most famous pronouncement on religion:

   The basis of irreligious criticism is man makes religion, religion does
   not make man. In other words, religion is the self-consciousness and
   the self-feeling of the man who has either not yet found himself, or
   else (having found himself) has lost himself once more. But man is no
   abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man,
   the state, society. This state, this society, produce religion, a
   perverted world consciousness, because they are a perverted world. . .
   .

   Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress
   and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the
   oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the
   spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.

   The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is
   required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusions
   about its condition is the demand to give up a condition which requires
   illusions. The criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the
   criticism of the vale of woe, the halo of which is religion [Marx's
   emphasis]. [162]

   Marx suggests that religion arises from perverted world
   consciousness--perverted from a correct, or right, or natural
   condition. Religion involves a cognitive dysfunction, a disorder or
   perversion that is apparently brought about, somehow, by an unhealthy
   and perverted social order. Religious belief, according to Marx, is a
   result of cognitive dysfunction, of a lack of mental and emotional
   health. The believer is therefore in an etymological sense insane.
   Because of a dysfunctional, perverse social environment, the believer's
   cognitive equipment isn't working properly. If his cognitive equipment
   were working properly--if, for example, it were working more like
   Marx's--he would not be under the spell of this illusion. He would
   instead face the world and our place in it with the clear-eyed
   apprehension that we are alone, and that any comfort and help we get
   will have to be of our own devising. [163]

   And here we can see an initial difference between Freud and Marx: Freud
   doesn't necessarily think religious belief is produced by cognitive
   faculties that are malfunctioning. Religious belief--specifically
   belief in God--is, indeed, produced by wish-fulfillment; it is the
   product of illusion; still, illusion and wish-fulfillment have their
   functions. In this case, their function is to enable us to get along in
   this cold and heartless world into which we find ourselves thrown. How
   then is this a criticism of religious belief? Freud speaks elsewhere of
   a "reality principle." Beliefs produced by wish-fulfillment aren't
   oriented toward reality; their function is not to produce true belief,
   but belief with some other property (psychological comfort, for
   example). So we could initially put it like this: religious belief is
   produced by cognitive processes whose function is not that of producing
   true beliefs, but rather that of producing beliefs conducive to
   psychological well-being. We will look into this in more detail below;
   for the moment, perhaps what we can say is that the Marxist criticism
   of religious belief is that it is produced by disordered cognitive
   processes, while the Freudian criticism is that it is produced by
   processes that are not aimed at the production of true beliefs.

   [162] "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right,
   Introduction," in On Religion, by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, tr.
   Reinhold Niebuhr (Chico, Calif.: Scholar's Press, 1964), pp. 41-42.
   Engels echoes Marx: All religion, however, is nothing but the fantastic
   reflection in men's minds of those external forces which control their
   daily life, a reflection in which the terrestrial forces assume the
   form of supernatural forces. In the beginnings of history it was the
   forces of nature which were first so reflected and which in the course
   of further evolution underwent the most manifold and varied
   personifications among the various peoples. . . . But it is not long
   before, side by side with the forces of nature, social forces begin to
   be active--forces which confront man as equally alien and at first
   inexplicable, dominating him with the same apparent natural necessity
   as the forces of nature themselves. . . . At a still further stage of
   evolution, all the natural and social attributes of the numerous gods
   are transferred to one almighty god, who is but a reflection of the
   abstract man. Such was the origin of monotheism. . . . It is still true
   that man proposes and God (that is, the alien domination of the
   capitalist mode of production) disposes. . . . What is above all
   necessary for this is a social act. And when this act has been
   accomplished, when society, by taking possession of all means of
   production and using them on a planned basis, has freed itself and all
   its members from the bondage in which they are now held by these means
   of production which they themselves have produced but which confront
   them as an irresistible alien force; when, therefore man not only
   proposes, but also disposes--only then will the last alien force which
   is still reflected in religion vanish; and with it will also vanish the
   religious reflection itself, for the simple reason that then there will
   be nothing left to reflect. (Anti-DÃ¼hring, pp. 147-49 in On Religion)

   see below, p. 162.
     __________________________________________________________________

    C. Others

   We must take a deeper look at these claims. First, however, we should
   note that although Freud and Marx often get the credit for this alleged
   unmasking (perhaps with a crumb thrown in the direction of Nietzsche),
   its essence is to be found much earlier. Jean-Jacques Rousseau
   (1712-78) thought Christian belief was a product of corrupt society,
   and that the natural spirituality of our souls has been damaged by a
   Christianized civilization; he thus anticipates Marx in seeing
   Christian belief as a result of cognitive malfunction resulting from
   social malfunction. David Hume, a British contemporary of Rousseau,
   anticipates Freud:

   It must necessarily, indeed, be allowed, that, in order to carry men's
   intention beyond the present course of things, or lead them into any
   inference concerning invisible intelligent power, they must be actuated
   by some passion, which prompts their thought and reflection; some
   motive, which urges their first enquiry. But what passion shall we here
   have recourse to, for explaining an effect of such mighty consequences?
   Not speculative curiosity, surely, or the pure love of truth. That
   motive is too refined for such gross apprehensions; and would lead men
   into enquiries concerning the frame of nature, a subject too large and
   comprehensive for their narrow capacities. No passions, therefore, can
   be supposed to work upon such barbarians, but the ordinary affections
   of human life; the anxious concern for happiness, the dread of future
   misery, the terror of death, the thirst of revenge, the appetite for
   food and other necessaries. Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature,
   especially the latter, men scrutinize with a trembling curiosity, the
   course of future causes, and examine the various and contrary events of
   human life. And in this disordered scene, with eyes still more
   disordered and astonished, they see the first obscure traces of
   divinity. [164]

   What is crucial here is the claim that religious belief does not arise
   from the pure love of truth', but from other sources: desire for
   happiness, fear of death, and the like. In fact Hume ironically
   suggests that Christian belief is so contrary to experience and to the
   "principles of understanding" (i.e., the deliverances of reason) that a
   reasonable person can accept it only by virtue of a miracle:

   upon the whole, we may conclude that the Christian Religion not only
   was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be
   believed by any reasonable person without one. . . . Whoever is moved
   by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued miracle in his
   own person, which subverts all the principles of his understanding, and
   gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom
   and experience. [165]

   So the fundamental thrust of Hume's suggestion, as of Freud's, is that
   religious belief doesn't emerge from the segment of our whole cognitive
   economy that is, as we might put it, aimed at the production of true
   belief; it comes, instead, from a desire for security or a fear of
   death or whatever. And of course what underlies Hume's ironic jape is
   the idea that Christian belief goes directly contrary to the
   deliverances of reason and experience.

   Many of our contemporaries also see religious beliefs in these terms.
   Thus Northrop Frye weighs in on Marx's side, but employs Freudian or
   semi-Freudian categories: speaking of "the curious aberration of
   believing the Bible'," he says:

   such belief is really a voluntarily induced schizophrenia, and probably
   a fruitful source of the infantilism and hysterical anxieties about
   belief which are so frequently found in the neighborhood of religion,
   at least in its more uncritical areas. [166]

   In the same vein, we have Don Cupitt: "Theological realism can only be
   actually true for [i. e. thought to be true by] a heteronomous
   consciousness such as no normal person ought now to have." [167] Those
   who claim that they really are theological realists' (i.e., claim that
   they really do believe in God), he says, are hypocrites [168] or have
   succumbed to "a kind of madness." [169] Cupitt seems to think that
   (perhaps, as they say, given what we now know') you would have to be
   psychotic to actually be a theological realist (one who believes that
   there really is such a person as God); if you are not psychotic but
   nonetheless profess theistic belief, then you must be one of those
   hypocrites Christian churches are supposed to be full of.

   A final witness. Charles Daniels agrees with Freud in finding the
   origin of religious belief in wishful thinking:

   we must begin to entertain suspicions that the explanation for these
   [religious] experiences does not lie in any perceived religious
   reality, but is rather the effect of some other cause--perhaps
   excessive emotion and fervor. . . .

   It is not at all difficult, however, to construct a plausible
   explanation not consisting of mere possibilities like the machinations
   of demons, why people should come very strongly to believe there to be
   a divinely populated religious reality which is perceived in religious
   experience even when there is none . . . we very much want there to be
   an understandable order to the universe, we very much want our lives to
   be of consequence, and we very much want to know in practical detail
   what's right and wrong. Religion addresses what we very much want. The
   universe has an intelligible order because there is an intelligent
   powerful God who made it. We are important because God made us (as
   Christians say, "in his image") and gave us the faculties of
   understanding and free, intelligent action. [170]

    D. How Shall We Understand the F&M Complaint?

   Now the F&M (Freud-and-Marx) complaint is, naturally enough, a
   complaint, a (negative) criticism of religious belief, including
   Christian belief. But the general project under which the efforts of
   Freud and Marx fall is that of giving naturalistic explanations of
   religious belief, explanations that don't involve the truth of the
   beliefs in question or the truth of any other supernaturalistic beliefs
   or hypotheses. Many (in addition to those cited above) have joined them
   in this effort, and by now there is quite a variety of naturalistic
   explanations of religious belief. [171] But of course giving a
   naturalistic account of a kind of belief isn't automatically a
   criticism of that kind of belief.

   Consider a priori belief, belief in such propositions as the laws of
   logic, perhaps, or the basic truths of arithmetic, or the proposition
   that if all cats are animals, and Maynard is a cat, then Maynard is an
   animal. Perhaps it is possible to give a naturalistic' account of our
   knowledge of these truths: an account, that is, that stands in the same
   relation to them as a naturalistic account of religious belief stands
   to it. Such an account would not invoke the truth of these a priori
   beliefs as part of the explanation; it would proceed instead by
   outlining certain salient features of the causal genesis or antecedents
   of these beliefs, perhaps pointing to events of some kind in the
   nervous system. The existence of a causal explanation, of this sort, of
   a priori belief would not show or tend to show that such beliefs are
   unreliable.

   The same would go for religious belief. To show that there are natural
   processes that produce religious belief does nothing, so far, to
   discredit it; perhaps God designed us in such a way that it is by
   virtue of those processes that we come to have knowledge of him.
   Suppose it could be demonstrated that a certain kind of complex neural
   stimulation could produce theistic belief. This would have no tendency
   to discredit religious belief--just as memory is not discredited by the
   fact that one can produce memory beliefs by stimulating the right part
   of the brain. Clearly, it is possible both that there is an explanation
   in terms of natural processes of religious belief (perhaps a brain
   physiological account of what happens when someone holds religious
   beliefs), and that these beliefs have a perfectly respectable epistemic
   status.

   If we are to have a criticism of religion by way of a naturalistic
   explanation, what we need is something that in some way discredits
   religious belief, casts doubt on it, shows that it is not epistemically
   respectable--in a word, shows that there is something wrong with it.
   And the criticism, of course, is that religious belief (including
   Christian belief) is irrational. But irrational in just what way? What
   exactly is wrong with religious belief, according to the F&M complaint?
   How, exactly, shall we understand the F&M complaint?

   First, an assumption underlying it. Going all the way back to Plato and
   Aristotle, it has been assumed that there are intellectual or cognitive
   or rational powers or faculties, or (possibly) virtues: for example,
   perception and memory. Joining the computer craze, we might say that
   these faculties have inputs and outputs; their outputs are beliefs. It
   is these processes that produce in us the myriad beliefs we hold. These
   faculties are also something like instruments; and, like instruments,
   they have a function or purpose. If we thought of ourselves as created
   and designed either by a Master Craftsman or by evolution, these
   cognitive faculties would be the parts of our total cognitive
   establishment or total cognitive design whose purpose it is to produce
   beliefs in us. Their overall purpose, furthermore, is presumably to
   produce true beliefs in us; to put it a bit less passively, they are
   designed in such a way that by using them properly we can come to true
   belief. Our cognitive faculties work over a surprisingly large area to
   deliver beliefs of many different topics: beliefs about our immediate
   environment; about the external world at large; about the past; about
   numbers, propositions, and other abstract objects and the relations
   between them; about other people and what they are thinking and
   feeling; about what the future will be like; about right and wrong;
   about God.

   These faculties and processes are the instruments or organs, as we
   might put it, whereby we come to have knowledge. They are aimed at the
   truth in the sense that their purpose or function is to furnish us with
   true belief. Like any other instruments or organs, they can work
   properly or improperly; they can function well or malfunction. A wart
   or a tumor doesn't either malfunction (although it might be by virtue
   of malfunction in some system that the tumor is present) or function
   properly: it doesn't have a function or purpose. But an organ--your
   heart, for example, or liver or pancreas--does have a function, and
   does either work properly or malfunction. And the same goes for
   cognitive faculties or capacities: they too can function well or ill.
   The condition in which they function really badly is insanity; of
   course there are much milder, less intrusive forms of cognitive
   malfunction.

   Now among these faculties one of the most important is reason. Taken
   narrowly, reason is the faculty or power whereby we form a priori
   beliefs, beliefs that are prior to experience or, better, independent,
   in some way, of experience. [172] These beliefs include what in chapter
   4 we called the deliverances of reason: first of all, simple truths of
   arithmetic and logic, such as 2 + 1 = 3 and if all men are mortal and
   Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. They also include such
   beliefs as that nothing can be red all over and also green all over and
   that to be a person you must at least be potentially capable of forming
   beliefs and having ends or aims. Still further, they include more
   controversial items, such as the belief that there are properties,
   states of affairs, propositions, and other abstract objects, and the
   belief that no object has a property in a possible world in which it
   doesn't exist. (So I say, anyway; there are those who disagree.) The
   deliverances of reason also include beliefs that obviously follow from
   deliverances of reason. [173] And still further, reason is the power or
   capacity whereby we see or detect logical relationships among
   propositions.

   There are other faculties or rational powers that have as their purpose
   the production of true beliefs in us; [174] for example, there are
   perception and memory, which, along with reason, constitute the
   standard package of chapter 4. Further, there are introspection, by
   which I learn such things about myself as that I am appeared to a
   certain way, and believe this or that; induction, whereby (in a way
   that defies explicit statement) we come to expect the future to be like
   the past in certain respects, thereby being able to learn from
   experience; [175] and Thomas Reid's sympathy, whereby we come to be
   aware of what other people are thinking, feeling, and believing. Still
   further, there is testimony or credulity, whereby we learn from others,
   by believing what they tell us. By sympathy I learn that you are
   telling me that your name is Archibald; for me to believe you, however,
   something further is required. (Thus by perception, I see that you are
   in such and such a bodily state; by sympathy, I learn that you are
   claiming that your name is Archibald; and by testimony, I believe you.)

   The Enlightenment looked askance at testimony and tradition; Locke saw
   them as a preeminent source of error. The Enlightenment idea is that
   perhaps we start by learning from others--our parents, for example.
   Properly mature and independent adults, however, will have passed
   beyond all that and believe what they do on the basis of the evidence.
   But this is a mistake; you can't know so much as your name or what city
   you live in without relying on testimony. (Will you produce your birth
   certificate for the first, or consult a handy map for the second? In
   each case you are of course relying on testimony.) As Thomas Reid puts
   it:

   I believed by instinct whatever they [my "parents and tutors"] told me,
   long before I had the idea of a lie, or a thought of the possibility of
   their deceiving me. Afterwards, upon reflection, I found they had acted
   like fair and honest people, who wished me well. I found that, if I had
   not believed what they told me, before I could give a reason for my
   belief, I had to this day been little better than a changeling. And
   although this natural credulity hath sometimes occasioned my being
   imposed upon by deceivers, yet it hath been of infinite advantage to me
   upon the whole; therefore, I consider it as another good gift of
   Nature. [176]

   In addition to the cognitive powers or rational faculties mentioned so
   far there may be others that are more controversial. For example, we
   seem to have a moral sense: certain kinds of behavior and certain kinds
   of character seem wrong, bad, to be avoided; others seem right, good,
   fitting, to be promoted. It is obviously wrong (all else being equal)
   to hurt young children or to refuse to care for your aging parents;
   perhaps we see this by way of a sort of moral sense. (It is no doubt
   because this moral sense can malfunction, or atrophy, that inability to
   tell right from wrong is a legal defense.) My point here is not to
   argue that indeed there is a moral sense, although I believe that there
   is, but rather to note that there could well be truth-aimed faculties
   in addition to the ones mentioned so far. Similarly a believer in God
   might think that there is such a thing as Calvin's sensus divinitatis,
   [177] a natural, inborn sense of God, or of divinity, that is the
   origin and source of the world's religions; perhaps there is also such
   a thing as the inward invitation or instigation of the Holy Spirit (to
   anticipate chapter 8) whereby the believer comes to accept the central
   truths of the Christian faith.

   As we have seen, these rational faculties can function either properly
   or improperly. We ordinarily take it for granted that when our
   cognitive faculties are functioning properly, when they are not subject
   to dysfunction or malfunction, then, for the most part, the beliefs
   they produce are true, or close to the truth. If your perceptual
   faculties are functioning properly, what you think you see is probably
   what you do see. (If you are suffering from delirium tremens, all bets
   are off.) There is, we might say, a presumption of reliability for
   properly functioning faculties; we are inclined (rightly or wrongly) to
   take it that properly functioning cognitive faculties for the most part
   deliver true belief. Of course there will be mistakes and
   disagreements, and we may be inclined to skepticism about various areas
   of belief: political beliefs, for example, as well as beliefs formed at
   the limits of our ability, as in particle physics and cosmology; but
   the bulk of the everyday beliefs delivered by our rational faculties,
   so we think, are true. At any rate, the deliverances of our rational
   faculties, taken broadly, comprise our best bet for achieving truth.

   Returning finally to the F&M complaint, it's clear that it has to do
   with the deliverances of our rational faculties. Freud and Marx
   acquiesce in the presumption of reliability; they assume (as do we all)
   that when our rational faculties are functioning properly and are used
   properly, then for the most part their deliverances are true, or at any
   rate close to the truth. Of course, as we saw, it is possible for
   cognitive faculties to function well or ill. The insane beliefs of
   Descartes's madmen [178] were due to cognitive malfunction of some
   sort. There are more subtle ways, however, in which nonrational or
   irrational beliefs can be formed in us. First of all, there are
   belief-forming processes or mechanisms that are aimed, not at the
   formation of true belief, but at the formation of belief with some
   other property--the property of contributing to survival, perhaps, or
   to peace of mind or psychological well-being in this sometimes
   dangerous and threatening world of ours. [179] Those with a lethal
   disease may believe their chances for recovery much higher than the
   statistics in their possession would warrant; again, the function of
   the relevant process would not be that of furnishing true beliefs but
   of furnishing beliefs that make it more likely that the believer will
   recover. A mountaineer whose survival depends on his ability to leap a
   crevasse may form an extremely optimistic estimate of his powers as a
   long-jumper; it is more likely that he will be able to leap the
   crevasse (or at least give it a try) if he thinks he can than if he
   thinks he can't. Most of us form estimates of our intelligence, wisdom,
   and moral fiber that are considerably higher than an objective estimate
   would warrant; no doubt 90 percent of us think ourselves well above
   average along these lines. [180]

   A person may be blinded (as we say) by ambition, failing to see that a
   certain course of action is wrong or stupid, even though it is obvious
   to everyone else. Our idea, here, is that inordinately ambitious people
   fail to recognize something they would otherwise recognize; the normal
   functioning of some aspect of their cognitive powers is inhibited or
   overridden or impeded by that excessive ambition. You may be blinded
   also by loyalty, continuing to believe in the honesty of your friend
   long after an objective look at the evidence would have dictated a
   reluctant change of mind. You can also be blinded by covetousness,
   love, fear, lust, anger, pride, grief, social pressure, and a thousand
   other things. In polemic, it is common to attack someone's views by
   claiming that the denial of what they think is patently obvious (i.e.,
   such that any right-thinking, properly functioning person can
   immediately see that it is so); we then attribute their opposing this
   obvious truth either to dishonesty (they don't really believe what they
   say; after all, who could?) or to their being blinded by something or
   other--maybe a reluctance to change, an aversion to new ideas, personal
   ambition, sexism, racism, or homophobia. Thus according to Judith
   Plaskow, "If the Rabbinical Assembly Law Committee cannot see that it
   is reflecting and supporting a long history of religious homophobia
   (Jewish and otherwise), then it is either willfully blind or patently
   dishonest." [181] In a similar vein, Richard Dawkins insists (in a
   recent review in the New York Times), "It is absolutely safe to say
   that if you meet someone who claims not to believe in evolution, that
   person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not
   consider that)." [182] Dawkins apparently thinks the truth of evolution
   is utterly clear and obvious to anyone who is not unduly ignorant, is
   not too stupid to follow the arguments, and is sane (i.e., with
   rational faculties that are functioning properly); it is therefore
   obvious that all who aren't just (wickedly) lying through their teeth
   would have to admit that they believe in evolution. What are appealed
   to in all these cases are mechanisms that can override or cancel what
   our rational faculties would ordinarily deliver, substituting a belief
   that is either contrary to what unimpeded rational faculties would
   deliver, or at any rate distinct from what reason would deliver.

   What we see, therefore, is that there are at least three ways in which
   a belief can fail to be a proper deliverance of our rational faculties:
   it may be produced by malfunctioning faculties, by cognitive processes
   aimed at something other than the truth, or by faculties whose function
   has been impeded and overridden by lust, ambition, greed, selfishness,
   grief, fear, low self-esteem, and other emotional conditions. [183]
   Accordingly, a belief can fail to be a proper deliverance of our
   rational faculties by way of malfunction and by way of being produced
   by a process that is not aimed at the production of true belief.

   And here we come to the heart of the F&M objection: when F&M say that
   Christian belief, or theistic belief, or even perhaps religious belief
   in general is irrational, the basic idea is that belief of this sort is
   not among the proper deliverances of our rational faculties. It is not
   produced by properly functioning truth-aimed cognitive faculties or
   processes. It is not produced by belief-producing processes that are
   free of dysfunction and whose purpose it is to furnish us with true
   belief. And this means that the presumption of the reliability of
   properly functioning cognitive faculties does not apply to the
   processes that yield belief in God or Christian belief more broadly.
   The fundamental idea is that religious belief has a source distinct
   from those of our faculties that are aimed at the truth. Alternatively,
   if religious belief does somehow issue from those truth-aimed
   faculties, their operation, when they function in such a way as to
   produce religious belief, is overridden and impeded by something else:
   a need for security, or for feeling important in the whole scheme of
   things, or for psychological comfort in the face of this pitiless,
   intimidating, and implacable world we face.

   Just what sort of deviation from the norm does religious belief
   present? Here Freud and Marx seem to diverge. Although Marx has
   relatively little to say about religion, there is of course that famous
   passage I quoted above (pp. 140-41); he seems to hold that what our
   rational faculties teach us (when they are unimpeded by that cognitive
   dysfunction produced by a perverted social order) is that there is no
   God and no religious meaning to life. There is no Father in Heaven to
   turn to and no prospect of anything, after death, but dissolution. The
   fundamental idea is that religious belief is irrational in a double
   sense: first, it is a product of cognitive faculties that are
   malfunctioning in response to social and political disorder; second,
   what these faculties produce when malfunctioning in this way is
   contrary to the deliverances of our rational faculties--that is,
   contrary to what they deliver when they function properly. For Freud,
   too, the main point is that theistic and religious belief, or theistic
   belief insofar as it is religious, does not arise from the proper
   function of truth-aimed cognitive processes or faculties, but rather
   from wishful thinking. [184] This is the force of Freud's claim that
   religious belief is an illusion. Of course, illusions have their
   functions, and a place in the human cognitive design plan; they may
   serve important ends, such as the end Freud thinks religious belief
   serves. Nevertheless, such cognitive processes as wishful thinking are
   not aimed at the production of true beliefs. Beliefs produced by
   wishful thinking are therefore irrational or nonrational in the sense
   that they are not produced by our rational faculties; they are not
   produced by truth-aimed cognitive processes. Like Marx, however, Freud
   thinks religious belief is also irrational in a stronger sense. Such
   belief runs contrary to the deliverances of our rational powers; they
   are "patently infantile" and "foreign to reality."

   The F&M criticism, then, is that religious belief is not produced by
   cognitive faculties that are functioning properly and aimed at the
   truth. And this, I think, leads us finally to a viable de jure
   question. Those who raise this question are not interested first of all
   in the truth of Christian belief: their claim is that there is
   something wrong with believing it. Christian belief may be true, and it
   may be false; but at any rate it is irrational to accept it. They are
   best construed, I think, as complaining that Christian belief is not
   produced by cognitive faculties functioning properly and aimed at the
   truth. Now what this suggests (at least to anyone who has taken a look
   at the first two volumes in this series) is warrant. Freud and Marx,
   from the perspective of those volumes, are really complaining that
   theistic belief and religious belief generally lack warrant. And the de
   jure criticism, so it seems to me, is best construed as the claim that
   Christian belief, whether true or false, is at any rate without
   warrant.

   professor, and that which his scarlet would blush at, to have his
   authority of forty years standing wrought out of hard rock Greek and

   malfunction.

   [184] Freud thinks of reason as the aggregate of those faculties (and
   he thinks of them as the ones involved in the pursuit of science); his
   idea, furthermore, is that reason taken this way is the only means we
   have for achieving the truth. Displaying that touching confidence in
   science characteristic of the Enlightenment, Freud assumes that
   scientific reason will enable us to achieve the truth in areas where
   for centuries we wandered in darkness; more modestly, perhaps reason so
   taken gives us our best shot at the truth. Ironically enough, there is
   excellent reason to doubt that Freud's characteristic contributions
   themselves constitute science in any sensible sense; see Adolf
   GrÃ¼nbaum's The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (Berkeley: University of
   California Press, 1984).

   Freud and Marx were equal-opportunity animadverters, attacking religion
   generally and without discrimination.

   [153] I don't mean for a moment to dispute Merold Westphal's contention
   (in Suspicion and Faith: The Religious Uses of Modern Atheism [Grand
   Rapids: W. B. Eerdmans, 1993]) that Christians have something to learn
   from Nietzsche (as from Freud and Marx). Of course they do, but the
   same lessons can be learned at a much subtler level from, for example,
   the Bible--where, as Westphal points out, Nietzsche's criticisms,
   insofar as they are on the mark, are anticipated. Taken as a serious
   account of the origin of Christianity, however, Nietzsche's intemperate
   scoldings can't really be seen as a serious contribution to the
   subject.

  II. Warrant: The Sober Truth

   I've said most [185] of what I have to say about the nature of warrant
   in Warrant: The Current Debate (WCD) and WPF. To spare the reader a
   trip to the library, however, I will briefly recapitulate; readers who
   want more depth and detail should consult those volumes (although on
   pp. 156ff. below I make a correction to what is said in WCD and WPF).
   The question is as old as Plato's Theaetetus: what is it that
   distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief? What further quality or
   quantity must a true belief have, if it is to constitute knowledge?
   This is one of the main questions of epistemology. (No doubt that is
   why it is called theory of knowledge'.) Along with nearly all
   subsequent thinkers, Plato takes it for granted that knowledge is at
   least true belief: you know a proposition p only if you believe it, and
   only if it is true. But Plato goes on to point out that true belief,
   while necessary for knowledge, is clearly not sufficient: it is
   entirely possible to believe something that is true without knowing it.
   You are congenitally given to pessimism; you believe that the stock
   market will plunge tomorrow, even though you have no evidence; even if
   you turn out to be right, you didn't know. You have traveled two
   thousand miles to the North Cascades for a climbing trip; you are
   desperately eager to climb. Being an incurable optimist, you believe it
   will be bright, sunny, and warm tomorrow, despite the forecast, which
   calls for high winds and a nasty mixture of rain, sleet, and snow. As
   it turns out, the forecasters were wrong, and tomorrow turns out sunny
   and beautiful: your belief was true, but didn't constitute knowledge.

   Suppose we use the term warrant' to denote that further quality or
   quantity (perhaps it comes in degrees), whatever precisely it may be,
   enough of which distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief. Then our
   question (the subject of WPF): what is warrant? My suggestion (WPF,
   chapters 1 and 2) begins with the idea that a belief has warrant only
   if it is produced by cognitive faculties that are functioning properly,
   subject to no disorder or dysfunction--construed as including absence
   of impedance as well as pathology. The notion of proper function is
   fundamental to our central ways of thinking about knowledge.

   But that notion is inextricably bound with another: that of a design
   plan. [186] Human beings and their organs are so constructed that there
   is a way they should work, a way they are supposed to work, a way they
   work when they work right; this is the way they work when there is no
   malfunction. There is a way in which your heart is supposed to work:
   for example, your pulse rate should be about 50 to 80 beats per minute
   when you are at rest and (if you are under age forty) achieve a maximum
   rate of some 180 to 200 beats per minute when you are exercising really
   hard. If your resting pulse is 160, or if you can't get your pulse
   above 60 beats per minute no matter how hard you work, then your heart
   isn't functioning properly. (Then again, a bird whose resting heart
   rate is 160 might be perfectly healthy.) We needn't initially take the
   notions of design plan and way in which a thing is supposed to work to
   entail conscious design or purpose. I don't here mean to claim that
   organisms are created by a conscious agent (God) according to a design
   plan, in something like the way in which human artifacts are
   constructed and designed (although in fact I think something like that
   is true). I am not supposing, initially at least, that having a design
   plan implies having been created by God or some other conscious agent;
   it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone
   else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans. [187] I mean,
   instead, to point to something nearly all of us, theists or not,
   believe: there is a way in which a human organ or system works when it
   works properly, works as it is supposed to work; and this way of
   working is given by its design or design plan.

   Proper function and design go hand in hand with the notion of purpose
   or function. The various organs and systems of the body (and the ways
   in which they work) have their functions, their purposes: the function
   or purpose of the heart is to pump the blood; of the immune system, to
   fight off disease; of the lungs to provide oxygen; of peristalsis, to
   move nutrients along the intestinal tract, and so on. If the design is
   a good design, then when the organ or system functions properly (i.e.,
   according to its design plan), that purpose will be achieved. The
   design plan specifies a particular way of working that subserves that
   purpose. Of course, the design plan for human beings will include
   specifications for our cognitive system or faculties, as well as for
   noncognitive systems and organs. Like the rest of our organs and
   systems, our cognitive faculties can work well or ill; they can
   malfunction or function properly. They too work in a certain way when
   they are functioning properly--and work in a certain way to accomplish
   their purpose. Accordingly, the first element in our conception of
   warrant (so I say) is that a belief has warrant for someone only if her
   faculties are functioning properly, are subject to no dysfunction, in
   producing that belief. [188]

   But that's not enough. Many systems of your body, obviously, are
   designed to work in a certain kind of environment. You can't breathe
   under water; your muscles atrophy in zero gravity; you can't get enough
   oxygen at the top of Mount Everest. Clearly, the same goes for your
   cognitive faculties; they too will achieve their purpose only if
   functioning in an environment much like the one for which they were
   designed (by God or evolution). Thus they won't work well in an
   environment (on some other planet, for example) in which a certain
   subtle radiation impedes the function of memory.

   And this is still not enough. It is clearly possible that a belief be
   produced by cognitive faculties that are functioning properly in an
   environment for which they were designed, but nonetheless lack warrant;
   the above two conditions are not sufficient. We think that the purpose
   or function of our belief-producing faculties is to furnish us with
   true (or verisimilitudinous) belief. As we saw above in connection with
   the F&M complaint, however, it is clearly possible that the purpose or
   function of some belief-producing faculties or mechanisms is the
   production of beliefs with some other virtue--perhaps that of enabling
   us to get along in this cold, cruel, threatening world, or of enabling
   us to survive a dangerous situation or a life-threatening disease. So
   we must add that the belief in question is produced by cognitive
   faculties such that the purpose of those faculties is that of producing
   true belief. More exactly, we must add that the portion of the design
   plan governing the production of the belief in question is aimed at the
   production of true belief (rather than survival, or psychological
   comfort, or the possibility of loyalty, or something else).

   Even this isn't sufficient. We can see why by reflecting on a fantasy
   of David Hume's:

   This world, for aught he knows, is very faulty and imperfect, compared
   to a superior standard; and was only the first rude essay of some
   infant Deity, who afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of his lame
   performance; it is the work only of some dependent, inferior Deity; and
   is the object of derision to his superiors; it is the production of old
   age and dotage in some superannuated Deity; and ever since his death,
   has run on at adventures, from the first impulse and active force,
   which it received from him. [189]

   So imagine that a young and untutored apprentice deity sets out to
   build cognitive beings, beings capable of belief and knowledge.
   Immaturity and incompetence triumph; the design contains serious
   glitches. In fact, in some areas of the design, when the faculties work
   just as they were designed to, the result is ludicrously false belief:
   thus when the cognitive faculties of these beings are working according
   to their design plan, they constantly confuse horses and hearses,
   forming the odd beliefs that cowboys in the old West rode hearses and
   that corpses are usually transported in horses. These beliefs are then
   produced by cognitive faculties working properly in the right sort of
   environment according to a design plan aimed at truth, but they still
   lack warrant. What is missing? Clearly enough, what must be added is
   that the design plan in question is a good one, one that is
   successfully aimed at truth, one such that there is a high (objective)
   probability that a belief produced according to that plan will be true
   (or nearly true).

   Put in a nutshell, then, a belief has warrant for a person S only if
   that belief is produced in S by cognitive faculties functioning
   properly (subject to no dysfunction) in a cognitive environment that is
   appropriate for S's kind of cognitive faculties, according to a design
   plan that is successfully aimed at truth. We must add, furthermore,
   that when a belief meets these conditions and does enjoy warrant, the
   degree of warrant it enjoys depends on the strength of the belief, the
   firmness with which S holds it. This is intended as an account of the
   central core of our concept of warrant; there is a penumbral area
   surrounding the central core where there are many analogical extensions
   of that central core; and beyond the penumbral area, still another belt
   of vagueness and imprecision, a host of possible cases and
   circumstances where there is really no answer to the question whether a
   given case is or isn't a case of warrant. [190] This means that the
   sort of classical analysis in which necessary and sufficient conditions
   are set out in a stylishly austere clause or two is of limited value
   here. What we need, instead, is an explanation and description of how
   the account works in the main areas of our cognitive life; that was the
   task of WPF.

   Responses to the above account of warrant have made it abundantly clear
   that it needs a certain kind of supplementation and fine tuning. [191]
   To see this, consider the following kind of Gettier example. I own a
   Chevrolet van, drive to Notre Dame on a football Saturday, and
   unthinkingly park in one of the many spaces reserved for the football
   coach. Naturally, his minions tow my van away and, as befits such
   lÃ¨se-majestÃ©, destroy it. By a splendid piece of good luck, however, I
   have won the Varsity Club's Win-a-Chevrolet-Van contest, although I
   haven't yet heard the good news. You ask me what sort of automobile I
   own; I reply, both honestly and truthfully, "A Chevrolet van." My
   belief that I own such a van is true, but just by accident' (more
   accurately, it is only by accident that I happen to form a true
   belief); hence it does not constitute knowledge. All of the
   nonenvironmental conditions for warrant, furthermore, are met. It also
   looks as if the environmental condition is met: after all, isn't the
   cognitive environment here on earth and in South Bend just the one for
   which our faculties were designed? What is important about the example
   is this: it is clear that if the coach's minions had been a bit less
   zealous and had not destroyed my van, the conditions for warrant
   outlined above would have obtained and I would have known that I owned
   a Chevrolet van. In the actual situation, however, the one in which the
   van is destroyed, my belief is produced by the very same processes
   functioning the very same way in (apparently) the same cognitive
   environment. Hence, on my account, either both of these situations are
   ones in which I know that I own a Chevrolet van, or neither is. But
   clearly one is, and the other isn't. Therefore my account is apparently
   defective. [192]

   Consider another Gettier example, this one antedating Gettier's birth
   (it was proposed by Bertrand Russell). I glance at a clock, forming the
   opinion that it is 3:43 p.m.; as luck would have it, the clock stopped
   precisely twenty-four hours ago. The belief I form is indeed true;
   again, however, it is true just by accident' (the clock could just as
   well have stopped an hour earlier or later); it does not constitute
   knowledge. As in the previous case, if the clock had been running
   properly and I had formed the same belief by the same exercise of
   cognitive powers, I would have known; here, therefore, we have another
   example that apparently refutes my account. Still another example: I am
   not aware that Paul's look-alike brother Peter is staying at his house;
   if I'm across the street, take a quick look, and form the belief that
   Paul is emerging from his house, I don't know that it's Paul, even if
   in fact it is (it could just as well have been Peter emerging); again,
   if Peter hadn't been in the neighborhood, I would have known.

   What is crucial, in each of these cases, is that my cognitive faculties
   display a certain lack of resolution. I am unable, by a quick glance,
   to distinguish the state of affairs in which the clock is running
   properly and telling the right time from a state of affairs in which it
   stopped just twelve or twenty-four hours earlier. I cannot distinguish
   Paul from Peter just by a quick look from across the street. Of course,
   this lack of resolution is in each case relative to the particular
   exercise of cognitive powers in question. If I had watched the clock
   for ten minutes, say, I would have known that it isn't running, and if
   I had walked across the street and taken a good look, I'd have known
   that it wasn't Paul but Peter at the door.

   What I can't distinguish by those exercises of my epistemic powers are
   different cognitive minienvironments. In "Respondeo," there is a fuller
   development of the distinction between cognitive maxienvironments and
   cognitive minienvironments; here the following will suffice. First, a
   cognitive maxienvironment is more general and more global than a
   cognitive minienvironment. Our cognitive maxienvironment here on earth
   would include such macroscopic features as the presence and properties
   of light and air, the presence of visible objects, of other objects
   detectable by cognitive systems of our kind, of some objects not so
   detectable, of the regularities of nature, of the existence and general
   nature of other people, and so on. Our cognitive faculties are designed
   (by God or evolution) to function in this maxienvironment, or one like
   it. They are not designed for a maxienvironment in which, for example,
   there is constant darkness, or where everything is in a state of
   constant random flux, or where the only food available contains a
   substance that destroys short-term memory, or where there aren't any
   distinguishable objects, or no regularities of a kind we can detect; in
   such an environment, our faculties will not fulfill their function of
   providing us with true beliefs. Now a given cognitive maxienvironment
   can contain many different minienvironments--for example, the one where
   the clock stops, but also one where it doesn't; the one where Peter is
   visiting Paul, but also one where he isn't; the one where the coach's
   minions destroy my van, but also one where they magnanimously temper
   the punishment I so richly deserve, contenting themselves with painting
   the windshield black.

   And now here's the point: some cognitive minienvironments--such as
   those of the Notre Dame van case, the clock that stopped, Peter's visit
   to Paul--are misleading for some exercises of cognitive faculties, even
   when those faculties are functioning properly and even when the
   maxienvironment is favorable. The maxienvironment is right, but the
   minienvironment isn't; in those minienvironments the cognitive
   faculties in question (more exactly, particular exercises of the
   cognitive faculties in question) can't be counted on to produce true
   beliefs. The basic idea is this: our cognitive faculties have been
   designed for a certain kind of maxienvironment. Even within that
   maxienvironment, however, they don't function perfectly (they sometimes
   produce false belief), although they do function reliably. (Perhaps
   perfectly functioning cognitive faculties would require too much brain
   size, thus interfering with the achievement of other desiderata.) In
   some minienvironments, therefore, they can't be counted on to produce a
   true belief: if they do, it is just by accident and does not constitute
   knowledge. So even if the maxienvironment is favorable and the other
   conditions of warrant are met, a belief could still be true just by
   accident', thus not constituting knowledge.

   It is clear, therefore, that S knows p, on a given occasion, only if
   S's cognitive minienvironment, on that occasion, is not
   misleading--more exactly, not misleading with respect to the particular
   exercise of cognitive powers producing the belief that p. So the
   conditions of warrant (i.e., for the degree of warrant sufficient for
   knowledge [193] ) need an addition: the maxienvironment must, indeed,
   be favorable or appropriate, but so must the cognitive minienvironment.
   What must then be added to the other conditions of warrant is the
   resolution condition:

   (RC) A belief B produced by an exercise E of cognitive powers has
   warrant sufficient for knowledge only if MBE (the minienvironment with
   respect to B and E) is favorable for E.

   What does appropriateness' or favorability', or nonmisleadingness', for
   a cognitive minienvironment, consist in: can we say anything more
   definite? Intuitively, a minienvironment is favorable, for an exercise
   of cognitive powers, if that exercise can be counted on to produce a
   true belief in that minienvironment. Perhaps this is as specific as we
   can sensibly get; in "Respondeo," however, I went on to make a
   tentative suggestion as to how we could say a bit more precisely what
   this favorability consists in. Where B is a belief, E the exercise of
   cognitive powers that produces B, and MBE a minienvironment with
   respect to B and E, say that

   (F) MBE is favorable for E if and only if, if S were to form a belief
   by way of E in MBE, S would form a true belief. [194]

   Sadly enough, though, (F) won't do the trick at all; the relevant
   counterfactual itself can be true just by accident'--that is, by
   accident from the point of view of the design plan. [195] There are
   plenty of possible cases to demonstrate this: here is one. Return to
   those impecunious Wisconsinites trying to put the best face on things
   by erecting a lot of fake barns. [196] Suppose I am driving through the
   area on an early September morning when there is a good deal of mist
   and fog. I glance to the right and see a real barn; as it happens, all
   the nearby fake barns (which outnumber the real ones) are obscured by
   the morning mist; I say to myself, "Now that is a fine barn!" The
   belief I form is true; the relevant counterfactual is also true because
   of the way the fake barns are obscured by mist; but the belief does not
   have warrant sufficient for knowledge.

   What to do? Here is another (also tentative) suggestion. Recall that
   the resolution problem arises because I can't (for example) distinguish
   Paul from Peter from across the street just by looking; this particular
   exercise of cognitive powers displays insufficient resolution for that.
   So consider a given exercise of cognitive powers E, the belief B formed
   on that occasion, and a relevant cognitive minienvironment MBE. If the
   conditions of warrant have been met, B will be probable (ordinarily
   very probable) with respect to MBE. Of course, MBE is a state of
   affairs. Among the states of affairs it includes are some that E is
   competent to detect, that are cognitively accessible to E. Thus in the
   twin case the appearance of a person, of a man, of someone across the
   road, and the like, are all detectable by E--that is, just by taking a
   look. On the other hand, it's being Paul rather than Peter who appears
   in the doorway is not thus detectable; they look just alike at this
   distance, and I know nothing entailing that Peter isn't there. So
   consider the conjunction of circumstances C contained in MBE such that
   C is detectable by E; call this conjunctive state of affairs DMBE. In
   the case in question, these circumstances will be observable, and
   observable by way of taking a look from across the road. In the typical
   case, furthermore (assuming that the general conditions of warrant are
   met), B will also be probable with respect to DMBE. And now we can say
   what it is for a minienvironment to be favorable:

   MBE is favorable just if there is no state of affairs S included in MBE
   but not in DMBE such that the objective probability of B with respect
   to the conjunction of DMBE and S falls below r,

   where r is some real number representing a reasonably high probability.
   In the twin case, for example, a state of affairs S such that B is not
   probable enough with respect to the conjunction of DMBE and S would be
   Peter's being in the house as well as Paul, and being indistinguishable
   from him from across the street. In the case of the impecunious
   Wisconsinites, it is that there are more fake barns than real barns in
   the neighborhood. Also, of course, I don't specify the requisite level
   of probability r, which in any case will display a certain contextual
   character, differing from case to case.

   This suggestion seems promising, although induction leads me to be less
   than wholly confident that it is right. It may be that in the long run
   we can't say more than that the minienvironment must be favorable. The
   overall picture, then, is as follows. Our faculties are designed for a
   certain kind of cognitive maxienvironment, one that sufficiently
   resembles the one in which we do, in fact, find ourselves. And when a
   belief is formed by properly functioning faculties in an environment of
   that sort (and the bit of the design plan that governs its production
   is successfully aimed at truth), then the belief in question has some
   degree of warrant, even if it happens to be false. But our cognitive
   faculties are not maximally effective--not only in that there is much
   we aren't capable of coming to know but also in that we are sometimes
   prone to err, even when the maxienvironment is right and the relevant
   faculties are functioning properly. Another way to put the same point:
   within a favorable cognitive maxienvironment, there can be
   minienvironments for a given exercise of our faculties, in which it is
   just by accident, dumb luck, that a true belief is formed, if one is
   indeed formed. A true belief formed in such a minienvironment doesn't
   have warrant sufficient for knowledge, even if it has some degree of
   warrant. To achieve that more exalted degree of warrant, the belief
   must be formed in a minienvironment such that the exercise of the
   cognitive powers producing it can be counted on to produce a true
   belief. Hence the resolution condition. Beliefs that meet all of the
   conditions will then constitute knowledge (provided they are accepted
   with sufficient firmness).

   I have neglected several important components of our epistemic
   establishment. First, I have said nothing here about defeaters; in
   chapter 11, I'll address this topic. Another very important topic
   ignored here [197] is that of epistemic probability. Further, knowledge
   or warrant seems to have a contextual character; the degree of warrant
   necessary for knowledge seems to depend, to some extent, on
   circumstances and context. I don't have the space to go into these
   matters here.

  III. The F&M Complaint Again

   Now we are ready to return to the F&M complaint. What we see is a clear
   if surprising connection between the topic of warrrant and the F&M
   complaint: the latter is really the claim that theistic belief lacks
   warrant. According to Freud, theistic belief is produced by cognitive
   faculties that are functioning properly, but the process that produces
   it--wishful thinking--does not have the production of true belief as
   its purpose; it is aimed, instead, at something like enabling us to
   carry on in the grim and threatening world in which we find ourselves.
   Therefore, theistic belief does not meet the third condition of
   warrant; as a result, the presumption of reliability that goes with
   warranted beliefs does not apply to it. Theistic belief is no more
   respectable, epistemically speaking, than propositions selected
   entirely at random. Suppose I have a random generator of English
   declarative sentences (sentences that express propositions); it
   randomly chooses one of a stockpile of a million sentences and their
   negations, flashing its selection on a big screen. I use the machine,
   recommending the resulting proposition to you for belief. You quite
   properly demur, pointing out that there isn't the slightest reason to
   think the belief in question true. Theistic belief, thinks Freud, has
   no better epistemic credentials, for the believer, than the
   propositions expressed by those sentences would have for someone for
   whom they have no source of warrant in addition to their appearing on
   the screen. It is baseless superstition.

   Still further, Freud thinks, once we see that theistic and religious
   belief has its origin in wishful thinking, we will also see that it is
   very probably false. There is no good argument from this fact about its
   origin to the conclusion that it is false; nor is it that someone who
   recognizes its origin in wishful thinking will simply see that it is
   false. It is rather just that people of sense who know something about
   how the world works will take it to be probably false. They will take
   the same attitude toward theistic and Christian belief that they take
   toward the stories in Greek or Aztec or Persian mythology: we can't
   really prove that these stories are false, but their chances of being
   true are pretty slim. So the proper intellectual attitude toward these
   beliefs isn't merely agnosticism; it is that the beliefs in question
   are unwarranted and furthermore are very probably false.

   Marx's views are similar. He thinks first that theistic and religious
   belief is produced by cognitive faculties that are not functioning
   properly. Those faculties are, to the extent that they produce such
   belief, dysfunctional; the dysfunction is due to a sort of perversion
   in social structure, a sort of social malfunction. Religious belief
   therefore doesn't meet the first condition of warrant; it is therefore
   without warrant, and an intellectually healthy person will reject it.
   Further, Marx also thinks that a person whose cognitive faculties are
   functioning properly and who knows what was known by the middle of the
   nineteenth century will see that materialism is very probably true, in
   which case Christian and theistic belief is very likely false. So he
   would join Freud in the contention that Christian and theistic belief
   is without warrant, a baseless superstition, and very probably false.

   We could see the matter slightly differently. Perhaps the problem with
   religious belief, according to Marx, is not that it is produced by
   malfunctioning faculties, but rather that capitalist society
   constitutes a hostile environment for the operation of human cognitive
   faculties; then the problem would be the second condition rather than
   the first. Still another possibility: perhaps the production of
   theistic or religious belief is like a damage-control mechanism. When
   people are subjected to the nasty conditions of capitalism, they come
   to believe these tales of a God and another world as a means of coping
   with their otherwise intolerable situation. Then Marx's view would be
   more like Freud's, and religious belief could be seen as an illusion in
   the Freudian sense. There would remain the following difference.
   According to Freud, the inclination to form religious belief arises out
   of our nature and is therefore to be expected, no matter what the
   social structure. According to this version of Marx, however, religious
   belief is a response to the very special social circumstances of misery
   and injustice generated by capitalist society, so that there need be no
   inclination toward it among people in a society that doesn't display
   that or a similar perversion. Of course Marx actually says little about
   religion, not enough to make it possible to distinguish one of these
   possibilities as the one he had in mind.

   The F&M complaint, therefore, is that theistic belief and religious
   belief in general lack warrant. So say Freud and Marx--but are they
   right? In the next chapter, we shall turn to a model for the possession
   of warrant by Christian belief. Model in hand, we shall then evaluate
   the F&M complaint.

Warranted Belief in God

   To know in a general and confused way that God exists is implanted in
   us by nature. . . .

   Thomas Aquinas

   for since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his
   eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being
   understood from what has been made. . . .

   St. Paul

   The de jure challenge to Christian (or theistic) belief, as we have
   seen, is the claim that such belief is irrational or unreasonable or
   unjustified or in some other way properly subject to invidious
   epistemic criticism; it contrasts with the de facto challenge,
   according to which the belief in question is false. Put just like that,
   the de jure rebuke is pretty vague and general; we can't do much by way
   of evaluating the proposed complaint without achieving a clearer and
   more specific formulation of it. As we have seen, clear and sensible
   formulation of the de jure criticism--at any rate of one that isn't
   just obviously mistaken--has proven elusive. In the last chapter,
   however, we were able to make progress by considering the F&M (Freud
   and Marx) complaint. What we saw is that this complaint is really the
   claim that Christian and other theistic belief is irrational in the
   sense that it originates in cognitive malfunction (Marx) or in
   cognitive proper function that is aimed at something other than the
   truth (Freud)--comfort, perhaps, or the ability to soldier on in this
   appalling world in which we find ourselves. To put it another way, the
   claim is that such belief doesn't originate in the proper function of
   cognitive faculties successfully aimed at producing true beliefs. To
   put it in still another way, the charge is that theistic and Christian
   belief lacks warrant.

   By way of response, in this chapter I shall first offer a model--a
   model based on a claim made jointly by Thomas Aquinas and John
   Calvin--for a way in which theistic belief could have warrant. Once we
   see how theistic belief might have warrant, we can also see the
   futility of the F&M complaint and its contemporary successors. In the
   remaining chapters of part III, I shall extend the model to cover
   specifically Christian belief. Chapter 7 will deal with sin and its
   noetic results. The extended model crucially involves the notion of
   faith. Following Aquinas and Calvin, I shall argue that faith has both
   an intellectual and an affective component: chapter 8 will therefore
   examine the way in which, as Calvin says, the great truths of the
   gospel are "revealed to our minds," and chapter 9 will examine the way
   in which, as he also says, they are "sealed upon our hearts." Then in
   chapter 10, I'll consider and reply to objections to the original and
   extended models.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. The Aquinas/Calvin Model
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Models

   I say I propose in this chapter to give a model of theistic belief's
   having warrant; but what sort of animal is a model, and what would it
   be good for? There are models of many different kinds: model airplanes,
   artists' models, models in the sense of exemplars, models of a modern
   major general. There is also the logician's sense of model in which,
   for example, any consistent first-order theory has a model in the
   natural numbers. My use of the term here is more abstract than the
   first and more concrete than the second. The rough idea is this: to
   give a model of a proposition or state of affairs S is to show how it
   could be that S is true or actual. The model itself will be another
   proposition (or state of affairs), one such that it is clear (1) that
   it is possible and (2) that if it is true, then so is the target
   proposition. From these two, of course, it follows that the target
   proposition is possible. In this chapter, I shall give a model of
   theistic belief's having warrant: the Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model. Then
   in chapters 7, 8, and 9, I will extend the A/C model to a model in
   which specific and full-blooded Christian belief has warrant.

   I claim four things for these two models. First, they are possible, and
   thus show it is possible that theistic and Christian belief have
   warrant. The sense of possibility here, however, isn't just broadly
   logical possibility--after all, such obvious falsehoods as the
   population of China is less than a thousand are possible in that
   sense--but something much stronger. I claim that these models are
   epistemically possible: they are consistent with what we know, where
   "what we know" is what all (or most) of the participants in the
   discussion agree on. [198]

   Second, and related to the first assertion, I claim that there aren't
   any cogent objections to the model--that is, to the proposition that
   the model is in fact true or actual. More exactly, there are no cogent
   objections of a philosophic or scientific kind (or indeed any other
   kind) to the model that are not also cogent objections to theism or
   Christian belief. Another way to put it: any cogent objection to the
   model's truth will also have to be a cogent objection to the truth of
   theistic or Christian belief. I shall go on to argue that if Christian
   belief is indeed true, then the model in question or one very like it
   is also true. If I am successful, therefore, the upshot will be that
   there is no viable de jure (as opposed to de facto) challenge either to
   theistic or to Christian belief. There is no sensible challenge to the
   rationality or rational justification or warrant of Christian belief
   that is not also a challenge to its truth. That is, there is no de jure
   challenge that is independent of a de facto challenge. That means that
   a particularly popular way of criticizing Christian belief--to be found
   in the evidentialist objection, in the F&M complaint, in many versions
   of the argument from evil, and in still other objections--is not
   viable. This is the sort of challenge that goes as follows: "I don't
   know whether Christian (or theistic) belief is true--how could anyone
   know a thing like that? But I do know that it is irrational, or
   rationally unacceptable or unjustified or without warrant (or in some
   other way epistemically challenged)." If my argument is right, no
   objection of this sort has any force.

   Third, I believe that the models I shall present are not only possible
   and beyond philosophical challenge but also true, or at least
   verisimilitudinous, close to the truth. Still, I don't claim to show
   that they are true. That is because the A/C model entails the truth of
   theism and the extended A/C model the truth of classical Christianity.
   To show that these models are true, therefore, would also be to show
   that theism and Christianity are true; and I don't know how to do
   something one could sensibly call showing' that either of these is
   true. I believe there are a large number (at least a couple dozen) good
   arguments for the existence of God; none, however, can really be
   thought of as a showing or demonstration. As for classical
   Christianity, there is even less prospect of demonstrating its truth.
   [199] Of course this is nothing against either their truth or their
   warrant; very little of what we believe can be demonstrated' or shown'.

   Fourth, there is a whole range of models for the warrant of Christian
   belief, all different but similar to the A/C and extended A/C models.
   (In claiming that models I present are close to the truth, what I am
   claiming is that they belong to that range.) And the fourth thing to
   say here is that if classical Christian belief is indeed true, then one
   of these models is very likely also true. Alternatively, for one who
   thinks Christian belief true, one or more of these models (or their
   disjunction) is a good way in which to conceive the warrant of
   Christian belief.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [198] Epistemic possibility is stronger than broadly logical
   possibility, but also weaker. There are propositions that are
   epistemically possible, but not possible in the broadly logical
   sense--true for all we know, but nonetheless impossible. Of course I
   can hardly be required to produce one; but I can produce a pair one or
   the other of which enjoys this distinction. Thus consider
   existentialism: the proposition that singular states of affairs and
   propositions are not necessarily existent but are ontologically
   dependent upon the objects with respect to which they are singular. For
   example, according to existentialism, no proposition singular with
   respect to Socrates--Socrates was wise, for example--could have existed
   if Socrates had not. I believe existentialism is false (see my "On
   Existentialism," Philosophical Studies [July 1983]), but I could
   scarcely claim to know that it is false, and, I believe, the same goes
   for everyone else. Existentialism is therefore epistemically possible.
   The same goes, naturally enough, for its denial. Each of these
   propositions, however, is necessarily true if true at all; hence one or
   the other is necessarily false, in the broadly logical sense, even if
   epistemically possible.

   [199] As I shall argue below, p. 271.
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Presentation of the Model

   Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin concur on the claim that there is a kind
   of natural knowledge of God (and anything on which Calvin and Aquinas
   are in accord is something to which we had better pay careful
   attention). Here I want to propose a model based on Calvin's version of
   the suggestion, not because I think Calvin should be the cynosure of
   all eyes theological, but because he presents an interesting
   development of the particular thought in question. And here, as in
   several other areas, we can usefully see Calvin's suggestion as a kind
   of meditation on and development of a theme suggested by Aquinas.
   According to the latter, "To know in a general and confused way that
   God exists is implanted in us by nature." [200] In the opening chapters
   of the Institutes of the Christian Religion, [201] Calvin concurs:
   there is a sort of natural knowledge of God. Calvin expands this theme
   into a suggestion as to the way in which beliefs about God can have
   warrant; he has a suggestion as to the nature of the faculty or
   mechanism whereby we acquire true beliefs about God. His idea here can
   also be seen as a development of what the apostle Paul says in Romans
   1:

   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
   and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth. For
   what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it
   to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature,
   namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the
   things that have been made. So they are without excuse. . . . (Romans
   1:18-20) [202]

   For our purposes, Calvin's basic claim is that there is a sort of
   instinct, a natural human tendency, a disposition, a nisus to form
   beliefs about God under a variety of conditions and in a variety of
   situations. Thus in his commentary on the above passage:

   By saying, that God has made it manifest, he means, that man was
   created to be a spectator of this formed world, and that eyes were
   given him, that he might, by looking on so beautiful a picture, be led
   up to the Author himself. [203]

   In the Institutes, he develops this thought:

   There is within the human mind, and indeed by natural instinct, an
   awareness of divinity. This we take to be beyond controversy. To
   prevent anyone from taking refuge in the pretense of ignorance, God
   himself has implanted in all men a certain understanding of his divine
   majesty. . . . Since, therefore, men one and all perceive that there is
   a God and that he is their maker, they are condemned by their own
   testimony because they have failed to honor him and to consecrate their
   lives to his will. . . there is, as the eminent pagan says, no nation
   so barbarous, no people so savage, that they have not a deep seated
   conviction that there is a God. . . . Therefore, since from the
   beginning of the world there has been no region, no city, in short, no
   household, that could do without religion, there lies in this a tacit
   confession of a sense of deity inscribed in the hearts of all.
   (Institutes I, iii, 1, p. 44) [204]

   Calvin goes on to claim that many rejections of God, or attempts to do
   without him, are really further testimonies to this natural
   inclination:

   Men of sound judgment will always be sure that a sense of divinity
   which can never be effaced is engraved upon men's minds. Indeed, the
   perversity of the impious, who though they struggle furiously are
   unable to extricate themselves from the fear of God, is abundant
   testimony that this conviction, namely that there is some God, is
   naturally inborn in all, and is fixed deep within, as it were in the
   very marrow. . . . From this we conclude that it is not a doctrine that
   must first be learned in school, but one of which each of us is master
   from his mother's womb and which nature itself permits no one to
   forget, although many strive with every nerve to this end. (I, iii, 3,
   p. 46)

   Separated from the extravagance of expression that sometimes
   characterizes Calvin, the basic idea, I think, is that there is a kind
   of faculty or a cognitive mechanism, what Calvin calls a sensus
   divinitatis or sense of divinity, which in a wide variety of
   circumstances produces in us beliefs about God. These circumstances, we
   might say, trigger the disposition to form the beliefs in question;
   they form the occasion on which those beliefs arise. Under these
   circumstances, we develop or form theistic beliefs--or, rather, these
   beliefs are formed in us; in the typical case we don't consciously
   choose to have those beliefs. Instead, we find ourselves with them,
   just as we find ourselves with perceptual and memory beliefs. (You
   don't and can't simply decide to have this belief, thereby acquiring
   it.) [205] These passages suggest that awareness of God is natural,
   widespread, and not easy to forget, ignore, or destroy. Seventy years
   of determined but unsuccessful Marxist efforts to uproot Christianity
   in the former Soviet Union tend to confirm this claim. [206]

   Second, it also sounds as if Calvin thinks knowledge of God is innate,
   such that one has it from birth, "from his mother's womb." Still,
   perhaps Calvin doesn't really mean to endorse either of these
   suggestions. The capacity for such knowledge is indeed innate, like the
   capacity for arithmetical knowledge. Still, it doesn't follow that we
   know elementary arithmetic from our mother's womb; it takes a little
   maturity. My guess is Calvin thinks the same with respect to this
   knowledge of God; what one has from one's mother's womb is not this
   knowledge of God, but a capacity for it. Whatever Calvin thinks,
   however, it's our model; and according to the model the development of
   the sensus divinitatis requires a certain maturity (although it is
   often manifested by very young children).

   The sensus divinitatis is a disposition or set of dispositions to form
   theistic beliefs in various circumstances, in response to the sorts of
   conditions or stimuli that trigger the working of this sense of
   divinity. Calvin thinks in particular of some of nature's grand
   spectacles. Like Kant, he was especially impressed, in this connection,
   by the marvelous compages of the starry heavens above:

   Even the common folk and the most untutored, who have been taught only
   by the aid of the eyes, cannot be unaware of the excellence of divine
   art, for it reveals itself in this innumerable and yet distinct and
   well-ordered variety of the heavenly host. It is, accordingly, clear
   that there is no one to whom the Lord does not abundantly show his
   wisdom. (I, v, 2, p. 53)

   You see the blazing glory of the heavens from a mountainside at 13,000
   feet; you think about those unimaginable distances; you find yourself
   filled with awe and wonder, and you form the belief that God must be
   great to have created this magnificent heavenly host. But it isn't only
   the variety of the heavenly host that catches his eye here:

   Lest anyone, then, be excluded from access to happiness, he not only
   sowed in men's minds that seed of religion of which we have spoken, but
   revealed himself and daily discloses himself in the whole workmanship
   of the universe. As a consequence, men cannot open their eyes without
   being compelled to see him. . . . But upon his individual works he has
   engraved unmistakable marks of his glory . . . wherever you cast your
   eyes, there is no spot in the universe wherein you cannot discern at
   least some sparks of his glory. (I, v, 1, p. 52) [207]

   Calvin's idea is that the workings of the sensus divinitatis is
   triggered or occasioned by a wide variety of circumstances, including
   in particular some of the glories of nature: the marvelous, impressive
   beauty of the night sky; the timeless crash and roar of the surf that
   resonates deep within us; the majestic grandeur of the mountains (the
   North Cascades, say, as viewed from Whatcom Pass); the ancient,
   brooding presence of the Australian outback; the thunder of a great
   waterfall. But it isn't only grandeur and majesty that counts; he would
   say the same for the subtle play of sunlight on a field in spring, or
   the dainty, articulate beauty of a tiny flower, or aspen leaves
   shimmering and dancing in the breeze. "There is no spot in the
   universe," he says, "wherein you cannot discern at least some sparks of
   his glory." Calvin could have added other sorts of circumstances: there
   is something like an awareness of divine disapproval upon having done
   what is wrong, or cheap, and something like a perception of divine
   forgiveness upon confession and repentance. People in grave danger
   instinctively turn to the Lord to ask for succor and support, having
   formed the belief that he can hear and help if he sees fit. (They say
   there are no atheists in foxholes.) On a beautiful spring morning (the
   birds singing, heaven and earth alight and alive with glory, the air
   fresh and cool, the treetops gleaming in the sun), a spontaneous hymn
   of thanks to the Lord--thanks for your circumstances and your very
   existence--may arise in your soul. According to the model, therefore,
   there are many circumstances, and circumstances of many kinds, that
   call forth or occasion theistic belief. Here the sensus divinitatis
   resembles other belief-producing faculties or mechanisms. If we wish to
   think in terms of the overworked functional analogy, we can think of
   the sensus divinitatis, too, as an input-output device: it takes the
   circumstances mentioned above as input and issues as output theistic
   beliefs, beliefs about God. We must note six further features of the
   model.

      1. Basicality

   According to the A/C model, this natural knowledge of God is not
   arrived at by inference or argument (for example, the famous theistic
   proofs of natural theology) but in a much more immediate way. The
   deliverances of the sensus divinitatis are not quick and sotto voce
   inferences from the circumstances that trigger its operation. It isn't
   that one beholds the night sky, notes that it is grand, and concludes
   that there must be such a person as God: an argument like that would be
   ridiculously weak. It isn't that one notes some feature of the
   Australian outback--that it is ancient and brooding, for example--and
   draws the conclusion that God exists. It is rather that, upon the
   perception of the night sky or the mountain vista or the tiny flower,
   these beliefs just arise within us. They are occasioned by the
   circumstances; they are not conclusions from them. The heavens declare
   the glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands: but not
   by way of serving as premises for an argument. Awareness of guilt may
   lead me to God; but it is not that in this awareness I have the
   material for a quick theistic argument: I am guilty, so there must be a
   God. This argument isn't nearly as silly as it looks; but when the
   operation of the sensus divinitatis is triggered by perception of my
   guilt, it doesn't work by way of an argument. I don't take my guilt as
   evidence for the existence of God, or for the proposition that he is
   displeased with me. It is rather that in that circumstance--the
   circumstance of my clearly seeing my guilt--I simply find myself with
   the belief that God is disapproving or disappointed.

   In this regard, the sensus divinitatis resembles perception, memory,
   and a priori belief. Consider the first. I look out into the backyard;
   I see that the coral tiger lilies are in bloom. I don't note that I am
   being appeared to a certain complicated way (that my experience is of a
   certain complicated character) and then make an argument from my being
   appeared to in that way to the conclusion that in fact there are coral
   tiger lilies in bloom there. (The whole history of modern philosophy up
   to Hume and Reid shows that such an argument would be thoroughly
   inconclusive.) It is rather that upon being appeared to in that way
   (and given my previous training), the belief that the coral tiger
   lilies are in bloom spontaneously arises in me. This belief will
   ordinarily be basic, in the sense that it is not accepted on the
   evidential basis of other propositions. The same goes for memory. You
   ask me what I had for breakfast; I think for a moment and then
   remember: pancakes with blueberries. I don't argue from the fact that
   it seems to me that I remember having pancakes for breakfast to the
   conclusion that I did; rather, you ask me what I had for breakfast, and
   the answer simply comes to mind. Or consider a priori belief. I don't
   infer from other things that, for example, modus ponens is a valid form
   of argument: I just see that it is so and, in fact, must be so. All of
   these, we might say, are starting points for thought. But (on the
   model) the same goes for the sense of divinity. It isn't a matter of
   making a quick and dirty inference from the grandeur of the mountains
   or the beauty of the flower or the sun on the treetops to the existence
   of God; instead, a belief about God spontaneously arises in those
   circumstances, the circumstances that trigger the operation of the
   sensus divinitatis. This belief is another of those starting points for
   thought; it too is basic in the sense that the beliefs in question are
   not accepted on the evidential basis of other beliefs. [208]

   Of course there are options here. The model could be developed in such
   a way that the role of the sensus divinitatis is to enable one to see
   the truth of the crucial premise for a quick theistic argument--such as
   the heavens can be gloriously beautiful only if God has created them.
   This proposition is a consequence of theism in any event; what the
   present suggestion would add is that it plays a crucial role in the
   genesis of theistic belief. [209] In the Summa Theologiae passage
   quoted above in footnote 3, Aquinas goes on to make a suggestion like
   this: he suggests that this natural knowledge of God is "immediate,"
   but also by way of inference:

   this is due either to the fact that it is self-evident that God exists,
   just as other principles of demonstration are--a view held by some
   people, as we said in Book One--or, what seems indeed to be true, that
   man can immediately reach some sort of knowledge of God by natural
   reason. For, when men see that things in nature run according to a
   definite order, and that ordering does not occur without an orderer,
   they perceive in most cases that there is some orderer of the things
   that we see.

   Here two things are noteworthy. First, what Aquinas says here suggests
   that this knowledge (the second variety) is by way of inference, so
   that, strictly speaking, this knowledge of God would not be basic. The
   inference, however, would be very quick, elementary, and obvious, so
   that perhaps believing by way of this kind of inference isn't easily
   distinguished from believing in the basic way.

   Second, note that this knowledge of God can indeed be very confused:

   But this knowledge admits of a mixture of many errors. Some people have
   believed that there is no other orderer of worldly things than the
   celestial bodies, and so they said that the celestial bodies are gods.
   Other people pushed it farther, to the very elements and the things
   generated from them, thinking that motion and the natural function
   which these elements have are not present in them as the effect of some
   other orderer, but that other things are ordered by them.

   Contemporary naturalists such as Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins
   [210] would presumably concur with those who think that "motion and the
   natural function which these elements have are not present in them as
   the effect of some other orderer." Aquinas would apparently include
   them among those who have a natural knowledge of God--at least if they
   also believe that there is something (if only, e.g., natural laws) that
   orders the things we see. Apparently this kind of knowledge of God,
   oddly enough, does not preclude being an atheist or a naturalist.

   Perhaps we can understand Aquinas as follows. Consider the description
   that which orders what we see. This description in fact applies to God.
   One who believes that it does indeed apply to something or other can
   therefore have de re knowledge of God; for example, she can believe of
   that which orders what we see that it has one or another
   properties--that it exists, is powerful, and indeed orders what we see.
   This would be to believe de re of God that he exists, is powerful, and
   orders what we see. But this knowledge also "admits of many errors":
   for example, the naturalist thinks that what orders what we see is, in
   fact, the ensemble of natural laws; she therefore believes de re of God
   that he is the ensemble of natural laws.

   Calvin's view of natural knowledge of God would be a bit different.
   Following Paul in Romans 1, he holds that the natural knowledge in
   question is sufficient to render human beings guilty--guilty of failing
   to worship, obey, and commit ourselves to God. Hence this knowledge
   includes that God is to be worshiped and obeyed, so that God couldn't
   be, for example, the ensemble of natural laws. (Of course there is a
   sense in which one does obey natural laws--if there are any [211] --but
   in this sense you can't fail to obey them, and wouldn't necessarily be
   guilty if you could and did.)

      2. Proper Basicality with Respect to Justification

   On the A/C model, then, theistic belief as produced by the sensus
   divinitatis is basic. It is also properly basic, and that in at least
   two senses. On the one hand, a belief can be properly basic for a
   person in the sense that it is indeed basic for him (he doesn't accept
   it on the evidential basis of other propositions) and, furthermore, he
   is justified in holding it in the basic way: he is within his epistemic
   rights, is not irresponsible, is violating no epistemic or other duties
   in holding that belief in that way. This is the sense of proper
   basicality that was foremost in "Reason and Belief in God." That sense
   was foremost there because there I was contesting the views of the
   evidentialist objectors to theistic belief. They didn't ordinarily say
   precisely what they think the problem is with believing in God in the
   basic way (without propositional evidence), but as far as I can see,
   they were claiming that belief in God taken that way is unjustified.
   Further, they apparently understood justification and lack of
   justification in deontological terms: to be unjustified is to be
   epistemically irresponsible, to flout an epistemic duty or requirement
   of some sort. As I argued above in chapter 3, however, it is really
   pretty obvious that a believer in God is or can be deontologically
   justified. You think about the matter carefully and at length,
   considering the F&M complaint and all the rest, but it still seems
   clear or obvious (perhaps even overwhelmingly so) that there is such a
   person as God: how could someone sensibly claim that you were being
   irresponsible or derelict with respect to some epistemic duty? That
   would be a hard saying indeed.

      3. Proper Basicality with Respect to Warrant

   There is another sense in which a belief can be properly or improperly
   basic: p is properly basic for S in this sense if and only if S accepts
   p in the basic way, and furthermore p has warrant for S, accepted in
   that way. Perceptual beliefs are properly basic in this sense: such
   beliefs are typically accepted in the basic way, and they often have
   warrant. (They are often produced by cognitive faculties functioning
   properly in a congenial epistemic environment according to a design
   plan successfully aimed at truth.) The same goes for memory beliefs,
   some a priori beliefs, and many other beliefs. I suppose the fact is
   most of our beliefs that have warrant, have it in this basic way; it is
   only in a smallish area of our cognitive life that the warrant a belief
   has for us derives from the fact that it is accepted on the evidential
   basis of other beliefs. Of course, sometimes beliefs are accepted in
   the basic way but do not have warrant. As we saw in chapter 4, this can
   be due to cognitive malfunction, or to a cognitive faculty's being
   impeded by such conditions as rage, lust, ambition, grief, and the
   like; it can also be because the bit of the design plan governing the
   production of the belief is aimed not at truth but at something else
   (survival, e.g.), or because something in the testimonial chain has
   gone wrong (one of your friends has lied to you), or for still other
   reasons.

   According to the A/C model I am presenting here, theistic belief
   produced by the sensus divinitatis can also be properly basic with
   respect to warrant. [212] It isn't just that the believer in God is
   within her epistemic rights in accepting theistic belief in the basic
   way. That is indeed so; more than that, however, this belief can have
   warrant for the person in question, warrant that is often sufficient
   for knowledge. The sensus divinitatis is a belief-producing faculty (or
   power, or mechanism) that under the right conditions produces belief
   that isn't evidentially based on other beliefs. On this model, our
   cognitive faculties have been designed and created by God; the design
   plan, therefore, is a design plan in the literal and paradigmatic
   sense. It is a blueprint or plan for our ways of functioning, and it
   has been developed and instituted by a conscious, intelligent agent.
   The purpose of the sensus divinitatis is to enable us to have true
   beliefs about God; when it functions properly, it ordinarily does
   produce true beliefs about God. These beliefs therefore meet the
   conditions for warrant; if the beliefs produced are strong enough, then
   they constitute knowledge. [213]

   There will be a complicated and many-sided interplay between the
   deliverances of the sensus divinitatis and the deliverances of other
   sources of belief, just as there is a complicated interplay between the
   deliverances of perception, which are accepted in the basic way, and
   other sources of belief. It is not the case, of course, that a person
   who acquires belief by way of the sensus divinitatis need have any
   well-formed ideas about the source or origin of the belief, or any idea
   that there is such a faculty as the sensus divinitatis. (Just as most
   of us don't have well-developed ideas as to the source and origin of
   our a priori beliefs.) Nor would such a person accept the belief in
   question on the basis of the following sort of argument: this belief
   seems to be a deliverance of the sensus divinitatis; the sensus
   divinitatis is a reliable belief-producing mechanism; therefore,
   probably this belief is true. Of course not; here, as in the case of
   other original sources of belief (memory, perception, a priori belief,
   etc.), the belief in question isn't typically accepted on the basis of
   any argument at all, and the belief can have warrant even if the
   believer has no second-level beliefs at all about the belief in
   question.

      4. Natural Knowledge of God

   This capacity for knowledge of God is part of our original cognitive
   equipment, part of the fundamental epistemic establishment with which
   we have been created by God. In this, it contrasts with one of the
   subjects of chapter 8, the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit. As
   we shall see there, the latter is an element in the divine response to
   human sin and the human predicament, a predicament in which we human
   beings require healing, restoration, and salvation. According to
   fundamental Christian teaching, the central divine response to our
   predicament is the incarnation and atonement: the life, sacrificial
   death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the divine son of God. By
   virtue of this divine response, we human beings can be put right with
   God and live triumphantly with him in this life and the next. Another
   part of God's response to our condition, however, is Scripture and the
   testimony of the Holy Spirit. God speaks to us in Scripture, teaching
   us his response to our fallen condition and the way in which this
   response is to be appropriated by us. By virtue of the inward
   instigation of the Holy Spirit, we see that the teachings of Scripture
   are true. This work of the Holy Spirit, therefore, is a very special
   kind of cognitive instrument or agency; it is a belief-producing
   process, all right, but one that is very much out of the ordinary. It
   is not part of our original noetic equipment (not part of our
   constitution as we came from the hand of the Maker), but instead part
   of a special divine response to our (unnatural) sinful condition.
   Later, we will look at these notions in more detail; here, the thing to
   see is the contrast between the activity of the Holy Spirit in our
   cognitive lives, on the one hand, and the sensus divinitatis on the
   other. The former is part of a special response to the fallen condition
   into which humankind has precipitated itself; the latter is part of our
   original epistemic endowment. The former is a special divine response
   to sin; presumably it would not have taken place had there been no sin.
   The latter would no doubt have been part of our epistemic establishment
   even if humanity had not fallen into sin.

      5. Perceptual or Experiential Knowledge?

   Suppose something like the A/C model is in fact correct: knowledge of
   God ordinarily comes not through inference from other things one
   believes, but from a sensus divinitatis, as characterized above. Would
   it follow that our knowledge of God comes by way of perception? That
   is, would it follow that the warrant enjoyed by theistic belief is
   perceptual warrant? Not necessarily. This is not because there is any
   real question about the possibility or, indeed, the actuality of
   perception of God. I believe William Alston has shown that if there is
   such a person as God, there could certainly be perception of him, and
   indeed is perception of him. Alston's powerful discussion shows that
   the usual objections to perception of God (no independent way of
   checking, disagreement as to what God is like, differences from sense
   perception, apparent relativity to the theological beliefs of the
   alleged perceiver, and so on) have very little to be said for them.
   [214]

   Of course it isn't wholly clear just what perception is (there is as
   much dispute about that as about any other philosophical topic);
   conceivably, the way to think of perception strictly so-called is such
   that it essentially involves specifically sensuous imagery. This
   imagery need not be of the sort that goes with our sense perception;
   other kinds are certainly possible. (Perhaps sensuous imagery goes with
   the bat's echolocation, a kind of imagery wholly foreign to us.) But
   sensuous imagery of some kind may be necessary for perception, and
   perhaps it is also required that this imagery plays a certain specific
   (and hard to specify) causal role in the genesis of the candidates for
   perceptual belief in question.

   What Alston thinks of as putative perception of God, however, often
   appears not to involve sensuous imagery. [215] If so, then, strictly
   speaking, there wouldn't be perception of God; what Alston's discussion
   would then show is that (given the existence of God) there could
   certainly be and probably is something very like perception of God
   (something that is epistemically on all fours with perception in that
   it, like the latter, can be a source of warrant). This something,
   therefore, can properly be called perception' in an analogically
   extended sense of that term. To the believer, the presence of God is
   often palpable. A surprising number of people report that at one time
   or another, they feel the presence of God, or at any rate it seems to
   them that they feel the presence of God--where the feeling' also
   doesn't seem to go by way of sensuous imagery. Many others (by no means
   for the most part spiritual heroes or even serious believers) report
   hearing God speak to them. And among these cases, cases where it seems
   right or nearly right to speak of perceiving God (feeling his presence,
   perhaps hearing his voice), there is great variation. There are the
   shattering, overwhelming sorts of experiences had by Paul (then Saul')
   on the road to Damascus and reported by mystics and other masters of
   the interior life. In these cases there may be vivid sensuous imagery
   of more than one kind. Still, there is also a sort of awareness of God
   where it seems right to say one feels his presence, but where there is
   little or none of the sort of sensuous imagery that typically goes with
   perception; it is more like a nonsensuous impression of a brooding
   presence. And (apparently) there are all sorts of examples between
   these two extremes.

   So I have no doubt that perception of God or something very much like
   it does occur, and occur rather widely. But would beliefs gained by way
   of the sensus divinitatis of the A/C model be perceptual belief--that
   is, would the knowledge of God afforded (in the A/C model) by the
   sensus divinitatis be by way of perception? I'm inclined to think not.
   There are different accounts of what is essential to perception;
   Alston's, I think, is as good as any. As he puts it,

   what I take to be definitive of perceptual consciousness is that
   something (or so it seems to the subject) presents itself to the
   subject's awareness as so-and-so--as red, round, loving, or whatever.
   When I stand before my desk with my eyes closed and then open them, the
   most striking difference in my consciousness is that items that I was
   previously merely thinking about or remembering, if conscious of them
   in any way, are now present to me. (PG, p. 36)

   Of course it isn't easy to say, in every sort of case, when the object
   seems to present itself to the subject; let's suppose we have something
   of a grasp of this notion and can tell within reasonable limits when it
   applies. Then I think it is clear that in some of the experiences that
   are, on the model, operations of the sensus divinitatis, there is a
   sense of God's actually being presented to, present to, one's
   awareness, but in others not. In the sorts of cases Calvin speaks of
   (the night sky, the mountains, the ocean), it is sometimes as if one
   feels, perceives the very presence of God. This would be what Alston
   calls (p. 21) indirect perception of God--the perception of God
   mediated by the perception of something else (the night sky, the
   mountains). In other cases of this sort, however, God doesn't seem
   exactly present, or presented, even though various beliefs about
   him--that he is powerful, glorious, to be worshiped, obeyed,
   thanked--arise. And in some of the other sorts of manifestations of the
   sensus divinitatis--situations of guilt, danger, gratitude--the sense
   that God is actually present to one, as Alston is thinking of it, seems
   rarer. So according to the model, the operation of the sensus
   divinitatis doesn't necessarily involve perception of God.

   Well, even if this sort of knowledge of God isn't perceptual, can we at
   any rate say that it is by way of religious experience? Can we say that
   the warrant it gets comes from experience? The first thing to see is
   that this term religious experience' is construed in a thousand
   different ways to cover a vast and confusing variety of cases; the
   question as it stands is multiply ambiguous and, in fact, we are
   probably better off boycotting the term. [216] Still, perhaps we can
   say at least the following: the operation of the sensus divinitatis
   will always involve the presence of experience of some kind or other,
   even if sensuous imagery isn't always present. Sometimes there is
   sensuous imagery; sometimes there is something like feeling the
   presence of God, where there seems to be no sensuous imagery present,
   but perhaps something (necessarily hard to describe) like it; often
   there is also the sort of experience that goes with being frightened,
   feeling grateful, delighted, foolish, angry, pleased, and the like. A
   common component is a sort of awe, a sense of the numinous; [217] a
   sense of being in the presence of a being of overwhelming majesty and
   greatness. None of these is inevitably connected with the operation of
   the sensus divinitatis, although perhaps no occasion of its operation
   fails to display one or another of these varieties of experience. But
   there is another sort of experience that is always present in the
   operation of the sensus divinitatis. Recall the distinction made a
   couple of chapters back between sensuous imagery and what I called
   above doxastic experience, the sort of experience one has when
   entertaining any proposition one believes. Entertaining, for instance,
   the proposition that 3 + 2 = 5 or that Mount Everest is higher than
   Mount Blanc feels different from entertaining one you think is clearly
   false--3 + 2 = 6, for example, or Mount Blanc is higher than Mount
   Everest. The first two feel natural, right, acceptable; the second two
   feel objectionable, wrong, eminently rejectable. [218] As I say, this
   experience is always connected with operations of the sensus
   divinitatis, because always connected with the formation or sustenance
   of any belief.

   So all of these varieties of experience can be found in the operation
   of the sensus divinitatis; doxastic experience accompanies any beliefs
   formed by its operation, as it does the formation of any other belief.
   So back to our question: shall we therefore say that knowledge by way
   of the sensus divinitatis comes by way of religious experience, that it
   is experiential knowledge? Shall we say that (on the model) the warrant
   it has comes from experience? I don't propose to answer the question.
   An answer would involve a long and essentially irrelevant effort to
   answer another question: "What does it mean to say that the warrant of
   a belief comes from (or comes by way of) experience, religious or
   otherwise?" This is an interesting question, and a tough question
   (doxastic experience always accompanies the formation of a priori
   belief, and scraps of sensuous imagery typically accompany it; does the
   warrant of a priori belief therefore come from experience?). But we
   don't need an answer to that question for our purposes. We can be
   satisfied with an account of how (on the model) the sensus divinitatis
   does in fact work; given that account, the answer to the question
   whether this is by way of experience is unimportant and optional.

      6. Sin and Natural Knowledge of God

   Finally, according to the A/C model this natural knowledge of God has
   been compromised, weakened, reduced, smothered, overlaid, or impeded by
   sin and its consequences. In the next chapter, we shall explore the
   noetic effects of sin in more detail, and in chapter 8 we shall see
   that (on the model) the sensus divinitatis is restored to proper
   function by regeneration and the operation of the Holy Spirit. For now,
   we note only that the knowledge of God provided by the sensus
   divinitatis, prior to faith and regeneration, is both narrowed in scope
   and partially suppressed. Due to one cause or another, the faculty
   itself may be diseased and thus partly or wholly disabled. There is
   such a thing as cognitive disease; there is blindness, deafness,
   inability to tell right from wrong, insanity; and there are analogues
   of these conditions with respect to the operation of the sensus
   divinitatis. According to Marx and Marxists, of course, it is belief in
   God that is a result of cognitive disease, of dysfunction. In an
   etymological sense, Marx thinks, the believer is insane. A milder, more
   conciliatory way to put it is that the believer, from those
   perspectives, is irrational; rational faculties fail to work as they
   should. But here the A/C model stands Freud and Marx on their heads
   (more accurately, what we see here is part of F&M's extensive borrowing
   from Christian and Jewish ways of thinking); according to the model, it
   is really the unbeliever who displays epistemic malfunction; failing to
   believe in God is a result of some kind of dysfunction of the sensus
   divinitatis.

   And here we should note that the notion of warrant can be usefully
   generalized. So far, we have thought of warrant as a property or
   characteristic of beliefs; the basic idea is that a belief enjoys
   warrant when it is formed by properly functioning cognitive faculties
   in a congenial epistemic environment according to a design plan
   successfully aimed at truth--which includes, we should note, the
   avoidance of error. But withholdings, failures to believe, can also be
   dictated by a design plan successfully aimed at truth and the avoidance
   of error. You have conflicting evidence for the proposition that there
   is intelligent life in other parts of the universe: some of those you
   trust say yes, some say no, and some say there is little evidence
   either way. You therefore withhold that belief, believing neither that
   there is nor that there isn't life elsewhere in the universe. Your
   friends with the rocky marriage tell you conflicting stories about the
   latest quarrel: by virtue of past experience in similar situations you
   have learned to believe neither story without further corroboration.
   Your young son asks you how high the highest mountain in Antarctica is;
   you have a dim impression of having heard that it is in the
   neighborhood of 16,000 feet, but don't really know; you form no belief
   on the subject. In all of these cases, withholding is what the design
   plan dictates. Thus withholding displays a sort of analogue of warrant:
   it too can in certain circumstances be dictated by the proper function
   of cognitive faculties operating in a congenial epistemic environment
   according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth and the
   avoidance of error.

   By contrast, if you call and ask what I am doing at the moment and I
   don't form the belief that I am sitting at my computer trying to work
   on my book, there is something wrong somewhere in my noetic
   establishment. I am introduced to someone at a party; although I have
   no reason to do so, I withhold the belief that what I see before me is
   a person, motivated by nothing more than the broadly logical
   possibility that what I see is really an extraordinarily clever
   hologram with sound effects attached. I read Bertrand Russell and see
   that it is possible (in the broadly logical sense) and compatible with
   appearances that the world popped into existence just five minutes ago,
   complete with all those apparent memories, crumbling mountains, and
   dusty books; as a result, I withhold the belief that I am more than
   five minutes old. In these cases, my failure to believe is a sign, not
   of exemplary epistemic caution, but of cognitive malfunction; these
   withholdings lack the analogue of warrant. Of course I might, in a
   frenzy due to philosophical error, come to the conclusion that in some
   way I ought not to believe in other people; I might come to the
   conclusion that such belief is unjustified, somehow; and I might try
   not to believe in other people. I might even succeed for brief periods
   in my study. But it is exceedingly hard to maintain this attitude, as
   is demonstrated by the famous lady who dropped Bertrand Russell a
   postcard on which she wrote something like "I agree entirely with you
   that solipsism is the correct and most reasonable position: so why
   aren't there more of us solipsists?" As Hume notoriously noted, it is
   exceedingly hard to maintain this attitude for long, or outside your
   study. The fact is that someone who consistently believes that she is
   the only person in the universe is suffering from a serious mental
   disorder, and the same is true for the person who is merely agnostic
   about the existence of other persons.

   We could put the same point by saying that some withholdings are
   rational and some irrational. An important sense of the term rational'
   [219] is one in which a belief is rational if it is produced by
   cognitive faculties functioning properly. But the same can be said for
   withholdings: they can be produced by cognitive faculties functioning
   properly, as in the first three examples above, but also by cognitive
   faculties functioning improperly, as in the next three examples.
   According to the model, the same thing can happen with respect to
   belief in God. Failure to believe can be due to a sort of blindness or
   deafness, to improper function of the sensus divinitatis. On the
   present model, such failure to believe is irrational, and such
   withholdings lack the analogue of warrant. It doesn't follow that
   failure to believe is unjustified--if it is due solely to cognitive
   malfunction, then there is no dereliction of epistemic duty--but it is
   nonetheless irrational. Contrary to a sort of ethos induced by
   classical foundationalism, it is not the case that the way to
   demonstrate rationality is to believe as little as possible;
   withholding, failure to believe, agnosticism, is not always, from the
   point of view of rationality, the safest and best path. In some
   contexts it is instead a sign of serious irrationality.

   According to the present model, then, the sensus divinitatis has been
   damaged and corrupted by sin. Further, according to the extended model
   I mean to propose in chapter 8, the sensus divinitatis is partly healed
   and restored to proper function by faith and the concomitant work of
   the Holy Spirit in one's heart. So the model as so far outlined is
   incomplete; the rest will come in chapters 8 and 9. Even if incomplete,
   however, the model as so far outlined will suffice for present
   purposes. For it shows us a sufficiently detailed way in which a
   properly functioning sensus divinitatis can produce theistic belief
   which is (1) taken in the basic way and (2), so taken, can indeed have
   warrant, and warrant sufficient for knowledge.

   God, which is in almost all men . . ." (Bk. III, ch. 38).

   [202] As Etienne Gilson says, very many medieval and later thinkers
   have found in this passage a charter for natural theology, construed as
   the effort to present proofs or arguments for the existence of God. But
   is Paul really talking here about proofs or arguments? Natural
   theology, as Aquinas says, is pretty difficult for most of us; most of
   us have neither the leisure, ability, inclination, nor education to
   follow those theistic proofs. But here Paul seems to be speaking of all
   of us human beings; what can be known about God is plain, he says. It
   is true that this knowledge comes by way of what God has made, but it
   doesn't follow that it comes by way of argument, the arguments of
   natural theology, for example. See below, p. 175.

   [203] Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans,
   volume XIX of Calvin's Commentaries (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House,
   1979; originally printed for the Calvin Translation Society of
   Edinburgh, Scotland), p. 70.

   [204] The "eminent pagan" is Cicero. John Beversluis suggests that
   these passages from the Institutes are really directed to human
   knowledge before the fall, and that, according to Calvin, "fallen human
   beings lack both the direct and immediate knowledge of God with which
   they were originally created and the capacity to achieve it. In
   Plantinga's language, the innate tendency, or nisus, or disposition' to
   believe in God with which human beings were originally created is no
   longer operative in fallen humanity" ("Reforming the Reformed Objection
   to Natural Theology," Faith and Philosophy 12, no. 2 (April 1995), p.
   193; see also p. 197). Of course Calvin interpretation is not my
   project here; still, Calvin is pretty clearly teaching that all people,
   fallen as well as unfallen, have this knowledge ("naturally inborn in
   all"; "each of us is master from his mother's womb"). Furthermore, as
   Beversluis points out, according to Calvin (following Romans 1) this
   knowledge renders those who have "failed to honor him" condemned by
   their own words (guilty); but of course that isn't possible unless the
   sensus divinitatis is working in them, even if it is not in its
   pristine state. There is an additional subtlety here: Beversluis speaks
   of a tendency "to believe in God." There is obviously an important
   difference between believing in God and believing that God exists (that
   there is such a person as God); chapter 9 is devoted in part to that
   difference. Perhaps in unfallen humanity, according to Calvin, the
   sensus divinitatis is a disposition to believe in God (to love him,
   trust him, see his beauty and glory and loveliness), but in fallen
   humanity only a tendency to believe that there is such a person, just
   as (according to the book of James) the devils do. See chapter 7 on the
   noetic effects of sin.

   [205] See my "Reason and Belief in God," in Faith and Rationality, ed.
   Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (Notre Dame: University of
   Notre Dame Press, 1983), pp. 34ff.

   [206] It is no part of the model, however, to hold that the sensus
   divinitatis is never subject to malfunction; perhaps it is sometimes
   diseased or even inoperative. It can also be impeded in the usual ways,
   and its deliverances can perhaps sometimes be extinguished by the wrong
   kind of nurture.

   [207] Compare Charles Sanders Peirce: A man looks upon nature, sees its
   sublimity and beauty, and his spirit gradually rises to the idea of
   God. He does not see the Divinity, nor does nature prove to him the
   existence of that Being, but it does excite his mind and imagination
   until the idea becomes rooted in his heart. Quoted by Edward T. Oakes,
   "Discovering the American Aristotle," First Things (December 1993), p.
   27.

   [208] It is worth noting that even if I believe something in the basic
   way, it doesn't follow that I wouldn't cite various other propositions
   in response to your question, "Why do you believe p? What is your
   reason for believing p?" See "Reason and Belief in God," p. 51.

   [209] For suggestions as to how the model could be developed in this
   direction, see Michael Sudduth, "Prospects for Mediate' Natural
   Theology in John Calvin," Religious Studies 31, no. 1 (March 1995), p.
   53.

   [210] See the former's Darwin's Dangerous Idea (New York: Simon and
   Schuster, 1995) and the latter's The Blind Watchmaker (New York: W. W.

   [211] For arguments casting doubt on the existence of natural laws, see
   Bas van Fraassen's Laws and Symmetry (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989),
   pp. 17ff.

   [212] And since a belief has warrant only if it is produced by properly
   functioning processes or faculties, a belief properly basic with
   respect to warrant is also properly basic with respect to rationality
   (that is, rationality as proper function; see above, p. 110).

   [213] Of course it doesn't follow that theistic belief can't get
   warrant by way of argument from other beliefs; nor does it follow that
   natural theology and more informal theistic argument is of no worth in
   the believer's intellectual and spiritual life. Note further that,
   according to the model, sin damages the sensus divinitatis and
   compromises its operation; see below, p. 184 and chapter 7.

  II. Is Belief in God Warrant-Basic?
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. If False, Probably Not

   As we saw above, Freud doesn't really argue that theistic belief has no
   warrant if taken in the basic way: he seems to assume that such belief
   is false, and then infers in rather quick and casual fashion that it is
   produced by wish-fulfillment and hence doesn't have warrant. Here
   (despite the appearance of carelessness) perhaps Freud's instincts are
   right: I shall argue that if theistic belief is false, but taken in the
   basic way, [220] then it probably has no warrant. First, as we saw
   above, no false belief has warrant sufficient for knowledge; therefore,
   if theistic belief is false, it doesn't have that degree of warrant.
   Still, couldn't it nonetheless have some warrant? There are at least
   two reasons for thinking not. First, when does a false belief have
   warrant? Typically, in a case where the faculty that produces the
   belief is working at the limit of its capability. You see a mountain
   goat on a distant crag and mistakenly think you see that it has horns;
   as a matter of fact, it is just too far away for you to see clearly
   that it doesn't have horns. You are a particle physicist and mistakenly
   believe that a certain subatomic model is close to the truth: working
   as you are at the outer limits of the cognitive domain for which our
   faculties are designed, your belief is false but not without warrant.
   If there is no such person as God, of course, then there is no such
   thing as a sensus divinitatis; and what truth-aimed faculty would be
   such that it is working at the limit of its ability in producing the
   belief that there is such a person as God, if that latter belief is
   false? It is exceedingly hard to think of decent candidates. Further,
   if your faculties are functioning properly and are unimpeded by desire
   for fame, ambition, lust, and the like, then if they are working at the
   limit of their capability, you will not ordinarily believe the
   proposition in question with great firmness--you will not believe it
   with anything like the degree of firmness often displayed by theistic
   belief. Thus you won't be sure that you see horns on that goat: you
   will instead think to yourself, "Well, it looks as if it has horns, but
   it's too far away to be sure." You won't insist that your physical
   model is correct; if you believe it is, it will be with a certain
   tentativeness. These considerations suggest that if theistic belief is
   false, it is not produced by cognitive processes successfully aimed at
   the truth, and hence does not have warrant.

   There is another and more important consideration, which we can
   approach indirectly as follows. A belief has warrant only if the
   cognitive process that produces it is successfully aimed at the
   truth--that is, only if there is a high objective probability that a
   belief produced by this process is true (given that the process is
   functioning properly in the sort of epistemic environment for which it
   is designed). Now from the fact that a belief is false, it doesn't
   follow that it is not produced by a process or faculty successfully
   aimed at truth. It could be that on a given occasion a process issues a
   false belief, even though there is a substantial objective probability
   that any belief it produces will be true (given the satisfaction of the
   other conditions of warrant). For example, a reliable barometer may
   give a false reading because of an unusual and improbable confluence of
   circumstances. Physicists tell us that it is possible (though extremely
   unlikely) that, for just a moment, all the air molecules in the room
   should congregate in the upper northwest corner of the room. Suppose
   this happens; at that moment, the air pressure in the vicinity of the
   barometer in the lower southeast corner of the room is zero; the
   barometer, however, still registers 29.72, because there hasn't been a
   long enough time for it to react to the change. The fact that it issues
   a false reading under these circumstances doesn't mean it is not a
   reliable instrument. Similarly for a cognitive process: there might in
   fact be a high probability that a belief it produces is true, despite
   the fact that on a given occasion (even though the other conditions of
   warrant are satisfied) it issues a false belief. Couldn't something
   similar hold for the processes that produce belief in God? Might it not
   be that belief in God is produced by cognitive processes successfully
   aimed at the truth, even if that belief is, as a matter of fact, false?

   I think not. A proposition is objectively probable, with respect to
   some condition C, only if that proposition is true in most of the
   nearby possible worlds that display C. [221] But now consider the
   process that produces theistic belief: if it is successfully aimed at
   truth, then in most of the nearby possible worlds it produces a true
   belief. Assuming that in those nearby possible worlds it produces the
   same belief as it does in fact (i.e., belief in God) it follows that in
   most of the nearby possible worlds that belief is in fact true: in most
   of the nearby possible worlds there is such a person as God. However,
   that can't be, if the fact is there is no such person as God. For if in
   fact (in the actual world) there is no such person as God, then a world
   in which there is such a person--an omniscient, omnipotent, wholly good
   person who has created the world--would be enormously, unimaginably
   different from the actual world, and enormously dissimilar from it. So
   if there is no such person as God, it is probably not the case that the
   process that produces theistic belief produces a true belief in most of
   the nearby possible worlds. Therefore, it is unlikely that belief in
   God is produced by a process that is functioning properly in a
   congenial epistemic environment according to a design plan successfully
   aimed at the production of true belief. So if theistic belief is false,
   it probably has no warrant. Freud is right: if theistic belief is
   false, then it is at the least very likely that it has little or no
   warrant.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [220] And, let's add, not taken on testimony. That is because
   testimony, like inference, is not an ultimate source of warrant; a
   belief taken on testimony has warrant for someone only if that belief
   has warrant for the testifier. See WPF, p. 83.

   [221] For an account of the connection between possible worlds and
   objective probability, see WPF, p. 162.
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. If True, Probably So

   On the other hand, if theistic belief is true, then it seems likely
   that it does have warrant. If it is true, then there is, indeed, such a
   person as God, a person who has created us in his image (so that we
   resemble him, among other things, in having the capacity for
   knowledge), who loves us, who desires that we know and love him, and
   who is such that it is our end and good to know and love him. But if
   these things are so, then he would of course intend that we be able to
   be aware of his presence and to know something about him. And if that
   is so, the natural thing to think is that he created us in such a way
   that we would come to hold such true beliefs as that there is such a
   person as God, that he is our creator, that we owe him obedience and
   worship, that he is worthy of worship, that he loves us, and so on. And
   if that is so, then the natural thing to think is that the cognitive
   processes that do produce belief in God are aimed by their designer at
   producing that belief. But then the belief in question will be produced
   by cognitive faculties functioning properly according to a design plan
   successfully aimed at truth: it will therefore have warrant. Again,
   this isn't certain; the argument is not deductively valid. It is
   abstractly possible, I suppose, that God has created us with a certain
   faculty f for knowing him; for one reason or another, f always
   malfunctions, and some other faculty f' created to produce some other
   beliefs, often malfunctions in such a way that it produces belief in
   God. Then our belief in God wouldn't have warrant, despite the fact
   that it is true. (This would be something like a sort of complex and
   peculiar theological Gettier problem.) And the abstract character of
   this possibility is perhaps strengthened when we think of the fact that
   human beings, according to Christian belief, have fallen into sin,
   which has noetic effects as well as effects of other sorts.
   Nevertheless, the more probable thing, at least so far as I can see, is
   that if in fact theism is true, then theistic belief has warrant.

   Suppose we try to take a deeper look. How could we make sense of the
   idea that theism is true but belief in God doesn't have warrant?

   We'd have to suppose (1) that there is such a person as God, who has
   created us in his image and has created us in such a way that our chief
   end and good is knowledge of him, and (2) that belief in God (i.e., our
   belief in God, human belief in God) has no warrant: is not produced by
   cognitive processes successfully aimed at giving us true beliefs about
   God, functioning properly in a congenial epistemic environment. That
   is, we'd have to think that belief in God is produced by cognitive
   processes that either (1) are not functioning properly (because of
   disease or impedance), (2) are not aimed at producing true beliefs
   about God, or (3) are so aimed but not successfully aimed, or (4) the
   cognitive environment is uncongenial, not one for which our faculties
   are designed. With respect to (4), however, we are supposing God has
   created us; there seems no reason at all to think our epistemic
   environment is not the one for which he created us. (We have no reason,
   for example, to think that our ancestors originated on some other
   planet and made a long, hazardous journey to Earth.) With respect to
   (3), because, by hypothesis, theistic belief is true, it seems that if
   the cognitive process that produces it is aimed at the truth, it is
   successfully aimed at the truth. That leaves us with (1) and (2). Given
   that God would certainly want us to be able to know him, the chances
   are excellent that he would create us with faculties enabling us to do
   just that. So the natural thing to think is that those faculties that
   produce theistic belief were indeed designed to produce that sort of
   belief and are functioning properly in so doing. Of course it is
   possible, in the broadly logical sense, that the faculties designed to
   produce theistic belief don't work for one reason or another, and some
   other faculties not aimed at producing theistic belief malfunction,
   thus producing it. The same, I suppose, is abstractly possible with
   respect to perception: the original faculties whereby we knew our
   environment began to malfunction, and by some serendipitous
   happenstance, other faculties began to malfunction in just such a way
   as to produce our perceptual beliefs. Possible, but not likely. This is
   an abstract possibility, but not much more. And suppose, improbably,
   that something like this did happen with the original sensus
   divinitatis: it stopped working (perhaps as a result of sin), and some
   other faculty began to malfunction and leapt into the breach, by
   serendipitous happenstance producing the very sorts of beliefs the
   original sensus divinitatis did: then it would seem likely that God has
   adopted this other way of working as our design plan, so that theistic
   belief does indeed have warrant, but via a sort of circuitous route.
   The conclusion to draw, I think, is that the epistemic probability of
   theistic belief's being warranted, given that theism is true, is very
   high. [222]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [222] Here we must also suppose, in accord with the conclusion of part
   IV of this book, that it is not the case that those who believe in God
   for the most part have defeaters for that belief.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  III. The de Jure Question is not Independent of the de Facto Question

   And here we see the ontological or metaphysical or ultimately religious
   roots of the question as to the rationality or warrant or lack thereof
   for belief in God. What you properly take to be rational, at least in
   the sense of warranted, depends on what sort of metaphysical and
   religious stance you adopt. It depends on what kind of beings you think
   human beings are, what sorts of beliefs you think their noetic
   faculties will produce when they are functioning properly, and which of
   their faculties or cognitive mechanisms are aimed at the truth. Your
   view as to what sort of creature a human being is will determine or at
   any rate heavily influence your views as to whether theistic belief is
   warranted or not warranted, rational or irrational for human beings.
   And so the dispute as to whether theistic belief is rational
   (warranted) can't be settled just by attending to epistemological
   considerations; it is at bottom not merely an epistemological dispute,
   but an ontological or theological dispute.

   You may think humankind is created by God in the image of God--and
   created both with a natural tendency to see God's hand in the world
   about us and with a natural tendency to recognize that we have indeed
   been created and are beholden to our creator, owing him worship and
   allegiance. Then, of course, you will not think of belief in God as in
   the typical case a manifestation of any kind of intellectual defect.
   Nor will you think it is a manifestation of a belief-producing power or
   mechanism that is not aimed at the truth. It is instead a cognitive
   mechanism whereby we are put in touch with part of reality--indeed, by
   far the most important part of reality. It is in this regard like a
   deliverance of sense perception, or memory, or reason, the faculty
   responsible for a priori knowledge. On the other hand, you may think we
   human beings are the product of blind evolutionary forces; you may
   think there is no God and that we are part of a godless universe. Then
   you will be inclined to accept the sort of view according to which
   belief in God is an illusion of some sort, properly traced to wishful
   thinking or some other cognitive mechanism not aimed at the truth
   (Freud) or to a sort of disease or dysfunction on the part of the
   individual or society (Marx).

   And this dependence of the question of warrant or rationality on the
   truth or falsehood of theism leads to a very interesting conclusion. If
   the warrant enjoyed by belief in God is related in this way to the
   truth of that belief, then the question whether theistic belief has
   warrant is not, after all, independent of the question whether theistic
   belief is true. So the de jure question we have finally found is not,
   after all, really independent of the de facto question; to answer the
   former we must answer the latter. This is important: what it shows is
   that a successful atheological objection will have to be to the truth
   of theism, not to its rationality, justification, intellectual
   respectability, rational justification, or whatever. Atheologians who
   wish to attack theistic belief will have to restrict themselves to
   objections like the argument from evil, the claim that theism is
   incoherent, or the idea that in some other way there is strong evidence
   against theistic belief. They can't any longer adopt the following
   stance: "Well, I certainly don't know whether theistic belief is
   true--who could know a thing like that?--but I do know this: it is
   irrational, or unjustified, or not rationally justified, or contrary to
   reason or intellectually irresponsible or . . ." There isn't a sensible
   de jure question or criticism that is independent of the de facto
   question. There aren't any de jure criticisms that are sensible when
   conjoined with the truth of theistic belief; all of them either fail
   right from the start (as with the claim that it is unjustified to
   accept theistic belief) or else really presuppose that theism is false.
   This fact by itself invalidates an enormous amount of recent and
   contemporary atheology; for much of that atheology is devoted to de
   jure complaints that are allegedly independent of the de facto
   question. If my argument so far is right, though, there aren't any
   sensible complaints of that sort. (More modestly, none have been so far
   proposed; it is always possible, I suppose, that someone will come up
   with one.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV. The F&M Complaint Revisited

   Now that we have the A/C model before us, we can deal with the F&M
   complaint in summary fashion. As we saw in the last chapter, Marx's
   complaint about religion is that it is produced by cognitive faculties
   that are malfunctioning; this cognitive dysfunction is due to social
   dysfunction and dislocation. Besides that famous "Religion is the opium
   of the people" passage, however, Marx doesn't have a lot to say about
   religious belief--except, of course, for a number of semi-journalistic
   gibes and japes and other expressions of hostility. [223] I shall
   therefore concentrate on Freud, who holds (as we saw in the last
   chapter) not that theistic belief originates in cognitive malfunction,
   but that it is an illusion, in his technical sense. It finds its origin
   in wish-fulfillment, which, although it is a cognitive process with an
   important role to play in the total economy of our intellectual life,
   is nevertheless not aimed at the production of true beliefs. On Freud's
   view, then, theistic belief, given that it is produced by
   wish-fulfillment, does not have warrant; it fails to satisfy the
   condition of being produced by cognitive faculties whose purpose it is
   to produce true belief. He goes on to characterize religious belief as
   "neurosis," "illusion," "poison," "intoxicant," and "childishness to be
   overcome," all on one page of The Future of an Illusion. [224]

   Not to be outdone, a substantial number of subsequent psychologists,
   sociologists, and anthropologists have followed his lead. Thus Albert
   Ellis:

   Religiosity is in many respects equivalent to irrational thinking and
   emotional disturbance. . . . The elegant therapeutic solution to
   emotional problems is to be quite unreligious . . . the less religious
   they are, the more emotionally healthy they will be. [225]

   Sometimes these suggestions take rather bizarre forms, worthy, almost
   to be compared with Freud's own highly imaginative stories about the
   origin of religion and the taming of fire. [226] According to Michael
   P. Carroll, for example, praying the rosary is "a disguised
   gratification of repressed anal-erotic desires"--a substitute for
   "playing with one's feces." [227] Perhaps this isn't up to Freud's
   standard when it comes to evoking that mist-enshrouded world of our
   distant ancestors, but it does match Freud for implausibility. A rather
   common view has been that religious belief is not so much a matter of
   illusion or cognitive malfunction as of simple stupidity. This view has
   sometimes been expressed rather colorfully; thus Warren Wilson blamed
   the growth of evangelical Protestant groups in rural America on the
   fact that "among country people there are many inferior minds." He went
   on to explain that revivalism was bound to persist in these regions
   "until we can lift the administration of popular institutions that are
   governed by public opinion out of the hand of the weak brother and the
   silly sister." [228] This kind of opinion is still widely popular among
   those who propose to study religion scientifically, [229] although
   (given current sensibilities) ordinarily not expressed with quite the
   same reckless enthusiasm.

   Following Voltaire, Rousseau, and others, furthermore, people in these
   fields regularly declare that (in this modern, scientific age) the
   death of religion is at hand [230] --about as often, perhaps, as others
   predict that the return of Jesus Christ is at hand. Of course previous
   predictions of the former kind (like previous predictions of the
   latter) have failed; as a result, these forecasts of the demise of
   religion (if not of the world) now tend to be more circumspect. For
   example:

   the evolutionary future of religion is extinction. Belief in
   supernatural beings and in supernatural forces that affect nature
   without obeying nature's laws will erode and become only an interesting
   historical memory. To be sure, this event is not likely to occur in the
   next generation; the process will very likely take several hundred
   years, and there will probably always remain individuals, or even
   occasional small cult groups who respond to hallucination, trance, and
   obsession with supernaturalist interpretation. But as a cultural trait,
   belief in supernatural powers is doomed to die out, all over the world,
   as a result of the increasing adequacy and diffusion of scientific
   knowledge . . . the process is inevitable. [231]

   Is there any reason to believe these things? Is there any evidence for
   the F&M complaint? Why should anyone believe it? First, however, it is
   only fair to defend this complaint against a fairly common objection.
   The F&M style of criticizing religious (or other) belief is often
   improperly dismissed as an instance of the genetic fallacy'. The
   question, so the claim goes, is whether the theistic beliefs in
   question are true; the question is not how it is that someone comes to
   hold them or what the origin of the belief might be. Furthermore (so
   the claim continues), questions of origin are ordinarily irrelevant to
   questions of truth. ("Ordinarily"--of course we can think of silly
   exceptions. For example, we might know that Sam came to believe a
   proposition by accepting the testimony of someone who, on the subject
   of the belief in question, asserts nothing but falsehoods; in that case
   the origin of the belief is obviously relevant to its truth.)

   This criticism of the F&M complaint is mistaken. True, questions of
   origin are ordinarily not relevant to the question of the truth of a
   belief; but they can be crucially relevant to the question of the
   warrant a belief enjoys. The objector fails to note that there are de
   jure questions and criticisms as well as de facto; his objection is
   relevant only if it is the latter sort that is at issue. But the F&M
   complaint is that theistic belief is not rational and lacks warrant.
   Unlike memory beliefs, a priori beliefs, or perceptual belief, theistic
   belief does not originate in the proper function of cognitive processes
   successfully aimed at the production of true belief. And if the
   problem, according to F&M, is that such beliefs have no warrant, then
   questions of origin may be intensely relevant; on many accounts of
   warrant, including the one I defend in WPF, the genesis of a belief is
   intimately connected with the degree of warrant, if any, it enjoys.

   Furthermore, there is an indirect connection with truth. Return to the
   random generator of p. 161, above: I use the machine, proposing the
   selected proposition to you for belief. You demur, citing the origin of
   the proposed belief, whereupon I accuse you of committing the genetic
   fallacy. Surely I am wrong; the fact is you haven't committed a fallacy
   at all, and your real complaint is that you haven't the faintest reason
   to think the proposition in question true. It is the same with beliefs
   that have no warrant for anyone. We ordinarily assume that propositions
   with warrant have something going for them: it is likely, or at least
   more likely than not, that they will be true. If I have reason to think
   your belief that your name is Sam' has warrant (you're pretty likely to
   know what your name is), then I have a reason to accept this belief. If
   I know that a belief has no warrant for anyone, however, then I have no
   reason at all to think that belief true, no reason at all to rely on
   that proposition. Once I see this, I see that the proposition in
   question has no claim whatever on my belief.

   But is Freud right: does theistic belief arise from wish-fulfillment,
   thereby failing to have warrant? Is there any reason to believe this?
   Does he offer argument or evidence for this claim, or (in Mill's
   phrase) other considerations to determine the intellect? Or is it mere
   assertion? Note that if the F&M complaint is to be a successful
   criticism, if it is to show that theistic belief lacks warrant, it must
   meet two conditions. First, it must show that theistic belief really
   does arise from the mechanism of wish-fulfillment; second (as I'll
   explain below), it must show that this particular operation of that
   mechanism is not aimed at the production of true beliefs. Consider the
   first. Freud offers no more than the most perfunctory argument here,
   and one can see why: it isn't easy to see how to argue the point. How
   would one argue that it is that mechanism, wish-fulfillment, rather
   than some other, that produces religious belief? Much of religious
   belief, after all, is not something that, on the face of it, fulfills
   your wildest dreams. Thus Christianity (as well as other theistic
   religions) includes the belief that human beings have sinned, that they
   merit divine wrath and even damnation, and that they are broken,
   wretched, in need of salvation; according to the Heidelberg Catechism,
   the first thing I have to know is my sins and miseries. This isn't
   precisely a fulfillment of one's wildest dreams. A follower of Freud
   might say: "Well, at any rate theistic belief, the belief that there is
   such a person as God, arises from wish-fulfillment." But this also is
   far from clear: many people thoroughly dislike the idea of an
   omnipotent, omniscient being monitoring their every activity, privy to
   their every thought, and passing judgment on all they do or think.
   Others dislike the lack of human autonomy consequent upon there being a
   Someone by comparison with whom we are as dust and ashes, and to whom
   we owe worship and obedience.

   And in any event where is the evidence (empirical or otherwise) for the
   Freudian claim? A survey wouldn't be of much use. Hardly anyone reports
   believing in God out of wish-fulfillment; the usual reports are,
   instead, of being seized, compelled, or overwhelmed, or its just
   seeming right after considerable thought and agony, or its having
   always seemed clearly true, or its suddenly becoming obvious that it is
   really so. It certainly doesn't seem to those of us who believe in God
   that we do so out of wish-fulfillment. Of course that won't be taken as
   relevant; the beauty of Freudian explanations is that the postulated
   mechanisms all operate unconsciously, unavailable to inspection. The
   claim is that you subconsciously recognize the miserable and
   frightening condition we human beings face, subconsciously see that the
   alternatives are paralyzing despair or belief in God, and
   subconsciously opt for the latter. Even after careful introspection and
   reflection, you can't see that the proffered explanation is true: that
   fact won't be taken as even the slightest reason for doubting the
   explanation. (Just as with your indignant denial that you hate your
   father because you see him as a rival for your mother's sexual favors.
   In fact your indignation may be taken as confirmation; you are
   resisting what at some level you know or suspect is the proper
   diagnosis.) So suppose you subject yourself to a decade or so of
   psychoanalysis, but still can't see that this is the origin of your
   belief; well (so you'll be told), psychoanalysis isn't always
   successful. (In fact its cure rate, as far as scientific study can
   demonstrate, is about the same as no treatment at all.) Now things
   could be like this; and in the nature of the case maybe this sort of
   thing can't be demonstrated. Still, why should we believe it?

   As far as I can see, the only evidence Freud actually offers is the
   claim that we see a lot of young people, nowadays, who give up religion
   when their father's authority breaks down:

   Psycho-analysis has made us familiar with the intimate connection
   between the father-complex and belief in God: it has shown us that a
   personal God is, psychologically, nothing other than an exalted father,
   and it brings us evidence every day of how young people lose their
   religious beliefs as soon as their father's authority breaks down. Thus
   we recognize that the roots of the need for religion are in the
   parental complex: the almighty and just God, and kindly Nature, appear
   to us as grand sublimations of father and mother. . . . [232]

   No doubt Freud saw a good bit of that in his day (and perhaps even in
   his own case: his relationship with his father, according to E. M.
   Jones, [233] seems to have left much to be desired). But how is this
   alleged evidence supposed to confirm the thesis that theistic belief
   results from wish-fulfillment? The claim is that when the father's
   authority (Freud doesn't say whether he means specifically with respect
   to religious belief or more generally) breaks down, young people often
   lose their religious beliefs. How is that fact, supposing that it is a
   fact, supposed to be evidence for the thesis that theistic belief
   results from wish-fulfillment? That's not at all obvious. Suppose
   theistic belief did result from wish-fulfillment: then wouldn't we
   expect some kind of correlation between serious belief and a
   recognition of the pitiless, indifferent character of nature? On
   Freud's thesis, we would expect that a young person would start
   evincing belief in God perhaps fairly soon after he comes to see that
   this is in fact the way the world is. But (given the thesis) why would
   we expect someone whose father's authority had suffered a breakdown to
   give up belief in God? The fact is someone who had a warm, loving,
   respectful relation with his father would be less likely to see the
   cold and indifferent face of nature than someone whose father had lost
   authority. As far as I can see, therefore, this alleged evidence
   doesn't fit well with the main Freudian thesis about the origin of
   theistic belief and certainly doesn't serve as evidence for it. Perhaps
   it shows instead that some young people like to display their maturity
   and independence by rejecting the religious stance of their parents,
   whatever that stance might be. (Thus at present we find many cases of
   children rejecting the unbelief of their parents.) But it certainly
   doesn't tend to show that religious or theistic belief arises out of
   wish-fulfillment.

   Of course the thesis isn't stated exactly, or with enough detail to
   enable us to see just what would be evidence for it. One naturally
   thinks that there must be a deeper, more precise statement of the
   theory somewhere; sadly enough, one can't find any such thing. The
   evidence for the theory would perhaps have to be something like the way
   it fits or explains all the data, all the phenomena of religious or
   theistic belief. But before we could seriously assess its fit with the
   evidence, the theory would have to be stated much more precisely; we
   should have to be able to see what it does and doesn't predict much
   more clearly than, in fact, we can. Freudian explanations have never
   been strong along these lines. [234]

   Even if it were established that wish-fulfillment is the source of
   theistic belief, however, that wouldn't be enough to establish that the
   latter has no warrant. It must also be established that
   wish-fulfillment in this particular manifestation is not aimed at true
   belief. The cognitive design plan of human beings is subtle and
   complicated; a source of belief might be such that in general it isn't
   aimed at the formation of true belief, but in some special cases it is.
   So perhaps this is true of wish-fulfillment; in general, its purpose is
   not that of producing true belief, but in this special case precisely
   that is its purpose. Perhaps human beings have been created by God with
   a deep need to believe in his presence and goodness and love. Perhaps
   God designed us that way in order that we come to believe in him and be
   aware of his presence. Perhaps this is how God has arranged for us to
   come to know him. If so, then the particular bit of the cognitive
   design plan governing the formation of theistic belief is indeed aimed
   at true belief, even if the belief in question arises from
   wish-fulfillment. Perhaps God has designed us to know that he is
   present and loves us by way of creating us with a strong desire for
   him, a desire that leads to the belief that in fact he is there. Nor is
   this a mere speculative possibility; something like it is embraced both
   by St. Augustine ("Our hearts are restless til they rest in thee, O
   God") and Jonathan Edwards (below, p. 305ff).

   And how would Freud or a follower establish that the mechanism whereby
   human beings come to believe in God (come to believe that there is such
   a person as God) is not aimed at the truth? This is really the crux of
   the matter. Freud offers no arguments or reasons here at all. As far as
   I can see, he simply takes it for granted that there is no God and that
   theistic belief is false; he then casts about for some kind of
   explanation of this widespread phenomenon of mistaken belief. He hits
   on wish-fulfillment and apparently assumes it is obvious that this
   mechanism is not "reality oriented"--that is, is not aimed at the
   production of true belief--so that such belief lacks warrant. As we
   have seen, this is a safe assumption if in fact theism is false. But
   then Freud's version of the de jure criticism really depends on his
   atheism: it isn't an independent criticism at all, and it won't (or
   shouldn't) have any force for anyone who doesn't share that atheism.
   Given the results of parts II and III of this chapter, this is of
   course just what we should expect.

   Now a believer in God, a Christian or Jew or Muslim, is unlikely to
   acquiesce in the F&M claim that belief in God has no warrant. (It is
   only a certain variety of liberal' theologian, crazed by the thirst for
   novelty and the desire to accommodate current secularity, who might
   agree with F&M here.) Indeed, a believer will see the shoe as on the
   other foot. According to St. Paul, it is unbelief that is a result of
   dysfunction, brokenness, failure to function properly, or impedance of
   rational faculties. Unbelief, he says, is a result of sin; it
   originates in an effort, as Romans 1 puts it, to "suppress the truth in
   unrighteousness." [235] In the next chapter, we shall begin to explore
   the extended A/C model, considering some of the ways in which this
   suppression and impedance can go.

   unbeliever herself. Some kinds of unbelief (see below, p. 215) are like
   blindness; upon seeing a blind man, the disciples asked Jesus, "Rabbi,
   who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" (John
   9:2)--to which Jesus replied that this blindness was due neither to the
   man's own sin nor to that of his parents.

Sin and Its Cognitive Consequences

   The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who can
   understand it?

   Jeremiah 17:9
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Preliminaries

   According to the Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model, theistic belief (belief in
   God) has warrant, indeed, sufficient warrant for knowledge. The central
   feature of this model is the stipulation that God has created us human
   beings with a belief-producing process or source of belief, the sensus
   divinitatis; this source works under various conditions to produce
   beliefs about God, including, of course, beliefs that immediately
   entail his existence. Belief produced in this way, I said, can easily
   meet the conditions for warrant; given that it is true (and held
   sufficiently strongly), it would constitute knowledge.

   So far, therefore, we have been thinking just about belief that there
   is such a person as God. But to go no further would be to give
   legitimate grounds for complaint:

   First, the beliefs that really shape and determine Christian
   intellectual identity and existence are much more precise and specific
   than belief in God. They are constituted by profound convictions about
   the person of Christ, about the mysterious reality of the Holy Trinity,
   about the presence of the Holy Spirit in one's life. . . . It is these
   rather than some minimalist theism which really matters to the vast
   majority of religious believers. Yet until very recently these have
   received next to no attention on the part of philosophers interested in
   the rationality of religious belief. Somehow they are taken as
   secondary and peripheral. [236]

   Well, I doubt that these beliefs have been neglected because they were
   thought secondary and peripheral; there is a more plausible
   explanation. Christian philosophers have been for the most part
   responding to various kinds of attacks on the rational justifiability
   of religious belief. Those who mount such attacks typically do so by
   attacking belief in God, which is the heart and soul of Christian
   belief as well as of the other theistic religions. This is a sensible
   strategy: if the atheologian can show that this belief is relevantly
   objectionable, he won't have to deal piecemeal with all those more
   specific beliefs; he can do for them all in one fell swoop. But then
   Christian responses to these objections, naturally enough, have dealt
   with animadversions on belief in God. Still, Abraham is quite right; we
   must indeed think about specifically Christian belief and inquire into
   its justification, rationality, and warrant. That is the task of the
   next four chapters; my aim is to extend the model of chapter 6 to
   include specifically Christian belief. The extended model will bear
   some of the earmarks of Reformed theology, but similar models can be
   constructed for other theological traditions. This model, incidentally,
   will essentially involve such theological notions as faith and the work
   of the Holy Spirit. Some may find it scandalous that theological ideas
   should be taken seriously in a book on philosophy; I find it no more
   scandalous than the ingression into philosophy of scientific ideas from
   (for example) quantum mechanics, cosmology, and evolutionary biology.

   My aim is to show how it can be that Christians can be justified,
   rational (both internally and externally), and warranted in holding
   full-blooded Christian belief--not just ignorant fundamentalists', but
   sophisticated, aware, educated, turn-of-the-millennium people who have
   read their Freud and Nietzsche, their Hume and Mackie (their Dennett
   and Dawkins). Justification and internal rationality are easy enough:
   just as for theistic belief, I'll argue that many or most Christians
   not only can be but also are both justified and internally rational in
   holding their characteristic beliefs. External rationality and warrant
   are harder. The only way I can see to argue that Christian belief has
   these virtues is to argue that Christian belief is, indeed, true. I
   don't propose to offer such an argument. That is because I don't know
   of an argument for Christian belief that seems very likely to convince
   one who doesn't already accept its conclusion. That is nothing against
   Christian belief, however, and indeed I shall argue that if Christian
   beliefs are true, then the standard and most satisfactory way to hold
   them will not be as the conclusions of argument.

   What I will do instead is extend the A/C model of chapter 6 to a model
   according to which specifically Christian belief (as well as theism)
   has both warrant and external rationality, and enough of the former to
   constitute knowledge. This model will include the main lines of
   ecumenical classic Christian belief. It also needs a certain amount of
   additional detail. This additional detail is broadly Reformed or
   Calvinist in inspiration, but I shall develop it in my own way. The
   point of the extended model is like the point of the A/C model itself.
   I shall use the model to argue three things. First, I will use it to
   argue that Christian belief can very well be both externally rational
   and warranted: there is a perfectly viable epistemological account of
   how it is that they should have these virtues, and no cogent objections
   to their having it. Second, I'll argue (as in chapter 6 I did with
   respect to theistic belief) that if Christian belief is true, then it
   is probably both externally rational and warranted for most Christians.
   Thus I'll be attacking again that stance I mentioned (above, p. x): the
   claim that of course we don't know whether Christian belief is, in
   fact, true (that's a pretty tall order, after all), but we do know that
   even if it happens to be true, it isn't rational or warranted. Third,
   I'll recommend the story or model I present as a good way, though not
   necessarily the only good way, for Christians to think about the
   epistemological status of Christian belief.

   Now one important difference between bare theism and Christianity has
   to do essentially with sin and the divine remedy proposed for it; it is
   sin that occasions Incarnation and Atonement, redemption and renewal.
   The present chapter, therefore, will examine the nature of sin and its
   noetic effects. Chapters 8 and 9 will address faith, the Bible, and the
   internal instigation of the Holy Spirit; these, on the extended model,
   are together the central source of warrant for Christian belief.
   According to Calvin, whose thought I shall follow (even if at some
   distance), faith is "a firm and certain knowledge (cognitio) of God's
   benevolence towards us, founded upon the truth of the freely given
   promise in Christ, both revealed to our minds and sealed upon our
   hearts through the Holy Spirit." [237] Chapter 8 will show how
   Christian belief is revealed to our minds, thus enjoying warrant;
   chapter 9 will deal with its being sealed upon our hearts; it therefore
   addresses the question of religious affections and the will, asking,
   among other things, whether there are analogues of justification,
   rationality, and warrant for the affections; chapter 10 will examine
   actual and possible objections to the extended model.

   An initial problem: the term Christian belief', like most useful terms,
   is vague. Does Tillich count as a Christian theologian? What about
   Mormon beliefs: are they Christian? [238] What about people who think
   Jesus was a great model and moral teacher, but doubt that he was God,
   rose from the dead, or atoned for our sins: are their beliefs
   Christian? What, precisely, must a set of beliefs be in order to be
   Christian--that is, to be properly denominated by that term? [239]

   This isn't a problem for my project. First, no doubt the term
   Christian' is vague; still, as Dr. Johnson once remarked, the existence
   of twilight is not a good argument against the distinction between day
   and night. There is such a thing as Christian belief, and there is also
   such a thing as non-Christian belief, even if it is difficult to say
   where the one begins and the other ends. Second, nothing in my project
   depends on a specific use of the term Christian'. However we propose to
   use that term, my project is to inquire into the epistemological status
   of a certain set of beliefs: the ones embodied, say, in the Apostle's
   Creed and the Nicene Creed. (Alternatively, we could identify the
   beliefs in question as belonging to the intersection of those expressed
   in the creeds of more specific Christian communities [the New Catholic
   Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Augsburg Confession, the
   Westminster Catechism, and so on].) Included are the affirmations that
   God created the heavens and the earth; that he created human beings in
   his own image; that human beings fell ruinously into sin, from which
   they require salvation; that in response God graciously sent Jesus
   Christ, the divine son of God, who took on our flesh (became
   incarnate), suffered, and died as an atonement for our sins, and rose
   from the dead, thus enabling us fallen human beings to have eternal
   life with God. These beliefs are ordinarily thought of as
   paradigmatically Christian and ordinarily referred to by the term
   Christian'. Still, nothing depends on the use of that term: my project
   is that of inquiring into the epistemological status of those beliefs.

  II. Initial Statement of the Extended Model

   Now our question is whether these beliefs are justified, rational, or
   warranted. But justification and internal rationality are easily dealt
   with. First, justification taken deontologically, in terms of
   intellectual rights and obligations, is no more problematic here than
   in the case of theism. Clearly, a person (including a highly educated,
   wholly with-it, twenty-first-century person who has read all the latest
   objections to Christian belief) could be justified in accepting these
   and other Christian beliefs and would be so justified if (for example)
   after careful and nonculpable reflection and investigation into the
   alleged objections and defeaters, she still found those beliefs wholly
   compelling. She could hardly be blamed for believing what strongly
   seems, after extensive investigation, to be the truth of the matter.
   (She's supposed to believe what seems false to her?) [240] As for the
   various analogical extensions of justification in this original
   sense--being responsible, doing as well as could be expected with
   respect to your part in belief formation, and the like--again, it is
   obvious, I think, both that believers can meet these conditions and
   that many believers do meet them.

   The same goes for internal rationality, which is a matter of the proper
   function of cognitive processes downstream from experience (see above,
   p. 110. for explanation of this metaphor). These beliefs, we are
   stipulating, seem to her to be clearly true. She finds them wholly
   convincing, just as she does her beliefs about other persons, say, and
   an external world; they remain thus convincing even after she has
   considered the objections she has encountered. She has a powerful
   inclination to believe these things and hence has strong doxastic
   evidence for them. But then there need be no cognitive malfunction,
   glitch, or other infelicity in her actually believing them; therefore,
   her belief is internally rational.

   As we saw in the case of theistic belief, however, these observations
   won't or shouldn't quiet the critics. For even if Christian believers
   are justified and internally rational in their beliefs, they might
   still be externally irrational (see above, p. 112) and thus wholly
   without warrant. After all, even the beliefs of a madman or of a victim
   of a Cartesian evil demon can be both justified and internally
   rational. Well, then, what about external rationality and warrant? A
   belief is externally rational if it is produced by cognitive faculties
   that are functioning properly and successfully aimed at truth (i.e.,
   aimed at the production of true belief)--as opposed, for example, to
   being the product of wish-fulfillment or cognitive malfunction. Now
   warrant, the property enough of which distinguishes knowledge from mere
   true belief, is a property or quantity had by a belief if and only if
   (so I say) that belief is produced by cognitive faculties functioning
   properly in a congenial epistemic environment according to a design
   plan successfully aimed at truth. Because rationality (in the sense of
   proper function of rational powers) is included in warrant, the real
   question, here, is whether Christian belief does or can have warrant.

   According to the extended A/C model, Christian belief does indeed have
   warrant. In essence, the model goes like this. First, God has created
   us human beings in his own image: this centrally involves our
   resembling God in being persons--that is, beings with intellect and
   will. Like God, we are the sort of beings who have beliefs and
   understanding: we have intellect. There is also will, however: we also
   resemble God in having affections (loves and hates), in forming aims
   and intentions, and in being able to act to accomplish these aims and
   intentions. [241] Call this the broad image of God. But human beings as
   originally created also displayed a narrow image: they had extensive
   and intimate knowledge of God, and sound affections, including
   gratitude for God's goodness. [242] They loved and hated what was
   lovable and hateful; above all, they knew and loved God. Part of this
   image was the sensus divinitatis of chapter 6.

   The extended model retains this feature and adds more. First, it adds
   that we human beings have fallen into sin, a calamitous condition from
   which we require salvation--a salvation we are unable to accomplish by
   our own efforts. This sin alienates us from God and makes us unfit for
   communion with him. Our fall into sin has had cataclysmic consequences,
   both affective and cognitive. As to affective consequences, our
   affections are skewed and our hearts now harbor deep and radical evil:
   we love ourselves above all, rather than God. There were also ruinous
   cognitive consequences. Our original knowledge of God and of his
   marvelous beauty, glory, and loveliness has been severely compromised;
   in this way the narrow image of God in us was destroyed and the broad
   image damaged, distorted. [243] In particular, the sensus divinitatis
   has been damaged and deformed; because of the fall, we no longer know
   God in the same natural and un-problematic way in which we know each
   other and the world around us. Still further, sin induces in us a
   resistance to the deliverances of the sensus divinitatis, muted as they
   are by the first factor; we don't want to pay attention to its
   deliverances. We are unable by our own efforts to extricate ourselves
   from this quagmire; God himself, however, has provided a remedy for sin
   and its ruinous effects, a means of salvation from sin and restoration
   to his favor and fellowship. This remedy is made available in the life,
   atoning suffering and death, and resurrection of his divine Son, Jesus
   Christ. Salvation involves among other things rebirth and regeneration,
   a process (beginning in the present life and reaching fruition in the
   next) that involves a restoration and repair of the image of God in us.

   So far, what we have here is the mere Christianity of which C. S. Lewis
   spoke; [244] we now come to a more specifically cognitive side of the
   model. God needed a way to inform human beings of many times and places
   of the scheme of salvation he has graciously made available. No doubt
   he could have done this in a thousand different ways; in fact he chose
   to do so in the following way. First, there is Scripture, the Bible, a
   collection of writings by human authors, but specially inspired by God
   in such a way that he can be said to be its principal author. Second,
   he has sent the Holy Spirit, promised by Christ before his death and
   resurrection. [245] A principal work of the Holy Spirit with respect to
   us human beings is the production in us of the gift of faith, that
   "firm and certain knowledge of God's benevolence towards us, founded
   upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ, both revealed to
   our minds and sealed upon our hearts through the Holy Spirit" of which
   Calvin speaks (below, p. 244). By virtue of the internal instigation of
   the Holy Spirit, we come to see the truth of the central Christian
   affirmations. Now faith is not just a cognitive affair: its being
   "sealed upon our hearts" is a matter of will and affect; it is a repair
   of the madness of the will that is at the heart of sin. Still, it is at
   least a cognitive matter. In giving us faith, the Holy Spirit enables
   us to see the truth of the main lines of the Christian gospel as set
   forth in Scripture. The internal invitation of the Holy Spirit is
   therefore a source of belief, a cognitive process [246] that produces
   in us belief in the main lines of the Christian story. Still further,
   according to the model, the beliefs thus produced in us meet the
   conditions necessary and sufficient for warrant; they are produced by
   cognitive processes functioning properly (in accord with their design
   plan) in an appropriate epistemic environment (both maxi and mini)
   according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth; if they are
   held with sufficient firmness, these beliefs qualify as knowledge, just
   as Calvin's definition of faith has it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [240] It is open to someone to claim that the Christian believer enjoys
   only subjective justification, not objective justification; that is
   because (so the claim goes) the fact is there are objective epistemic
   duties such that one cannot accept Christian belief without violating
   them (above, pp. 98-99), and the believer escapes guilt only because
   she is not aware of them. (Thus ignorance is a protection from guilt.)
   Once more, however: what would those objective duties be? And is there
   even a suggestion of a reason for thinking there are any such duties?

   [241] Here I am thinking of will in such a way that it includes not
   only decision and choice (the executive function of will) but also
   loves and hates, desire and conation (the affective function of will).
   This is a bit broader than the usual contemporary understanding of the
   will, but in line with older ways of thinking about it (see, e.g.,
   Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I, q. 82, a. 1 and 2 and Summa contra
   Gentiles Bk. III, ch. 26).

   [242] Here I was helped by Derek Jeffreys.

   [243] As Calvin puts it, "The natural gifts in man were corrupted, but
   the supernatural were taken away" (II, ii, 4, p. 260). And according to
   Aquinas, "Man in the state of corrupted nature falls short even of what
   he can do by his nature, so that he is unable to fulfill all of it by
   his own natural power." We therefore need "a gratuitous strength
   superadded to natural strength" not only "to do and will supernatural
   good," but also, he says, to live up to our original nature as persons
   (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 102, a. 2, respondeo). Here we should note
   an ambiguity in such terms as "our natural condition." On the one hand,
   the term can refer to what we human beings were like in our original
   and sinless condition, fresh from the hand of God, and what we would
   still be like if it weren't for sin; on the other, the term refers to
   our fallen condition, prior to regeneration and renewal.

   [244] Mere Christianity (New York: Macmillan, 1958).

   [245] See, e.g., John 14:26: "All this have I spoken while still with
   you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
   my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I
   have said to you."

   [246] Those who raise their eyebrows at the application of this term to
   the work of the Holy Spirit are invited to note the explanation below,
   pp. 257-58.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III. The Nature of Sin

   Now that we have the extended model before us in outline, we must take
   a more detailed look into some of its various aspects, starting with
   the nature of sin and its cognitive consequences. Reformed theologians
   used to speak of the "noetic effects of sin"; although (sadly enough)
   this topic has at present dropped out of favor, it will be important
   for our model, so after an examination of the nature of sin we'll turn
   in the remaining part of the chapter to its cognitive consequences.

   What is sin? Whatever it is, it is both astonishingly deep and deeply
   elusive. According to the model, there is first the phenomenon of
   sinning: of doing what is wrong, what is contrary to God's will. This
   is something for which the sinner is responsible; he is guilty and
   warrants blame--but only if he recognizes that what he does is sin, or
   is culpable in failing to recognize that it is. There is also the
   condition of being in sin, a state in which we human beings find
   ourselves from our very birth. A traditional Christian term for this
   condition is original sin'. Unlike a sinful act I perform, original sin
   need not be thought of as something for which I am culpable (original
   sin is not necessarily original guilt); insofar as I am born in this
   predicament, my being in it is not within my control and not up to me.
   (In any event there is plenty of opportunity for culpability with
   respect to the less original variety of sin.)

   How does it happen that we human beings are mired in this desperate and
   deplorable condition? The traditional Christian answer: it is as a
   result of the sinful actions of Adam and Eve, our original parents and
   the first human beings. Whether this is indeed how it happened is a
   matter on which the model need not take a stand; what is part of the
   model is that in fact we are in the condition. G. K. Chesterton once
   remarked that of all the doctrines of Christianity, the doctrine of
   original sin has the strongest claim to "empirical verifiability," the
   quality that back in the palmy days of positivism was widely trumpeted
   as the very criterion of cognitive meaningfulness'; it has been
   verified in the wars, cruelty, and general hatefulness that have
   characterized human history from its very inception to the present.
   Indeed, no century has seen more organized hatred, contempt, and
   cruelty than ours, and none has seen it on as grand a scale. Our
   century in particular also enables us to see the social side of sin. We
   human beings are deeply communal; we learn from parents, teachers,
   peers, and others, both by imitation and by precept. We acquire beliefs
   in this way, but just as important (and perhaps less self-consciously),
   we acquire attitudes and affections, loves and hates. Because of our
   social nature, sin and its effects can be like a contagion that spreads
   from one to another, eventually corrupting [247] an entire society or
   segment of it.

   Original sin involves both intellect and will; it is both cognitive and
   affective. On the one hand, it carries with it a sort of blindness, a
   sort of imperceptiveness, dullness, stupidity. This is a cognitive
   limitation that first of all prevents its victim from proper knowledge
   of God and his beauty, glory, and love; it also prevents him from
   seeing what is worth loving and what worth hating, what should be
   sought and what eschewed. It therefore compromises both knowledge of
   fact and knowledge of value.

   But sin is also and perhaps primarily an affective disorder or
   malfunction. Our affections are skewed, directed to the wrong objects;
   we love and hate the wrong things. Instead of seeking first the kingdom
   of God, I am inclined to seek first my own personal glorification and
   aggrandizement, bending all my efforts toward making myself look good.
   Instead of loving God above all and my neighbor as myself, I am
   inclined to love myself above all and, indeed, to hate God and my
   neighbor. [248] Much of this hatred and hostility springs from pride,
   that aboriginal sin, and from consequent attempts at
   self-aggrandizement. We think of getting the world's good things as a
   zero-sum game: any bit of it you have is a bit I can't have--and want.
   I want to be better known than you, so anytime you do something
   noteworthy I feel a prick of envy. I may want to be rich. What counts
   is not how much money I have, absolutely speaking; what counts is
   whether I have more than you, or most people, or everybody else. But
   then you and others are obstacles to the fulfillment of my desires; I
   can thus come to resent and hate you. And God himself, the source of my
   very being, can also be a threat. In my prideful desire for autonomy
   and self-sufficiency I can come to resent the presence of someone upon
   whom I depend for my every breath and by comparison with whom I am
   small potatoes indeed. I can therefore come to hate him too. I want to
   be autonomous, beholden to no one. Perhaps this is the deepest root of
   the condition of sin. [249]

   The defect here is affective, not intellectual. Our affections are
   disordered; they no longer work as in God's original design plan for
   human beings. There is a failure of proper function, an affective
   disorder, a sort of madness of the will. In this condition, we know (in
   some way and to some degree) what is to be loved (what is objectively
   lovable), but we nevertheless perversely turn away from what ought to
   be loved and instead love something else. (As the popular song has it:
   "My heart has a mind of its own.") We know (at some level) what is
   right, but find ourselves drawn to what is wrong; we know that we
   should love God and our neighbor, but we nonetheless prefer not to. Of
   course this raises an ancient question, one going back to Socrates: can
   a person really do what she knows or believes is wrong? [250] If she
   sees what is right, how can she still do what is wrong? The answer is
   simple enough: she sees what is right, but prefers what is wrong.
   Socrates fails to see the possibility of affective disorder, as opposed
   to intellectual deficiency or ignorance. In the absence of affective
   disorder, perhaps, indeed, I cannot see the good but prefer the evil,
   knowing that it is evil. Unfortunately, however, we can't count on the
   absence of that disorder; sin is, in large part, precisely such
   disorder. Because of this affective malfunction, I desire and seek what
   I know or believe is bad.

   There are many traditional arguments for the idea that you can't desire
   what on balance you see to be wrong: I don't have the space to deal
   with these arguments here, except to say that I don't find them at all
   convincing. One argument I would like to mention, though, can be put as
   follows: "There a serious semantic problem here. It isn't so much as
   coherent to suggest that a person might love and value what she knows
   is hateful, or hate what she knows is good. Consider Sam, who says, I
   love and propose to promote what is in fact evil': his words fail to
   make coherent sense. Words like good', evil', right', wrong', etc. are
   used to commend and censure, express approval and disapproval; hence
   the first part of Sam's utterance expresses his approval of the very
   thing of which the second part of the utterance expresses his
   disapproval. You can sensibly say that you are given to approving what
   is evil, that you have done so often in the past and even that you
   often do so; but you can't sensibly say that right now you approve what
   is evil or hate what is good. Sam hasn't contradicted himself (he
   hasn't asserted a proposition and its denial); what he says is
   nevertheless incoherent, just as if he had said Hooray for the red,
   white and blue, and furthermore execrations upon it!'?"

   Reply: first, there are two separate questions here: (1) Is it possible
   to love what one knows is evil? and (2) Is Sam's utterance coherent?
   These are independent: one is a question about what sorts of attitudes
   are possible, and the other about what sentences make coherent sense
   (in English). Even if Sam's utterance is incoherent, it might still be
   possible to love what one knows to be evil. But second, the fact is
   Sam's utterance makes perfect sense. When Milton's Satan says, "Evil,
   be thou my good," what he says is perfectly intelligible: he means to
   say that he prefers, and proposes to promote, what he recognizes to be
   evil. We can see what is going on here as follows. It is indeed true
   that words like good', bad', and evil' perform the function of
   expressing approval or disapproval. That is only part of their
   function, however: they also express properties. (It doesn't matter for
   present purposes precisely what properties they express, but perhaps
   the property expressed by good' [bad'] is at any rate equivalent, in
   the broadly logical sense, to the property of being approved
   [disapproved] by God.) Ordinarily these two go together: one expresses
   approval of what one takes to have the property expressed by good'. The
   important point, however, is that the two functions can also be prized
   apart: either of the two components of the meaning of these terms can
   be canceled. When Satan says, "Evil, be thou my good," the aspect of
   the term evil' by which it ordinarily expresses disapproval gets
   canceled, as does the aspect of the term good' whereby it ordinarily
   expresses the property of being good. So Satan is not (of course)
   endorsing or proposing a condition in which what has the property of
   being evil shall henceforth have the property of goodness; nor is he
   expressing both disapproval and approval of the same thing. He is,
   instead, declaring, of what he knows has the property of being evil,
   that he approves of it, loves it, values it, and aims to promote it.
   His words can be used to do this just because either of the two
   components--property expression and attitude or affection
   expression--of the meaning of good', evil', and similar terms can be
   canceled.

   As both Augustine and Pascal noted, this whole complex and confusing
   congeries of attitudes, affections and beliefs that constitutes the
   state of sin is a fertile field for ambiguity and self-deception. [251]
   According to the extended model, we human beings typically have at
   least some knowledge of God, and some grasp of what is required of us;
   this is so even in the state of sin and even apart from regeneration.
   The condition of sin involves damage to the sensus divinitatis, but not
   obliteration; it remains partially functional in most of us. We
   therefore typically have some grasp of God's presence and properties
   and demands, but this knowledge is covered over, impeded, suppressed.
   We are prone to hate God but, confusingly, in some way also inclined to
   love and seek him; we are prone to hate our neighbor, to see her as a
   competitor for scarce goods, but also, paradoxically, to prize her and
   love her. Perhaps I recognize, in a sort of semisubliminal way, that
   there is deep disorder and worse in my life. I half-recognize the
   selfishness and self-centeredness that characterizes most of my waking
   moments. Perhaps I note that even (or perhaps especially) in private
   soliloquy, where there is no question of influencing others, I
   imaginatively create, rehearse, and contemplate various situations in
   which I come out victorious, or heroic, or virtuously long-suffering,
   or anyway abundantly admirable. Perhaps I also glimpse the foolishness
   and corruption here, but most of the time I pay no attention. I ignore
   it; I hide it from myself, escaping into work, projects, family, the
   whole realm of the everyday. (As Pascal says, "Right now I can't be
   bothered; I have to return my opponent's serve." [252] )

   This ambiguity extends even deeper. One can't help but concur with the
   apostle Paul: "For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil
   I do not want to do--this I keep on doing" (Romans 7:19). I often do
   what I recognize is the wrong thing, even though I don't want to do the
   wrong thing; and I don't do what's right, even though I do want to do
   what's right. It seems that I don't do what I want to do and, instead,
   do what I don't want to. Or is it instead that when I do wrong, I want
   to do that very thing, but don't then think it is wrong (though at
   other times I see perfectly well that it is, and very much wish that I
   hadn't done it)? Or is it rather that at that time I do see (to at
   least some degree) that it's wrong, or would clearly see that it is if
   I paid attention (and I also semiknow that fact then), but I don't pay
   attention, because I want to do this thing? Or is it that when I do
   something wrong, then I do want to do that wrong thing, knowing (in a
   sort of muffled way) that it is wrong, even though I don't want to want
   to do the wrong thing? Or is it that when I am wanting to do what is
   wrong, I don't even raise for myself the question whether it is wrong?
   My second-level affections can seem typically better attuned or
   calibrated than my first level: I often want to do what is wrong;
   wanting to want to do what is wrong is much less frequent. I want to
   love and hate the right things--that is, what I see as the right
   things--even if in fact, as I sadly recognize, I do love and hate the
   wrong things. I don't want to love myself above all; that doesn't stop
   me from loving myself above all.

   A traditional conundrum (or pair of conundra) asks how a person--human
   or otherwise--could get into this condition in the first place, and
   whether what is deepest here is a problem of intellect or a problem of
   will. According to Calvin (Institutes II, i, 4, p. 245), the first and
   primal sin is disobedience; he also says elsewhere that it is failure
   to trust God. According to Augustine, [253] it is pride that is the
   deepest root of sin; he also says elsewhere that envy occupies this
   unenviable position. These four conditions are clearly connected. I
   pridefully want to think of myself as just as good as anyone else,
   including God; it therefore irks me to have to obey him. And if he
   requires that I obey him, will I not begin to mistrust him? (I don't
   want to obey him; it is a short step to convincing myself that what he
   requires of me is not for my own good.) Of course I also recognize that
   I don't have divine status; hence the envy (and once again, ambiguity
   and self-deception). Perhaps all of these originate in that Promethean
   desire for autonomy, for being beholden to nothing and no one. But how
   can I get into the condition of desiring this autonomy in the first
   place? Or rather, since I am born in it, how could Eve have done so?
   She knew that God alone is the first being of the universe; she knew
   that she owed God obedience and love; she knew that her own interest
   lay in loving and serving God, and, in fact, she did love and serve
   him. So how could she get into this condition of sin? It must include
   an intellectual defect; it must be by way of somehow acquiring a false
   belief. Somehow she gets deceived into thinking that it would be better
   for her to go her own way, to be her own person. But how could she come
   to think a thing like that?

   "Not only because he [Adam] was seized by Satan's blandishments," says
   Calvin, "but contemptuous of truth, he turned aside to falsehood" (II,
   i, 4, p. 245). So it wasn't just that he somehow non-culpably fell into
   false belief. He was indeed deceived, but he had a hand in it himself;
   it was partly a matter of self-deception. He was contemptuous of truth,
   and that was because at some point his affections went wrong: he was
   seized by pride. Still, why would his affections go wrong in this way?
   He must have known that this disobedience is both corrupt and contrary
   to his own good. So there must have been some kind of prior
   intellectual fault. But where could such a fault originate: how could
   it get started? It must be because of self-deception, turning away from
   what he in some sense knew was the truth. But why deceive himself?
   There is a complicated many-sided, dialectical relationship between
   intellect and will here, one such that it isn't possible to say that
   either is absolutely prior to the other with respect to falling into
   sin. One thinks that in some way it must be pride and desire for
   autonomy that lie at the bottom of the whole mess. Somehow there arises
   a sneaking desire to be like God, indeed to be equal with him, not to
   have to play second fiddle (or nth fiddle, for very large n).

   Of course the final mystery remains: where does this sneaking desire to
   be equal with God come from in the first place? How could the very idea
   so much as enter Adam's soul? In one way, this is easy enough for us to
   understand; we ourselves share in the same corruption, the same madness
   of the will. But Adam was made perfect; so how could it happen? That's
   not easy to say. God grants us an area of autonomy (we can accept or
   reject him), and this desire somehow arises out of that autonomy. I see
   what God is like, I see what I am like, and I have a choice (a choice I
   partly hide from myself): I can take pleasure in my condition, which is
   wonderfully good, or I can give in to envy. (Perhaps at first a mere
   prick, a small discomfort I can't even identify, a subterranean
   half-thought: why can't I be like that, like God, who owes no one
   anything and is such that what he wills determines what is good?)

   A speculation: for any free creature God creates, this falling into sin
   is clearly a possibility; God can't create significantly free creatures
   who cannot fall into sin. And perhaps a high probability of such a fall
   attaches to free creatures (creatures with an area of autonomy) who are
   created in the image of God. God sets out to create beings in his own
   image: they resemble him in having will and intellect, and they
   recognize the lustrous beauty, glory, and desirability of God's
   position. God is himself the center of the universe; his creatures see
   the splendor and wonderful desirability of that condition. Perhaps,
   insofar as one is free, and sees both the glory of this position and
   its enormous desirability, there is a powerful tendency to desire it
   for oneself. Perhaps there is a high probability that beings created in
   the image of God will also wind up resembling him in this: that they
   want to see and do see themselves as the center of the universe.
   Perhaps a substantial probability of falling into this condition is
   built into the very nature of free creatures who have knowledge of
   God's glorious status and do see it as indeed glorious and desirable.
   There are possible worlds in which there are free creatures with that
   kind of knowledge and affection who don't fall into this condition of
   sin, but perhaps these worlds form only a small proportion of the space
   of the totality of possible worlds containing free creatures. Fall
   isn't inevitable or necessary; nevertheless, perhaps its objective
   probability is very high.

  IV. The Noetic Effects of Sin
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. The Basic Consequence

   These are deep and dark (and gloomy) theological waters; fortunately
   the model need not take a stand on the questions how God's creatures
   could fall into sin, and whether it is intellect or will that is
   primary in sin. Suffice it to say that we human beings have indeed
   fallen from a pristine state into sin, a condition that involves both
   intellect and will. It is an affective malaise, a malfunction or
   madness of the will. But it is also a cognitive condition, and in what
   follows we will inquire a bit more closely into the cognitive
   consequences of sin.

   According to the extended A/C model, the noetic effects of sin are
   concentrated with respect to our knowledge of other people, of
   ourselves, and of God; they are less relevant (or relevant in a
   different way: see below, p. 218.) to our knowledge of nature and the
   world. Sin affects my knowledge of others in many ways. Because of
   hatred or distaste for some group of human beings, I may think them
   inferior, of less worth than I myself and my more accomplished friends.
   Because of hostility and resentment, I may misestimate or entirely
   misunderstand someone else's attitude toward me, suspecting them of
   trying to do me in, when in fact there is nothing to the suggestion.
   [254] Due to that basic and aboriginal sin pride, I may unthinkingly
   and almost without noticing assume that I am the center of the universe
   (of course if you ask me, I will deny thinking any such thing), vastly
   exaggerating the importance of what happens to me as opposed to what
   happens to others. I may vastly overestimate my own attainments and
   accomplishments, [255] consequently discounting the accomplishments of
   others. I may also fail to perceive my own sin or see it as less
   distasteful than it really is; I may fail to see myself as a creature,
   who, if not viewed through the lens of Christ's sacrifice, would be
   worthy of divine punishment. (Thus among the ravages of sin is my very
   failure to note those ravages.) Our grasp of ourselves as image bearers
   of God himself, the First Being of the universe, can also be damaged or
   compromised or dimmed. For example, we may think the way to understand
   human characteristics and ventures such as love, humor, adventure, art,
   music, science, religion, and morality is solely in terms of our
   evolutionary origin, rather than in terms of our being image bearers of
   God. [256] By failing to know God, we can come to a vastly skewed view
   of what we ourselves are, what we need, what is good for us, and how to
   attain it.

   The most serious noetic effects of sin have to do with our knowledge of
   God. Were it not for sin and its effects, God's presence and glory
   would be as obvious and uncontroversial to us all as the presence of
   other minds, physical objects, and the past. Like any cognitive
   process, however, the sensus divinitatis can malfunction; as a result
   of sin, it has indeed been damaged. [257] Our original knowledge of God
   and his glory is muffled and impaired; it has been replaced (by virtue
   of sin) by stupidity, dullness, blindness, inability to perceive God or
   to perceive him in his handiwork. Our knowledge of his character and
   his love toward us can be smothered: it can even be transformed into a
   resentful thought that God is to be feared and mistrusted; we may see
   him as indifferent or even malignant.

   In the traditional taxonomy of the seven deadly sins, this is sloth.
   Sloth is not simple laziness, like the inclination to lie down and
   watch television rather than go out and get the exercise you need; it
   is, instead, a kind of spiritual deadness, blindness, imperceptiveness,
   acedia, torpor, a failure to be aware of God's presence, love,
   requirements. [258] And in addition to the general injury due to the
   condition of sin itself, there is also the possibility of special
   damage or disease; perhaps in some people at some times, the sensus
   divinitatis doesn't work at all. Furthermore, the deliverances of the
   sensus divinitatis, muffled as they already are, can easily be
   suppressed and impeded. That can happen in various ways: for example,
   by deliberately or semideliberately turning one's attention away from
   them. Perhaps I am tormented by guilt before God, or perhaps by my
   desire to live a way of which, as I see it, God disapproves; then I may
   be inclined (with Paul Tillich) to think of God as an impersonal
   abstract object ("the ground of being") rather than as a living person
   who judges me. Or I may come to think of him as unconcerned with the
   day-to-day behavior of his creatures. Or I may come to think of him,
   not as a holy God who hates sin, but more like an indulgent grandparent
   who smiles at the childish peccadilloes of her grandchildren.

   That is just one way in which sin interferes with the deliverances of
   the sense of divinity. Another way in which the latter can be
   compromised is by way of testimony (which includes not only the case
   where someone rushes up and breathlessly tells me that my house is on
   fire but also the whole course of my upbringing and acculturation by
   parents and peers). Perhaps I am brought up to think there is no such
   person as God, that belief in God is a result of superstition,
   belonging to the infancy of the race. Perhaps I read Don Cupitt (after
   ingesting hallucinogens) and come to regard serious believers in God as
   objects of pity or figures of fun. Perhaps I am brought up to think of
   serious theistic belief as the universal obsessional neurosis of
   humanity and begin to look upon the rest of believing mankind with a
   sort of amused condescension. For these reasons or others, I ignore the
   promptings of the sense of divinity, a little ashamed, no doubt, to
   note its stirring within my heart. Ordinarily there will be a
   complicated interplay between guilt and damage, between what is due to
   my own sin (in the primary sense) and what is due to the noetic effects
   of sin that are beyond my control. [259]

   An analogy: Thomas Reid and others point out that the idea of truth, as
   a relation between beliefs and the world, is part of our native noetic
   equipment. We ordinarily take it utterly for granted that there is such
   a thing as truth, and we ordinarily take it for granted, with respect
   to any given belief we hold, that it is indeed true. But the right kind
   of cognitive environment can squelch and smother our notion of truth,
   so that some people in some circumstances wind up apparently with no
   concept of truth at all--or, more likely, with a way of thought that
   displays deep and buried conflicts. One way this can happen is by way
   of perverse philosophizing. Following certain postmodern thinkers, I
   can come to see that classical foundationalism is deeply mistaken, and
   then (perversely) leap lightly to the conclusion that really, there is
   no such thing as truth. (There is only my version, your version, and so
   on; where these differ, there is only an issue of power, not of truth.)
   It can happen in other ways as well. It is said that one of the most
   serious results of the long Communist tyranny in eastern Europe was
   just such a suppression of the idea of truth. The truth was officially
   perverted so often and so cynically (for example, the official organ of
   the Communist party devoted to the dissemination of this propaganda was
   ironically named Pravda, i.e., truth) that people came to lose the very
   idea of truth. They were lied to at every level in utterly shameless
   and blatant ways; they knew they were being lied to, knew that those
   who lied to them knew they were lying and that those to whom they lied
   knew they were being lied to, and so on; the result was that the whole
   idea of truth tended to evaporate. One said whatever would be of
   advantage; the question whether it was true no longer arose. In the
   same sort of way, the deliverances of the sensus divinitatis can be
   compromised, skewed, or even suppressed altogether.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [254] There are also beliefs we think no person of good will could come
   to hold, so that holding them is prima facie evidence of culpability;
   see my "Reason and Belief in God," in Faith and Rationality, ed. Alvin
   Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (Notre Dame: University of Notre
   Dame Press, 1984), p. 36. According to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, certain
   kinds of knowledge--knowledge of how to achieve salvation or
   happiness--require obedience: one won't be able to acquire this sort of
   knowledge without obedience. ("The Call of Discipleship," in The Cost
   of Discipleship [New York: Macmillan, 1963], pp. 83ff.)

   [255] "'Tis inexpressible, and almost inconceivable, how strong a
   self-righteous, self-exalting disposition is naturally in man; and what
   he will not do and suffer to feed and gratify it: and what lengths have
   been gone in a seeming self-denial in other respects . . . ; and all to
   do sacrifice to this Moloch of spiritual pride or self-righteousness;
   and that they may have something wherein to exalt themselves before
   God, and above their fellow creatures," Jonathan Edwards, Religious
   Affections (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959), p. 241.

   [256] Thus Herbert Simon ("A Mechanism for Social Selection and
   Successful Altruism," Science 250 [December 1990], pp. 1665ff.)
   believes that the rational way to behave is to act or try to act in
   such a way as to increase one's personal fitness, that is, to act so as
   to increase the probability that one's genes will be widely
   disseminated in the next and subsequent generations, thus doing well in
   the evolutionary derby; this, he thinks, is given by our evolutionary
   history. But then how do we account for the behavior of people like
   Mother Teresa, the Scottish missionary Eric Liddel, the Jesuit
   missionaries of the seventeenth century, or the Methodist missionaries
   of the nineteenth? Why do they devote their time and energy and indeed
   their entire lives to the welfare of other people, apparently not
   giving a fig about the fate of their genes? Two mechanisms, says Simon:
   "docility," whereby they are unusually likely to believe what others
   tell them (1666), and "limited rationality" (1667)--to speak plainly,
   stupidity.

   [257] It is no part of the model to say that damage to the sensus
   divinitatis on the part of a person is due to sin on the part of the
   same person. Such damage is like other disease and handicaps: due
   ultimately to the ravages of sin, but not necessarily sin on the part
   of the person with the disease. In this connection, see Jesus' remarks
   (John 9:1-3) about the man blind from birth.

   [258] It is this sloth as blindness that C. S. Peirce finds in David
   Hume: "Lately, when I was suffering at every mouth through which a man
   can drink suffering, I tried to beguile it by reading three books that
   I hadn't read for a long time, three religious books: Bunyan's
   Pilgrim's Progress, Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, and Hume's
   Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. The last one did one most good
   owing to the utter blindness of the man" (quoted in Edward T. Oakes,
   "Discovering the American Aristotle," First Things [December 1993], p.
   27). Insofar as sloth (so thought of) is (in part) an element of
   original sin, it is not something for which one is wholly responsible.

   [259] There are also those who are "always learning but never able to
   acknowledge the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7), despaired of by both St. Paul
   and Tertullian, like the theologian in C. S. Lewis's The Great Divorce
   who finds hell more interesting than heaven on the grounds that it
   offers more scope for lively and controversial theological inquiry and
   discussion. (In heaven there is that stultifying theological
   uniformity. . . .)
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Sin and Knowledge

   The most important cognitive consequence of sin, therefore, is failure
   to know God. And this failure can have further cognitive consequences.
   At present and especially in academia, there is widespread doubt and
   agnosticism with respect to the very existence of God. But if we don't
   know that there is such a person as God, we don't know the first thing
   (the most important thing) about ourselves, each other, and our world.
   That is because (from the point of view of the model) the most
   important truths about us and them is that we have been created by the
   Lord and utterly depend upon him for our continued existence. [260] We
   don't know what our happiness consists in, and we don't know how to
   achieve it. We don't know that we have been created in the image of
   God, and we don't grasp the significance of such characteristically
   human phenomena as love, humor, adventure, science, art, music,
   philosophy, history, and so on.

   Can we take things a step further yet? According to John Calvin, "As
   soon as ever we depart from Christ, there is nothing, be it ever so
   gross or insignificant in itself, respecting which we are not
   necessarily deceived." [261] Perhaps Calvin means only what we have
   already noted: one who doesn't know God fails to know the most
   important truth about anything else. He may mean to go even further,
   however: perhaps he means to say that those who don't know God suffer
   much wider ranging cognitive deprivation and, in fact, don't really
   have any knowledge at all. (This view is at any rate attributed
   (rightly or wrongly) to some of his followers, for example, Cornelius
   van Til.) That seems a shade harsh, particularly because many who don't
   believe in God seem to know a great deal more about some topics than
   most believers do. (Could I sensibly claim, for example, that I know
   more logic than, say, Willard van Orman Quine, even if I can't do any
   but the simplest logic exercises, on the grounds that at any rate I
   know something about logic and he, being an unbeliever, knows nothing
   at all about that subject or indeed anything else?) As it stands, this
   suggestion is desperately wide of the mark; surely many nontheists do
   know some things, for example, their age to the nearest year or so, to
   whom if anyone they are married, and which university it is that
   employs them. (If this weren't so, contemporary academia would display
   even more confusion than it does.)

      1. Sin and Skepticism

   A couple of less sweeping views however have a great deal to be said
   for them. One who is agnostic about the existence of God may also be
   agnostic about his origin and his place in the universe. In this
   section, I shall argue that one who displays a certain kind of
   agnosticism with respect to his origin and place in the universe, and
   also grasps a certain cogent argument, will not, in fact, know anything
   at all; nothing he believes will have warrant sufficient for knowledge.
   To explore this suggestion, we may begin by considering the Scottish
   philosopher David Hume. Thomas Reid, Hume's great contemporary and
   antagonist, took Hume to be a skeptic with respect to external objects,
   an enduring self, other minds, causality, the past, and so on. [262] As
   Reid sees him, Hume thinks that there is something wrong in believing
   the things we ordinarily do: it isn't as if Hume simply announces that
   as a matter of fact we don't really know all we think we know about
   external objects, causal relations, our own selves. Perhaps that would
   be bad enough, but there is something much deeper.

   We can see what by considering the Hume of the conclusion of Book I of
   the Treatise. [263] Here he isn't coolly announcing, as a mildly
   interesting fact about us, that fewer of our beliefs constitute
   knowledge than we ordinarily think. Instead, he finds himself in a sort
   of existential crisis; he simply doesn't know what to believe. When he
   follows out what seem to be the promptings and leading of reason, he
   winds up time after time in a black coal pit, not knowing which way to
   turn:

   Where am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to
   what condition shall I return? Whose favour shall I court, and whose
   anger must I dread? What beings surround me? and on whom have I any
   influence, or who have any influence on me? I am confounded with all
   these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable
   condition imaginable, inviron'd with the deepest darkness, and utterly
   depriv'd of the use of every member and faculty. (p. 269)

   Of course this is Hume in his study, sometime before he emerges for
   that famous game of backgammon. Nature herself, fortunately, dispels
   these clouds of despair: she "cures me of this philosophical melancholy
   and delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some
   avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all
   these chimeras. I dine, I play a game of backgammon, I converse, and am
   merry with my friends" (p. 269).

   Still, the enlightened person, Hume thinks, holds the consolations of
   Nature at arm's length. She knows she can't help acquiescing in the
   common illusion, but she maintains her skepticism of "the general
   maxims of the world" and adopts a certain ironic distance, a wary
   double-mindedness: "I may, nay I must yield to the current of nature,
   in submitting to my senses and understanding; and in this blind
   submission I shew most perfectly my sceptical disposition and
   principles" (p. 269). This is the irony of the human condition: those
   who are enlightened can see that what nature inevitably leads us to
   believe is false, or arbitrary, or at best extremely dubious; they also
   see, however, that even the best of us simply don't have it in them to
   successfully resist her blandishments. We can't help believing those
   "general maxims," or if we can, it is only for brief periods of time
   and in artificial situations. No one can think Humean thoughts about,
   say, induction, when under attack by a shark or when clinging
   precariously to a rock face high above the valley floor. (You won't
   find yourself saying, "Well, I do of course believe that if this
   handhold breaks out, I'll hurtle down to the ground and get killed,
   still [fleeting sardonic, self-deprecatory smile] I also know that this
   thought is just a deliverance of my nature and is therefore not really
   to be taken seriously.") Still, in other circumstances, one can take a
   sort of condescending and dismissive stance with respect to these
   promptings of nature; in reflective moments in my study, for example, I
   see through them. As a rational creature, I can rise above them,
   recognizing that they have little or nothing to be said for them.
   Indeed, I see more: this skepticism is itself a reflexive skepticism;
   it arises even with respect to this very thought; this very doubt, this
   feeling of superiority, this seeing through what our natures impose on
   us, is itself a deliverance of my nature and is thus as suspect as any
   other. The true skeptic, says Hume, "will be diffident of his
   philosophical doubts, as well as of his philosophical conviction" (p.
   273). [264]

   In these passages, therefore, Hume isn't shamefacedly confessing an
   epistemic weakness or flaw, rather as a victim of neurosis or mental
   disease might. ("Doctor, I often find that I simply can't bring myself
   to believe that induction will continue to work, or that I myself have
   existed for a good long time, or that there really are other people or
   external objects.") No; this multiply skeptical position, he thinks, is
   somehow the right one, the one that the man of sense (at least the man
   of philosophic sense) will adopt. The rest of us who unthinkingly
   acquiesce in the promptings of nature, who without a thought believe in
   causal connection, induction, persistent selves, external objects--the
   rest of us are from this perspective naive or foolish, unwitting dupes
   of our own nature. Hume is a sort of Presbyterian of the intellect; we
   are all, sage and ingenue alike, enmeshed in the toils of an original
   sin of the mind (and here perhaps we can see a lingering influence of
   the Calvinism of his youth). Of course Hume might claim that at least
   he has the advantage of recognizing that (ordinarily) he is a dupe. In
   this regard, he may seem like the publican in Jesus' parable, who at
   any rate had the grace to confess that he was indeed a sinner. But the
   fact is Hume is really more like the Pharisee. He isn't confessing a
   frailty or shortcoming, hoping for a cure; he is arguing, as he sees
   it, from a position of strength or at least insight; the rest of us who
   unthinkingly accede to the promptings of nature are the ones who suffer
   from intellectual shortcoming. More than that, we are irrational, in
   the Humean view, in that reason, carefully preserved from the
   corrupting influence of everyday attitudes, enjoins this skepticism
   upon us. To fail to accept it is to fail to follow reason, to go
   against its teachings, and in that sense to fall into irrationality.

   Now Thomas Reid takes issue with Hume (at any rate Hume as he sees him)
   at just this point. He sees Hume as standing with Descartes in thinking
   that the deliverances of perception, memory, induction, sympathy,
   testimony, and any other faculty we might have must be validated before
   the bar of reason and consciousness. That is, none of these faculties
   can reasonably be trusted until it has been shown to be reliable by an
   argument that meets two conditions. First, the argument in question
   must start from premises that are either self-evident (like elementary
   truths of arithmetic), or else deliverances of consciousness: such
   propositions about my own mind as that I seem to see a horse, or am
   appeared to redly, or believe that the Orkney Islands are north of
   Aberdeen. Second, the argument must be such that each of its steps is
   self-evidently valid.

   Now Descartes thought that in fact the other sources of belief could be
   legitimated by reason and consciousness. He thought first to establish
   the reliability of reason itself by giving a reasoned (rational) proof
   that we have been created by a benevolent God who is nondeceptive (and
   here we fall into that distressing Cartesian circle), but God would be
   a deceiver if the world weren't very much like our perceptual faculties
   reveal it to be. As Reid sees it, Descartes is mistaken at several
   points; the point of present interest, however, is Descartes's
   confidence that the reliability of those other sources can be
   established by reason. It took the work of modern philosophy from
   Descartes to Hume, so Reid thinks, to show that this is in fact a
   chimera, a will-o'-the-wisp; it simply can't be done. (The inevitable
   failure of this Cartesian project was therefore wholly evident to Reid
   some two hundred years or so before Rorty and Quine took this failure
   as a reason for proclaiming the death of epistemology [Rorty [265] ] or
   its transmogrification into empirical psychology [Quine [266] ].)

   Now one reaction would be to see this condition as interesting and
   perhaps even mildly regrettable, but of no real importance: these other
   sources of belief are perfectly acceptable, whether or not we can find
   arguments of the above sort for their reliability. Reid's Hume,
   however, takes quite a different tack; he takes it to be a sign of
   foolishness or error or dupery (in any event, part of the deplorable
   human condition) to accept the testimony of any source whose veracity
   hasn't been (or, worse, can't be) established by way of consciousness
   and reason. He therefore concludes that the rational course is to
   reject these beliefs (given that we can't show in the way in question
   that their sources are reliable), even if because of nature's imperious
   edicts we can't actually follow that austere prescription.

   This strikes Reid as a piece of consummate arbitrariness:

   The sceptic asks me, Why do you believe the existence of the external
   object which you perceive? This belief, sir, is none of my manufacture;
   it came from the mint of Nature; it bears her image and superscription;
   and, if it is not right, the fault is not mine: I ever took it upon
   trust, and without suspicion. Reason, says the sceptic, is the only
   judge of truth, and you ought to throw off every opinion and every
   belief that is not grounded on reason. Why, sir, should I believe the
   faculty of reason more than that of perception?--they came both out of
   the same shop, and were made by the same artist; and if he puts one
   piece of false ware into my hands, what should hinder him from putting
   another? [267]

   I believe that Reid is substantially right here; the Humean skeptic is
   arbitrary. [268] But this is not the place for a discussion of this
   point: what I want to argue instead is that Hume has a different reason
   for his skepticism, a reason shared by anyone who concurs with him in
   agnosticism about our origin and the origin of our cognitive faculties.
   Suppose, for one reason or another, you give up this idea that we have
   been created by a benevolent deity. Perhaps with Hume you adopt instead
   a thoroughgoing agnosticism: there is simply no way to know whether
   there is any being at all like God, no way to know whether there is a
   divine being who created the world, no way, indeed, to know anything
   about the ultimate origin of the world or of the ultimate origin of
   ourselves and our cognitive faculties. "Our experience," he says, "so
   imperfect in itself and so limited both in extent and duration, can
   afford us no probable conjecture concerning the whole of things." [269]
   Perhaps the world owes its existence to intelligent design: just as
   likely, though (at least as far as we can tell), it owes it to animal
   or even vegetative generation (perhaps comets are seeds and our world
   has arisen from one); and there are a thousand other possibilities,
   some of them canvassed with grace and style in the Dialogues concerning
   Natural Religion. Hume's [270] conclusion there, it seems, is that

   In such questions as the present [cosmogony, the origin of the
   universe], a hundred contradictory views may preserve a kind of
   imperfect analogy, and invention has here full scope to exert itself.
   Without any great effort of thought, I believe that I could, in an
   instant, propose other systems of cosmogony which would have some faint
   appearance of truth: though it is a thousand, a million to one if
   either yours or any one of mine be the true system. (Dialogues, p. 49)

   He adds a bit later that on this topic, "A total suspense of judgment
   is here our only reasonable resource" (p. 53). Hume so understood has
   no idea at all how the world got here, how rational creatures such as
   we ourselves have arisen, and what the origin and provenance of our
   rational or belief-producing faculties might be.

   Now turn to the question whether our cognitive faculties are reliable
   and do, in fact, produce for the most part true belief. Given Hume's
   complete agnosticism about the origins of his cognitive faculties,
   something like his deeply agnostic attitude to that question is no more
   than sensible. For suppose Hume asks himself how likely it is that our
   cognitive faculties are reliable, given his views (or rather lack of
   views) about the origin and provenance of ourselves and those
   faculties. What is the probability that our faculties produce the
   considerable preponderance of true belief over false required by
   reliability, given his views of their origin and purpose (if any)? I
   should think he would have to say that this probability is either low
   or inscrutable--impossible to determine. From his point of view, there
   are innumerable scenarios, innumerable ways in which we and our
   cognitive faculties could have come into being: perhaps we have been
   created by God, but perhaps we and the world are the result of some
   kind of vegetative principle, or a result of copulation on the part of
   animals we have no knowledge of, or the result of Russell's accidental
   collocation of atoms, or of . . . . On many of these scenarios, our
   cognitive faculties wouldn't be reliable (although they might
   contribute to fitness or survival); perhaps on others they would be
   reliable; on balance, one just wouldn't know what to think about this
   probability.

   We can see this more fully as follows. Let R be the proposition that
   our cognitive faculties are reliable: now what is the likelihood of R?
   As Reid points out, we all instinctively believe or assume that our
   cognitive faculties are indeed reliable; but what is the probability of
   that assumption, given the relevant facts? Well, what are the relevant
   facts? First, they would be facts about those faculties: the
   probability of R given (relative to) the population of China would not
   be relevant. And presumably the relevant facts would be facts about how
   these faculties originated; whether they were designed; if so, by whom
   and with what end in view; what constraints governed their development;
   and what their purpose and function is, if, indeed, they have a purpose
   and function. Were they, as Reid thought, created in us by a being who
   intends that they function reliably to give us knowledge about our
   environment, ourselves, and God himself--all the knowledge needed for
   us to attain shalom, to be the sort of beings God intended us to be? On
   that scenario, the purpose of our cognitive faculties would be (in
   part, at least) to supply us with true beliefs on those topics, and
   (given that they are functioning properly) there would be a high
   probability of their doing just that.

   Did they, by contrast, arise by way of some chance mechanism, something
   like the mindless swerve of atoms in the Democritian void? What is the
   likelihood, on that possibility, that our cognitive faculties are
   reliable? Well, you might think it pretty low. More likely, you may
   think that you simply can't say what that probability is: perhaps it is
   high (though presumably not very high), perhaps it is low; you simply
   can't tell. [271] There will be many more such scenarios, says Hume,
   some involving vegetative origin, some copulative origin, some still
   other kinds of origin; with respect to them, too, the probability that
   our cognitive faculties are reliable is simply inscrutable. So first,
   Hume thinks his grasp of the whole set of relevant scenarios is at best
   infirm; second, with respect to many of these scenarios, those possible
   origins, the probability of R is inscrutable; and finally, the
   probability with respect to any of these scenarios that it is in fact
   the truth of the matter is also, as far as Hume is concerned, quite
   inscrutable.

   But that means that the probability of R, given Hume's agnosticism, is
   also inscrutable for Hume. Let F be the relevant facts about their
   origin, purpose, and provenance: my claim is that, for Hume, P(R/F)
   (the probability of R on F) is inscrutable. He simply doesn't know what
   it is and has no opinion about its value, although presumably it
   wouldn't be very high. Another way to put it: the probability of R,
   given Hume's agnosticism, is inscrutable.

   And that gives Hume a reason to be agnostic with respect to R as well;
   it gives him a reason to doubt that R is, in fact, true. For our
   cognitive faculties, our belief-producing mechanisms, are a bit like
   measuring instruments (more exactly, measuring instruments under an
   interpretation). Our faculties produce beliefs; for each belief, there
   is the content of that belief, the proposition believed, a proposition
   that is true if and only if the belief is true. Now a state of a
   measuring instrument (relative to a scheme of interpretation) can also
   be said (in an analogically extended sense) to have content. For
   definiteness, consider a thermometer and suppose its pointer is resting
   on the number 70. Given the natural scheme of interpretation, this
   state can be said to have the content that the ambient temperature is
   70? F. And of course a thermometer is reliable only if the propositions
   it delivers in this way are for the most part true, or nearly true.

   Imagine, then, that you embark on a voyage of space exploration and
   land on a planet revolving about a distant sun. This planet has a
   favorable atmosphere, but you know little more about it. You crack the
   hatch, step out, and immediately find something that looks a lot like a
   radio; it periodically emits strings of sounds that, oddly enough, form
   sentences in English. The sentences emitted by this instrument express
   propositions only about topics of which you have no knowledge: what the
   weather is like in Beijing at the moment, whether Caesar had eggs on
   toast on the morning he crossed the Rubicon, whether the first human
   being to cross the Bering Strait and set foot on North America was
   left-handed, and the like. A bit unduly impressed with your find, you
   initially form the opinion that this quasi radio speaks the truth: that
   is, the propositions expressed (in English) by those sentences are
   true. But then you recall that you have no idea at all as to what the
   purpose of this apparent instrument is, whether it has a purpose, or
   how it came to be. You see that the probability of its being reliable,
   given what you know about it, is for you inscrutable. Then (in the
   absence of investigation) you have a defeater for your initial belief
   that the thing does, in fact, speak the truth, a reason to reject that
   belief, a reason to give it up, to be agnostic with respect to it.
   Relative to your beliefs about the origin, purpose, and provenance of
   this apparent instrument, the probability that it is a reliable source
   of information is low or (more likely) inscrutable. And that gives you
   a defeater for your original and hasty belief that the thing really
   does speak the truth. If you don't have or get further information
   about its reliability, the reasonable course is agnosticism about that
   proposition.

   The same goes, I think, in the case of Humean views (or non-views)
   about our origins and the origin and purpose, if any, of our cognitive
   faculties. Suppose I join Hume in that agnosticism. Then P(R/F) is for
   me inscrutable (as for Hume); I have no idea what the probability of my
   faculties being reliable is, given the relevant facts about their
   origin and purpose. But then I have a defeater for my original belief
   or assumption that my faculties are in fact reliable. If I have or can
   get no further information about their reliability, the reasonable
   course for me is agnosticism with respect to R, giving it up, failing
   to believe it. It isn't that rationality requires that I believe its
   denial, but it does require that I not believe it.

   Suppose, therefore, that I am agnostic with respect to R: I believe
   neither it nor its denial. And now consider any belief B I have: that
   belief, of course, will be a deliverance of my cognitive faculties.
   However, I don't believe that my cognitive faculties are reliable--not
   because I've never thought about the question, but because I have
   thought about it and seen that P(R/F) is inscrutable for me. Well, what
   does rationality require with respect to this belief B? The clear
   answer seems to be that I have a defeater for this belief too, a reason
   to withhold it, to be agnostic with respect to it. Perhaps it isn't
   possible, given my nature, that I be agnostic with respect to it, at
   least much of the time; as Hume says, nature may not permit this.
   Still, this agnosticism is what reason requires, just as Hume suggests
   (though for different reasons). And we can take one further step with
   Hume. Because B is just any belief I hold--because I have a defeater
   for just any belief I hold--I also have a defeater for my belief that I
   have a defeater for B. This universal, all-purpose defeater provided by
   my agnosticism is also a defeater for itself, a self-defeating
   defeater. [272] And hence this complex, confusing, multilayered,
   reflexive skepticism Hume describes, a skepticism in which I am
   skeptical of my beliefs and also of my doubts, and of the beliefs that
   lead to those doubts, and of my doubts with respect to those doubts,
   and the beliefs leading to them. Thus the true skeptic will be
   skeptical all the way down; he "will be diffident of his philosophical
   doubts, as well as his philosophical conviction."

   Here we can imagine the following response: "Hey, hang on a minute! You
   said Hume and any similarly situated agnostic has a defeater for R, a
   belief to which he is inclined by nature--and you added that the
   rational course for them therefore is to give up belief in R--provided
   they have no other information about the reliability of their
   faculties. But what about that strong natural inclination to believe
   that our faculties are in fact reliable? Doesn't that count as other
   information'?" According to Reid (who might object to being pressed
   into service in defense of Hume), this belief in the reliability of our
   faculties is a first principle:

   Another first principle is--That the natural faculties, by which we
   distinguish truth from error, are not fallacious. (275)

   He goes on:

   If any truth can be said to be prior to all others in the order of
   nature, this seems to have the best claim; because, in every instance
   of assent, whether upon intuitive, demonstrative, or probable evidence,
   the truth of our faculties is taken for granted. . . . (277)

   Surely there is truth here: this conviction is one normal human beings
   ordinarily have, and, as Reid gleefully points outs, even skeptics also
   seem to assume, in the course of ordinary daily living, to be sure, but
   most poignantly when proposing their skeptical arguments, that their
   faculties are functioning reliably. Very few skeptics, in offering
   their skeptical arguments, preface the argument by saying something
   like, "Well, here is an argument for general skepticism with respect to
   our cognitive faculties; of course I realize that the premises of this
   argument are themselves produced by cognitive faculties whose
   reliability the conclusion impugns, and of whose truth I am therefore
   extremely doubtful."

   But our question is whether this belief can sensibly be pressed into
   service as information that can defeat the defeater provided for R by
   Hume's agnosticism about the origin and provenance of ourselves and our
   faculties. As Reid clearly sees, it cannot. If the general reliability
   of our cognitive faculties is under question, we can't hope to answer
   the question whether they are reliable by pointing out that these
   faculties themselves deliver the belief that they are, in fact,
   reliable. "If a man's honesty were called into question," says Reid,
   "it would be ridiculous to refer it to the man's own word, whether he
   be honest or not" (276). Concede that it is part of our nature to
   assume R; concede further that it is part of our nature to take R in
   the basic way, so that this conviction is not given or achieved by
   argument and evidence but comes with our mother's milk; concede still
   further, if you like, that this belief is produced by our cognitive
   faculties functioning properly. None of this, clearly enough, can serve
   to defeat the defeater for R provided by Hume's agnosticism. That is
   because any doubt about our cognitive faculties generally is a doubt
   about the specific faculty that produces this conviction; therefore we
   can't allay such a doubt by appealing to the deliverances of that
   faculty. [273]

      2. Naturalism and Lack of Knowledge

   Agnosticism with respect to our origins is one way to reject the
   theistic belief that we human beings have been created in the image of
   God: as we have seen, agnosticism with respect to origins destroys
   knowledge. There is another way to reject the belief in question: by
   accepting a belief incompatible with it, for example, philosophical or
   metaphysical naturalism. As Bas van Fraassen notes, it isn't easy to
   say precisely what naturalism is; [274] for present purposes, suppose
   we take it to be the view that there is no such person as God, nor
   anyone or anything at all like him (it isn't that you believe, for
   example, that there are one or more finite gods). Paradigm cases of
   naturalism would be the views of Daniel Dennett in Darwin's Dangerous
   Idea [275] or Bertrand Russell in "A Free Man's Worship": you think
   that "man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end
   they were achieving, that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears,
   his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental
   collocations of atoms." [276] (Perhaps you even go so far as to add,
   with Richard Dawkins, that the very idea that there is such a person as
   God is really a kind of cognitive virus, an epistemic sickness or
   disease, distorting the cognitive stance of what would otherwise be
   reasonable and rational human beings. [277] ) Unlike Hume, therefore,
   you are not agnostic as to whether there is such a person as God or any
   being at all like him; you think there is not.

   There is likely to be a further difference between you and Hume. Having
   rejected theism, Hume had no comparable story to put in its place: he
   was left with no idea as to how humanity arose, under what conditions
   our cognitive faculties came to be, and so on. The contemporary
   naturalist, however, is in a different condition; for naturalism now
   sports a shared myth or story about ourselves and our origins, a set of
   shared beliefs about who we are, where we come from, and how we got
   here. The story is familiar; I shall be brief. We human beings have
   arrived on the scene after millions, indeed, billions of years of
   organic evolution. In the beginning, there was just inorganic matter;
   somehow, and by way of processes of which we currently have no grasp,
   life, despite its enormous and daunting complexity at even the simplest
   level, arose from nonliving matter, and arose just by way of the
   regularities studied in physics and chemistry. Once life arose, random
   genetic mutation and natural selection, those great twin engines of
   evolution, swung into action. [278] These genetic mutations are
   multiply random: they weren't intended by anyone, of course, but also
   were not directed by any sort of natural teleology and do not arise at
   the behest of the design plan of the organism. They are "not in a
   response to the needs of the organism" (Ernst Mayr); they just
   unaccountably appear. Occasionally, some of them yield an adaptive
   advantage; their possessors come to predominate in the population, and
   they are passed on to the next and subsequent generations. In this way,
   all the enormous variety of flora and fauna we behold came into being.

   Including ourselves and our cognitive systems. These systems and the
   underlying mechanisms have also been selected for, directly or
   indirectly, in the course of evolution. Consider, for example, the
   mammalian brain in all its enormous complexity. It could have been
   directly selected for in the following sense: at each stage in its
   development, the new stage (by virtue of the structures and behaviors
   it helped bestow) contributed to fitness and conferred an evolutionary
   advantage, giving its possessors a better chance of surviving and
   reproducing. Alternatively, at certain stages new structures (or new
   modifications of old structures) arose, not because they were
   themselves selected for, but because they were genetically associated
   with something else that was selected for (pliotropy). Either way these
   structures were not selected for their penchant for producing true
   beliefs in us; instead, they conferred an adaptive advantage or were
   genetically associated with something that conferred such an advantage.
   And the ultimate purpose or function, if any, of these belief-producing
   mechanisms will not be the production of true beliefs, but survival--of
   the gene, genotype, individual, species, whatever.

   If you are a naturalist and also believe these things, then you are
   what I shall call an ordinary naturalist. [279] In chapter 12 of
   Warrant and Proper Function (WPF), I argued that an ordinary naturalist
   is like Hume in that she has a defeater for any belief she
   holds--including, ironically enough, ordinary naturalism itself, so
   that ordinary naturalism is self-defeating. [280] I shall not repeat
   that argument; instead, I will take this opportunity to make some
   corrections, simplifications, and additions.

   First, a correction. In chapter 12 of WPF, there are really two
   arguments: a preliminary argument and a main argument. The main
   argument is for the conclusion that naturalism is self-defeating (and
   hence not rationally acceptable); the preliminary argument is not for
   that conclusion, but is, instead, a straightforward (probabilistic)
   argument for the falsehood of naturalism. The preliminary argument is
   also straightforwardly incorrect. [281] We can see this as follows. It
   began with an argument for the conclusion that P(R/N&E&C) is fairly
   low. Here R is the proposition that our cognitive faculties are
   reliable, N is metaphysical naturalism, E is the proposition that our
   cognitive faculties have developed by way of the mechanisms to which
   contemporary evolutionary theory directs our attention, and C was an
   unspecified proposition describing our noetic systems. In fact, C is
   dispensable, so in what follows I shall suppress it.

   After arguing that P(R/N&E) is low, I went on:

   Suppose you do estimate these probabilities in roughly this way:
   suppose you concur in Darwin's Doubt, taking P(R/N&E) to be fairly low.
   But suppose you also think, as most of us do, that, in fact, our
   cognitive faculties are reliable (with the qualifications and nuances
   introduced above). Then you have a straightforward probabilistic
   argument against naturalism--and for traditional theism, if you think
   these two the significant alternatives. According to Bayes's Theorem,

   P(N&E/R) = P(N&E) Ã P(R/N&E) / P(R)

   where P(N&E) is your estimate of the probability for N&E independent of
   the consideration of R. You believe R, so you assign it a probability
   of 1 (or nearly 1); and you take P(R/N&E) to be no more than 1/2. Then
   P(N&E/R) will be no greater than 1/2 times P(N&E), and will thus be
   fairly low. No doubt you will also assign a very high probability to
   the conditional if naturalism is true, then our faculties have arisen
   by way of evolution; if so, then you will judge that P(N/R) is also
   low. But you do think R is true; you therefore have evidence against N.
   So your belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable gives you a
   reason for rejecting naturalism and accepting its denial (p. 228).

   A very pretty little argument: too bad it contains a serious flaw. Here
   is the problem: in this argument, I was confusing the absolute (logical
   or anyway objective) probability of R with its probability conditional
   on our background information B; that is, I was confusing P(R/B) with
   P(R) simpliciter. (For simplicity, I shall henceforth also suppress E,
   annexing it to N, so that henceforth N will stand for ordinary
   naturalism, the conjunction of naturalism simpliciter with E.) We can
   see this by considering the argument both ways: first, relativizing the
   probabilities to our background knowledge B, and second, not so
   relativizing them.

   First interpretation: if we relativize the probabilities in question to
   B, then the relevant application of Bayes's Theorem will be

   P(N/R&B) = P(N/B) Ã P(R/N&B) / P(R/B)

   Here I can set P(R/B) very high, just as I say on p. 228. But I can't
   sensibly claim that P(R/N&B) is low. That P(R/N) is low is what I
   argued: I didn't argue that the probability of R is low on N plus
   background knowledge. In the argument that P(R/N) is low, I was
   abstracting from what we ordinarily think we know (for example, R
   itself). So I can't, without further argument, anyway, claim that the
   probability of R on N together with our background knowledge, is low.

   Second interpretation: if we don't relativize the argument to B (or
   anything else), the relevant application of Bayes's will be

   P(N/R) = P(N) Ã P(R/N) / P(R)

   as I said on p. 228. But if we are thinking of the absolute probability
   of R (conditioned only on necessary truths), then I can't claim (as I
   did) that P(R) is high: how would I know what proportion of the space
   of possible worlds is occupied by worlds in which R is true? In
   particular, the fact that R is true in fact is no reason for assigning
   it a high absolute (logical) probability. So either way the argument
   fails.

   Fortunately, there is a repair. We are comparing theism (T) and N. So
   the relevant applications of Bayes's will be

   P(N/R) = P(N) Ã P(R/N) / P(R)

   and

   P(T/R) = P(T) Ã P(R/T) / P(R)

   where we are thinking of absolute or logical probabilities. P(R) will
   have the same value in each expression; so the question is, how do

   (a) P(N) Ã P(R/N)

   and

   (b) P(T) Ã P(R/T)

   compare in value? Well, P(R/N) is low, as I had argued. However, P(R/T)
   is not; R is just what we'd expect, given T. (At any rate we've got no
   reason for thinking P(R/T) low.) So (given that we don't assign N a
   considerably higher absolute probability than T) we should take the
   probability of T on R to be greater than that of N on R. But we do, in
   fact, believe R. So we have a reason to prefer T to N. Not perhaps a
   very strong reason (this doesn't tell us a whole lot about the
   probabilities of T and N on our total evidence) but a reason
   nonetheless. (It's the same sort of reason the atheologian has for
   preferring atheism to theism, given that he thinks it unlikely that a
   world created by God would display all the evil the world does, in
   fact, display.)

   In essence, the main argument is for the conclusions that P(R/N&E&C)
   (which I'll abbreviate as P(R/N); see small print above) is either low
   or inscrutable; in either case, so I argued, one who accepts N (and
   also grasps the argument for a low or inscrutable value of P(R/N)) has
   a defeater for R. This induces a defeater, for him, for any belief
   produced by his cognitive faculties, including N itself; hence,
   ordinary naturalism is self-defeating. Now I argued that P(R/N) is low
   or inscrutable by noting first that natural selection isn't interested
   in true belief but in adaptive behavior (taken broadly), so that
   everything turns on the relation between belief and behavior. I then
   presented five mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive possibilities
   for the relation between belief and behavior, arguing with respect to
   each possibility P[i] that P(R/N&P[i]) is low or inscrutable, yielding
   the result that P(R/N) is low or inscrutable.

   Here we can simplify by dropping two of the five possibilities, leaving
   just epiphenomenalism, semantic epiphenomenalism (perhaps content
   epiphenomenalism' would be a more felicitous name), and the common
   sense (folk psychological') view of the causal relation between belief
   and behavior. The first possibility (call it P[1]') is
   epiphenomenalism, the proposition that belief (conscious belief) isn't
   involved in the causal chain leading to behavior at all. This view was
   named and suggested by T. H. Huxley ("Darwin's bulldog"). [282]
   Although epiphenomenalism runs counter to our commonsense ways of
   thinking, it is nonetheless widely popular among those enthusiastic
   about the "scientific" study of human beings. According to Time, a few
   years ago the eminent biologist J. M. Smith "wrote that he had never
   understood why organisms have feelings. After all, orthodox biologists
   believe that behavior, however complex, is governed entirely by
   biochemistry and that the attendant sensations--fear, pain, wonder,
   love--are just shadows cast by that biochemistry, not themselves vital
   to the organism's behavior." [283]

   And the same can be said for conscious belief: if "behavior, however
   complex, is governed entirely by biochemistry," there seems to be no
   room for conscious belief to become involved in the causal story, no
   way in which conscious belief can get its hand in; it will be causally
   inert. Furthermore, if this possibility were, in fact, actual, then
   evolution would not have been able to mold and shape our beliefs, or
   belief-producing structures, weeding out falsehood and encouraging
   truth; for then our beliefs would be, so to speak, invisible to
   evolution. Which beliefs (if any) an organism had, under this scenario,
   would be merely accidental as far as evolution is concerned. It
   wouldn't make any difference to behavior or fitness what beliefs our
   cognitive mechanisms had produced, because (under this scenario) those
   beliefs play no role in the production or explanation of behavior. What
   then is the probability of R on this scenario? That is, what is
   P(R/N&P[1])? What reliability requires, of course, is that a large
   preponderance of our beliefs be true. Now most large sets of
   propositions do not meet that condition; but one large set of
   beliefs--at any rate, of beliefs we human beings are capable of
   having--would seem to be about as likely as any other on this scenario.
   Hence we couldn't claim with a straight face that there is a high
   probability, on this scenario, that most of our beliefs are true.
   Perhaps the verdict is that this probability is relatively low; just
   for definiteness, let's say it's in the neighborhood of .3 or so.
   Alternatively, we might think that the right attitude here is that we
   simply can't make a sensible estimate of this probability, so that
   P(R/N&P[1]) is inscrutable.

   The second possibility as to the relation between belief and behavior
   (call it P[2]) is semantic epiphenomenalism. From a naturalistic point
   of view, the natural thing to think is that human beings are material
   objects. [284] Well, suppose that's what they are: then what sort of
   thing will a belief--perhaps the belief that Cartesian dualism is
   false--be? Presumably it will be a long-standing neural or neuronal
   event of some kind. This neural event will have electrochemical
   properties: the number of neurons involved; the way in which the
   neurons involved are connected with each other, with other neuronal
   events, with muscles, with sense organs, and so on; the average rate
   and intensity of neuronal firing in various parts of this event and the
   ways in which this changes over time and with respect to input from
   other areas. (Call these the syntax' of the belief.) Of course it is
   easy to see how these properties of this neuronal event should have
   causal influence on behavior. A given belief is neurally connected both
   with other beliefs and with muscles; we can see how electrical impulses
   coming from the belief can negotiate the usual neuronal channels and
   ultimately cause muscular contraction.

   Now if this belief is really a belief, then it will also have other
   properties, properties in addition to its syntax or neurophysiological
   properties. In particular, it will have content; it will be the belief
   that p, for some proposition p--in this case, the proposition Cartesian
   dualism is false. But how does the content of this neuronal event--that
   proposition--get involved in the causal chain leading to behavior?
   [285] Under this scenario, it will be difficult or impossible to see
   how a belief can have causal influence on our behavior or action by
   virtue of its content. Suppose the belief had had the same
   electrochemical properties but some entirely different content, perhaps
   the proposition Cartesian dualism is true; would that have made any
   difference to its role in the causation of behavior? It is certainly
   hard to see how: there would have been the same electrical impulses
   traveling down the same channels, issuing in the same muscular
   contractions. The neurophysiological properties seem to have swept the
   field when it comes to the causation of behavior; there seems to be no
   way in which content can get its foot in the door. Of course, it is the
   content of my beliefs, not their electrochemical properties, that is
   the subject of truth and falsehood: a belief is true just if the
   proposition that constitutes its content is true. As in the
   epiphenomenalist scenario, therefore, the content of belief would be
   invisible to evolution. Accordingly, the fact that we have survived and
   evolved, that our cognitive equipment was good enough to enable our
   ancestors to survive and reproduce--that fact would tell us nothing at
   all about the truth of our beliefs or the reliability of our cognitive
   faculties. It would tell something about the neurophysiological
   properties of our beliefs; it would tell us that, by virtue of these
   properties, those beliefs have played a role in the production of
   adaptive behavior. But it would tell us nothing about the contents of
   these beliefs, and hence nothing about their truth or falsehood. On
   this scenario as on the last, therefore, we couldn't sensibly claim a
   high probability for R. As with the last scenario, the best we could
   say, I think, is that this probability is either low or inscrutable;
   P(R/N&P[2]) is low or inscrutable, just as is P(R/N&P[1]).

   Finally, what is the probability of R, given N&P[3], the commonsense
   (folk psychological) view as to the causal relation between behavior
   and belief? According to folk psychology, belief serves as a (partial)
   cause and thus explanation of behavior--and this explicitly holds for
   the content of belief. I want a beer and believe there is one in the
   fridge; that belief, we ordinarily think, partly explains those
   movements of that large lumpy object that is my body as it heaves
   itself out of the armchair, moves over to the fridge, opens it, and
   extracts the beer.

   Can we mount an argument from the evolutionary origins of the
   processes, whatever they are, that produce these beliefs to the
   reliability of those processes? Could we argue, for example, that these
   beliefs of ours are connected with behavior in such a way that false
   belief would produce maladaptive behavior, behavior which would tend to
   reduce the probability of the believers' surviving and reproducing?
   [286] No. False belief doesn't by any means guarantee maladaptive
   action. Perhaps a primitive tribe thinks that everything is really
   alive, or is a witch or a demon of some sort; and perhaps all or nearly
   all of their beliefs are of the form this witch is F or that demon is
   G: this witch is good to eat, or that demon is likely to eat me if I
   give it a chance. If they ascribe the right properties to the right
   witches, their beliefs could be adaptive while nonetheless (assuming
   that in fact there aren't any witches) false. [287] Also, of course,
   there is the fact that behavior, if it is partly produced by belief, is
   also partly produced by desire: it is belief and desire, along with
   other things, that together produce behavior. But then clearly there
   could be many different systems of belief and desire that yield the
   same bit of adaptive behavior, and in many of those systems the belief
   components are largely false; there are many possible belief-desire
   systems that yield the whole course of my behavior, where in each
   system most of the beliefs are false. The fact that my behavior (or
   that of my ancestors) has been adaptive, therefore, is at best a
   third-rate reason for thinking my beliefs mostly true and my cognitive
   faculties reliable--and that is true even given the commonsense view of
   the relation of belief to behavior. So we can't sensibly argue from the
   fact that our behavior (or that of our ancestors) has been adaptive, to
   the conclusion that our beliefs are mostly true and our cognitive
   faculties reliable. It isn't easy to estimate P(R/N&P[3]); if it isn't
   inscrutable, perhaps it is moderately high. To concede as much as
   possible to the opposition, let's say that this probability is either
   inscrutable or in the neighborhood of .9.

   Note that epiphenomenalism simpliciter and semantic epiphenomenalism
   unite in declaring or implying that the content of belief lacks causal
   efficacy with respect to behavior; the content of belief does not get
   involved in the causal chain leading to behavior. So perhaps we can
   reduce these two possibilities to one: the possibility that the content
   of belief has no causal efficacy. Call this possibility -C. What we
   have so far seen is that the probability of R on N&-C is low or
   inscrutable, and that the probability of R on N&C is also inscrutable
   or at best moderate. Now what we are looking for is P(R/N). Because C
   and -C are jointly exhaustive and mutually exclusive, the calculus of
   probabilities tells us that

   P(R/N) = P(R/N&C) Ã P(C/N) + P(R/N&-C) Ã P(-C/N),

   that is, the probability of R on N is the weighted average of the
   probabilities of R on N&C and N&-C--weighted by the probabilities of C
   and -C on N.

   We have already noted that the left-hand term of the first of the two
   products on the right side of the equality is either moderately high or
   inscrutable; the second is either low or inscrutable. What remains is
   to evaluate the weights, the right-hand terms of the two products. So
   what is the probability of -C, given ordinary naturalism: what is the
   probability that one or the other of the two epiphenomenalistic
   scenarios is true? Note that according to Robert Cummins, semantic
   epiphenomenalism is in fact the received view as to the relation
   between belief and behavior. [288] That is because it is extremely hard
   to envisage a way, given materialism, in which the content of a belief
   could get causally involved in behavior. If a belief just is a neural
   structure of some kind--a structure that somehow possesses
   content--then it is exceedingly hard to see how content can get
   involved in the causal chain leading to behavior: had a given such
   structure had a different content, its causal contribution to behavior,
   one thinks, would be the same. By contrast, if a belief is not a
   material structure at all but a nonphysical bit of consciousness, it is
   hard to see that there is any room for it in the causal chain leading
   to behavior; what causes the muscular contractions involved in behavior
   will be states of the nervous system, with no point at which this
   nonphysical bit of consciousness makes a causal contribution. So it is
   exceedingly hard to see, given N, how the content of a belief can have
   causal efficacy.

   It is exceedingly hard to see, that is, how epiphenomenalism--semantic
   or simpliciter--can be avoided, given N. (There have been some valiant
   efforts, but things don't look hopeful.) So it looks as if P(-C/N) will
   have to be estimated as relatively high; let's say (for definiteness)
   .7, in which case P(C/N) will be .3. Of course we could easily be
   wrong--we don't really have a solid way of telling--so perhaps the
   conservative position here is that this probability, too, is
   inscrutable: one simply can't tell what it is. Given current knowledge,
   therefore, P(-C/N) is either high or inscrutable. And if P(-C/N) is
   inscrutable, then the same goes, naturally enough, for P(C/N). What
   does that mean for the sum of these two products, i.e., P(R/N)?

   Well, we really have several possibilities. Suppose we think first
   about the matter from the point of view of someone who doesn't find any
   of the probabilities involved inscrutable. Then P(C/N) will be in the
   neighborhood of .3, P(-C/N) in the neighborhood of .7, and P(R/N&-C)
   perhaps in the neighborhood of .2. This leaves P(R/N&C), the
   probability that R is true, given ordinary naturalism together with the
   commonsense or folk-theoretical view as to the relation between belief
   and behavior. Given that this probability is not inscrutable, let's say
   that it is in the neighborhood of .9. And given these estimates, P(R/N)
   will be in the neighborhood of .41. [289] Suppose, however, we think
   the probabilities involved are inscrutable: then we will have to say
   the same for P(R/N). Therefore, P(R/N) is either relatively low--less
   than .5, at any rate--or inscrutable.

   In either case, however, doesn't the ordinary naturalist--at any rate,
   one who sees that P(R/N) is low or inscrutable--have a defeater for R,
   and for the proposition that his own cognitive faculties are reliable?
   I say he does. To see how, we must note some analogies with clear
   cases. First, there are the analogies I mentioned in WPF (229-31); here
   are a couple more. Return (pp. 224) to that voyage of space exploration
   and the radio-like device that emitted sounds that constitute English
   sentences, sentences that express propositions of whose truth value you
   are ignorant. At first, you were inclined to believe these
   propositions, if only because of shock and astonishment. After a bit of
   cool reflection, however, you realize that you know nothing at all
   about the purpose, if any, of this instrument, or who or what
   constructed it. The probability that this device is reliable, given
   what you know about it, is low or inscrutable; and this gives you a
   defeater for your initial belief that the instrument indeed speaks the
   truth. Consider another analogy. You start thinking seriously about the
   possibility that you are a brain in a vat, being subjected to
   experiment by Alpha Centaurian cognitive scientists in such a way that
   your cognitive faculties are not, in fact, reliable. For one reason or
   another, you come to think this probability is greater than .5; then
   you have a defeater for your belief that your cognitive faculties are
   reliable. Suppose instead that you think this is a genuine possibility,
   but you can't make any estimate at all of its likelihood, so that you
   can't make any estimate at all of the probability that your faculties
   are reliable: as far as you can tell, the probability could be anywhere
   between and 1. Then too you have a defeater for your natural belief
   that your cognitive faculties are reliable.

   The same goes for the naturalist who realizes that P(R/N) is low or
   inscrutable. With respect to those factors crucially important for
   coming to a sensible view of the reliability of his belief-producing
   mechanisms--how they were formed and what their purpose is, if any--he
   must concede that the probability that those faculties are reliable is
   at best inscrutable. Unless he has some other information, [290] the
   right attitude would be to withhold R. But then something like Hume's
   attitude toward my beliefs would be the appropriate one. I recognize
   that I can't help forming most of the beliefs I do form; for example,
   it isn't within my power, just now, to withhold the belief that there
   are trees and grass outside my window. However, because I now do not
   believe that my cognitive faculties are reliable (I withhold that
   proposition), I also realize that these beliefs produced by my
   cognitive faculties are no more likely to be true than false: I
   therefore assume a certain skeptical distance with respect to them.
   And, because my doubts about my beliefs themselves depend on my
   beliefs, I also assume a certain skeptical distance with respect to
   these doubts, and with respect to the beliefs prompting those doubts,
   and with respect to the beliefs prompting the doubts about those
   doubts. . . . The ordinary naturalist, therefore, should join Hume in
   this same skeptical, ironic attitude toward his beliefs. This holds, of
   course, for N itself; for this reason, we might say that N is
   self-defeating, in that if it is accepted in the ordinary way, it
   provides a defeater for itself, a defeater that can't be defeated.
   [291]

   We can briefly extend this result to the case where I am agnostic about
   ordinary naturalism. I don't really believe it; either it seems to me
   to be about as likely as its denial, or its probability is inscrutable
   for me. In either case, once more, I have a defeater for R, just as in
   the case of the ordinary naturalist. To see this, consider once again
   an analogy, and just to preserve continuity, make it another
   instrumental analogy. You are confronted with a measuring instrument of
   some kind--a barometer, say. You believe that this barometer is in one
   or the other of two conditions, C1 and C2; the probability that it is
   in either is for you either inscrutable or about .5. The probability of
   its being reliable, given that it is in C1, is high, certainly high
   enough so that if you believed that it was in C1, you would
   unhesitatingly accept its deliverances. However, the likelihood that it
   is reliable, given that it is in condition C2, is inscrutable so far as
   you are concerned: it could be high, but it could also be low; you just
   don't know what to think about that probability. Would it be reasonable
   to accept the deliverances of this instrument? I should think not. You
   know that if it is in C1, it is reliable; but the probability that it
   is in C1 is (for you) either about .5 or inscrutable. Either way, the
   rational attitude is to withhold the belief that it is reliable,
   accepting neither it nor its denial. And then (given that you have no
   other source of information) the same goes for the output of the
   barometer: for any proposition in its output, the rational course for
   you would be agnosticism with respect to that proposition. The pointer
   points to thirty inches; still (if you have no other information), you
   will not on that account believe that the ambient atmospheric pressure
   is thirty inches. Of course you won't form a belief inconsistent with
   that one either: you will withhold the proposition.

   It is easy enough to make the application to agnosticism as between
   theism and ordinary naturalism. If I am such an agnostic, the
   probability of ordinary naturalism is either in the neighborhood of .5
   or inscrutable for me. Suppose the former: what attitude should I take
   toward R? Well, there is a fifty-fifty chance that my cognitive
   faculties were produced in a way with respect to which the probability
   of R is low or inscrutable; if so, however, I have a defeater for R,
   good reason to withhold. Suppose the latter: then I can't rule out any
   probability for ordinary naturalism. Because the probability of R on
   ordinary naturalism is also inscrutable, I can't rule out any
   probability for R; in particular, I can't rule out a low probability
   for R. But again, that gives me a defeater for my ordinary and
   instinctive belief that R. In either case, therefore, I acquire a
   defeater for R; unless I have or can come up with a defeater-defeater
   for this defeater, [292] I should be agnostic with respect to R. And if
   I am agnostic with respect to R, then just as Hume sees, the rational
   attitude is to be agnostic with respect to any of the deliverances of
   my cognitive faculties. I may not, in fact, be able to be agnostic with
   respect to them, but agnosticism is what rationality requires. Of
   course I also recognize that the beliefs involved in my coming to this
   agnosticism--such as the belief that the relevant probabilities are
   inscrutable--are themselves products of my cognitive faculties, and no
   better off than any other such products. Hence that multilayered
   reflexive Humean skepticism.

   By way of conclusion: the noetic effects of sin don't necessarily
   include failure to know anything; Calvin (if that is what, in fact, he
   thought) goes too far. Still, something in the same general
   neighborhood is true. If I reject theism in favor of ordinary
   naturalism, and also see that P(R/N) is low or inscrutable, then I will
   have a defeater for any belief I hold. If so, I will not, if forming
   beliefs rationally, hold any belief firmly enough to constitute
   knowledge. The same goes if I am merely agnostic as between theism and
   ordinary naturalism. And the same goes if I am agnostic about my origin
   and the origin of my cognitive faculties. So rejection of theistic
   belief doesn't automatically produce skepticism: many who don't believe
   in God know much. But that is only because they don't accurately think
   through the consequences of this rejection. Once they do, they will
   lose their knowledge; here, therefore, is another of those cases where,
   by learning more, one comes to know less.

   In this chapter, we have begun to explore the extended model by
   exploring the nature of sin and some of its cognitive consequences.
   These consequences extend further than one would ordinarily think;
   indeed, insofar as sin interferes with the sensus divinitatis and thus
   with our knowledge of God, it can easily lead to a noetic condition
   where what rationality demands is that complex, many-layered Humean
   skepticism. But here a nasty problem looms. According to the A/C model
   of chapter 6, knowledge requires proper function, and knowledge of God
   requires proper function of the sensus divinitatis. According to the
   extended model, however, this belief-producing process has been damaged
   because of sin, so that it no longer functions properly: how then (on
   this model) can we have knowledge of the existence and character of
   God? In the next chapter, we turn to the question how specifically
   Christian belief, not just generically theistic belief, can have
   warrant; in answering that question we will also see how the sensus
   divinitatis is repaired.

   [260] In this connection, consider the despised creationists, who
   believe that the world is only ten thousand years old: they are
   ignorant, pitifully ignorant about when God created the world. From the
   point of view of the model, this ignorance pales into utter
   insignificance compared with that of many of their cultured detractors,
   who foolishly believe that there is no God and thus (naturally enough)
   are ignorant of the vastly more important fact that the world was,
   indeed, created by God.

   [272] Of course this raises problems: if I have a defeater-defeater (a
   defeater for my defeater for R), then don't I thereby lose my defeater
   for R? Am I back where I was before I acquired the defeater for R? No;
   for my defeater-defeater is also a defeater for R. For explanation and

   reliable; any such attempt could proceed only by reliance on the very

   popular form of argument, I know of no proof that not-p; therefore,
   there is no proof that not-p; therefore, p.) In contrast to Huxley, I
   am here using the term epiphenomenalism' to denote any view according
   to which belief isn't involved in the causal chain leading to behavior,
   whether or not that view involves the dualism apparently part of
   Huxley's version.

   [284] Though it isn't easy to say just what a material object is (as
   Bas van Fraassen emphasizes in "Science, Materialism, and False
   Consciousness"; see above, footnote 274). For present purposes we need
   not try to address that project; we can simply narrow our focus to the
   claim that beliefs are neural events or processes of some sort.

   [285] A question just as pressing, of course, is How does this neuronal
   event have a content at all?' What is it that assigns to this neuronal
   event the proposition that Cartesian dualism is false, as opposed, for
   instance, to the proposition that it is true, or interesting, or
   obsolete, or vaguely obscene?

   [286] Thus Quine: "There is some encouragement in Darwin. If people's
   innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing
   that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to
   predominate through natural selection. Creatures inveterately wrong in
   their inductions have a pathetic but praiseworthy tendency to die
   before reproducing their kind" ("Natural Kinds," in Ontological
   Relativity and Other Essays [New York: Columbia University Press,
   1969], p. 126).

   [287] Objection: in any event, these tribespeople would be ascribing
   the right properties to the right things, so that their beliefs are, in
   some loose sense, accurate, even if strictly speaking false. Reply: by
   further gerrymandering, we can easily find schemes under which their
   beliefs would lead to adaptive behavior (thus being functionally
   equivalent with respect to behavior to the true scheme) but are not
   accurate even in this loose sense. There are schemes of this sort, in
   fact, in which the properties ascribed are logically incapable of
   exemplification. They think everything is a witch; perhaps, then, their
   analogue of property ascriptions involves ascribing certain sorts of
   witches (rather than properties). (One of these witches, for example,
   is such that, as we would put it, if a thing has it, then that thing is
   red.) Then their beliefs will not be accurate in the above sense and
   will indeed be necessarily false.

   [288] Meaning and Mental Representation (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1989),
   p. 130.

   [289] Of course these figures are the merest approximations; others
   might make the estimates somewhat differently; but they can be
   significantly altered without significantly altering the final result.
   For example, perhaps you think P(R/N&C) is higher, perhaps even 1; then
   (retaining the other assignments) P(R/N) will be in the neighborhood of
   .44. Or perhaps you reject the thought that P(-C/N) is more probable
   than P(C/N), thinking them about equal. Then (again, retaining the
   other assignments) P(R/N) will be in the neighborhood of .55.

   [290] And how could he have or get other information? Any such
   information would consist in beliefs that were a product of his
   cognitive faculties, but he has a defeater for the reliability of those
   faculties and hence for any belief produced by them.

   [291] See chapter 12 of WPF, and "Naturalism Defeated." The defeater
   can't be defeated because any defeater would arise from the very
   faculties or belief-producing processes in question. For example, the
   defeater might take the form of an argument, perhaps for the conclusion
   that those belief-producing processes are reliable after all. But then
   I would have the same defeater for each of the premises of this
   argument, as well as for my belief that if the premises are true, then
   so is the conclusion.

   [292] And again (see footnote 291), how could I? Any such
   defeater-defeater would be subject to the very defeater defeating R in
   the first place.

The Extended Aquinas/Calvin Model: Revealed to Our Minds

   The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's
   children.

   Romans 8:16

   In chapter 6, I proposed a model--the Aquinas/Calvin (A/C)
   model--according to which belief in God can have the three varieties of
   positive epistemic status with which we have been concerned:
   justification, rationality (in both its external and internal guises),
   and warrant. What about specifically Christian belief, belief, not just
   in God, but in trinity, incarnation, Christ's resurrection, atonement,
   forgiveness of sins, salvation, regeneration, eternal life? The main
   business of this chapter is to extend the A/C model to cover these
   beliefs, to show how they, too, can have those varieties of positive
   epistemic status. In chapter 7, I gave an initial statement of this
   extended model. One element of the extended A/C model has to do with
   sin and its epistemic consequences; most of chapter 7 was devoted to a
   development of this feature of the model.

   In this chapter, I turn to the central elements of the model: how can
   we think of the full panoply of Christian belief in all its
   particularity as enjoying justification, rationality in both its
   internal and external varieties, and warrant? How can we think of these
   beliefs--some of which, as David Hume loved to point out, go entirely
   contrary to ordinary human experience--as reasonable or rational, let
   alone warranted, let alone having warrant sufficient for knowledge? The
   materials for an answer lie close at hand. Actually, the materials have
   lain close at hand for several centuries--certainly since the
   publication of Jonathan Edwards's Religious Affections [293] and John
   Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion. [294] As a matter of
   fact, they have lain close at hand for much longer than that: much of
   what Calvin says can be usefully seen as development of remarks of
   Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura. Indeed, these materials go much further
   back yet, all the way back to the New Testament, in particular, the
   Gospel of John and the epistles of Paul.

   In this chapter, I shall develop those materials and propose a
   model--the extended A/C model--for warranted Christian belief: a model
   in which full-blooded Christian belief in all its particularity is
   justified, rational, and warranted. [295] I shall argue further that
   Christian belief can be justified, rational, and warranted not just for
   ignorant fundamentalists or benighted medievals but for informed and
   educated twenty-first-century Christians who are entirely aware of all
   the artillery that has been rolled up against Christian belief since
   the Enlightenment. I shall argue that if Christian belief is true, then
   it is rational and warranted for most of those who accept it. I shall
   therefore be refuting the widespread idea that Christian belief is
   lacking in positive epistemic status, even if it happens, somehow, to
   be true. If I am right, the atheologian can't sensibly take the
   attitude, "I don't know whether Christian belief is true or not (who
   could know a thing like that?); still I do know that it isn't rational
   (or warranted, or justified, or rationally justified, or intellectually
   respectable or . . . )." For the sake of definiteness I shall be
   following one particular and traditional way of thinking about our
   knowledge of Christian truth. I believe that this account or something
   similar is, in fact, rather close to the sober truth; other models
   fitting other traditions can easily be constructed. My extended model
   will have one further feature: it will complete and deepen the previous
   account (chapter 6) of our knowledge of God. The central themes of this
   extended model are the Bible, the internal testimony of the Holy
   Spirit, and faith. I'll begin with a quick overview of the essential
   elements of the extended model.

   According to the model (as we saw in chapter 7), we human beings were
   created in the image of God: we were created both with appropriate
   affections and with knowledge of God and his greatness and glory.
   Because of the greatest calamity to befall the human race, however, we
   fell into sin, a ruinous condition from which we require rescue and
   redemption. God proposed and instituted a plan of salvation: the life,
   atoning suffering and death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the
   incarnate second person of the trinity. The result for us is the
   possibility of salvation from sin and renewed relationship with God.
   Now (and here we come to the specifically epistemological extension of
   the model) God needed a way to inform us--us human beings of many
   different times and places--of the scheme of salvation he has
   graciously made available. [296] No doubt he could have done this in
   many different ways; in fact he chose to do so by way of a three-tiered
   cognitive process. First, he arranged for the production of Scripture,
   the Bible, a library of books or writings each of which has a human
   author, but each of which is also specially inspired by God in such a
   way that he himself is its principal author. Thus, the whole library
   has a single principal author: God himself. In this library, he
   proposes much for our belief and action, but there is a central theme
   and focus (and for this reason this collection of books is itself a
   book): the gospel, the stunning good news of the way of salvation God
   has graciously offered. [297] Correlative with Scripture and necessary
   to its properly serving its purpose is the second element of this
   three-tiered cognitive process: the presence and action of the Holy
   Spirit promised by Christ himself before his death and resurrection,
   [298] and invoked and celebrated in the epistles of the apostle Paul.
   [299] By virtue of the work of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of those
   to whom faith is given, the ravages of sin (including the cognitive
   damage) are repaired, gradually or suddenly, to a greater or lesser
   extent. Furthermore, it is by virtue of the activity of the Holy Spirit
   that Christians come to grasp, believe, accept, endorse, and rejoice in
   the truth of the great things of the gospel. It is thus by virtue of
   this activity that the Christian believes that "in Christ, God was
   reconciling the world to himself, not counting men's sins against them"
   (2 Corinthians 5:19).

   According to John Calvin, the principal work of the Holy Spirit is the
   production (in the hearts of Christian believers) of the third element
   of the process, faith. Like the regeneration of which it is a part,
   faith is a gift; it is given to anyone who is willing to accept it.
   Faith, says Calvin, is "a firm and certain knowledge of God's
   benevolence towards us, founded upon the truth of the freely given
   promise in Christ, both revealed to our minds and sealed upon our
   hearts through the Holy Spirit" (Institutes III, ii, 7, p. 551). Faith
   therefore involves an explicitly cognitive element; it is, says Calvin,
   knowledge--knowledge of the availability of redemption and salvation
   through the person and work of Jesus Christ--and it is revealed to our
   minds. To have faith, therefore, is to know and hence believe something
   or other. But (as we shall see in chapter 9) faith also involves the
   will: it is "sealed upon our hearts." By virtue of this sealing, the
   believer not only knows about the scheme of salvation God has prepared
   (according to the book of James [2:19], the devils also know about
   that, and they shudder) but is also heartily grateful to the Lord for
   it, and loves him on this account. Sealing, furthermore, also involves
   the executive function of the will: believers accept the proffered gift
   and commit themselves to the Lord, to conforming their lives to his
   will, to living lives of gratitude. [300]

   But isn't all this just endorsing a wholly outmoded and discredited
   fundamentalism, that condition than which, according to many academics,
   none lesser can be conceived? I fully realize that the dreaded f-word
   will be trotted out to stigmatize any model of this kind. Before
   responding, however, we must first look into the use of this term
   fundamentalist'. On the most common contemporary academic use of the
   term, it is a term of abuse or disapprobation, rather like son of a
   bitch', more exactly sonovabitch', or perhaps still more exactly (at
   least according to those authorities who look to the Old West as
   normative on matters of pronunciation) sumbitch'. When the term is used
   in this way, no definition of it is ordinarily given. (If you called
   someone a sumbitch, would you feel obliged first to define the term?)
   Still, there is a bit more to the meaning of fundamentalist' (in this
   widely current use): it isn't simply a term of abuse. In addition to
   its emotive force, it does have some cognitive content, and ordinarily
   denotes relatively conservative theological views. That makes it more
   like stupid sumbitch' (or maybe fascist sumbitch'?) than sumbitch'
   simpliciter. It isn't exactly like that term either, however, because
   its cognitive content can expand and contract on demand; its content
   seems to depend on who is using it. In the mouths of certain liberal
   theologians, for example, it tends to denote any who accept traditional
   Christianity, including Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Barth;
   in the mouths of devout secularists like Richard Dawkins or Daniel
   Dennett, it tends to denote anyone who believes there is such a person
   as God. The explanation is that the term has a certain indexical
   element: its cognitive content is given by the phrase considerably to
   the right, theologically speaking, of me and my enlightened friends.'
   The full meaning of the term, therefore (in this use), can be given by
   something like stupid sumbitch whose theological opinions are
   considerably to the right of mine'.

   It is therefore hard to take seriously the charge that the views I'm
   suggesting are fundamentalist; more exactly, it is hard to take it
   seriously as a charge. The alleged charge means only that these views
   are rather more conservative than those of the objector, together with
   the expression of a certain distaste for the views or those who hold
   them. But how is that an objection to anything, and why should it
   warrant the contempt and contumely that goes with the term? An argument
   of some kind against those conservative views would be of interest, but
   merely pointing out that they differ from the objector's (even with the
   addition of that abusive emotive force) is not.

   How does this model, with its excursion into theology, provide an
   answer to an epistemological question? How can it be a model for a way
   in which Christian belief has or could have justification, rationality,
   warrant? The answer is simplicity itself. These beliefs do not come to
   the Christian just by way of memory, perception, reason, testimony, the
   sensus divinitatis, or any other of the cognitive faculties with which
   we human beings were originally created; they come instead by way of
   the work of the Holy Spirit, who gets us to accept, causes us to
   believe, these great truths of the gospel. These beliefs don't come
   just by way of the normal operation of our natural faculties; they are
   a supernatural gift. Still, the Christian who has received this gift of
   faith will of course be justified (in the basic sense of the term) in
   believing as he does; there will be nothing contrary to epistemic or
   other duty in so believing (indeed, once he has accepted the gift, it
   may not be within his power to withhold belief).

   Given the model, however, the beliefs in question will typically (or at
   least often) have the other kinds of positive epistemic status we have
   been considering as well. First, they will be internally rational:
   [301] they will be an appropriate doxastic response to what is given to
   the believer by way of her previous belief and current experience. That
   is, the believer's response is such that a properly functioning person
   with the same current experience and antecedent beliefs could form the
   same or similar beliefs, without compromising proper function. But the
   beliefs in question will typically also have external rationality.
   There need be no cognitive malfunction downstream from experience (see
   above, p. 110), in believers, but there need be none upstream either:
   all of their cognitive faculties can be functioning properly. Finally,
   on the model, these beliefs will also have warrant for believers: they
   will be produced in them by a belief-producing process [302] that is
   functioning properly in an appropriate cognitive environment (the one
   for which they were designed), according to a design plan successfully
   aimed at the production of true beliefs.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Faith

   Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
   not seen.

   Hebrews 11:1

   So much for the initial account of the model; I turn now to a more
   detailed development of some of its aspects, beginning with faith. The
   first thing to note is that this term, like nearly any philosophically
   useful term, is used variously, in a number of different but
   analogically connected senses. According to Mark Twain, faith is
   "believing what you know ain't true"; this only slightly exaggerates a
   common use of the term to denote a belief that lacks warrant and,
   indeed, is unlikely with respect to what does have warrant for the
   believer. A mother who believes, in the teeth of the evidence, that her
   son is in fact still alive will be said to have faith that he is still
   alive. It is in connection with this use that one thinks of a leap of
   faith', which is rather like a leap in the dark. A second way the term
   is used is to denote a vague and generalized trust that has no specific
   object, a confidence that things will go right, a sort of Bultmannian
   sitting loose with respect to the future, trusting that one can deal
   with whatever happens. To have faith in this sense is to "accept the
   universe," as the nineteenth-century transcendentalist Margaret Fuller
   was said to have declared she did. [303]

   In setting out the model, however, I am using the term in a different
   sense from any of those. My sense will be much closer to that which the
   Heidelberg Catechism (following John Calvin) ascribes to true faith':

   True faith is not only a knowledge and conviction that everything God
   reveals in his word is true; it is also a deep-rooted assurance,
   created in me by the Holy Spirit through the gospel, that, out of sheer
   grace earned for us by Christ, not only others, but I too, have had my
   sins forgiven, have been made forever right with God, and have been
   granted salvation. (Q. 21)

   We can think of this account as making more explicit the content of the
   definition of faith offered by Calvin in the Institutes (above, p.
   244). The first thing to see is that faith, so taken, is a cognitive
   activity. It isn't merely a cognitive activity; it also involves the
   will, both the affections and the executive function. (It is a
   knowledge sealed upon our hearts, as well as revealed to our minds.)
   Still, even if faith is more than cognitive, it is also and at least a
   cognitive activity. It is a matter of believing ("knowledge," Calvin
   says) something or other. Christians, on this account, don't merely
   find their identity in the Christian story, or live in it or out of it;
   [304] they believe it, take the story to be the sober truth.

   Now what one believes are propositions. To have faith, therefore, is
   (at least) to believe some propositions. Which ones? Not, for example,
   that the world is the sort of place in which human beings can flourish,
   or even or primarily that there is such a person as God. [305] Indeed,
   on this model it isn't really by faith that one knows that there is
   such a person as God. Faith is instead, says Calvin, "firm and certain
   knowledge of God's benevolence towards us"; that is, a firm and certain
   knowledge that "not only others, but I too, have had my sins forgiven,
   have been made forever right with God, and have been granted
   salvation"; that is, a firm and certain knowledge of God's plan whereby
   we fallen humans can attain shalom, flourishing, well-being, happiness,
   felicity, salvation, all of which are essentially a matter of being
   rightly related to God. [306] So the propositional object of faith is
   the whole magnificent scheme of salvation God has arranged. To have
   faith is to know that and how God has made it possible for us human
   beings to escape the ravages of sin and be restored to a right
   relationship with him; it is therefore a knowledge of the main lines of
   the Christian gospel. [307] The content of faith is just the central
   teachings of the gospel; [308] it is contained in the intersection of
   the great Christian creeds.

   What is at issue, in faith, furthermore, is not just knowing that there
   is such a scheme (as we saw above, the devils believe that, and they
   shudder), but also and most important, that this scheme applies to and
   is available to me. [309] So what I know, in faith, is the main lines
   of specifically Christian teaching--together, we might say, with its
   universal instantiation with respect to me. Christ died for my sins,
   thus making it possible for me to be reconciled with God. Faith is
   initially and fundamentally practical; it is a knowledge of the good
   news and of its application to me, and of what I must do to receive the
   benefits it proclaims. Still, faith itself is a matter of belief rather
   than action; it is believing something rather than doing something.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [303] To which Thomas Carlyle retorted, "Gad! She'd better!" Mark
   Twain, by contrast, claimed he hadn't heard it had been offered to her.

   [304] In this way, the model (apparently) differs from the postmodern
   Yale theology of Hans Frei (The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative [1974]
   and The Identity of Jesus Christ [1975]) and George Lindbeck (The
   Nature of Doctrine: Religion and Theology in a Postliberal Age [1984]),
   which emphasizes the role of the Bible in the Christian life but is a
   bit coy as to whether its apparent teachings--creation, sin,
   incarnation, atonement, Christ's resurrection--are to be taken as
   actually true. (See, for example, pp. 143-45 of The Identity of Jesus
   Christ.) This standoffishness about truth is perhaps the postliberal'
   element in Yale theology; according to the present model, however, it
   is also unnecessary. The model is designed to show that
   straightforward, downright, out-and-out belief in the great things of
   the gospel can have the epistemic virtues we are considering.

   [305] "In understanding faith," says Calvin, "it is not merely a
   question of knowing that God exists . . . but also--and this
   especially--of knowing what is his will toward us. For it is not so
   much our concern to know who he is in himself, as what he wills to be
   toward us" (549).

   [306] I take it this is a definition or description of faith by way of
   presenting a paradigm of it: fully formed and well-developed faith will
   be like this. Thus a person who (for example) believes these things,
   but without the firmness sufficient for knowledge of them, can still be
   said to have faith.

   [307] And hence not everything a typical Christian believes (as a
   Christian) will be, strictly speaking, part of faith. For example, she
   may believe that Jesus Christ performed miracles, or that God is
   omniscient, or that the Bible is a specially inspired word from the
   Lord, or that faith naturally issues in good works; none of these is,
   as such, part of the content of faith. (This is not in any way to
   downgrade the importance of these things, and certainly the content of
   faith may enter into her reasons for believing them.) And in thus
   specifying the content of faith, I am not, of course, trying to specify
   those beliefs which are such that accepting them is necessary for being
   a real Christian.

   [308] On the present model, therefore, faith is a bit narrower than in
   the account of true faith from the Heidelberg Catechism (above, p.
   247), which includes a "conviction that everything God reveals in his
   word is true." God presumably reveals more, in his word, than the great
   truths of the gospel. For example, there is Jesus' turning water into
   wine, healing the demoniac, and raising Lazarus from the dead; these
   are not among the central truths of the gospel, although they are
   related to and illustrative of those truths.

   [309] See Calvin, III, ii, 16, p. 561: "Here, indeed, is the chief
   hinge on which faith turns: that we do not regard the promises of mercy
   that God offers as true only outside ourselves, but not at all in us;
   rather that we make them ours by inwardly embracing them." As we'll see
   in the next chapter, there is more that distinguishes what the devils
   know from what the person of faith knows: she but not they also knows
   the beauty, loveliness, splendor of this plan of salvation; still
   further, she loves it, gives it her hearty approval, is grateful for
   it, and commits herself to love and trust the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II. How Does Faith Work?

   The principal answer is that faith is a work--the main work, according
   to Calvin--of the Holy Spirit; it is produced in us by the Holy Spirit.
   The suggestion that belief in the "great things of the gospel"
   (Jonathan Edwards's phrase) is a result of some special work of the
   Holy Spirit is often thought of as especially the teaching of such
   Calvinist thinkers as Edwards and John Calvin himself. It is, indeed,
   central to their teaching, and here the model follows them. On this
   point as on so many others, however, Calvin, despite his pugnacious
   noise about the pestilential papists and their colossal offenses, may
   be seen as following out and developing a line of thought already to be
   found in Thomas Aquinas. "The believer," says Aquinas, "has sufficient
   motive for believing, for he is moved by the authority of divine
   teaching confirmed by miracles and, what is more, by the inward
   instigation of the divine invitation." [310] Here we have
   (embryonically, at any rate) the same trio of processes: there is
   belief, there is the divine teaching (as given in Scripture) which is
   the object of that belief, and there is also special divine activity in
   the production of the belief ("the inward instigation of the divine
   invitation"). [311]

   What is really involved, in a believer's coming to accept the great
   things of the gospel, therefore, are three things: Scripture (the
   divine teaching), the internal invitation or instigation of the Holy
   Spirit, and faith, the human belief that results. What sort of
   phenomenology is involved in this epistemic process: what does it seem
   like from the inside? In the model, the beliefs constituting faith are
   typically taken as basic; that is, they are not accepted by way of
   argument from other propositions or on the evidential basis of other
   propositions. Of course they could be accepted on the basis of other
   propositions, and perhaps in some cases are. A believer could reason as
   follows: I have strong historical and archaeological evidence for the
   reliability of the Bible (or the church, or my parents, or some other
   authority); the Bible teaches the great things of the gospel; so
   probably these things are true. A believer could reason in this way,
   and perhaps some believers do in fact reason this way. But in the model
   it goes differently.

   We read Scripture, or something presenting scriptural teaching, or hear
   the gospel preached, or are told of it by parents, or encounter a
   scriptural teaching as the conclusion of an argument (or conceivably
   even as an object of ridicule), or in some other way encounter a
   proclamation of the Word. What is said simply seems right; it seems
   compelling; one finds oneself saying, "Yes, that's right, that's the
   truth of the matter; this is indeed the word of the Lord." I read, "God
   was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself"; I come to think:
   "Right; that's true; God really was in Christ, reconciling the world to
   himself!" And I may also think something a bit different, something
   about that proposition: that it is a divine teaching or revelation,
   that in Calvin's words it is "from God." What one hears or reads seems
   clearly and obviously true and (at any rate in paradigm cases) seems
   also to be something the Lord is intending to teach. (As Calvin says,
   "the Spirit . . . is the only fit corrector and approver of doctrine,
   who seals it on our hearts, so that we may certainly know that God
   speaks. For while faith ought to look to God, he alone can be a witness
   to himself, so as to convince our hearts that what our ears receive has
   come from him.") So faith may have the phenomenology that goes with
   suddenly seeing something to be true: "Right! Now I see that this is
   indeed true and what the Lord is teaching!" Or perhaps the conviction
   arises slowly, and only after long and hard study, thought, discussion,
   prayer. Or perhaps it is a matter of a belief's having been there all
   along (from childhood, perhaps), but now being transformed, renewed,
   intensified, made vivid and alive. This process can go on in a thousand
   ways; in each case there is presentation or proposal of central
   Christian teaching and, by way of response, the phenomenon of being
   convinced, coming to see, forming of a conviction. There is the reading
   or hearing, and then there is the belief or conviction that what one
   reads or hears is true and a teaching of the Lord.

   According to the model, this conviction comes by way of the activity of
   the Holy Spirit. Calvin speaks here of the internal testimony' and
   (more often) witness' of the Holy Spirit; Aquinas, of the divine
   instigation' and invitation'. On the model, there is both Scripture and
   the divine activity leading to human belief. God himself (on the model)
   is the principal author of Scripture. Scripture is most importantly a
   message, a communication from God to humankind; Scripture is a word
   from the Lord. [312] But then this just is a special case of the
   pervasive process of testimony, by which, as a matter of fact, we learn
   most of what we know. [313] From this point of view, Scripture is as
   much a matter of testimony as is a letter you receive from a friend.
   What is proposed for our belief in Scripture, therefore, just is
   testimony--divine testimony. So the term testimony' is appropriate
   here. However, there is also the special work of the Holy Spirit in
   getting us to believe, in enabling us to see the truth of what is
   proposed. Here Aquinas's terms invitation' and instigation' are more
   appropriate. I shall therefore use the term inward instigation of the
   Holy Spirit' to denote this activity of the Holy Spirit, and (where no
   confusion threatens) the term faith' to denote both the whole
   tripartite process (Scripture, the inward instigation of the Holy
   Spirit, belief in the great things of the gospel) and the last member
   of that trio.

   So Scripture is, indeed, testimony, even if it is testimony of a very
   special kind. First, the principal testifier is God. It also differs
   from ordinary testimony in that in this case, unlike most others, there
   is both a principal testifier and subordinate testifiers: the human
   authors. [314] There is still another difference: it is the instigation
   of the Holy Spirit, on this model, that gets us to see and believe that
   the propositions proposed for our beliefs in Scripture really are a
   word from the Lord. This case also differs from the usual run of
   testimony, then, in that the Holy Spirit not only writes the letter
   (appropriately inspires the human authors) [315] but also does
   something special to enable you to believe and appropriate its
   contents. So this testimony is not the usual run of testimony; it is
   testimony nonetheless. According to the model, therefore, faith is
   belief in the great things of the gospel that results from the internal
   instigation of the Holy Spirit.

   [310] Summa Theologiae II-II, q.2, a.9, reply ob. 3 (my emphasis).
   According to Aquinas, therefore, faith is produced in human beings by
   God's action; "for since in assenting to the things of faith a person
   is raised above his own nature, he has this assent from a supernatural
   source influencing him; this source is God. The assent of faith, which
   is its principal act, therefore, has as its cause God, moving us
   inwardly through grace" (ST II-II, q.6, a.1, respondeo).

   [311] Calvin explicitly identifies the third person of the trinity as
   the divine actor in question, and Aquinas does not; this is not a
   difference of any moment. According to Aquinas, some of the items
   proposed by God for our belief can also be the objects of scientia;
   when they are, they are not accepted by faith, for it isn't possible,
   he thinks, to have both scientia and faith with respect to the same
   proposition. Because scientia is often translated as knowledge', this
   makes it look as if Calvin contradicts Aquinas when he says that faith
   is a sure and certain knowledge of God's benevolence toward us.
   Appearances are deceiving, however, and there is no contradiction here.
   Scientia for Aquinas is a very special relation between a person and a
   proposition; it is one that holds when the person sees that the
   proposition follows from first principles she sees to be true. Thus
   scientia' is much narrower than our term knowledge'. It is also
   narrower than Calvin's term cognitio', which is much closer to our
   contemporary use of knowledge'. When Calvin says that faith is a sure
   and certain knowledge of God's benevolence to us, he isn't ascribing to
   faith a status Aquinas denies it. On this topic, see Arvin Vos,
   Aquinas, Calvin & Contemporary Protestant Thought (Grand Rapids: W. B.
   Eerdmans, 1985), pp. 18-20.

   [312] On this model (pace most twentieth century Christian
   theologians), it is not the case that revelation occurs just by way of
   events, which must then be properly interpreted. No doubt this does
   indeed happen, but much of Scripture is centrally a matter of God's
   speaking, of his telling us things we need to know, of his
   communicating propositions to us. See Nicholas Wolterstorff's Divine
   Discourse (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995) for a specific
   account of precisely how it could be that the Bible constitutes divine
   speech and a divine communication to us. For the sake of definiteness,
   in what follows I shall incorporate in the model the proposition that
   something like Wolterstorff's account is in fact correct. (Of course
   other accounts could also serve in the model.)

   [313] See Warrant and Proper Function (hereafter WPF), pp. 77ff.

   [314] Most others: it sometimes happens with human testimony that one
   person is deputized to speak for another, and in those cases there is
   the same principal-subordinate structure. See Wolterstorff, Divine
   Discourse, pp. 38ff.

   [315] According to Acts 28:25, Paul says, "The Holy Spirit spoke the
   truth to your forefathers when he said through Isaiah the prophet: Go
   to this people and say, You will ever . . . '?" (Isaiah 6:9, 10).

  III. Faith and Positive Epistemic Status
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Justification

   I'm proposing this model as a model of Christian belief's having the
   sorts of epistemic virtues or positive epistemic status with which
   we've been concerned: justification, rationality of both the internal
   and the external variety, and warrant. Justification needn't detain us
   for long. There should be little doubt that Christian belief can be and
   probably is (deontologically) justified, and justified even for one
   well acquainted with Enlightenment and postmodern demurrers. If your
   belief is a result of the inward instigation of the Holy Spirit, it may
   seem obviously true, even after reflection on the various sorts of
   objections that have been offered. Clearly, one is then violating no
   intellectual obligations in accepting it. No doubt there are
   intellectual obligations and duties in the neighborhood; when you note
   that others disagree with you, for example, perhaps there is a duty to
   pay attention to them and to their objections, a duty to think again,
   reflect more deeply, consult others, look for and consider other
   possible defeaters. If you have done these things and still find the
   belief utterly compelling, however, you are not violating duty or
   obligation--especially if it seems to you, after reflection, that the
   teaching in question comes from God himself.

   Of course some writers charge that if you have faith (as on the model)
   and think your belief comes from God, then you are arrogant (and hence
   unjustified). Among the more vivid is the theologian John Macquarrie:

   The Calvinist believes that he himself, as one of the elect, has been
   rescued from this sea of error and that his mind has been enlightened
   by the Holy Spirit. However much he may insist that this is God's doing
   and not his own, his claim is nevertheless one of the most arrogant
   that has ever been made. It is this kind of thing that has rightly
   earned for theology the contempt of serious men. [316]

   A Calvinist's first impulse might be to retort by asking whom or what
   Macquarrie credits with furnishing him with the truth, when he finds
   himself disagreeing with the bulk of humankind on religious matters
   (as, of course, he does): his own cognitive prowess and native
   sagacity? his own self-developed penetration and perspicacity? And is
   that attribution less arrogant than to attribute enlightenment to the
   work of the Holy Spirit? Rather than pursue this unprofitable retort,
   however, let's think a bit more soberly about the charge. First, note
   that the accusation initially seems to be brought, not necessarily
   against someone who actually has been enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
   but against someone who believes that she has. No doubt it was the Holy
   Spirit who was at work in the hearts of the faithful and faith-filled
   patriarchs and others mentioned in Hebrews 11; but presumably they
   didn't know about the Holy Spirit and didn't have any views to the
   effect that their beliefs were due to the activity of the Holy Spirit.
   So perhaps Macquarrie's idea is that it's all right to know something
   others don't, but it's not all right to believe that you do,
   attributing your knowledge to the Holy Spirit. His criticism is
   directed, not necessarily toward a person who accepts Christian
   teaching (even if in fact such a person has, as in the model, been
   enlightened by the Holy Spirit), but toward someone who accepts the bit
   of Reformed theology according to which the Holy Spirit illuminates
   only some of us, and thinks that she is one of those thus illuminated.
   And the criticism is that such a person has culpably come to think more
   highly of herself than she ought.

   We'll look further into this charge of arrogance in chapter 13; for
   now, let me just ask this. Suppose you believe that you have been
   favored by the Lord in a way in which some others haven't been: does it
   really follow that you are arrogant? You recognize that in some respect
   you are better off than someone else: perhaps you have a happy
   marriage, or your children turn out well, or you are enjoying glowing
   good health while a good friend is succumbing to melanoma. And suppose
   you attribute at least part of the difference to God's activity. Are
   you then automatically arrogant? Isn't it rather that you would be
   arrogant if, instead, you thought the difference wasn't attributable to
   God but was a manifestation, say, of personal strength, or virtue, or
   wisdom on your part? Suppose you think you know something someone else
   doesn't--perhaps Macquarrie thinks that he, as opposed to his Calvinist
   friends, knows that the Calvinist view of faith is mistaken. Is he
   thereby arrogant? If not, is it that he fails to be arrogant because he
   does not attribute his good fortune to God, perhaps attributing it
   instead to his own native good sense? That hardly seem promising.

   The fact is there isn't any arrogance involved as such in recognizing
   that God has given you something he hasn't (or hasn't yet) given
   everyone. Human beings are, indeed, tempted to arrogance, and often
   succumb; still, one isn't arrogant just by virtue of recognizing that
   God has given you a good thing he hasn't (yet, anyway) given everyone
   else. (You might be as puzzled as anyone else that it is you who are
   the recipient of the gift.) Arrogance would be involved, no doubt, if
   you thought of this gift as your right, so that God would be unjust if
   he didn't give it to you. But you're not culpable if you believe your
   faith is a gift from the Lord and note that not everyone has as yet
   received this gift. Indeed, the right attitude here, far from a
   crestfallen admission that you have been arrogant in thus believing, is
   gratitude and thanksgiving for this wonderfully great gift. [317]
   Hearing of Jesus Christ's resurrection, the apostle Thomas declared,
   "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the
   nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it" (John
   20:25). Later, Jesus shows himself to Thomas, inviting him to look at
   the nail marks, and put his hand into his side. Thomas then
   believes--upon which Jesus says to him, "Because you have seen me, you
   have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have
   believed" (John 20:29). No doubt there is more than one point here; a
   central point, surely, is that those who have been given faith are
   indeed blessed. Their faith is a gift requiring joyful thanksgiving,
   not a moral lapse requiring shamefaced repentance. One who has faith,
   therefore, is (or may very well be) justified according to the model.
   And even apart from the model: how could you fail to be justified,
   within your epistemic rights, in believing what seems to you, after
   reflection and investigation, to be no more than the truth?

   (1989), pp. 171-78.
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Internal Rationality

   Internal rationality (see above, pp. 110ff.) has a dual aspect: on the
   one hand, it requires proper function in the part of the cognitive
   system that lies "downstream from experience"; on the other, it
   requires more generally that you have done your best or anyway well
   enough with respect to the formation of the belief in question. [318]
   You have considered how it fits in with your other beliefs, engaged in
   the requisite seeking for defeaters, considered the objections that you
   have encountered, compared notes with the right people, and so on.
   Clearly, on the model (and even apart from the model), someone who
   accepts the Christian beliefs in question can easily meet these
   conditions. Suppose my experience is of the sort that goes with the
   testimony of the Holy Spirit (and in chapter 9 we'll see more of what
   that experience involves), so that the great things of the gospel seem
   powerfully plausible and compelling to me: then (given that I have no
   undefeated defeaters for these propositions) there will be nothing
   dysfunctional or contrary to proper function in accepting the beliefs
   in question. Indeed, given those experiences, it would be dysfunctional
   not to form them. And suppose I carefully consider the objections
   people raise, consult with others, ask how the beliefs in question
   match the rest of my beliefs, and all the rest. Then clearly I will
   have done my part with respect to the formation of these beliefs. On
   the testimonial model, therefore, Christian belief enjoys both
   justification and internal rationality. [319]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [318] This requirement of internal rationality may seem to overlap with
   justification. It does, if in fact there are intellectual duties
   prescribing the behavior required by rationality. Even if there are no
   such duties, however, internal rationality still requires the behavior
   in question.

   [319] But aren't there many different theories of (say) incarnation and
   atonement? Don't Christians disagree about this? So which of the many
   views of Incarnation and Atonement are in fact rational? The question
   is misplaced. There are many different theories as to how it is that
   people are able to think; it is still plain to many of us that some
   people do (sometimes) think. There are many theories about what numbers
   are; it is still plain that 7 + 5 = 12. We can quite properly believe
   in the Atonement even if we don't see exactly how it is supposed to go
   and don't embrace any of the theories; it can also be that we are
   rational in believing in the Atonement but not in accepting some
   specific theory of it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    C. External Rationality and Warrant: Faith Is Knowledge

   The part of Calvin's definition of faith that is especially striking to
   contemporary ears is that on his account faith is a really special case
   of knowledge ("a sure and certain knowledge"; compare also the account
   of true faith in the Heidelberg Catechism, above, p. 247). Faith is not
   to be contrasted with knowledge: faith (at least in paradigmatic
   instances) is knowledge, knowledge of a certain special kind. It is
   special in at least two ways. First, in its object: what is allegedly
   known is (if true) of stunning significance, certainly the most
   important thing a person could possibly know. But it is also unusual in
   the way in which that content is known; it is known by way of an
   extraordinary cognitive process or belief-producing mechanism.
   Christian belief is "revealed to our minds" by way of the Holy Spirit's
   inducing, in us, belief in the central message of Scripture. The
   belief-producing process is dual, involving both the divinely inspired
   Scripture (perhaps directly, or perhaps at the head of a testimonial
   chain) and the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit. Both involve
   the special activity of God.

   If faith is such an extraordinary way of holding belief, why call it
   knowledge' at all? What about it makes it a case of knowledge? Here we
   must look a bit more deeply into the model. The believer encounters the
   great truths of the gospel; by virtue of the activity of the Holy
   Spirit, she comes to see that these things are indeed true. And the
   first thing to see is that, on this model, faith is a belief-producing
   process or activity, like perception or memory. It is a cognitive
   device, a means by which belief, and belief on a certain specific set
   of topics, is regularly produced in regular ways. [320] In this it
   resembles memory, perception, reason, sympathy, induction, and other
   more standard belief-producing processes. It differs from them in that
   it also involves the direct action of the Holy Spirit, so that the
   immediate cause of belief is not to be found just in her natural
   epistemic equipment. There is the special and supernatural activity of
   the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, faith is a belief-producing process. Now
   as we saw in chapter 7, what is required for knowledge is that a belief
   be produced by cognitive faculties or processes that are working
   properly, in an appropriate epistemic environment (both maxi and mini)
   according to a design plan that is aimed at truth, and is furthermore
   successfully aimed at truth. But according to this model, what one
   believes by faith (the beliefs that constitute faith) meets these four
   conditions.

   First, when these beliefs are accepted by faith and result from the
   internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, they are produced by cognitive
   processes working properly; [321] they are not produced by way of some
   cognitive malfunction. Faith, the whole process that produces them, is
   specifically designed by God himself to produce this very effect--just
   as vision, say, is designed by God to produce a certain kind of
   perceptual beliefs. When it does produce this effect, therefore, it is
   working properly; thus the beliefs in question satisfy the external
   rationality condition, which is also the first condition of warrant.
   Second, according to the model, the maxienvironment in which we find
   ourselves, including the cognitive contamination produced by sin, is
   precisely the cognitive environment for which this process is designed.
   The typical minienvironment is also favorable. Third, the process is
   designed to produce true beliefs; [322] and fourth, the beliefs it
   produces--belief in the great things of the gospel--are in fact true;
   faith is a reliable belief-producing process, so that the process in
   question is successfully aimed at the production of true beliefs.

   Reliability, of course, demands more than just that these beliefs be
   true. A thermometer stuck on 72?F is not reliable even if it is
   somewhere--San Diego, say--where it is always 72?F. What it would do if
   things were relevantly different (what it would do in appropriately
   nearby possible worlds) is also relevant; a process or instrument is
   reliable only if it would produce a true output under different
   conditions. On the current model, this condition is also met. The Holy
   Spirit doesn't work just by accident or at random, and there are a
   thousand ways in which, even if things had been different, the Holy
   Spirit would have produced the results actually produced. Clearly, any
   circumstances in which it produces this output are circumstances in
   which this output is true; hence, under those circumstances, it would
   have produced a true output. Under what conditions would the Holy
   Spirit have failed, with respect to a given person, to do this work of
   enabling one to see the truth of the great things of the gospel? The
   model need take no stand on this issue, but it is part of much
   traditional Christian teaching to hold that a necessary condition of my
   receiving the gift of faith is my acquiescing, being willing to accept
   the gift, being prepared to receive it. There is a contribution to this
   process that I myself must make, a contribution that I can withhold.

   According to this model, faith as a belief-producing mechanism involves
   a supernatural element; it involves God's doing something specially and
   directly and quite out of the ordinary. Does that compromise the claim
   that the deliverances of faith constitute knowledge? I can't see how.
   There was no suggestion in the original account that cognitive
   mechanisms must all be natural, whatever precisely that comes to. Must
   the account be revised because faith doesn't go just by natural laws or
   regularities, working instead by way of the free cooperation of a
   person--God himself--whose speaking in Scripture is, of course, free,
   as is the action of the Holy Spirit in revealing and sealing the great
   truths of the gospel? Again, I can't see why. The same goes for the
   mechanism Thomas Reid calls testimony', a mechanism whereby we learn
   from others; this mechanism too (often) works by way of free human
   agency. (When you ask me how old I am, I can [freely] tell you, or in a
   minor fit of pique, freely refuse.)

   Why, then, does faith constitute knowledge? Because what one believes
   by faith satisfies the conditions that are jointly sufficient and
   severally necessary for warrant. If the degree of warrant (which, given
   the satisfaction of the above conditions, is determined by the firmness
   or strength of belief) is high enough, then the beliefs in question
   will constitute knowledge. [323]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [320] Although this regularity is typical of cognitive processes, it
   isn't really necessary; see my reply to Lehrer in Warrant in
   Contemporary Epistemology, ed. J. Kvanig (New York: Rowman and
   Littlefield, 1996), pp. 332ff.

   [321] A caveat: as Andrew Dole points out in "Cognitive Processes,
   Cognitive Faculties, and the Holy Spirit in Plantinga's Warrant Series"
   (as yet unpublished), it is not obvious that one can directly transfer
   necessary and sufficient conditions for warrant from beliefs produced
   by faculties to beliefs produced by processes.

   [322] Though this need not be the only purpose involved. Perhaps the
   beliefs produced have other virtues in addition to truth: perhaps they
   enable one to stand in a personal relationship with God, to face life's
   vicissitudes with equanimity, to enjoy the comfort that naturally
   results from the belief that constitutes faith, and so on.

   [323] On the account of knowledge given in WPF. I leave as homework the
   problem of showing how to modify the model in such a way as to
   accommodate the other main accounts of warrant.

  IV. Proper Basicality and the Role of Scripture

   According to the model, Christian belief in the typical case is not the
   conclusion of an argument (which is not to say arguments cannot play an
   important role in its acceptance), [324] or accepted on the evidential
   basis of other beliefs, or accepted just because it constitutes a good
   explanation of phenomena of one kind or another. Specific Christian
   beliefs may, indeed, constitute excellent explanations of one or
   another phenomenon (the Christian teaching of sin leaps to mind here),
   but they aren't accepted because they provide such an explanation. Nor
   are they accepted as the conclusion of an argument from religious
   experience. According to the model, experience of a certain sort is
   intimately associated with the formation of warranted Christian belief,
   but the belief doesn't get its warrant by way of an argument from the
   experience. It isn't that the believer notes that she or someone else
   has a certain sort of experience, and somehow concludes that Christian
   belief must be true. It is rather that (as in the case of perception)
   the experience is the occasion for the formation of the beliefs in
   question, and plays a causal role (a role governed by the design plan)
   in their genesis.

   In the typical case, therefore, Christian belief is immediate; it is
   formed in the basic way. It doesn't proceed by way of an argument from,
   for example, the reliability of Scripture or the church. As Jonathan
   Edwards puts it, "This evidence, that they, that are spiritually
   enlightened, have of the truth of the things of religion, is a kind of
   intuitive and immediate evidence. They believe the doctrines of God's
   word to be divine, because they see divinity in them." [325] Christian
   belief is basic; furthermore, Christian belief is properly basic, where
   the propriety in question embraces all three of the epistemic virtues
   we are considering. On the model, the believer is justified in
   accepting these beliefs in the basic way and is rational (both
   internally and externally) in so doing; still further, the beliefs can
   have warrant, enough warrant for knowledge, when they are accepted in
   that basic way. [326] My Christian belief can have warrant, and warrant
   sufficient for knowledge, even if I don't know of and cannot make a
   good historical case for the reliability of the biblical writers or for
   what they teach. I don't need a good historical case for the truth of
   the central teachings of the gospel to be warranted in accepting them.
   I needn't be able to find a good argument, historical or otherwise, for
   the resurrection of Jesus Christ, or for his being the divine Son of
   God, or for the Christian claim that his suffering and death constitute
   an atoning sacrifice whereby we can be restored to the right
   relationship with God. On the model, the warrant for Christian belief
   doesn't require that I or anyone else have this kind of historical
   information; the warrant floats free of such questions. It doesn't
   require to be validated or proved by some source of belief other than
   faith, such as historical investigation.

   Instead, Scripture (through the work of the Holy Spirit) carries its
   own evidence with it; as Calvin says, it is self-authenticating':

   Let this point therefore stand: that those whom the Holy Spirit has
   inwardly taught truly rest upon Scripture, and that Scripture indeed is
   self-authenticated. . . .

   "Therefore," he says,

   illumined by his power, we believe neither by our own nor by anyone
   else's judgment that Scripture is from God; but above human judgment we
   affirm with utter certainty that it has flowed to us from the very
   mouth of God by the ministry of men. We seek no proofs, no marks of
   genuineness upon which our judgment may lean; but we subject our
   judgment and wit to it as to a thing far beyond any guess work! . . .
   Such, then, is a conviction that requires no reason; such, a knowledge
   with which the best reason agrees--in which the mind truly reposes more
   securely and constantly than in any reasons. I speak of nothing other
   than what each believer experiences within himself--though my words
   fall far beneath a just explanation of the matter. [327]

   Calvin speaks here of a certainty, a knowledge that Scripture "has
   flowed to us from the very mouth of God," even if it is "by the
   ministry of men." He does not mean to say, I think (at any rate this is
   not how the model goes), that the Holy Spirit induces belief in the
   proposition the Bible (or the book of Job, or Paul's epistles, or the
   thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians) comes to us from the very
   mouth of God. [328] Rather, upon reading or hearing a given teaching--a
   given item from the great things of the gospel--the Holy Spirit teaches
   us, causes us to believe that that teaching is both true and comes from
   God. So the structure here is not: what is taught in Scripture is true;
   this (e.g., that in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself)
   is taught in Scripture; therefore, this is true. It is rather that, on
   reading or hearing a certain teaching t, one forms the belief that t,
   that very teaching, is true and from God.

   What is this self-authentication' of which Calvin speaks? Is he (or the
   model) claiming that the truths of the gospel are self-evident in
   something like the traditional sense in which 2 + 1 = 3 is said to be?
   Not at all. Self-evident propositions are necessarily true and, at
   least in the cases of maximal self-evidence, such that a properly
   functioning human being can't so much as grasp them without seeing that
   they couldn't be false. [329] But the great things of the gospel are
   not necessarily true (they are a result of God's free and gracious
   action), and it is entirely possible to grasp them without seeing that
   they are true (it is possible to understand them and reject them). So
   according to the model (and Calvin), these truths are not self-evident.
   The propositions Scripture is reliable or God is the author of the
   Bible are not self-evident; neither are such teachings as that God was
   reconciling the world to himself in Christ, or that this reconciliation
   was accomplished by virtue of Christ's atoning suffering and death.
   [330]

   Nor does Calvin mean to say (nor is it any part of the model to assert)
   that Scripture is self-authenticating in the sense that it offers
   evidence for itself or somehow proves itself to be accurate or
   reliable. Suppose a question is raised with respect to a given source
   of belief: is this source of belief really reliable? Suppose a question
   is raised with respect to a particular teaching of Scripture: is this
   particular teaching really true? Neither the source nor the particular
   teaching can, by itself, give an answer that (rationally) allays that
   doubt. Analogy: suppose I read Hume in an unduly receptive frame of
   mind and become doubtful that my cognitive faculties are, in fact,
   reliable. I can't rationally quell or quiet that doubt by offering
   myself an argument for their reliability. It is the reliability of
   those very faculties, that very source, that is at issue; and if I have
   a general doubt about their reliability, I should also have the same
   doubt about their reliability in this specific instance; I should have
   the same doubt about the premises of the argument I offer myself, and
   about my belief that the premises imply the conclusion. Similarly for
   Scripture: If I am doubtful about its reliability, I can't sensibly
   quell or quiet that doubt by noting that, say, II Timothy 3:16 says all
   Scripture is God-breathed (even if I were convinced that what is taught
   here refers to just the books I take to be canonical). So Scripture
   isn't self-authenticating in that sense either.

   What, then, could Calvin mean when he says that Scripture is
   self-authenticating? We can see what he means by noting a respect in
   which the gospel truths resemble self-evident propositions. According
   to the model, these truths, like self-evident truths, are indeed
   evident (do indeed have warrant); and, like self-evident truths, they
   have their evidence immediately--that is--not by way of propositional
   evidence. They do not get their evidence or warrant by way of being
   believed on the evidential basis of other propositions. So from that
   point of view, these truths too could be said to be self-evident--in a
   different and analogically extended sense of that term. They are
   evident, but don't get their evidence from other propositions; they
   have their evidence in themselves (and not by way of inference from
   other propositions). [331] In this same extended sense, perceptual and
   memory beliefs too are self-evident. They too are evident in
   themselves', in that they don't get their warrant (or evidence) by way
   of warrant transfer from other propositions. To say that a proposition
   p is self-evident in this sense is just to say that p does, indeed,
   have warrant or evidence and does not get that warrant by way of
   warrant transfer (that is, by way of being believed on the basis of
   other propositions)--in a word (or two), p is properly basic. [332]

   What Calvin means, then (and what the testimonial model endorses), is
   that we don't require argument from, for example, historically
   established premises about the authorship and reliability of the bit of
   Scripture in question to the conclusion that the bit in question is in
   fact true; that whole process gets short-circuited by way of the
   tripartite process producing faith. Scripture is self-authenticating in
   the sense that for belief in the great things of the gospel to be
   justified, rational, and warranted, no historical evidence and argument
   for the teaching in question, or for the veracity or reliability or
   divine character of Scripture (or the part of Scripture in which it is
   taught) are necessary. The process by which these beliefs have warrant
   for the believer swings free of those historical and other
   considerations; these beliefs have warrant in the basic way.

   But suppose someone does believe these things with a degree of firmness
   sufficient to constitute knowledge: isn't this attitude, however it is
   caused, irrational, contrary to reason? Suppose I read the gospels and
   come to believe, for example, that Jesus Christ is in fact the divine
   son of God and that by his passion, death, and resurrection we human
   beings, fallen and seriously flawed as we are, can be reconciled and
   have eternal life. Suppose I believe these things without any external
   evidence. Suppose, further, I pay little attention to Scripture
   scholarship and give no thought to the identity or credentials of the
   real or alleged authors of these documents. I pay little or no
   attention to such questions as when they were composed or redacted, by
   whom or how many, whether the redactor was trying to make a theological
   point in editing as he did, and so on. [333] Won't I be leaping to
   conclusions, forming belief too hastily? What am I really going on, in
   such a case? Where is my basis, my ground, my evidence? If I have
   neither propositional evidence nor the sort of ground afforded
   perception by perceptual experience, am I not just taking a blind leap?
   Isn't this leap of faith a leap in the dark? Am I not like someone
   whose house is on fire and blindly jumps from his third-story window,
   desperately hoping to catch hold of a branch of the tree he knows is
   somewhere outside the window? And isn't that irresponsible [334] and
   irrational?

   Not at all. Faith, according to the model, is far indeed from being a
   blind leap; it isn't even remotely like a leap in the dark. Suppose you
   are descending a glacier at twelve thousand feet on Mount Rainier;
   there is a nasty whiteout and you can't see more than four feet before
   you. It's getting very late, the wind is rising and the temperature
   dropping, and you won't survive (you are wearing only jeans and a
   T-shirt) unless you get down before nightfall. So you decide to try to
   leap the crevasse before you, even though you can't see its other side
   and haven't the faintest idea how far it is across it. That's a leap in
   the dark. In the case of faith, however, things are wholly different.
   You might as well claim that a memory belief, or the belief that 3 + 1
   = 4 is a leap in the dark. What makes something a leap in the dark is
   that the leaper doesn't know and has no firm beliefs about what there
   is out there in the dark--you might succeed in jumping the crevasse and
   triumphantly continue your descent, but for all you know you might
   instead plummet two hundred feet into the icy depths of the glacier.
   You don't really believe that you can jump the crevasse (though you
   don't disbelieve it either); you hope you can, and act on what you do
   believe--namely, that if you don't jump it, you don't have a chance.

   The case of faith, this sure and certain knowledge, is very different.
   For the person with faith (at least in the paradigmatic instances), the
   great things of the gospel seem clearly true, obvious, compelling. She
   finds herself convinced--just as she does in the case of clear memory
   beliefs or her belief in elementary truths of arithmetic. [335]
   Phenomenologically, therefore, from the inside, there is no similarity
   at all to a leap in the dark. Nor, of course, is there (on the model)
   any similarity from the outside. This is no leap in the dark, not
   merely because the person with faith is wholly convinced but also
   because, as a matter of fact, the belief in question meets the
   conditions for rationality and warrant.

   Compare belief of this sort with the a priori and memory beliefs I
   spoke of above. In a certain sense, there isn't anything to go on in
   any of the three cases. You don't accept memory and obvious a priori
   beliefs on the basis of other beliefs; but you also lack the detailed
   phenomenological basis, the rich and highly articulated sensuous
   imagery that is involved in perception. What you do have in all three
   cases is another kind of phenomenal evidence, what I have been calling
   doxastic evidence. (In WPF I called it impulsional evidence.) There is
   a certain kind of phenomenology that distinguishes entertaining a
   proposition you believe from one you do not: the former simply seems
   right, correct, natural, approved--the experience isn't easy to
   describe (WPF, 190ff.). You have this doxastic evidence in all three
   sorts of cases (as, indeed, in any case of belief), and you have
   nothing else to go on. But you don't need anything else to go on: it is
   not as if things would be better, from an epistemic point of view, if
   you believed, say, 2 + 1 = 3 or that you had oatmeal for breakfast this
   morning on the evidential basis of other propositions, or on the basis
   of some kind of sensuous imagery more or less like that involved in
   perception. (I don't mean that you can't get more evidence, for
   something you believe by way of memory, but that you would not
   necessarily be better off, epistemically speaking, if you believed the
   proposition in question on the basis of other beliefs or on the basis
   of sensuous imagery.) The same goes (on the model) for the beliefs of
   faith: you don't have either sensuous imagery or evidence from other
   things you believe to go on; the beliefs are none the worse,
   epistemically speaking, for that. In fact (on the model) they are all
   the better for that; they have (or can have) much more firmness and
   stability than they could sensibly have if accepted on the basis of
   rational argument or, as in this case, historical investigation; they
   can also have much more warrant. These beliefs (on the model) are not
   accepted on the basis of other beliefs; in fact, other beliefs are
   accepted on the basis of them.

   You might think this model is a model of how, broadly speaking,
   Christian belief can have warrant by way of religious experience.
   That's not exactly right--or if it is right, then memory and a priori
   beliefs also get their warrant by way of experience. But suppose we
   think that (on the model) the beliefs of faith do get their warrant by
   way of experience--that is, by way of doxastic experience--and suppose
   we describe that experience as religious experience. What is crucially
   important to note is that we don't have here an argument from religious
   experience to the truth of these Christian beliefs. There could be
   something like that, a model according to which Christian belief got
   warrant by way of an argument from religious experience. This would be
   one in which you have religious experience (or note that others do),
   and then argue (perhaps by way of something roughly like the analogical
   argument for other minds) to the truth of these doctrines.
   Alternatively, it might be like the arguments some have offered from
   the facts of perceptual experience for the truth of perceptual beliefs.
   This model isn't like that. The experience in question is an occasion
   for the belief in question, not a phenomenon whose existence serves as
   a premise in an argument for that belief.

   According to Hebrews 11, "Now faith is the substance (hupostasiz) of
   things hoped for and the evidence (elenchoz) of things not seen" (King
   James translation). The key words substance' and evidence' are
   translated variously; for example, the more recent Revised Standard
   Version has "faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction
   of things not seen" (my emphasis). Perhaps the former way is the better
   translation; in any event, it is the richer. For faith, according to
   Christian doctrine, is many things. It is the means or vehicle of
   salvation: "for it is by grace you have been saved, through faith"
   (Ephesians 1:8). It is also that by which we are justified (above, p.
   87), as well as that by means of which we are regenerated, becoming new
   creatures in Christ. And it is also the foundation and substance
   (etymologically, that which stands under') of Christian hope.

   But faith is also "the evidence of things not seen." By faith--the
   whole process, involving the internal instigation of the Holy
   Spirit--something becomes evident (i.e., acquires warrant, has what it
   takes to be knowledge). And what thus becomes evident or warranted is
   indeed not seen. This doesn't mean that it is indistinct, blurred,
   uncertain, or a matter of guesswork; what it means is that the belief
   in question isn't made evident by way of the workings of the ordinary
   cognitive faculties with which we were originally created. (The author
   refers, by way of synecdoche, to these faculties as vision.) Return to
   the account of Thomas's skepticism (above, pp. 254): Thomas would not
   believe until he saw the nail holes, put his finger where the nails
   were, thrust his hand into Christ's side. Jesus then says to him,
   "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who
   have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20:29). From the present
   point of view, this is neither a general counsel commending credulity
   nor a rebuke addressed to such embryonic empiricists as Thomas. It is,
   instead, the observation that those who have faith have a source of
   knowledge that transcends our ordinary perceptual faculties and
   cognitive processes, a source of knowledge that is a divine gift; hence
   they are indeed blessed. [336]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [324] For example, in rebutting defeaters: see below, chapter 11.

   [325] A Treatise concerning Religious Affections, ed. John E. Smith
   (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959 [originally published 1746]),
   p. 298. Subsequent references to Religious Affections are to this
   edition.

   [326] Of course that is not to say that a believer can properly reject
   proposed defeaters out of hand, without examination (see below,
   chapters 11-14); nor is she committed to refusing to think she could be
   wrong. No doubt she can be wrong: that is part of the human condition.
   If there were a demonstration or a powerful argument from other sources
   against Christian belief, an argument to which neither she nor the
   Christian community could see a satisfactory reply, then she might have
   a problem; this would be a genuine example of a clash between faith and
   reason. No such demonstration or argument, however, has so far reared
   its ugly head.

   [327] I, vii, 5, pp. 80-81. Here Calvin speaks of "utter certainty" and
   of the mind "reposing securely" in these teachings. But this is only
   one side of the story: elsewhere he notes that even the best and most
   favored of us are subject to doubt and uncertainty: "For unbelief is so
   deeply rooted in our hearts, and we are so inclined to it, that not
   without hard struggle is each one able to persuade himself of what all
   confess with the mouth: namely, that God is faithful" (III, ii, 15); he
   also says that "unbelief, in all men, is always mixed with faith" (III,
   ii, 4, p. 547). (What he means, of course, is not that unbelievers
   always have a portion of faith, but that faith always contains a
   portion of unbelief.) It is only in the pure and paradigmatic instances
   of faith that there is that utter certainty'.

   [328] As to what Calvin actually meant here, there has been
   considerable debate.

   [329] See WPF, 108-9.

   [330] According to Richard Swinburne, "Very few parts of the Bible seem
   to claim either self-evident' authority or indeed even to be the
   immediate word of the Lord' . . . much of Scripture has not seemed
   self-evident to so many of its readers; argument is needed to show how
   it is to be understood and why it is to be believed. Those to whom
   Scripture seems self-evident' are well advised to reflect on these
   facts before reaffirming their conviction that its truth needs no
   argument" (Revelation [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992], p. 118). Here
   two issues are conflated: (a) are these gospel truths self-evident? and
   (b) can they properly be believed without argument? According to the
   present model the answer to (b) is yes' but to (a) is no'. (There is
   also still a further issue: according to the model, the central truths
   of the gospel are self-authenticating in this way; the same does not
   (necessarily) go for the rest of what the Bible teaches.)

   [331] Compare Jonathan Edwards: "The gospel of the blessed God don't go
   abroad a begging for its evidence, so much as some think; it has its
   highest and most proper evidence in itself" (Religious Affections, p.
   307).

   [332] Faith resembles perception, memory, and rational intuition
   (whereby one grasps what is self-evident) in that in all three cases
   the beliefs in question are properly basic with respect to warrant. But
   faith differs from perception (though not from memory and rational
   intuition) in that it does not involve anything like the highly
   articulated and detailed sort of sensuous phenomenology that prompts
   perceptual belief.

   [333] I don't mean for a moment to suggest that Scripture scholarship
   is unimportant or unimportant for the Christian life (see chapter 12);
   what I mean is only that knowledge of its results is not necessary for
   warranted Christian belief.

   [334] As is argued by, e.g., James L. Muyskens, The Sufficiency of
   Hope: The Conceptual Foundations of Religion (Philadelphia: Temple
   University Press, 1979), p. 113; see also pp. 134-44.

   [335] Again, in the paradigmatic cases; but of course the fact is the
   conviction and belief involved in faith come in all degrees of
   firmness. As Calvin puts it, "in the believing mind certainty is mixed
   with doubt" and "we are troubled on all sides by the agitation of
   unbelief." In typical cases, therefore, as opposed to paradigmatic
   cases, degree of belief will be less than maximal. Furthermore, degree
   of belief, on the part of the person who has faith, typically varies
   from time to time, from circumstance to circumstance.

   [336] Compare Aquinas: "Accordingly, if anyone would reduce the
   foregoing words to the form of a definition, he may say that faith is a
   habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the
   intellect assent to what is non-apparent (ST II-II, q.4, a.i,
   respondeo).
     __________________________________________________________________

  V. Comparison with Locke

   We can understand this testimonial model better if we compare it with a
   picture of a very different sort--that of John Locke, whose
   Enlightenment model is still dominant in some Christian circles. [337]
   According to Locke, all of our beliefs should be formed by "following
   reason." What that means, more specifically, is that epistemic duty
   demands "not entertaining any proposition with greater assurance than
   the proofs [inductive as well as deductive] it is built upon will
   warrant." [338] And what that means (as we saw in chapter 4) is that I
   should proportion degree of assent to the evidence; that is, I should,
   as far as I can, believe a proposition p with a firmness that is
   proportional to the degree to which p is probable with respect to what
   is certain for me.

   All of our beliefs should be formed by following reason; but this
   doesn't mean, as Locke sees it, that there is no rational room for
   beliefs formed by faith, which he defines as "the assent to any
   proposition, not thus made out by the deductions of reason; but upon
   the credit of the proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary
   way of communication" (416). Nor does it mean that we can't properly
   believe an item of divine revelation, where that item itself is not
   more likely than not with respect to what is certain for us:

   I do not mean that we must consult reason, and examine whether a
   proposition revealed from God can be made out by natural principles,
   and if it cannot then we may reject it. . . .

   What he does mean is

   but consult it we must, and by it examine whether it be a revelation
   from God or no: and if reason finds it to be revealed from God, reason
   then declares for it as much as for any other truth, and makes it one
   of her dictates. (439)

   Locke's claim is that before believing an allegedly revealed
   proposition, we must first satisfy ourselves by reason that this
   proposition is, indeed, a revelation from God. What we need is a
   rational proof (a proof whose premises and procedures come from reason,
   not from revelation) that the proposition in question really is
   proposed for our belief by God. So what we need in the case of a
   scriptural teaching is a rational proof that this teaching is indeed a
   divine revelation; it is that proposition which must be shown to be
   probable with respect to what is certain for us. Once we have that,
   then we can properly believe what it teaches, although presumably with
   a firmness that is proportional to the probability (with respect to
   what is certain for us) that the teaching in question really does come
   from God.

   Things are very different on the testimonial model. It isn't that one
   believes, for example, that God was reconciling the world to himself in
   Christ, because one has first seen or shown that it is likely (with
   respect to what is certain) that this particular suggestion of Paul's
   (or perhaps all of II Corinthians, or perhaps the entire New Testament,
   or perhaps the entire Bible) is in fact divinely inspired and hence
   true. This would be vastly too tenuous and speculative. A belief that
   the passage is a divine revelation, if properly formed by way of
   historical inquiry, could only be halting and tentative; but then the
   belief itself would have to be equally halting and tentative. As Calvin
   puts it:

   If we desire to provide in the best way for our consciences--that they
   may not be perpetually beset by the instability of doubt or
   vacillation, and that they may not also boggle at the smallest
   quibbles--we ought to seek our conviction in another place than human
   reasons, judgment, or conjectures, that is, in the secret testimony of
   the Spirit. [339]

   Instead, on the present model the source of belief and knowledge here
   is independent of ordinary historical investigation and of the
   probability mongering, the vagaries and uncertainties to which that
   line of inquiry is condemned. The belief in question is, instead,
   immediate and basic, an immediate response to the proclamation. Of
   course this response takes place within the context of a whole
   interlocking system of beliefs; we may add, if we like, that it obtains
   some of its warrant from its coherence with a coherent system.
   Nevertheless, the belief is still basic in that it isn't accepted on
   the evidential basis of these beliefs or any others. It is basic, and
   properly basic--with respect to warrant and rationality as well as
   justification. Says Calvin, no doubt with an anticipatory glance in
   Locke's direction,

   Since for unbelieving men religion seems to stand by opinion alone,
   they, in order not to believe anything foolishly or lightly, both wish
   and demand rational proof that Moses and the prophets spoke divinely.
   But I reply: the testimony of the Spirit is more excellent than all
   reason. For as God alone is a fit witness of himself in his Word, so
   also the Word will not find acceptance in men's hearts before it is
   sealed by the inward testimony of the Spirit. The same Spirit,
   therefore, who has spoken through the mouths of the prophets must
   penetrate into our hearts to persuade us that they faithfully
   proclaimed what had been divinely commanded. (79) [340]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [337] Locke's cool rationalism with respect to the authority of
   Scripture is echoed at present by, for example, Richard Swinburne (see
   footnote 348), but also by those more evangelical thinkers who hold
   that warrant for Christian belief can only come by way of argument or
   evidence.

   [338] An Essay concerning Human Understanding, ed. with "Prolegomena"
   by Alexander Fraser (New York: Dover, 1959 [original first published in
   1690]), IV, xix, 1, p. 429. Subsequent page references to Locke's essay
   are to this edition.

   [339] Institutes, p. 78. Of course it doesn't follow that Scripture
   scholarship and biblical commentary are not both important and
   necessary; Calvin himself wrote more than twenty volumes of detailed
   and searching biblical commentary.

   [340] Note here that the Holy Spirit plays a dual role: inspiring the
   human authors of Scripture (bringing it about that they say what he
   wants them to say) but also working in the hearts of the hearers and
   readers, bringing it about that they believe what they hear and read.
   So the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit is to what he himself has
   said.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VI. Why Necessary?

   Why is this elaborate scheme necessary? Why these supernaturally
   inspired writings and this individually applied supernatural testimony
   of the Holy Spirit? Or rather (because God could have accomplished his
   aim of enabling human beings of many times and places to know about the
   possibility and means of salvation in many different ways), what might
   recommend this particular scheme? Wouldn't some less extravagant means
   suffice? Couldn't this information come to us just as well by way of
   ordinary human testimony, for example? Perhaps (as Locke thought) God
   could have revealed the great truths of the gospel in some direct way
   only to certain human beings. They could then write them down for the
   benefit of the rest of us, who are then supposed to be able to see in
   the ordinary way that these writings do, indeed, constitute divine
   revelation (and are accordingly both true and to be believed). Why have
   any truck with special faculties or supernatural belief-producing
   processes like faith and the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit?

   Well, first of all, we have no reason to think God either specially
   prizes ontological economy or specially dislikes supernatural
   processes. But the main problem with Locke's appealingly simple device
   is that it wouldn't work. First, according to the extended A/C model,
   we human beings, apart from God's special and gracious activity, are
   sunk in sin; we are prone to hate God and our neighbor; our hearts, as
   Jeremiah said, are deceitful above all things and desperately corrupt.
   In this context, that fact is of great importance: without some special
   activity on the part of the Lord, we wouldn't believe. As the apostle
   Paul says, "The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that
   come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he
   cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned." [341]
   We human beings won't come to see the depth of our own sin and our need
   for salvation without regeneration, rebirth; according to Jesus
   himself, we need the testimony of the Holy Spirit to come to believe
   the great truths of the gospel. [342] Given our fallen nature and our
   natural antipathy to the message of the gospel, faith will have to be a
   gift, not in the way a glorious autumn day is a gift, but a special
   gift, one that wouldn't come to us in the ordinary run of things, one
   that requires supernatural and extraordinary activity on the part of
   God. [343]

   Furthermore, suppose someone did come to believe, just by way of
   historical investigation that Jesus was indeed the divine son of God,
   that he died for our sins and rose again, and that through him we can
   have eternal life. Merely believing this--as an interesting fact about
   the world, rather like the fact that the universe began in a Big Bang
   some twelve to sixteen billion years ago--is insufficient. These truths
   must be sealed to the heart, as well as revealed to the mind. This
   sealing is the topic of the next chapter; now we note only that coming
   to faith includes more than a change of opinion. It also (and
   crucially) includes a change of heart, a change in affection, in what
   one loves and hates, approves and disdains, seeks and avoids. According
   to the present model, faith is, indeed, a belief-producing process; it
   is also an affection-producing process, a process issuing in alteration
   of affection as well as change of opinion. Given our constitution, this
   alteration of affection can't be accomplished just by coming to
   believe, as a historical fact, the main lines of the gospel. [344]

   We therefore need a change of attitude in addition to a change of
   opinion, and won't sustain the latter without the former. Well then,
   why couldn't God (supernaturally if he feels that is necessary) just
   arrange for a change of attitude and affections? Why do we need that
   supernatural source for a change in opinion? Given the right
   affections, wouldn't Scripture and our ordinary faculties (reason,
   memory, perception, sympathy, induction, etc.) be sufficient to enable
   us to see the truth of the message of the gospel?

   I doubt it. First, what is proposed is such that by virtue of the
   ordinary faculties employed in historical investigation, only a few
   people would acquire the knowledge in question, and they only after a
   great deal of effort and much time; furthermore, their belief would be
   both uncertain and shot through with falsehood. [345] What is being
   taught, after all, is not something that chimes straightforwardly with
   our ordinary experience. It isn't like an account of an ancient war, or
   of the cruelty of the Athenians to the Melians, or of the overweening
   pride of some ancient despot. That sort of thing would be easy enough
   to believe. What we have instead, however, is the claim that a certain
   human being--Jesus of Nazareth--is also, astonishingly, the unique
   divine Son of God who has existed from eternity. Furthermore, this man
   died, which is not uncommon, but then three days later rose from the
   dead, which is uncommon indeed. Still further, it is by way of his
   atoning suffering and death and resurrection that we are justified,
   that our sins are forgiven, and that we may have life and have it more
   abundantly. This is heady stuff indeed, and the mere fact that some
   ancient authors believed it would certainly be insufficient for a
   sensible conviction on our part. As biblical scholars remind us, there
   are many ancient books with stories more or less (in my opinion, mostly
   less) like the biblical ones; how many of those ancient books do we in
   fact believe?

   Still (comes the reply), can't we discover for ourselves, without any
   special divine aid or assistance, that the Bible (the New Testament,
   say) is in fact "from God": divinely inspired in such a way that God
   speaks to us in it and through it, [346] and hence wholly reliable?
   [347] Can't we come to see this in the same way that we can learn that
   Herodotus and Xenophon are reasonably reliable reporters of what they
   hear and see? And once we see that, couldn't we then infer that the
   Bible's central message of incarnation and atonement is true? Can't we
   see and appreciate the historical case for the truth of the main lines
   of Christian belief without any special work of the Holy Spirit? "You
   must be born again" all right--your affections, aims, and intentions
   must be recalibrated, redirected, reversed--and that requires special
   divine help. But given that recalibration, couldn't you then see and
   appreciate the historical case for the truth of the main lines of
   Christianity without any special work of the Holy Spirit?

   I don't think so. Even discounting the effects of sin on our
   apprehension of the historical case, that case isn't strong enough to
   produce warranted belief that the main lines of Christian teaching are
   true--at most, it could produce the warranted belief that the main
   lines of Christian teaching aren't particularly improbable. For how
   could such a case go? [348] First, of course, the case in question
   couldn't in any way rely on the thought that the Bible is in some
   special way inspired by God; for these purposes, we should have to
   treat it exactly as we would any other ancient volume. We should have
   to follow the example of those Scripture scholars who try to determine
   (for example) what actually happened with Jesus--what he preached,
   whether he rose from the dead--without making any special theological
   assumptions about the reliability of the Bible or the person of Jesus.
   [349] They bracket any such theological beliefs they may have and then
   try to assess the historical case or evidence for such claims as that
   Jesus actually asserted that he was the divine redeemer, or the claim
   that he died and came back to life. Such a case for the truth of the
   main lines of Christianity could be at most a case for the probability
   that these teachings are true.

   What would such a case be like? How could it be constructed? The
   conclusion of the case (or argument) would be that the central
   Christian claims are probable. Now a proposition is probable only with
   respect to some other proposition or propositions. [350] In this case,
   the relevant other propositions would be some body of background
   knowledge K--what we all or nearly all know or take for granted or
   firmly believe, or what at any rate those conducting the inquiry know
   or take for granted or believe. [351] And the aim would be to show that
   the claims of the Christian gospel are probable with respect to K--that
   is, probable with respect to what we know or take for granted. For
   simplicity, take the central Christian claims to be sin (human beings
   are in need of salvation), incarnation (Jesus is the incarnate second
   person of the trinity), atonement (by virtue of his suffering and
   death, he atoned for our sin and enables us to attain eternal
   salvation), and general availability (salvation isn't restricted to
   just one group of people, for example, the Jews [352] ); and let's use
   G' to name their conjunction. Our aim, therefore, is to argue that G is
   reasonably probable on K; we can employ the usual symbolism for
   probability and put this by saying that P(G/K) is reasonably high.

   How can we construct such a case--argue that P(G/K) is reasonably high?
   The usual way (and the method followed by Swinburne) is to try to find
   some proposition (or group of propositions) P which is probable with
   respect to K, and which is such that G is probable with respect to its
   conjunction with K: that is, a proposition P such that P(P/K) and
   P(G/P&K) are both high. For example, you might argue first that T, the
   existence of God, is probable on K, our background knowledge. Then you
   might argue that given our background knowledge K and the existence of
   God (T), it is probable that God would reveal certain crucial truths
   (truths we need to know) to humankind. [353] Call that proposition R.
   Then you might continue arguing in the same vein (repeating the same
   form of argument), finally winding up with some propositions with
   respect to which it is likely that God raised Jesus from the dead, thus
   authorizing and validating the message of the New Testament. That
   message could then be taken as authorized by God and hence true; and
   the message contains those propositions G to whose probability we are
   trying to argue. So you might then conclude that G is in fact probable
   with respect to what we know.

   To illustrate and explain this procedure, suppose you are interested in
   the probability that Eleonore is at the party. It is very probable, on
   your background knowledge K, that Paul is at the party (call that
   proposition P'): P(P/K) is high--for definiteness, say it's .9. It is
   also very likely that Eleonore is at the party (call that proposition
   E'), given that Paul is (she ordinarily goes to every party he goes
   to); so P(E/P&K) is also high--say it is also .9. There is a formula
   from the probability calculus that enables you to conclude that it is
   likely that Eleonore is there, too:

   P(E/K) equals or exceeds P(P/K) Ã P(E/P&K).

   Thus P(E/K) will be at least .81. [354]

   This sort of argument can be reiterated. Perhaps you also know that
   there is a pretty good probability--.8, say--that Vonnie will be there,
   given that Eleonore is: in that case, you can conclude that the
   probability of Vonnie's being there is at least .648; and perhaps you
   know that the probability of Jim's being there, given that Vonnie is
   there, is .95; then the probability that he's there will be at least
   .616.

   Now suppose we try along these lines to construct a case for the
   probability of G with respect to that background knowledge K. We should
   first have to find the probability that T (theism) is true: what is the
   probability (on our background knowledge, or the totality of what we
   know apart from theism) that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly
   good being who has created the world? In his book The Existence of God,
   [355] Swinburne considers this probability and concludes on the last
   page of the book, "On our total evidence theism is more probable than
   not." The argument is complex and at many points controversial. [356]
   From the present perspective, however, an even more vexing problem is
   that its conclusion is only that theism is more probable than not on
   the relevant body of knowledge or information K: it lies somewhere in
   the (half open) interval .5 to 1. Even if all the other probabilities
   involved in our historical case were as high as 1, we could conclude no
   more than that the probability of the truth of Christian teaching lies
   somewhere in that same interval.

   But if my only ground for Christian teaching is its probability with
   respect to K, and all I know about that probability is that it is
   greater than .5, then I can't rationally believe that teaching. Suppose
   I know that the coin you are about to toss is loaded. I don't know just
   how heavily it is loaded, so I don't know what the probability is that
   it will come up heads, but I do know that this probability is greater
   than .5. Under those conditions I do not believe that the next toss of
   this coin will come up heads. (Of course I also don't believe that it
   will come up tails; and I suspect that it will come up heads.) All I
   know is that it is more likely than not to come up heads; and that's
   not sufficient for my sensibly believing that it will. The same goes in
   this case: if what I know is only that the probability of Christian
   belief (with respect to K) is greater than .5, I can't sensibly believe
   it. [357] I can hope that it is true, and think it rather likely that
   it is; I can't believe it. To give the historical case for G a run for
   its money, therefore, suppose we arbitrarily assign T a much higher
   probability on K--let's say that it is at least .9. Many will howl with
   indignation at such a high assignment; let us ignore them for the
   moment.

   We must next consider the probability, given T&K, that

   A God would make some kind of revelation (of himself, or perhaps of
   what we need to know about him) to humankind.

   Well, that seems quite likely, although of course it's very hard to
   predict a priori what God would or wouldn't do. Again, let's be
   generous and estimate this probability as also lying in the interval .9
   to 1.

   But now we come to the hard parts. Somehow we have to make a
   probabilistic argument for the proposition that such a revelation would
   contain G, the great claims of the gospel. Of course a revelation from
   God would include G only if G is true; so what we really need here is a
   probabilistic argument for a conclusion sufficient to entail G. One
   common way to do this would be to argue that it is likely that Jesus
   taught G, and that by raising Jesus from the dead God endorsed or
   ratified that teaching. But just on the basis of ordinary historical
   scholarship, without the assumption that the Bible is, in fact, a
   divine revelation, it really isn't likely that Jesus taught anything
   nearly as definite as G--that is, sin, incarnation, atonement, and
   general availability. Scripture scholars argue at length about what
   precisely Jesus taught, but those who approach the matter from below'
   (i.e., without employing any special theological assumptions) for the
   most part are not at all prepared to assert that Jesus taught G.
   Indeed, even if we do accept the Bible as authoritative, it still won't
   be clear that Jesus taught G; much of our grasp of the central claims
   of Christian faith comes from other parts of the Bible (e.g., the
   Pauline epistles) and later reflection (e.g., the Nicene Creed).

   Perhaps, though, it is likely just on historical grounds that the
   teachings of Jesus were such that by sensible interpretation and
   extrapolation one could arrive at G. So we must ask after the
   probability of

   B Jesus' teachings were such that they could be sensibly interpreted
   and extrapolated to G

   given K&T and A; that is, we must ask after the value of P(B/(K&T&A)).
   B is fairly vague, but let's suppose it's rather likely, just on the
   basis of historical scholarship. Of course there will be many who would
   demur--those who think Jesus was a homosexual magician, [358] for
   example, not to mention those who think he was the first Christian
   atheist. [359] Let's say they are wrong and that this probability is
   high--for definiteness, in the interval .7 to .9.

   But now things get harder yet. We must next consider the proposition
   that God endorsed Jesus' teachings by performing a great miracle and
   raising him from the dead. What is the probability, just on historical
   grounds, that

   C Jesus rose from the dead?

   Of course, C must be taken in a literal and bodily sense; it is not to
   be glossed as, for example, the mere thought that the followers of
   Jesus underwent some experience so impressive and revivifying that they
   acquired the energy and determination necessary to start a new
   religion. [360] And again, what we need to consider is the conditional
   probability of C on K, T, and A&B--that is, P(C/(K&T&A&B)). What is
   this probability? One hesitates to say much here, given the enormous
   controversies and disagreements among Scripture scholars. How many
   people are there who believe on strictly historical grounds together
   with theism (no help from theology, or the internal instigation of the
   Holy Spirit, or anything like that), that Jesus Christ arose from the
   dead (in the strict and literal sense)? Even if you had a fine command
   of the vast literature and thought there was rather a good historical
   case here, you would presumably think it pretty speculative and chancy.
   I'd guess that it is likely that the disciples believed that Jesus
   arose from the dead, but on sheerly historical grounds (together with
   the assumption that there really is such a person as God, who is rather
   likely to make a revelation to us) it is considerably less likely that
   this actually did happen. Given all the controversy among the experts,
   we should probably declare this probability inscrutable--that is, such
   that we can't really say with any confidence what it is. Again, let's
   be generous: let's say that this proposition is more probable than
   not--for definiteness, say it lies in the interval .6 to .8.

   Next, we must consider the probability of

   D In raising Jesus from the dead, God endorsed his teachings

   on the previous propositions; that is, we must consider
   P(D/(K&T&A&B&C)). From C we have only that Jesus arose from the dead,
   not that God raised him from the dead, thereby endorsing his teaching.
   Given T, though, it does seem likely that God raised him from the
   dead--how else would it happen? Still, did he, in so doing, ratify what
   Jesus taught? Not necessarily: there are other reasons why he might
   have done it. Perhaps it was to endorse the teaching of the Pharisees
   as opposed to the Sadducees (Matthew 22:23), or perhaps as a reward for
   special devotion and a holy life, or perhaps for some reason of which
   we have no knowledge. Still, this probability should probably be pegged
   fairly high: let's say, for definiteness, .9.

   But there is still another probability to be evaluated here: the
   probability that in raising Jesus from the dead and endorsing his
   teachings, he was also endorsing their extrapolation to G, the central
   teaching of Christianity: we must look into the probability of

   E The extension and extrapolation of Jesus' teachings to G is true

   That is, we must look into P(E/(K&T&A&B&C&D)). Here the issues are more
   complex than they appear at first. Suppose you were completely
   convinced, on merely historical grounds, that Jesus rose from the dead:
   wouldn't it be an enormous further step to conclude G, that he was, in
   fact, the divine and unique son of God, the second person of the
   trinity, and that his suffering and death is a propitiatory sacrifice,
   whereby we can have eternal life? It isn't easy to see how a powerful
   historical case for all this could be made; perhaps it could go as
   follows. In accord with B, above, Jesus' teachings can naturally be
   extrapolated or extended to G; and perhaps God endorsed this extension
   of Jesus' teachings in raising him from the dead. But why think so? Why
   think that extrapolation (as opposed to all the other possibilities)
   has it right? Well, perhaps Jesus intended to (and did) found a church
   to interpret and preserve his teachings; God ratified that intention
   too; the church he founded is still extant, preserved (by the Holy
   Spirit, perhaps) from error, and teaches G. Here we really have five
   further propositions that together constitute our historical case for
   E; so, instead of E, we must consider the probability of the
   conjunction of

   (1) Jesus intended to (and did) found a church to interpret and
   preserve his teachings,

   (2) God ratified that intention in raising him from the dead,

   (3) The church Jesus founded is still extant,

   (4) God has preserved that church from error,

   and

   (5) That church teaches G

   on K&T&A&B&C&D.

   Now in the context of the present argument, we can take the conjunction
   of (1) to (5) as E*. Our present project, then, is to evaluate the
   probability of E*, so construed, on K&T&A&B&C&D. It seems sensible to
   estimate P((1)&(2)&(3)&(4)/(K&T&A&B&C&D)) as very high: [361] to be
   generous (and keep things as simple as possible) let's say this
   probability is 1. That still leaves us with (5), however: what is its
   probability on K&T&A&B&C&D plus the conjunction of (1) to (4)? This is
   not easy to estimate. Given that there is a church that God has
   preserved from error, which church is it? Is it one that teaches G? At
   present, many mainline Protestant churches (and some Roman Catholic
   clergy), for example, don't seem really to teach G at all. These
   churches (and their members) display a very wide spectrum of opinion,
   ranging all the way from extremely liberal views, according to which
   very little of classical Christianity is actually true (though much of
   it perhaps warmly inspiring), to full-blooded classical Christian
   belief. Which of these opinions did Christ mean to endorse? Which of
   these most faithfully conforms to his intentions? Is it a group that
   actually teaches G? [362] That's not easy to say on historical grounds;
   once again, let's be generous and estimate this probability (i.e.,
   P((5)/(K&T&A&B&C&D)) as somewhere in the interval .7 to .9. This means
   that P(E/(K&T&A&B&C&D)) will lie in that same interval.

   Now how do we get a probability (on K) for G, given all this? Note that
   E entails G; so (following our present argument) to find the
   probability of G on K, what we need is to find the probability of E on
   K. How do we do that? Our argument followed the strategy of finding a
   series of propositions, T and A-E, such that the first is probable on
   K, the second on K together with the first, the third on K together
   with the first and second, and so on. A little arithmetic enables us to
   conclude that

   P(E/K)

   will be equal to or greater than

   P(T/K) Ã (P(A/(K&T)) Ã P(B/(K&T&A)) Ã P(C/(K&T&A&B)) Ã P(D/(K&T&A&B&C))
   Ã P(E/(K&T&A&B&C&D)).

   The little arithmetic goes as follows.

   By

   (1) P(X/Y) ? P(X/Z&Y) Ã P(Z/Y)

   we know that

   (2) P(E/K) ? P(E/K&T&A&B&C&D) Ã (P(T&A&B&C&D/K).

   Consider the right multiplicand. According to the probability calculus,

   (3) P(X&Y/Z) = P(X/Z) Ã P(Y/X&Z);

   hence

   (4) P(T&A&B&C&D/K) = P(T&A&B&C/K) Ã
   P(D/T&A&B&C&K).

   By substitution into (2) we have

   (5) P(E/K) ? P(E/T&A&B&C&D&K) Ã P(T&A&B&C/K) Ã
   P(D/T&A&B&C&K).

   Again, by (3) we know that

   (6) P(T&A&B&C/K) = P(C/T&A&B&K) Ã P(T&A&B/K);

   substituting into (5), we have

   (7) P(E/K) ? P(E/T&A&B&C&D&K) Ã P(C/T&A&B&K) Ã
   P(T&A&B/K) Ã P(D/A&B&C&K).

   Applying (3) and substitution a couple of more times and rearranging
   terms, we have

   (8) P(E/K) ? P(T/K) Ã P(A/K&T) Ã P(B/K&T&A) Ã
   P(C/K&T&A&B) Ã P(D/K&T&A&B&C) Ã
   P(E/K&T&A&B&C&D),

   which was to be demonstrated.

   In some cases these values were intervals rather than real numbers,
   sharp probabilities. That's no problem; since we are in any event
   winding up with the statement that P(G/K) is equal to or greater than
   some number, what we do is just use the lower bounds of the intervals.
   Doing the arithmetic, in the present case we wind up with the
   proposition that P(E/K) is at least .21. If instead of using just the
   lower bounds, we use the midpoints of the intervals assigned, we find
   that P(G/K) is at least .35. Suppose we stick with the midpoint (rather
   than the lower bound): then our argument entitles us to say only that
   the probability of G on K is at least .35. It could be higher, of
   course, but all we can say with confidence, given the argument, is that
   it is equal to or greater than .35.

   Now of course it is ludicrous to assign real numbers to these
   probabilities: there is vagueness of many kinds here. Not only can't we
   sensibly assign a real number to any of these probabilities, it also
   seems wrong to assign them intervals with sharp boundaries; our actual
   reasoning must be vaguer. Perhaps the best we can really say is that
   these probabilities are high, or low, or fairly near .5. Still, our
   reasoning, even if vague, would have to be guided here roughly and
   vaguely by the calculus of probabilities; and the best way to let it be
   thus guided is to assign probabilities (and intervals of probability)
   that comport with the vague estimates we seriously make, and then see
   what the consequent probabilities would be. When we do this in the
   present case, in our attempt to estimate the power of a historical
   argument for G, an argument that doesn't rely on faith or any special
   theological assumptions, what we can say is only that this probability
   is at least high enough not to be a whole lot less likely than its
   denial. Of course we might quibble with the specific values I proposed.
   But I tried to err on the side of generosity; and even if we assigned
   somewhat higher probabilities, the result won't change much. The
   conclusion to be drawn, I think, is that K, our background knowledge,
   historical and otherwise (excluding what we know by way of faith or
   revelation), isn't anywhere nearly sufficient to support serious belief
   in G. If K were all we had to go on, the only sensible course would be
   agnosticism: "I don't know whether G is true or not: all I can say for
   sure is that it is not terribly unlikely." The main problem for such a
   historical case, as I see it, is what we can call the principle of
   dwindling probabilities: the fact that in giving such a historical
   argument, we can't simply annex the intermediate propositions to K (as
   I'm afraid many who employ this sort of argument actually do) but must
   instead multiply the relevant probabilities.

   It is for this reason that some such scheme as proposed in the
   testimonial model is necessary, if we human beings are to be able to
   know the great truths of the gospel.

   [341] 1 Corinthians 2:14. Compare 1 Corinthians 1:23-24: "We preach
   Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to
   Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks,
   Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."

   [342] "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him"
   (John 6:44); and "I will pray the Father, and he will give you another
   Counselor, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the
   world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you
   know him for he dwells with you, and will be in you" (John 14:16-17).

   [343] This, once more, is a point on which Calvin and Aquinas concur:
   "for since, by assenting to what belongs to faith, man is raised above
   his nature, this must needs come to him from some supernatural
   principle moving him inwardly; and this is God" (STII-II, q.6, a.1,
   respondeo; see also article 2). When I speak of supernatural activity
   on the part of God, I don't mean to suggest a sort of incursion into or
   intervention in the natural order. The fact is, God is constantly
   active in the world: apart from his upholding activity, the world would
   disappear like a candle flame in a high wind. Supernatural activity on
   the part of God (as well as miracles) must be understood, instead, in
   terms of God's special activity, as opposed to the way in which he
   ordinarily treats the things he has created. There are depths and
   problems here; they will have to await another occasion.

   [344] "If they wouldn't believe Moses and the prophets, they will not
   be convinced even if someone rises from the dead" (Luke 16:31).

   [345] As Aquinas says about the existence of God if accepted on the
   basis of the theistic proofs (ST I, q.1, a.1, respondeo; Summa contra
   Gentiles, Bk. I, ch. 4; ST II-II, q.2, a.4). It is for this reason,
   Aquinas says, that it was entirely appropriate for the existence of God
   to be proposed as an object of belief or faith, even though it could in
   fact be proved by reason.

   [346] Perhaps in the way proposed by Nicholas Wolterstorff's Divine
   Discourse. As I understand Wolterstorff, however, his account of how it
   could be that God speaks presupposes the main lines of Christian
   teaching, and hence wouldn't offer a way in which we could come to see
   that that teaching is in fact true (i.e., wouldn't provide the
   materials for an argument for the truth of that teaching).

   [347] This would substantially be the Locke-Swinburne model; however,
   it isn't clear whether they would concur with the current proposal in
   the suggestion that a change in affection and attitude is necessary to
   a proper appreciation of the historical case.

   [348] What follows is roughly based on Richard Swinburne's argument for
   a similar conclusion in his Revelation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992),
   chapters 5, 7, and 8. A difference is that Swinburne thinks one
   believes that p if and only if one believes that p is more probable
   than not. (Faith and Reason [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981], p. 32); I
   take it that belief that p is more probable than not is nowhere nearly
   sufficient for belief that p. (I am about to throw an ordinary die: I
   believe it is more likely than not that it won't come up showing face 2
   or 3, but I certainly don't believe that it won't; what I actually
   believe on this head is only that it will come up showing one of faces
   1 through 6 (and not, for example, wind up delicately balanced on one
   of its points or edges).

   [349] See below, pp. 390ff.

   [350] The absolute or logical probability of a proposition would then
   be its probability with respect to a necessary truth.

   [351] These probabilities would not be Bayesian measures of degrees of
   belief, but something much more objective--Richard Swinburne's
   epistemic probability, or the objective probability of WPF (pp.
   161ff.).

   [352] Peter's vision in Acts 10.

   [353] Thus Swinburne: "So if there is other evidence which makes it
   quite likely that there is a God, all powerful and all good, who made
   the Earth and its inhabitants, then perhaps it becomes to some extent
   likely that he would intervene in human history to reveal things to
   them" (Revelation, p. 70).

   [354] "At least": that is because there could also be some probability
   that Eleonore would be there even if Paul were not. The probability of
   Eleonore's being there (E) will be the weighted average of the
   probabilities of E given Paul's being there (P) and the probability of
   E given -P--weighted by the probabilities of P and -P. The relevant
   formula is P(E/K) = [P(E/(P&K)) Ã P(P/K)] + [P(E/(-P&K)) Ã P(-P/K)].

   [355] Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979.

   [356] Especially, perhaps, with respect to the judgments of comparative
   simplicity involved, and the judgment that simplicity is, in fact, a
   good guide to probability.

   [357] Note, of course, that we can't simply add theism to the relevant
   body of knowledge K on the grounds that it is more probable than not on
   what we know; that way lies contradiction. It is more probable than not
   that this die will not turn up ace; the same, of course, for each of
   the other five possibilities; so if we could add each of these
   propositions (it won't come up 1, it won't come up 2 . . . ) to K, we
   wind up with the contradiction that the die will come up showing some
   number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) and also that it will not.

   1978).

   [359] See Thomas Sheehan, The First Coming (New York: Random House,
   1976).

   [360] As in much contemporary liberal and quasi-liberal theology. See,
   e.g., Norman Perrin, The Resurrection according to Matthew, Mark, and
   Luke (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1977), p. 83: of the witnesses to
   the resurrection appearances of Jesus, he says, "in some way they were
   granted a vision of Jesus which convinced them that God had vindicated
   Jesus out of His death and that therefore the death of Jesus was by no
   means the end of the impact of Jesus upon their lives." Here we can
   bracket the question what sort of body Jesus had upon resurrection: was
   the body he had upon resurrection (whether or not it was numerically
   the same body he had before his death) a glorified body with
   supernatural powers? The latter would be still harder to establish by
   historical argument (see Robert Cavin's "Is There Sufficient Historical
   Evidence to Establish the Resurrection of Jesus?" Faith and Philosophy
   [July 1995]).

   [361] Celsus, an early critic of Christianity, apparently thought this
   probability fairly low, not much greater than .5 (see Origen, Contra
   Celsum, 1.68); let's suppose Celsus was wrong.

   [362] Swinburne (Revelation, chapter 8) proposes two criteria for
   determining what is to count as the church: continuity of aim and
   continuity of organization. The first depends on continuity of
   doctrinal teaching; but then to apply it we would already have to know
   what the true church teaches. That is, we would have to know what Jesus
   intended his church to teach; but then we can't use this test to
   determine what Jesus intended his church to teach.

  VII. Cognitive Renewal

   According to Jesus Christ himself, "unless a person is born again, he
   cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). And according to the apostle
   Paul, not as high an authority but still no slouch, a Christian
   believer becomes a new creature in Christ. The believer enters a
   process whereby she is regenerated, transformed, made into a new and
   better person. We might say she acquires a new and better nature. This
   new and better nature is also a renewal, a restoration of the nature
   with which humankind was originally created. Sin damaged our nature;
   regeneration, the work of the Holy Spirit, is (among other things) a
   matter of setting right and repairing that damage. The ravages of sin
   were of two sorts. First, affective effects: sin induces a sort of
   madness of the will whereby we fail to love God above all; instead, we
   love ourselves above all. But the damage was also cognitive. Sin
   induces a blindness, dullness, stupidity, imperceptiveness, whereby we
   are blinded to God, cannot hear his voice, do not recognize his beauty
   and glory, may even go so far as to deny that he exists.

   Regeneration heals the ravages of sin--embryonically in this life, and
   with ever greater fullness in the next. Just what are the cognitive
   benefits of regeneration? First, there is the repair of the sensus
   divinitatis, so that once again we can see God and be put in mind of
   him in the sorts of situations in which that belief-producing process
   is designed to work. The work of the Holy Spirit goes further. It gives
   us a much clearer view of the beauty, splendor, loveliness,
   attractiveness, glory of God. It enables us to see something of the
   spectacular depth of love revealed in the incarnation and atonement.
   Correlatively, it also gives me a much clearer view of the heinousness
   of sin, and of the degree and extent to which I am myself enmeshed in
   it. It gives me a better picture of my own place in the universe.
   Perhaps I will no longer see myself as the center of things, or see my
   wants, needs, and desires as more important and more worthy of
   fulfillment than anyone else's. I may come to see that I fit in as one
   of God's children, all of enormous value even if all vastly less
   important and valuable than God, and all equally important and
   valuable. There is also a certain reflexive benefit. Part of the model
   I am presenting is itself the main line of Christian belief, and it is
   part of the model that cognitive regeneration enables us to see that
   part of the model as indeed true.

   John Calvin summarizes some of these cognitive benefits in his famous
   spectacles metaphor:

   Just as old or bleary-eyed men and those with weak vision, if you
   thrust before them a most beautiful volume, even if they recognize it
   to be some sort of writing, yet can scarcely construe two words, but
   with the aid of spectacles will begin to read distinctly; so Scripture,
   gathering up the otherwise confused knowledge of God in our minds,
   having dispersed our dullness, clearly shows us the true God.
   (Institutes, p. 70)

   Here Calvin is suggesting that what we learn from Scripture and by way
   of faith gathers, focuses, and clarifies what we learn by way of the
   sensus divinitatis, enabling us to see God and his love, glory, beauty,
   and the like with much higher resolution. He could have added that it
   also gives us a clearer view of our world: we now see what is most
   important about all the furniture of heaven and earth--namely, that it
   has been created by God. We can even come to see, if we reflect, what
   is most important about numbers, propositions, properties, states of
   affairs, and possible worlds: namely, that they really are divine
   thoughts or concepts. [363]

   Still further, it enables us to see what is most important about
   ourselves, and in so doing removes the defeater that is the Achilles'
   heel of naturalism. As we saw in chapter 7, one of the most
   far-reaching of the noetic effects of sin is that it skews belief about
   our origins and the origins of our cognitive systems: it prevents us
   from seeing that we are the creatures of a just and loving God who has
   created us in his own image. We may come, instead, to think that God is
   terrible and to be feared rather than a good and loving Father, or
   distant and far off, or indifferent to us and our welfare; we may come
   to embrace some version of austere theism, or even agnosticism or
   naturalism. As we saw in chapter 7, the probability that our cognitive
   faculties are reliable, given any of these views of God, is low or
   inscrutable. Now consider anyone who accepts the view in question, and
   who sees the epistemic relation between that view and R, the
   proposition that his cognitive faculties are reliable. Such a person
   has a defeater for R--a defeater that can't itself be defeated. And
   that means that he suffers from still another noetic deficiency: he has
   a defeater for any of his own beliefs and is therefore in an irrational
   condition. But the restoration and healing induced by the work of the
   Holy Spirit also counters this noetic effect of sin. It restores us to
   a position of seeing that we have been created in God's image; in so
   doing, it removes that defeater.

   A popular objection to the evolutionary argument against naturalism is
   a tu quoque--briefly, "the same to you, buddy." Perhaps the most
   challenging version of this objection is by Keith Lehrer. Consider
   theism (and call it T')--not austere theism, but theism itself,
   including the proposition that we and our cognitive faculties have been
   created by a just and loving God and created in his image. What is
   P(R/T)? Well, maybe not as high as you think. The fact that God is just
   and loving doesn't prevent all the ills we human beings are heir
   to--warfare, cruelty, starvation, earthquakes, flood, fire, and
   pestilence. Granted, God has his own good reasons for permitting these
   things; still, they do indeed occur, and so are clearly compatible with
   our having been created by a just and loving Father. So even if God
   created humankind, he might for his own good reasons permit us to
   suffer from cognitive malfunction of some sort, cognitive disease or
   disorder; and such cognitive disorder could inhibit the reliability of
   our cognitive faculties. Even if God is wholly good, he has or may have
   permitted Satan to introduce widespread natural evil into the world;
   but then might he not also permit Satan (that father of lies) to
   introduce widespread error into the world? (Indeed, hasn't he done
   exactly that by permitting us to fall into sin?) Lehrer develops this
   thought:

   Compare, finally,

   S Satan and his cohorts produce incredible deceps of error

   with

   E Evolutionary processes produce incredible deceps of error.

   I find little to choose between them. A naturalist wishing to assign a
   high probability to the conclusion that the proper functioning of our
   faculties yields truth because they are the result of evolution must
   assign a low probability to E, while a supernaturalist wishing to
   assign a high probability to the conclusion that the proper functioning
   of our faculties yields truth because they are designed by God must
   assign a low probability to S. [364]

   And as a matter of fact, of course, according to Christianity precisely
   this or something like it has happened: God has permitted us to fall
   into sin with its attendant noetic effects. So what is P(R/T)? Wouldn't
   we have to say it is low or at any rate inscrutable, just like
   P(R/N&E)? So won't the theist join the naturalist in having a defeater
   for any of his beliefs? Won't he be in the very same leaky epistemic
   boat?

   This is a formidable objection; there is a reply. [365] For the
   Christian doesn't accept just theism; she also accepts the rest of the
   Christian story, including fall (along with corruption of the image of
   God), redemption, regeneration, and the consequent repair and
   restoration of that image. She believes she knows these truths by way
   of divine revelation. But she also knows, so she thinks, the truth of
   theism by way of divine revelation. And this delivers her (or rather R)
   from defeat. Consider an analogy. Suppose you tell me that

   (1) Feike is a very wealthy eccentric who loves to wear dilapidated old
   clothes from the local Goodwill.

   Acting on the principle that it is always a good idea to acquire some
   new true beliefs, I infer

   (2) Feike wears dilapidated old clothes.

   I have also believed for some time that

   (3) Feike is a millionaire.

   But now I note that P((3)/(2)) is low (most people who wear dilapidated
   old clothes are not millionaires); I conclude in considerable
   puzzlement that (2) is a defeater, for me, of (3), and do my best to
   refrain from believing (3). My error is plain: (2) isn't, in fact, a
   defeater for (3), for me. Why not? Well, for one thing, because I see
   that the warrant (2) has for me is derivative from the warrant (1) has
   for me, and obviously (1) is not, for me, a defeater for (3). But that
   means that (2) is not a defeater of (3). If you would like a principle,
   try:

   (4) If (i) S believes A, B, and C, and (ii) S believes that the warrant
   B has for her is derivative from the warrant A has for her, and (3) S
   believes that A is not a defeater, for her, of C, then B is not a
   defeater, for S, of C. [366]

   This principle, as I say, delivers R from defeat, for the Christian
   theist (and also delivers the evolutionary argument against naturalism
   from defeat by that tu quoque). For the Christian theist believes that
   she knows the whole Christian story, or that at any rate it has some
   considerable warrant for her. Theism is part of that story, and the
   warrant theism has for her is derivative from the warrant had for her
   of the whole Christian story. Hence by (4) theism won't be a defeater
   of R for her unless the whole Christian story is. But it isn't.
   Therefore, theism isn't a defeater of R, for her, and the objection
   crumbles.

   To recount the essential features of the model, the internal
   instigation of the Holy Spirit working in concord with God's teaching
   in Scripture is a cognitive process or belief-producing mechanism that
   produces in us the beliefs constituting faith, as well as a host of
   other beliefs. These beliefs, of course, will seem to the believer to
   be true: that is part of what it is for them to be beliefs. They will
   have the internal features of belief, of seeming to be true; and they
   can have this to various degrees. Second, according to the model, these
   beliefs will be justified; they will also have at least two further
   kinds of virtues. In the first place, they are internally rational, in
   the sense that the believer's response to the experience she has (given
   prior belief) is within the range permitted by rationality, that is, by
   proper function; there is nothing pathological there. And in the second
   place, the beliefs in question will have warrant: they will be produced
   by cognitive processes functioning properly in an appropriate
   environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at the
   production of true belief. To be sure, the process in question is not
   like the ordinary belief-producing mechanisms we have just by virtue of
   creation; it will be by a special work of the Holy Spirit. Recall
   Hume's sarcastic gibe:

   Upon the whole, we may conclude that the Christian Religion not only
   was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be
   believed by any reasonable person without one. . . . Whoever is moved
   by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued miracle in his
   own person, which subverts all the principles of his understanding, and
   gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom
   and experience. [367]

   According to the testimonial model, Hume (sarcasm aside) is partly
   right: belief in the main lines of the gospel is produced in Christians
   by a special work of the Holy Spirit, not by the belief-producing
   faculties and processes with which we were originally created. Further,
   some of what Christians believe (e.g., that a human being was dead and
   then arose from the dead) is as Hume says, contrary to custom and
   experience: it seldom happens. Of course it doesn't follow, contrary to
   Hume's implicit suggestion, that there is anything irrational or
   contrary to reason in believing it, given the internal instigation of
   the Holy Spirit.

   What I claim for this model is that there aren't any successful
   philosophical objections to it (and in chapter 10 I'll look into some
   objections); so far as philosophical considerations go, given the truth
   of Christian belief, this model, or something very much like it, could
   be no more than the sober truth. Of course there may be philosophical
   objections to the truth of Christian belief itself; I shall consider
   some of them in part IV under the guise of defeaters. But the point
   here is that if Christian belief is true, then it could very well have
   warrant in the way proposed here. If (as I claim) the fact is there are
   no good philosophical objections to the model, given the truth of
   Christian belief, then any successful objection to the model will also
   have to be a successful objection to the truth of Christian belief.

   We can take the matter a step further. If Christian belief is true,
   then very likely it does have warrant--if not in the way proposed in
   the extended A/C model, then in some other similar way. For if it is
   true, then, indeed, there is such a person as God, who has created us
   in his image; we have fallen into sin and require salvation; and the
   means to such restoral and renewal have been provided in the
   incarnation, suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the
   second person of the trinity. Furthermore, the typical way of
   appropriating this restoral is by way of faith, which, of course,
   involves belief in these things--that is, belief in the great things of
   the gospel. If so, however, God would intend that we be able to be
   aware of these truths. And if that is so, the natural thing to think is
   that the cognitive processes that do indeed produce belief in the
   central elements of the Christian faith are aimed by their designer at
   producing that belief. But then these beliefs will have warrant.

   Someone who has read his Gettier [368] might object: "Isn't it possible
   God has created a certain process p in us for coming to know the great
   things of the gospel; this process p usually malfunctions, producing no
   belief at all; while another process p* also (and serendipitously)
   malfunctions, in precisely such a way as to produce in us the very
   beliefs p would have produced, had it not malfunctioned? Then the
   Christian story would be true, but Christian belief would have no
   warrant." No doubt this scenario is possible, even if a bit
   far-fetched. Even if it happened, however, it wouldn't follow that
   Christian belief, thus produced, lacks warrant. Even if Christian
   belief was (improbably) produced by a process p* originally designed
   for some other purpose, it wouldn't follow that Christian belief does
   not have warrant. For perhaps God has adopted p* and its new way of
   working as part of the design plan for human beings. Then, once more,
   Christian belief would have warrant, even if in a bit of a roundabout
   way.

   Finally, I should like to ask how my project in this book compares with
   William Alston's in his magisterial Perceiving God. [369] There is much
   similarity and overlap, but also important difference. First, the
   central thesis of Alston's book is that "experiential awareness of God,
   or as I shall be saying, the perception of God, makes an important
   contribution to the grounds of religious belief" (p. 1). The religious
   beliefs in question are of two sorts: "beliefs to the effect that God
   is doing something currently vis-Ã -vis the subject--comforting,
   strengthening, guiding . . . --or to the effect that God has some
   (allegedly) perceivable property--goodness, power, lovingness" (p. 1).
   What kind of contribution does experiential awareness of God make to
   the grounds of such beliefs? "More specifically, a person can become
   justified in holding certain kinds of beliefs about God by virtue of
   perceiving God as being or doing so-and-so" (p. 1). Alston's central
   claim, I think, is that this experiential awareness of God (i.e., what
   seems to the subject to be experiential awareness of God) makes it
   possible for the believer to be practically rational in the doxastic
   practices in question, and practically rational to take these practices
   to be a source of epistemic justification. (See chapter 4 above for my
   evaluation of the success of this claim.)

   My project differs in three ways. First, I am concerned not primarily
   with beliefs of the two sorts Alston mentions, but rather with the
   central claims or beliefs of the Christian faith. I am not limiting my
   attention to beliefs about God's (allegedly) perceptible properties or
   his current actions with respect to the believer. My aim, instead, is
   to examine the epistemic status of the great things of the gospel: that
   Jesus Christ is the second person of the trinity, that he became
   incarnate, suffered, died, and rose from the dead, and that by atoning
   for our sins he made it possible for us human beings to achieve a right
   relationship with God. Second, the epistemic property in which I am
   most interested is not justification, taken either deontologically or
   in the way in which Alston takes it, but warrant: does Christian belief
   have, can it have, the property enough of which is what distinguishes
   knowledge from mere true belief? And can it (if true) have enough of
   that property to constitute knowledge? Third, I don't argue that these
   Christian beliefs have or can have warrant by way of perception or
   experiential awareness of God or of his presence or his properties, but
   by way of faith.

   An Alston-like project in the neighborhood of my project would be an
   effort to argue that the kinds of beliefs he mentions--that God has
   some perceptible property, that he is acting a certain way vis-Ã -vis
   the believer--could have warrant by way of perception (there aren't any
   successful philosophical objections to the claim that they do) and that
   from a Christian perspective the most satisfactory way of thinking of
   their warrant is in terms of perception of God and his properties: if
   Christian belief is, in fact, true, then (probably) these beliefs do
   have warrant in these ways. What about these suggestions? First, I take
   it Alston has adequately (and more than adequately) disposed of the
   main philosophical objections to the thought that we human beings can
   perceive God and perceive that he is amiable, delightful, powerful,
   glorious, loving, and the like. On this point, Alston is close to
   Jonathan Edwards, who is best construed, as I argued above, as holding
   that we do (not merely can) perceive God and perceive these things of
   him.

   I have just one comment to make here. There is no doubt that human
   beings seem to experience God, and to experience him as being these
   things. To many, it has indeed seemed that God is present to their
   consciousness in something like the way in which any perceptible object
   can be present to my consciousness; it is equally clear that it has
   seemed to many that they experience God as having the properties in
   question. But are these really cases of seeming to perceive? On the one
   hand, they exhibit several salient differences from paradigm cases of
   perception, such as perception of trees, horses, other people: in
   particular, the phenomenology is quite different. (Of course the
   phenomenology of the various sensuous modalities of perception
   themselves also differ from each other.) On the other hand, there is
   the crucial similarity that, in this case as in the paradigm sensory
   cases, there is that sense of being in the presence of the object in
   question, the powerful impression that it is present or presented to
   one's consciousness. The thing to say, I think, is that these cases of
   putative perception of God are such that the term perception' applies
   to them either perfectly straightforwardly, or else by way of close
   analogy. Which is it? Perhaps this is not a very important question. If
   it isn't precisely perception, it is something closely and analogically
   related to it, and related in such a way that (if, in fact, things are
   as they seem to the believer) it too can perfectly well be a source of
   warranted belief. So I have a great deal of sympathy for this
   Alston-like project and would in fact be prepared to endorse it.
   Further, while I am not completely clear about Alston's notion of
   practical rationality (see above, pp. 119ff.), I believe it is fairly
   close to my internal rationality; I would therefore concur with him in
   thinking that Christian belief does indeed enjoy these varieties of
   positive epistemic status.

   Where my project differs from Alston's, then, is that I am concerned
   not simply with those perceptual (or perceptual') beliefs Alston
   mentions. Further (and on this point I am not, so far as I know,
   disputing anything Alston says), I doubt that perception of God, in his
   sense, is the central way in which Christian belief is formed. First,
   as Alston says, it is only the fortunate few who perceive God with any
   regularity. [370] Second, the sorts of beliefs with which I am
   centrally concerned do not ordinarily seem to come to the believers in
   question by way of perception. This is so even when the occasions in
   question are not ordinary, garden-variety occasions for the formation
   and sustenance of Christian belief. Thus John Wesley's famous
   experience:

   In the evening, I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate
   Street, where one was reading Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the
   Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change
   which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart
   strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for
   salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my
   sins, even mine and saved me from the law of sin and death. [371]

   Here what Wesley comes to believe, or believe more profoundly, is just
   what the Heidelberg Catechism sees as the content of true faith: that
   the divine scheme of salvation applies to oneself personally. As far as
   one can tell, however, this wasn't a matter of perceiving God. There
   was, indeed, sensuous phenomenology ("I felt my heart strangely
   warmed") and an oft-noted kind of phenomenology; but it doesn't seem to
   be perceptual. Indeed, it isn't clear that it is possible to perceive,
   for example, that Christ has taken away my sins, or that he is the
   incarnate second person of the trinity or that he suffered and died,
   thereby enabling us to have life. Consider also the apostle Paul's
   vision on the way to Damascus: no doubt he then did perceive Jesus, and
   furthermore perceived that he said that he was indeed the Christ. So it
   is certainly possible to perceive Jesus the Christ and perceive that he
   is saying that he is the Christ; still, can we perceive that Jesus
   actually is the Christ? That he actually is the second person of the
   trinity? I'm inclined to doubt it. And the more ordinary cases where
   someone's belief in the great things of the gospel comes by way of
   faith (i.e., Scripture/internal instigation of the Holy Spirit/faith)
   seem even less properly thought of as cases of perception.

   Accordingly, there is indeed such a thing as perceiving God;
   furthermore, perceiving God plays an important role in the religious
   and spiritual lives of many Christians, in particular, Christians who
   have been blessed with considerable progress in the spiritual life.
   Indeed, we might think, following Edwards, that perceiving
   God--perceiving that he is lovely, amiable, holy, glorious, and the
   like--is an essential element in the full-blown, well-rounded Christian
   life. I agree, furthermore, that these perceptual beliefs can have
   warrant. The central Christian beliefs, however, are not perceptual
   beliefs; they come, not by way of perception of God, but by way of
   faith. The warrant those beliefs have is not perceptual warrant; it
   comes rather by way of faith. In sum, perception of God is an important
   part of the mature Christian life, but maturity in the Christian life
   isn't attained by most of us; and even for the fortunate few who do
   achieve maturity, the warrant their central Christian beliefs enjoy
   does not come by way of perception. I therefore see Alston's project
   here as covering only part of the relevant epistemological
   territory--an important part, but only a part, and not the part by way
   of which the central beliefs of the Christian faith have warrant.

   [296] It is no part of the model to suggest that explicit beliefs about
   Jesus Christ are a necessary condition of salvation: the Old Testament
   patriarchs, for example, are counted as heroes of faith in the New
   Testament (Hebrews 11), despite the fact that they presumably had no
   explicit beliefs about Jesus Christ. They trusted God to do whatever
   was necessary for their salvation and shalom, but they had no
   particular idea as to just what that might be. Furthermore, it is no
   part of the model to assert that all who believe these things have come
   to believe them by way of the processes proposed in the model: perhaps,
   for example, the apostles came to believe these truths in quite a
   different fashion.

   [297] But hasn't the historical-critical Scripture scholarship of the
   last two hundred years cast grave doubt on the reliability of the Bible
   and the claim that it is specially inspired by God? This suggestion is
   a proposed defeater for Christian belief and is the subject of chapter
   12.

   [298] E.g., John 14:26: "but the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the
   Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to
   your remembrance all that I have said to you." See also John 14:11 and
   15:26: "When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the
   Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will
   testify about me. . . ."

   [299] E.g., Ephesians 1:17-19: "I keep asking that the God of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the spirit of wisdom
   and revelation, so that you may know him better." And 1 Corinthians
   2:12-13: "We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit
   who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.
   This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in
   words taught by the Spirit. . . ."

   [300] Presented in this brief and undeveloped way, this model can seem
   unduly individualistic. But of course it doesn't at all preclude the
   importance of the Christian community and the church to the belief of
   the individual Christian. It is the church or community that proclaims
   the gospel, guides the neophyte into it, and supports, instructs,
   encourages, and edifies believers of all sorts and conditions.

   [301] For the notion of internal rationality, see above, p. 110ff.

   [302] Of course this belief-producing process isn't exactly like the
   others--memory, perception, reason, and even the sensus divinitatis.
   That is because these others are all part of our original increated
   cognitive equipment, while (according to the model) the cognitive
   process here involves a special, supernatural activity on the part of
   the Holy Spirit. But this doesn't so much as suggest that its
   deliverances can't enjoy warrant, and warrant sufficient for knowledge.
   What it suggests, instead, is that the account of warrant of Warrant
   and Proper Function must be understood in such a way that a belief can
   have warrant even if it is produced by a belief-producing process of
   this special kind. True, such a process that consists in direct divine
   activity cannot fail to function properly; we may therefore say that it
   functions properly in a limiting sense of the term.

The Testimonial Model:
Sealed upon Our Hearts

   Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
   with all your mind and with all your strength.

   Jesus Christ

   If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all
   knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not
   love, I am nothing.

   St. Paul

   He that has doctrinal knowledge and speculation only, without
   affection, never is engaged in the business of religion.

     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Belief and Affection

   In chapter 8, I proposed a model to show how Christian belief can have
   warrant. On this model, Christian belief is produced in the believer by
   the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of
   Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The
   result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith--which, according to
   both John Calvin and the model, is "a firm and certain knowledge of
   God's benevolence towards us, founded upon the truth of the freely
   given promise in Christ, both revealed to our minds and sealed upon our
   hearts through the Holy Spirit." According to the model, these beliefs
   enjoy justification, rationality, and warrant. We may therefore say
   with Calvin that they are "revealed to our minds." There is more,
   however; they are also "sealed upon our hearts." What could this latter
   mean, and how does it figure into the model? Given that these truths
   are revealed to our minds, what more could we need? Why must they also
   be sealed upon our hearts? To answer, suppose we ask whether one could
   hold the beliefs in question but nonetheless fail to have faith. The
   traditional Christian answer is, "Well yes: the demons believe and they
   shudder" (James 2:19); [372] but the demons do not have faith. So what
   is the difference? What more is there to faith than belief? What
   distinguishes the Christian believer from the demons?

   According to the model, [373] the shape of the answer is given in the
   text just mentioned: the demons shudder. They believe these things, but
   hate them; and they also hate God. Perhaps they also hope against hope
   that these things aren't really so, or perhaps they believe them in a
   self-deceived way. They know of God's power and know that they have no
   hope of winning any contest of power with him; nevertheless, they
   engage in just such a contest, perhaps in that familiar self-deceived
   condition of really knowing, in one sense, that they couldn't possibly
   win such a contest, while at some other level nevertheless refusing to
   accept this truth, or hiding it from themselves. [374] Or perhaps the
   problem here is not merely cognitive but affective: knowing that they
   couldn't possibly win, they insist on fighting anyway, thinking of
   themselves as courageously Promethean, as heroically contending against
   nearly insuperable odds, a condition, they point out, in which God
   never finds himself, and hence a way in which they can think of
   themselves as his moral superior. The devils also know of God's
   wonderful scheme for the salvation of human beings, but they find this
   scheme--with its mercy and suffering love--offensive and unworthy. No
   doubt they endorse Nietzsche's notion that Christian love (including
   the love displayed in incarnation and atonement) is weak, whining,
   resentful, servile, duplicitous, pusillanimous, tergiversatory, and in
   general unappealing.

   The person with faith, however, not only believes the central claims of
   the Christian faith; she also (paradigmatically) finds the whole scheme
   of salvation enormously attractive, delightful, moving, a source of
   amazed wonderment. She is deeply grateful to the Lord for his great
   goodness and responds to his sacrificial love with love of her own. The
   difference between believer and devil, therefore, lies in the area of
   affections: of love and hate, attraction and repulsion, desire and
   detestation. In traditional categories, the difference lies in the
   orientation of the will. Not primarily in the executive function of the
   will (the function of making decisions, of seeking and avoiding various
   states of affairs), though of course that is also involved, but in its
   affective function, its function of loving and hating, finding
   attractive or repellent, approving or disapproving. And the believer,
   the person with faith, has the right beliefs, but also the right
   affections. Conversion and regeneration alters affection as well as
   belief.

   According to Calvin, it is the Holy Spirit who is responsible for this
   sealing upon our hearts of that firm and certain knowledge of God's
   benevolence toward us; it is the Holy Spirit who is responsible for
   this renewal and redirection of affections. Calvin is sometimes
   portrayed as spiritually cold, aloof, bloodless, rationalistic--a
   person in whom intellect unduly predominates. These charges may (or may
   not) have some validity with respect to the Reformed scholasticism of a
   century later; even a cursory examination of Calvin's work, however,
   reveals that with respect to him they are wildly inaccurate. [375]
   Calvin's emblem was a flaming heart on an outstretched hand; it bore
   the motto: Cor meum quasi immolatum tibi offero, Domine. [376] Of the
   Holy Spirit, he says that "persistently boiling away and burning up our
   vicious and inordinate desires, he enflames our hearts with the love of
   God and with zealous devotion." [377] The Institutes are throughout
   aimed at the practice of the Christian life (which essentially involves
   the affections), not at theological theory; the latter enters only in
   the service of the former.

   So the initial difference between believer and demon is a matter of
   affections: the former is inspired to gratitude and love, the latter to
   fear, hatred, and contempt. The Holy Spirit produces knowledge, in the
   believer; in sealing this knowledge to our hearts, however, it also
   produces the right affections. Chief among these right affections is
   love of God--desire for God, desire to know him, to have a personal
   relationship with him, desire to achieve a certain kind of unity with
   him, as well as delight in him, relishing his beauty, greatness,
   holiness, and the like. There is also trust, approval, gratitude,
   intending to please, expecting good things, and much more. Faith,
   therefore, isn't just a matter of believing certain propositions--not
   even the momentous propositions of the gospel. Faith is more than
   belief; in producing faith, the Holy Spirit does more than produce in
   us the belief that this or that proposition is indeed true. As Aquinas
   repeats four times in five pages, "the Holy Spirit makes us lovers of
   God." [378] And according to Martin Luther,

   there are two ways of believing. In the first place I may have faith
   concerning God. This is the case when I hold to be true what is said
   concerning God. Such faith is on the same level with the assent I give
   to statements concerning the Turk, the devil and hell. A faith of this
   kind should be called knowledge or information rather than faith. In
   the second place there is faith in. Such faith is mine when I not only
   hold to be true what is said concerning God, but when I put my trust in
   him in such a way as to enter into personal relations with him,
   believing firmly that I shall find him to be and to do as I have been
   taught. . . . The word in is well chosen and deserving of due
   attention. We do not say, I believe God the Father or concerning God
   the Father, but in God the Father, in Jesus Christ, and in the Holy
   Spirit. [379]

   Following Luther, we may distinguish believing in God from believing
   that God exists. The latter itself comes in two varieties: theism, and
   believing de re of God that he exists. A theist is one who believes a
   certain proposition: that there is an all-powerful, all-knowing, wholly
   good person who has created and sustains the world. Where God is indeed
   the unique being meeting this condition, the theist believes that there
   is such a being, but also, no doubt, believes of God, the being who in
   fact meets this description, that he exists. It isn't necessary,
   however, that he does the latter; perhaps he forms the de dicto belief
   but never performs the de re act of believing something or other of the
   being in question. It is even clearer that one can believe of God that
   he exists without being a theist: one can believe of God that he exists
   even if one is (from the theist's point of view) confused and mistaken
   about what properties God has. Perhaps I encounter God in experience,
   believing that he loves me, or perhaps I pick him out as the being that
   my parents worship. Then I will believe of God that he exists, even if
   I fail (for example) to believe that God created the world. (Perhaps,
   like some Mormons, I think God himself was created, and add that the
   world has always existed and was not created.) It is even possible to
   believe of God that he exists and be an atheist: I encounter God in
   experience, believe of the thing that I encounter that it exists, but
   fail to believe that this thing I encounter is all-powerful or
   all-knowing or wholly good, or has created the world; and I also
   believe that there is nothing that has those properties. Believing in
   God, of course, is different from either believing of God that he
   exists or being a theist. The demons, no doubt, are theists and also
   believe of God that he exists; the demons do not believe in God,
   because they do not trust and love God and do not make his purposes
   their own.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [372] Perhaps this needs qualification. The content of faith is
   plausibly indexical: a person x has faith only if x believes or knows
   that God is benevolent toward x herself. But perhaps the devils do not
   believe that God is benevolent toward them. They know that God is
   all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good, and that he has arranged
   a way of salvation for human beings; but perhaps they reject the belief
   that God is benevolent toward them. (Note, incidentally, that the
   author of James sometimes (in chapter 2, e.g.) seems to use the term
   faith' to mean mere cognitive or intellectual assent.)

   [373] And perhaps also according to Calvin. He sees this sealing, as in
   the first instance, a matter of God's putting his mark, imprint, seal
   upon the believer; but perhaps this seal consists in the believer's
   having the appropriate affections.

   [374] See Milton's Paradise Lost, books 5 and 6.

   [375] See, e.g., Dennis Tamburello, Union with Christ: John Calvin and
   the Mysticism of St. Bernard (Louisville, Ky: Westminster John Knox
   Press, 1994), chapters 1-3.

   [376] "My heart, as if aflame, I offer to you, Oh Lord." This
   particular phenomenology--a phenomenology that is naturally expressed
   in terms of one's heart being warmed or even aflame--goes back in the
   Christian tradition at least to the disciples who met the risen Christ
   on the road to Emmaus: "Then their eyes were opened and they recognized
   him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other Were
   not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road
   and opened the Scriptures to us?'?" (Luke 24:31-32). There are parallel
   passages in Aquinas; and in Preface to the Epistle to the Romans
   (1522), Luther says that faith "sets the heart aflame." John Wesley
   reports, "As one was reading Luther's Preface to Romans . . . I felt my
   heart strangely warmed." In the Orthodox tradition, St. Seraphim of
   Sarov reports something similar (see William Abraham, "The
   Epistemological Significance of the Inner Witness of the Holy Spirit,"
   Faith and Philosophy 7, no. 4, p. 440).

  II. Jonathan Edwards

   Our topic, therefore, essentially involves the affections. In trying to
   understand the religious affections, we can obviously do no better than
   to consult Jonathan Edwards, one of the great masters of the interior
   life and a peerless student of the religious affections. Edwards, of
   course, concurs with Calvin that true religion is more than just right
   belief. Indeed, according to him, true religion is first a matter of
   having the right affections: "True religion, in great part, consists in
   holy affections." [380] "The Holy Scriptures do everywhere place
   religion very much in the affections; such as fear, hope, love, hatred,
   desire, joy, sorrow, gratitude, compassion and zeal" (p. 102). Mere
   knowledge isn't enough for true religion:

   There is a distinction to be made between a mere notional
   understanding, wherein the mind only beholds things in the exercise of
   a speculative faculty; and the sense of the heart, wherein the mind
   don't only speculate and behold, but relishes and feels. That sort of
   knowledge, by which a man has a sensible perception of amiableness and
   loathsomeness, or of sweetness and nauseousness, is not just the same
   sort of knowledge with that, by which he knows what a triangle is, and
   what a square is. The one is mere speculative knowledge; the other
   sensible knowledge, in which more than the mere intellect is concerned;
   the heart is the proper subject of it, or the soul as a being that not
   only beholds, but has inclination, and is pleased or displeased. (p.
   272)

   Of course he doesn't think true religion is just a matter of
   affections, of loves and hates, as if belief and understanding had no
   role to play: "Holy affections are not heat without light; but evermore
   arise from some information of the understanding, some spiritual
   instruction that the mind receives, some light or actual knowledge" (p.
   266). Still, true religion primarily involves (so he seems to say) the
   affections, in particular love: "all true religion summarily consists
   in the love of divine things" (p. 271). And love brings other
   affections in its train: "love to God," he says, "causes a man to
   delight in the thoughts of God, and to delight in the presence of God
   and to desire conformity to God, and the enjoyment of God" (p. 208);
   elsewhere, he adds that one who loves God will also delight in
   contemplating the great things of the gospel, taking pleasure in them,
   finding them attractive, marvelous, winsome (p. 250). Further, one who
   thus delights in the great truths of the gospel may find himself
   disgusted by various attempts (see chapter 2) to trade that splendidly
   rich and powerful gospel for cheap and trivial substitutes. Still
   further, acquiring the right affections enables one to see the true
   heinousness of sin: "he who sees the beauty of holiness, must
   necessarily see the hatefulness of sin, its contrary" (p. 274); and he
   who sees the hatefulness of sin (in himself and others) will also
   (given proper function) hate it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Intellect and Will: Which Is Prior?

   But how exactly is this supposed to work? What is the relation between
   affection and belief here, between will and intellect? Which, if
   either, is primary? Is it that first one sees (i.e., comes to know or
   believe) that the great things of the gospel and God himself are lovely
   and amiable, and then comes to love them? Or is it rather that first
   one comes to love them, thus coming to see that the things in question
   are, indeed, worthy of love? In working in our hearts, does the Holy
   Spirit first and supernaturally get us to see the truths of the great
   things of the gospel, our affections naturally following suit (so that
   we come to love and delight in them)? Or is it rather that the Holy
   Spirit first corrects our affections, cures the madness of our wills,
   so that we begin to love God above all rather than ourselves, as a
   result of which we come to believe the great things of the gospel? Or
   is neither prior, so that will and intellect are cured simultaneously?
   This question, of course, is connected with a correlative question we
   examined in chapter 7: is sin primarily a matter of intellect, of
   blindness, of failing to see or believe the right things, thus leading
   to wrong affection and wrong action? Or is it primarily a matter of the
   wrong affections, of loving and hating the wrong things?

   Although Edwards emphasizes the centrality of the affections, he also
   seems to endorse the position that intellect is prior to will. He seems
   to suggest that the believer first sees the beauty, amiability,
   loveliness of God and the great things of the gospel, her affections
   then naturally following:

   [The saints] first see that God is lovely, and that Christ is excellent
   and glorious, and their hearts are first captivated with this view, and
   the exercises of their love are wont from time to time to begin here,
   and to arise primarily from these views; and then, consequentially,
   they see God's love; and great favor to them. (p. 246)

   Here the focus of his attention isn't the question whether it is
   intellect or will that is prior (but whether the saints first see that
   God loves them and then come themselves to love God, or the other way
   around). Nevertheless, there is the clear suggestion that what happens
   first is that the saint sees that God is lovely and Christ excellent
   and glorious; this vision is captivating, delightful, winsome; the
   result is love for God. Elsewhere he is more explicit: "Knowledge is
   the key that first opens the hard heart and enlarges the affections,
   and so opens the way for men into the kingdom of heaven" (p. 266);
   "Gracious affections do arise from the mind's being enlightened,
   rightly and spiritually to understand or apprehend divine things."
   Furthermore,

   Truly spiritual and gracious affections . . . arise from the
   enlightening of the understanding to understand the things that are
   taught of God and Christ, in a new manner, the coming to a new
   understanding of the excellent nature of God, and his wonderful
   perfections, some new view of Christ in his spiritual excellencies and
   fullness, or things opened to him in a new manner, that appertain to
   the way of salvation by Christ, whereby he now sees how it is, and
   understands those divine and spiritual doctrines which once were
   foolishness to him. . . . That all gracious affections do arise from
   some instruction or enlightening of the understanding, is therefore a
   further proof. (pp. 267, 268)

   This apparently fits less than perfectly well with another of Edwards's
   characteristic doctrines: that what lies at the bottom of sin is
   hardness of heart--which, he says, is a matter of having the wrong
   affections, or (less disastrously) at any rate lacking the right
   affections:

   Divines are generally agreed, that sin radically and fundamentally
   consists in what is negative, or privative, having its root and
   foundation in a privation or want of holiness. And therefore
   undoubtedly, if it be so that sin does very much consist in hardness of
   heart, and so in the want of pious affections of heart; holiness does
   consist very much in those pious affections. (p. 118)

   Now by a hard heart, is plainly meant an unaffected heart, or a heart
   not easy to be moved with virtuous affections, like a stone,
   insensible, stupid, unmoved and hard to be impressed. Hence the hard
   heart is called [in Scripture] a stony heart, and is opposed to an
   heart of flesh, that has feeling, and is sensibly touched and moved.
   (p. 117)

   These passages suggest (as I argued in chapter 7) that sin is
   fundamentally a matter of failing to have the right affections and
   having the wrong ones; it isn't (in the first instance, anyway) a
   failure of knowledge. It is less a failure to see something than to
   feel something. [381] The hard-hearted person fails to love the right
   things; he lacks the virtuous affections of love for the Lord and
   neighbor and for the great truths of the gospel; he also lacks the
   hatred and sorrow for sin, gratitude for salvation, joy, peace, and all
   the rest that flow from a proper love of God. And that suggests that on
   receiving the gift of faith and the rebirth (regeneration) that goes
   with it, what happens is that the affections are redirected, so that
   one makes at least the first halting steps in the direction of loving
   God above all.

   Somehow consequent upon that is a new knowledge of the loveliness and
   gloriousness of God and of the Christian story as well. Still, this
   suggestion is compatible with the thought that in acquiring faith it is
   a kind of knowledge or enlightenment that is prior. Perhaps sin is,
   indeed, a malfunction of the will (a misdirection of affection);
   perhaps this malfunction is, indeed, what is repaired with
   regeneration; but perhaps the way this repair is effected is by way of
   being granted a certain kind of knowledge or enlightenment. It can be
   both that sin is fundamentally malfunction or dysfunction of the will,
   and that what comes first in regeneration is a certain understanding or
   insight. Then revealing would be prior to sealing, with respect to
   faith, even though what needs repair is, at bottom, will rather than
   intellect.

   Sometimes Edwards seems to suggest that neither intellect nor will is
   prior:

   Spiritual understanding consists primarily in a sense of heart of that
   spiritual beauty. I say, a sense of heart; for it is not speculation
   merely that is concerned in this kind of understanding: nor can there
   be a clear distinction made between the two faculties of understanding
   and will, as acting distinctly and separately, in this matter. When the
   mind is sensible of the sweet beauty and amiableness of a thing, that
   implies a sensibleness of sweetness and delight in the presence of the
   idea of it; and this sensibleness of the amiableness or delightfulness
   of beauty, carries in the very nature of it, the sense of the heart; or
   an effect and impression the soul is the subject of, as a substance
   possessed of taste, inclination and will. (p. 272)

   If there is no clear distinction between the two, then clearly neither
   is prior to the other. Even in this passage, however, it looks as if,
   according to Edwards, intellect really is prior. He speaks here of "a
   sense of heart"; that sounds like affection, but I think appearances
   are deceiving. To see how, we must note one further characteristic
   Edwardsian idea: that upon conversion and regeneration the believer
   acquires a "new simple idea." She thus acquires the ability to perceive
   something she wasn't able to perceive before. She can now perceive the
   beauty and amiability of the Lord, something she was unable to do prior
   to conversion. This ability involves a new phenomenology, one not
   available to "natural men":

   For if there be in the saints a kind of apprehension or perception,
   which is in its nature, perfectly diverse from all that natural men
   have, or that it is possible they should have, till they have a new
   nature; it must consist in their having a certain kind of ideas or
   sensations of mind, which are simply diverse from all that is or can be
   in the minds of natural men. And that is the same thing as to say, that
   it consists in the sensations of a new spiritual sense. (p. 271)

   Here Edwards speaks the epistemological language of the mid-eighteenth
   century. Knowledge or cognition involves mental entities Locke calls
   ideas' and Hume impressions and ideas'. These are on the order of
   mental images, like bits of visual or auditory imagery or other
   sensuous imagery. The details of the process, as the British
   empiricists thought of it, need not concern us now (and in any event
   are incoherent). But (to take an Edwardsian example) think of the taste
   of honey. You know what honey tastes like, and that knowledge crucially
   involves a certain kind of phenomenology. You wouldn't know what honey
   tastes like unless you actually tasted it (or in some other way
   experienced that taste). You can't have knowledge (more exactly,
   sensible knowledge) of the taste of honey or of its sweetness, without
   undergoing that phenomenology--without having that simple idea (as
   Edwards would think of it). There is a certain kind of experience that
   normally goes with seeing something red, and there is a certain kind of
   knowledge, namely, knowledge of what it's like to see something red,
   that you aren't able to have unless you have that experience. (Maybe
   this experience is a little like hearing the sound of a trumpet; still,
   that kind of analogy can take us only so far.) One who has never tasted
   sweetness or perceived red can know a good deal about the sweetness of
   honey and the look of something red (e.g., that both are experienced by
   many people, that people find the first pleasant and the second mildly
   exciting); there is also something she doesn't know, namely, what honey
   tastes like and what a sunset looks like.

   Now according to Edwards, one kind of experiential knowledge is
   spiritual knowledge; more exactly, there is such a thing as spiritual
   knowledge, and spiritual knowledge is experiential knowledge. This is
   knowledge of God's moral' qualities, as Edwards puts it--knowledge of
   his holiness, loveliness, beauty, glory, and amiability. Like knowledge
   of the taste and sweetness of honey, this knowledge requires that one
   have a certain characteristic phenomenal imagery, "a certain kind of
   ideas or sensations of mind," as he puts it. This is a new idea and a
   new simple idea. It is simple, first, because (unlike the image of a
   house, say) it is not compounded out of other ideas. And it is new in
   the sense that it is not available to "natural men"; it is available
   only to those in whom the process of regeneration has begun. In the
   fall into sin, Edwards thinks, we human beings lost a certain cognitive
   ability: the ability to apprehend God's moral qualities. With
   conversion comes regeneration; part of the latter is the regeneration
   (to a greater or lesser extent) of this cognitive ability to grasp or
   apprehend the beauty, sweetness, amiability of the Lord himself and of
   the whole scheme of salvation. And it is just this cognitive ability
   that involves that new simple idea. There is little to say by way of
   describing this new experience except to say that it is the experience
   of God's moral qualities; and one who doesn't have this new simple
   idea--one in whom the cognitive process in question has not been
   regenerated--doesn't have spiritual knowledge of God's beauty and
   loveliness. [382] Such a person may know, in a way, that God is
   beautiful and lovely (perhaps she takes this on the authority of
   someone else), but there is a kind of knowledge of this loveliness she
   doesn't have (experiential knowledge), and it is precisely this kind of
   knowledge that is the spiritual knowledge of which Edwards speaks.
   Spiritual knowledge is experiential knowledge, and a necessary
   condition of having the latter is having the right phenomenology, the
   right imagery, the new simple idea.

   I spoke of a cognitive ability, the ability to grasp and apprehend the
   beauty and sweetness and amiability of the Lord and of the great things
   of the gospel. Edwards constantly uses more specific language, the
   language of perception. One in whom the process of regeneration has
   reached a certain point can see the beauty of the Lord, taste his
   sweetness, feel his presence. I believe Edwards thinks these uses of
   the terms see', taste', and feel' are figurative or (better)
   analogical. On the other hand he thinks the term perceive' is being
   used perfectly literally, and in the same sense in which it is used
   when we speak of sight and hearing, taste and touch as perception. This
   ability to apprehend the beauty and glory of the Lord is in fact a
   perceptual ability. One may know that the Lord is, indeed, beautiful
   and glorious; there is also the different condition of perceiving that
   the Lord is beautiful and glorious. Here Edwards appeals to the
   language of Scripture, which often represents regeneration as a matter
   of giving eyes to see, ears to hear, unstopping the ears of the deaf,
   opening the eyes of the blind. It is important to see that Edwards
   thinks of these properties--beauty, glory, holiness, as well as love
   and benevolence--as genuine and objective properties, genuinely
   inhering in God. It isn't that beauty is really a subjective reaction
   on our part to something or other; rather, there is the property the
   Lord has of being beautiful; we grasp or apprehend that property and
   that the Lord has it; and a necessary condition of so doing is
   undergoing a certain kind of phenomenology. And of course this
   precisely mirrors the situation with respect to sensory perception.
   [383]

   Edwards believes we perceive these moral qualities of God; and I
   believe that Edwards's views here are, at the least, plausible. I don't
   propose to canvass the objections to perception of God, however, or
   defend its plausibility. That is because this has already been done in
   fine style by William Alston. [384] Alston shows that none of the
   objections to perception of God--that only material objects can be
   perceived (and God isn't a material object), that there aren't the
   right kinds of tests and measurements, that we can't demonstrate that
   the alleged perception is veridical and hence really perception, that
   not everyone has this alleged ability, that people disagree as to what
   it is that they (as they take it) perceive of God, and all the
   rest--Alston clearly shows that none of these objections is anywhere
   nearly cogent. He also develops a powerful generic account of
   perception according to which perception of God is perfectly possible.
   If indeed there is such a person as God, there is no reason why he
   couldn't have endowed us, his creation and his children, with the
   ability to perceive him and to perceive that he has certain properties.

   We can now return to the question that occasioned this detour:
   according to Edwards, which comes first, affection or intellection?
   Love for God or knowledge of God? I think Edwards's answer is that it
   is knowledge. I think he thinks that one first perceives the beauty and
   loveliness of the Lord, first comes to this experiential knowledge, and
   then comes to develop the right loves and hates: love for the Lord, for
   the great truths of the gospel, hatred for sin: "all gracious
   affections do arise from some instruction or enlightening of the
   understanding"; "Gracious affections do arise from the mind's being
   enlightened, rightly and spiritually to understand or apprehend divine
   things." What he means here, I think, is that this experiential
   knowledge of God and his qualities comes first; then there is a
   consequent raising of affections. "Truly spiritual and gracious
   affections . . . arise from . . . some new view of Christ in his
   spiritual excellencies and fullness." His idea, I think, is that the
   regenerated person perceives the beauty and loveliness of the Lord and
   of the great things of the gospel and then, naturally enough, comes to
   love them. It is the perceiving that comes first; in this respect,
   therefore, intellect is prior to will.

   Is Edwards right? Is it really true that intellect precedes will, that
   knowledge precedes love in this case? The question divides itself. We
   may think of the structure of intellect and will as follows. There are
   various dependency relations among the acts of intellect and will, of
   such a sort that certain intellectual acts (acts of cognition) are
   necessary conditions for certain acts of will. Any given act of will
   could be basic in the sense that it doesn't depend on any prior act of
   intellect, and any given act of intellect could be basic in the sense
   that it doesn't depend on any prior act of will. Perhaps one can't love
   God without first seeing that he is, indeed, lovely and attractive; if
   so, then no act of loving God will be basic in the present sense. On
   the other hand, perhaps certain affective acts do not depend on any
   prior acts of intellection; if so, those acts will be basic. What is
   the relevant sense of dependency involved? I suggest that it is a
   matter of design plan: an act of will is dependent, for a creature S,
   on a certain act of intellect if and only if S's design plan specifies
   that S will engage in the act of will in question only consequent upon
   engaging in the kind of act of intellect in question. [385]

   Given these preliminaries, it is evident that there are several
   different ways to take the claim that intellect precedes will here. It
   might be claimed only that

   (1) For any affective act of will, there is at least one kind of act of
   intellect upon which it is dependent, and some acts of intellect are
   not dependent on any act of will.

   By way of illustration, perhaps no one who is functioning properly
   comes to love God without first seeing, knowing, that God is indeed
   lovely and attractive (and perhaps that latter cognitive act must
   involve Edwards's experiential knowledge); but perhaps that cognitive,
   intellective act of knowing that God is lovely and attractive is not
   dependent on any (affective) act of will. One comes to see that God is
   lovely and then (and therefore) loves him. This is quite compatible
   with there being some acts of intellect that are dependent on acts of
   will; it requires only that there also be some that are not. So it
   might be held, more strenuously, that

   (2) For every (affective) act of will, there is a prior act of
   intellect on which it is dependent, and for no act of intellect is
   there a prior act of will on which it is dependent.

   It isn't easy to see which (if either) of these Edwards means to
   assert. And perhaps, indeed, he means to assert neither; perhaps he is
   thinking just of religious affections and the characteristic acts of
   intellect associated with them. Perhaps he means to claim only that the
   religious affections depend on a preceding (or concomitant) grasp or
   perception of some of the qualities of God, although it is not the case
   that perception of God's moral qualities is dependent on a prior
   affection. Perhaps he means to say that, in the process of
   regeneration, what happens first is that the Holy Spirit enables one to
   perceive something of God's moral qualities; this then (according to
   the normal working of the design plan) raises one's religious
   affections. He is committed to this much, but perhaps to nothing
   stronger.

   Still, even this much is too strong. In the state of sin, we are
   inclined to be indisposed to God and neighbor; this is the essence of
   our sinful condition. The real problem, then, is a matter of will. It
   isn't merely that we fail to see the beauty of the Lord and the
   lovableness of our brothers and sisters, thus failing to love them.
   Mere absence of the right affections is only part of the problem; there
   is also the fact that we are inclined to be resentful and dismissive
   toward the Lord and competitive and self-serving with respect to other
   people. What is required here isn't, first of all, more knowledge.
   Given our sinful inclinations to hate God and neighbor, we might
   perceive God's moral qualities and nonetheless continue to hold him at
   arm's length, refusing to love him--perhaps thus being in an even worse
   condition than when his presence was obscured by the smoke of our
   wrongdoing (Anselm) and we hated him, as it were, from afar.

   Edwards might retort that one simply can't perceive the moral qualities
   of God and fail to love him, to be attracted by him, to find him
   marvelously delightful and fascinating. This is dubious at best. No
   doubt one whose affective capacities or faculties are functioning
   properly will love the Lord on perceiving his loveliness, glory, and
   beauty; no doubt such a person will find him delightful. Conversely,
   consider someone who did perceive God's beauty and glory but was
   nonetheless put off by him: such a person would be malfunctioning in
   some way. (A person who saw God's beauty but didn't love him wouldn't,
   perhaps, describe God as beautiful (although he might describe him as
   terrible and fascinating, as a bird, transfixed by terror, might
   describe a snake, or a mariner the horrifying beauty and power of a
   storm that threatens his life); it doesn't follow that he doesn't, in
   fact, perceive that beauty.) When intellect and will function properly
   and are appropriately tuned to each other, we will delight in what we
   see to be delightful, love what we see to be amiable. [386] A chief
   component of sin, however, just is dysfunction of the affections; and
   there is no good reason to think someone suffering from a mad
   misdirection of affection couldn't be put off by what he saw to be
   beautiful. Curing the cognitive effects of sin doesn't automatically
   cure the affective madness. The gift of faith and consequent
   regeneration isn't just a matter of restoring the intellect to a
   pristine condition in which we can once again perceive God and his
   glories and beauties; it also, and essentially, requires curing that
   madness of the will.

   So which is primary in faith and regeneration: intellect or will? I say
   neither. Sin is a malfunction of the will, a skewing of affections; it
   is loving and hating the wrong things. Still, it also involves
   blindness, an inability to see the glory and beauty of the Lord. The
   answer to the question which is prior?' is neither' or there's no
   saying'. Regeneration is a matter of curing both intellectual and
   affective disorders. The structure of will and intellect here is
   perhaps a spiral, dialectical process: heightened affections enable us
   to see more of God's beauty and glory; being able to see more of God's
   beauty and glory and majesty in turn leads to heightened affections.
   There are certain things you won't know unless you love, have the right
   affections; there are certain affections you won't have without
   perceiving some of God's moral qualities; neither perceiving nor
   affection can be said to be prior to the other. Regeneration consists
   in curing the will, so that we at least begin to love and hate the
   right things; it also includes cognitive renewal, so that we come to
   perceive the beauty, holiness, and delightfulness of the Lord and of
   the scheme of salvation he has devised.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [381] Though of course I don't mean to suggest for a moment that an
   affection is simply a feeling of some sort, as if it had no intentional
   component.

   [382] According to Edwards, those who have the requisite experience and
   enjoy the requisite phenomenology note that previous to this experience
   they hadn't really understood such phrases as a spiritual sight of
   Christ'; these terms had not conveyed "those special and distinct ideas
   to their minds which they were intended to signify; in some respects no
   more than the names of colors are to convey the ideas to one that is
   blind from birth" (The Great Awakening, ed. C. C. Goen [New Haven: Yale
   University Press, 1972], p. 174).

   [383] For an insightful account of Edwards's sense of the heart (with
   extensive and useful quotations from Edwards's works), see William
   Wainwright's "Jonathan Edwards and the Sense of the Heart," Faith and
   Philosophy 7, no. 1 (January 1990).

   [384] Perceiving God (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991). See also
   my reply in chapter 10 to Richard Gale's suggestion that perception of
   God is not possible.

   [385] Of course there are other kinds of dependency; we could call the
   variety currently under discussion design plan dependency'. For present
   purposes I'm thinking of design plan dependency as including logical
   and causal dependency; thus, if a given act of will's (intellect's)
   occurring entails or causally necessitates a given act of intellect's
   (will's) occurring, the former act will be design-plan-dependent on the
   latter.

   [386] As I see it, therefore, there are such properties as being
   delightful, desirable, beautiful, and the like; there is also the
   cognitive condition of noting that something is delightful, desirable,
   or beautiful; in addition, there is the affective condition of
   delighting in the thing in question, or desiring it, or admiring and
   being drawn to its beauty. I believe Edwards concurs.

    B. The Affirmations of Faith

   So far we have been speaking of perception of God, religious
   affections, and relations between them. Now we turn to a different
   though related question: how is it, according to Edwards, that we come
   to believe what he calls the great things of the gospel--trinity,
   incarnation, atonement, and so on? It is one thing to perceive the
   glory and beauty of the Lord and something quite different to know that
   Jesus Christ was, in fact, the divine son of God who took on human
   flesh, and suffered and died, thereby atoning for human sin. Do we also
   perceive the latter? No. Edwards doesn't believe that we perceive the
   great truths of the gospel; we do not perceive such qualities of the
   Lord as that he loved us so much that he sent his only begotten son to
   suffer and die, thus enabling us to have life. A certain sort of
   perception may be involved in our coming to know these things, but we
   don't perceive these things themselves:

   A view of this divine glory directly convinces the mind of the divinity
   of these things, as this glory is in itself a direct, clear and
   all-conquering evidence of it. . . . He that has his judgment thus
   directly convinced and assured of the divinity of the things of the
   gospel, by a clear view of their divine glory, has a reasonable
   conviction; his belief and assurance is altogether agreeable to reason;
   because the divine glory and beauty of divine things is in itself, real
   evidence of their divinity, and the most direct and strong evidence. He
   that truly sees the divine, transcendent, supreme glory of these things
   which are divine, does as it were know their divinity intuitively; he
   not only argues that they are divine, but he sees that they are divine;
   he sees that in them wherein divinity chiefly consists. (p. 298)

   There are two ways of understanding this and similar passages. On the
   one hand, Edwards might think the believer perceives the divine glory
   and beauty of the things of the gospel, and then infers from that, in a
   quick argument, that they are indeed divine, from God, and hence are to
   be believed. On the other hand, the account could be that the believer
   sees the loveliness and beauty--divine beauty--of the things of the
   gospel, and consequently and immediately forms the beliefs that these
   things are true and that they are from God. The difference would be
   that, in the first case, there is an inference, perhaps so quick and
   inexplicit that one scarcely notices it, but an inference nonetheless.
   Then the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit would work as follows:
   the Holy Spirit enables the believer to see the glory and beauty of the
   gospel, whereupon she infers that they are in fact divine and hence to
   be believed. The "real evidence" Edwards mentions would be
   propositional evidence: it would be such propositions as this (one of
   the gospel teachings) is glorious and beautiful; and the conclusion
   would be this teaching is from God (and hence true).

   On the second construal, a perception of the glory and beauty of the
   teaching in question would be an occasion of the formation of the
   belief that the teaching is indeed from God (and is true), but the
   transition from the one to the other would not be by way of an
   inference. The belief in question would be held in the basic way,
   although occasioned by the perception of something else (the beauty and
   glory of the teaching in question). This second way would resemble the
   way in which (as I see it) Calvin thinks the sensus divinitatis
   operates. It isn't that upon beholding the glory of the mountains or
   the majesty of the ocean one infers that there is such a person as God
   who has created it; rather, the perception of the mountains or ocean
   (or one's own sin, or danger, or . . . ) is the occasion of the
   formation of the belief about God in question. On this construal, the
   "real evidence" in question wouldn't be propositional evidence
   functioning as premise for an inference. It would rather be something
   else that makes the belief in question evident--that is, something else
   that plays the appropriate role in the belief's having warrant for one.
   It would be like the role played by perception of someone else's facial
   expression in coming to the warranted belief that she is angry or
   depressed or delighted: again, even if I don't infer the latter from
   the former, the former is still my evidence for the latter in the sense
   that the former is (part of) what makes the latter evident (warranted)
   for me.

   Under the second construal, there are again two ways things could go.
   It could be that perception of the beauty and delightfulness of the
   great things of the gospel directly and without intermediary occasions
   the formation of the relevant belief. Then again, it could be that the
   Holy Spirit enables the believer to perceive that beauty and
   delightfulness and also enables her to make the right affective
   response of delight, admiration, and love: and it is that affective
   response which is the immediate occasion of the belief in question. You
   see that the great things of the gospel are glorious and beautiful; you
   find them winsome, delightful, and attractive; so you believe them. If
   things went this second way, then with respect to the formation of
   belief in the great things of the gospel, will (affection) would
   precede intellect.

   Which of these is the truth of the matter? What does Edwards think: is
   there or isn't there a quick inference involved? It's not easy to tell,
   and indeed perhaps he thinks the belief is formed both ways at once:
   "he not only argues that they are divine, but he sees that they are
   divine." I think the second position (according to which perception of
   the beauty of one of the great things of the gospel is a direct or
   indirect occasion of the formation of the belief that it is indeed
   true, not a premise of an inference whose conclusion is that belief) is
   the stronger. That is because the alleged inference in question seems
   dubious, questionable--just as would be an inference to the proposition
   that the sun is shining on the oaks from propositions reporting how I
   am now being appeared to. On the other hand, there need be nothing
   dubious or questionable about a process in which perception of the
   beauty and glory of that teaching is an occasion (direct or indirect)
   for the belief that it is true.

   Or is there something dubious here? Would it be somehow irrational to
   form a belief B as a response just to the perception that B is
   attractive and beautiful, or to the fact that you delight in the
   thought that B, that you have a certain affective response to B?
   Wouldn't this be like the cases we noted earlier on (above, pp. 149ff.)
   in which noncognitive or nonintellectual features of a cognitive
   situation can influence belief formation, thus impeding cognitive
   proper function? I don't think so. It needn't be the case that wherever
   there is influence of this sort--that is, from nonintellectual
   factors--what you have is impedance: perhaps the design plan calls for
   just this sort of belief formation, and perhaps the relevant part of
   the design plan is successfully aimed at true belief. According to the
   physicist Steven Weinberg, scientists often accept a view or a theory
   not (or not only) because there is good evidence for it, but because it
   is beautiful:

   Nevertheless, despite the weakness of the early experimental evidence
   for general relativity, Einstein's theory became the standard textbook
   theory of gravitation in the 1920s and retained that position from then
   on, even while the various eclipse expeditions of the 1920s and 1930s
   were reporting at best equivocal evidence for the theory. I remember
   that, when I learned general relativity in the 1950s, before modern
   radar and radio astronomy began to give impressive new evidence for the
   theory, I took it for granted that general relativity was more or less
   correct. Perhaps all of us were just gullible and lucky, but I do not
   think that is the real explanation. I believe that the general
   acceptance of general relativity was due in large part to the
   attractions of the theory itself--in short, to its beauty. [387]

   Here we have the same three possibilities: (a) Weinberg argued to the
   truth of general relativity, employing as a premise the proposition
   that the theory is beautiful (more exactly, displays a certain
   hard-to-specify kind of beauty or aesthetic appeal), or (b) Weinberg's
   perception of the beauty of the theory was the direct occasion of his
   belief that it is true, or (c) Weinberg's perception of the beauty was
   the direct occasion of an affective response of admiration, attraction,
   and delight, that affective response then occasioning belief. [388]
   There need be nothing irrational here, and won't be, if in fact this
   sort of belief formation is in accord with a part of our cognitive
   design plan, which is successfully aimed at the formation of true
   belief. Similarly with the great things of the gospel.

   We can also compare the second Edwardsian construal with Augustine's
   famous dictum: "Our hearts are restless till they rest in you, O Lord."
   [389] Perhaps this restlessness without God leads to belief in God; and
   perhaps God has designed us in this way to impel us to try to get in
   touch with him. If either Edwards or Augustine is right, the process by
   which belief (in God, or in the great things of the gospel) arises in
   us would be a little like the way in which Freud thinks theistic belief
   arises. According to Freud (see above, chapter 5), religious belief
   arises out of wishful thinking: we see that the world is cold, cruel,
   heedless of us and our needs and desires, hostile, unthinking, and all
   the rest; we respond by forming a belief in a heavenly father who loves
   us and is actually in control of the world. The difference would be, of
   course, that according to Freud this process of belief formation does
   not have the production of true belief as its purpose, but rather the
   production of belief with some other property--that of enabling us to
   cope with the cold, cruel world into which, as our continental cousins
   say, we have been geworfen. If Augustine or Edwards is right, however,
   the processes leading to the formation of the beliefs in question are
   directed to the truth: the relevant module of the design plan has as
   its purpose the production of true belief, even if it goes by way of
   perception of beauty or wish-fulfillment.

   Indeed, there is a connection between belief and perception of beauty
   (and similar qualities) that goes much deeper than Weinberg suggests.
   As Leibniz and many since have noted, there are ordinarily many
   different theories or beliefs compatible with our evidence. If we plot
   our data on Cartesian coordinates, we will be able to draw as many
   lines as we please through the points we plot, and we could project any
   of the appropriately related hypotheses. All emeralds so far examined
   have been green; if so, however, they have also all been grue, where an
   emerald is grue if either it is examined before 2050 a.d. (bringing
   Goodman up to date) and is found to be green, or is not so examined and
   is blue. [390] So (instead of projecting that all emeralds are green)
   we could project that all emeralds are grue, thus concluding that
   emeralds not observed before 2050 are blue. The sun has come up every
   morning so far; we form the belief that it comes up every day and will
   also come up tomorrow. We could have formed quite a different belief,
   however: where T is today, we could have formed the belief that the sun
   comes up every day prior to T and never after T. Why do we accept the
   hypotheses we do; why do we project green rather than grue, and the
   hypothesis that the sun will continue to come up rather than the one
   according to which it won't? Why do we project simple hypotheses rather
   than complex ones? Not because we have evidence that simpler hypotheses
   are more likely to be correct than complex ones; for, for any alleged
   evidence for this conclusion, there will be a more complex inference
   from the same data for the denial of this conclusion. So why do we do
   it?

   Because we find simple beliefs (whatever precisely simplicity is) more
   natural and more attractive than complex beliefs. Only a madman would
   project grue or its partner in crime, bleen. [391] Messy, complex
   beliefs are ugly, disgusting, weird, repellent: we dislike them and
   therefore reject them. We may hope that the world is in fact such that
   simplicity (at least simplicity of a certain sort and in certain areas)
   is a mark of truth; but we have no hope whatever of establishing that
   in a way that doesn't already rely upon simplicity. For suppose we note
   that in the last one thousand cases the simplest hypothesis has turned
   out to be true. Where t is the present, say that a belief is simplex'
   if it is formed before t and simple, or after t and complex; what we
   will have observed, so far, is that simplex beliefs tend to be true.
   But that means that from now on we should go for complex beliefs.

   How shall we think of these things in the model? There are the three
   Edwardsian possibilities: it could be that there is a quick inference
   from the beauty and glory of the gospel to its truth; it could be that
   such belief is uninferred, but directly consequent, according to the
   design plan, upon perception of the beauty and glory of the gospel; and
   it could be that perception of the beauty of the gospel induces
   admiration and delight, which induces belief. We need not choose among
   them. There is that affective response, there is the perception of
   beauty and glory, and there is the belief; it is no part of the model
   to say which, if any, is prior to which.

  III. Analogue of Warrant

   We should note the deep analogies between will and intellect, affection
   and belief here. Intellect is the province of belief; will, the
   province of affection. Now when our cognitive faculties function
   properly, we won't believe just any propositions; we will (ordinarily)
   believe true propositions. [392] To put the matter in an older
   terminology, intellect is ordered to truth. Like intellect, however,
   affection also has an appropriate object--or, rather, the various
   affections have appropriate objects. When the sources of affection
   function properly, we will love what is lovable, take delight in what
   is delightful, and desire what is desirable. We will love God above all
   and our neighbor as ourselves; we will delight in his beauty and glory,
   and in created reflections of that beauty and glory; we will desire
   what is in fact good for us. Here I am assuming the unfashionable view
   that some individuals and some states of affairs are genuinely and
   objectively lovable, delightful, and desirable; others are genuinely
   and objectively hateful, disgusting, and undesirable; still others are
   none of the above. Delightfulness is not or not just the dispositional
   property a thing or state of affairs has of tending to produce delight
   in us; it is, rather, an objective property of an object or state of
   affairs, one that in no way depends upon human reactions to it. The
   beauty and delightfulness of a Mozart sonata are objective properties
   of (tokens of) the pattern of sounds; they aren't just subjective
   reactions on the part of the listener (or the dispositional properties
   of being apt for the production of such subjective reactions), although
   of course if things are going right, there will be such a reaction. (It
   may be that a thing's delightfulness depends on God's attitude toward
   it, but that is a very different matter.)

   Like beliefs, affections can be justified or unjustified--or, rather, I
   can be justified or unjustified in having a certain affection. [393]
   Furthermore, affections, like beliefs, can be rational or irrational:
   if I react to disaster with an amused smile, or love myself above all,
   or disdain someone because her relatives are poorer than mine, there is
   lack of proper function. There can also be proper and improper function
   with respect to the degree of affection, just as with degree of belief.
   I value a silly little ditty from a cigar commercial ("Man to man with
   a RoiTan! Man to man with a RoiTan cigar!") as much as Bach's B Minor
   Mass: that's a case of affective malfunction. Similarly if you value my
   good opinion more than God's.

   Still further, there is an analogue of warrant for affections. A belief
   has warrant when it is formed by cognitive faculties functioning
   properly in a congenial epistemic environment (both maxi and mini)
   according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth. An affection
   can have an analogous property. As we have already seen, it can be
   produced by faculties functioning properly or not. The environmental
   condition is equally obvious. On some distant planet, there could be a
   gas that causes human beings to react to disaster with a silly giggle
   or an indifferent shrug, or to become furiously angry for no reason at
   all. The right kind of affective environment (for us) will be one
   where, given our design plan, we will form the right affective
   responses. What about the last two conditions for warrant: (1) the
   faculty in question being such that it is aimed at the production of
   true beliefs, and (2) the design plan's being a good one? As to the
   first, again, there are clear analogues. It could be that a specific
   form of affection is aimed, not at our valuing something that is
   genuinely valuable, but at something else--at the continuation of the
   species, or survival, or whatever. An affection (or an instance of an
   affection) has the analogue of warrant only if it is produced by a
   process that isn't aimed at the production of affections with any of
   those properties, but instead at the production of affection that is
   appropriate to its object: valuing or loving or desiring what is
   valuable or lovable or desirable. The last condition for warrant is
   that the production of the belief be governed by a design plan that is
   good in the sense that there is a high objective probability that a
   belief formed in such a way as to satisfy the first three conditions
   will be true. Again, there is a clear analogue in the case of
   affection: the design plan governing the production of the affections
   is a good one just if, for example, it is objectively likely that a
   given instance of desire will be for something desirable and a given
   instance of hate will be of something hateful (given the satisfaction
   of the other three conditions). [394]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [392] And, of course, not just any true propositions, but ones
   appropriate to the circumstances. I meet you at a party; you tell me
   you live in Omaha; I form the belief that you live there, rather than,
   say, the true belief that you were born in Cleveland or that Caesar
   crossed the Rubicon.

   [393] Furthermore, affection, like belief, is not within our direct
   control; for example, I can't just by willing to do so, take the right
   attitude toward someone who has wronged or offended me. But also
   affection, again like belief, is to some extent within our indirect
   control; one can train oneself not to be so sensitive to slights, to
   see (and feel) them as unimportant. One can fight against pride and
   self-centeredness, and sometimes achieve partial success.

   [394] Is there an analogue of the Gettier problem for affections? I
   leave this problem for homework, only reminding the reader that the
   essence of Gettier situations is the "resolution problem": the fact
   that cognitive minienvironments can be misleading, even if embedded in
   maxienvironments apt for our style of cognitive faculties (above, pp.
   158ff.).

  IV. Eros

   Conversion, therefore, is fundamentally a turning of the will, a
   healing of the disorder of affection that afflicts us. It is a turning
   away from love of self, from thinking of oneself as the chief being of
   the universe, to love of God. But what is this love of God like, and
   how shall we understand it? William James, that cultured, sophisticated
   New England Victorian gentleman, notes the throbbing elements of
   longing, yearning, desire, eros in the writings of Teresa of Avila,
   looks down his cultivated nose, and finds all that a bit, well,
   tasteless, a bit declassÃ©. Sniffs James, "in the main her idea of
   religion seems to have been that of an endless amatory flirtation . . .
   between the devotee and the deity." [395] Here the joke is on James.
   There is an intimate and long-standing connection between eros and
   developed spirituality. The Bible is full of expressions of that
   longing, yearning, Sehnsucht, desire; the Hebrew word for knowledge, as
   in knowledge of God, is also a word for sexual intercourse; [396] and
   when the children of Israel are unfaithful, turning aside to false
   gods, this is represented as adultery. The Psalms are particularly rich
   in such expressions of eros:

   My soul yearns, even faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my
   flesh cry out for the living God. (Psalm 84:2)

   Oh God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you,
   my body longs for you. (Psalm 63:1)

   One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after; that I .
   . . behold the beauty of the Lord. (Psalm 27:4)

   As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O
   God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. (Psalm 42:1-2)

   I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commands. (Psalm 119:131)

   This love for God isn't like, say, an inclination to spend the
   afternoon organizing your stamp collection. It is longing, filled with
   desire and yearning; and it is physical as well as spiritual: "my body
   longs for you, my soul pants for you." It is erotic; and one of the
   closest analogues would be with sexual eros. There is a powerful desire
   for union with God, the oneness Christ refers to in John 17. Another
   perhaps equally close analogue would be love between parent and small
   child; and this kind of love too is often employed in Scripture as a
   figure for love of God--both God's love for us and ours for him. Here
   too, of course, there is longing, yearning, desire for closeness,
   though not sexual longing; think of the longing in the homesickness of
   an eight-year-old or in the love of a mother for her hurt and suffering
   child.

   Of course expressions of this eros are not found only in the Psalms. In
   Isaiah, we read, "I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my
   people" (65:19); "As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your
   God rejoice over you" (62:5b). This implies, I take it, not merely that
   God will rejoice over his people the way a bridegroom rejoices over his
   bride, but that the bride will return this love; when things go
   properly, God's people love him the way a bride loves her new husband,
   with a similar sort of erotic desire. Then there is the Song of Songs,
   with its intensely erotic imagery, imagery the church has all along
   taken to be a picture of the love between Christ and his church:

   I belong to my lover, and his desire is for me. Come, my lover, let us
   go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages. Let us
   go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their
   blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom--there I
   will give you my love. (7:10-12)

   In the New Testament, the relationship between Christ and his church is
   repeatedly compared to that between husband and wife:

   He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hates his own
   flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church,
   because we are members of his body. "For this reason a man shall leave
   his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall
   become one flesh" [Genesis 2:24]. This mystery is a profound one, and I
   am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. (Ephesians
   5:28b-32).

   Christians over the centuries have echoed these expressions. Thus
   Augustine:

   Late it was that I loved you, beauty so ancient and so new, late I
   loved you! . . . You called, you cried out, you shattered my deafness:
   you flashed, you shone, you scattered my blindness: you breathed
   perfume, and I drew in my breath and I pant for you: I tasted, and I am
   hungry and thirsty: you touched me, and I burned for your peace. [397]

   The great mystical masters of the spiritual life, furthermore, speak in
   similarly erotic terms:

   And although the attractions by which God draws us be admirably
   pleasing, sweet and delicious, yet on account of the force which the
   divine beauty and goodness have to draw unto them the attention and
   application of the spirit, it seems that it not only raises us but that
   it ravishes and bears us away. As, on the contrary, by reason of the
   most free consent and ardent motion, by which the ravished soul goes
   out after the divine attractions, she seems not only to mount and rise,
   but also to break out of herself and cast herself into the very
   divinity. [398]

   It isn't only the great mystics who have this sort of experience:

   as I turned and was about to take a seat by the fire, I received a
   mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost . . . the Holy Spirit descended upon
   me in a manner that seemed to go through me, body and soul. I could
   feel the impression, like a wave of electricity, going through and
   through me. Indeed, it seemed to come in waves and waves of liquid
   love; for I could not express it in any other way. [399]

   Even (and perhaps especially) the Puritans, dour and emotionally
   pinched as they are often represented, are full of expressions of
   erotic love of God. There is of course Jonathan Edwards; but he was by
   no means alone. Thus Henry Scougal:

   when once the soul is fixed on that supreme and all sufficient good, it
   finds so much perfection and goodness as does not only answer and
   satisfy its affection, but master and overpower it too: it finds all
   its love to be too faint and languid for such a noble objection, and is
   only sorry that it can command no more. It . . . longs for the time
   when it shall be wholly melted and dissolved into love. [400]

   What an infinite pleasure must it needs be, thus, as it were, to lose
   ourselves in him, and being swallowed up in the overcoming sense of his
   goodness, to offer ourselves a living sacrifice always ascending unto
   him in flames of love. [401]

   Amy Plantinga Pauw notes that

   The joy between Christ and the saints is described by such a staid
   figure as Samuel Willard in frankly erotic terms: "We shall then dwell
   at the Fountain of his Love, and the reciprocal ardours of Affection
   between him and us, shall break over all Banks and Bounds, and we shall
   be entirely satisfied, both in Soul and in Body." [402]

   What is to be made of this erotic love of God, this yearning, longing,
   desire, and its apparent fulfillment in some kind of ardent union
   between "the devotee and the deity"? This phenomenon comes in all
   grades of intensity: there is the full-blown, breathtaking,
   overpowering scenario de Sales points to, but also the much quieter and
   more restrained movement of the heart toward God on the part of one who
   gives thanks for a glorious June morning, or who for one brief moment
   sees the glory and beauty of the Christian story and feels a pang of
   attraction deeper than gratitude; and there is every degree between
   these two. What is to be made of this phenomenon? Most psychiatric
   literature has tended to follow Freud in understanding religion as a
   kind of neurosis, the "universal obsessional neurosis of humanity."
   [403] From this point of view, religious eros is to be understood as a
   kind of analogue, displacement, or sublimation of (broadly) sexual
   energy (presumably on the part of those who have little by way of the
   more conventional sexual outlets).

   What is it for sexual energy to be sublimated in art, or poetry, or
   love of God? The idea is that there is some finite store of energy
   whose natural' use or outlet is sexual; this energy can somehow be
   diverted into other channels, perhaps especially if the natural
   channels aren't available. (There is also the suggestion that these
   other channels are socially somehow more respectable.) The person in
   whom the sublimation occurs, of course, is not aware of this origin of
   what he thinks of as his higher feelings and desires. (Here there is
   more of that unmasking for which Freud is famous.) We might stop to try
   to understand this claim more fully: what is this energy' like, and
   what does it mean to say that it gets pointed in some other direction,
   and why would energy be diverted in this fashion? And isn't the whole
   claim really metaphorical (sublimation', energy', diversion', etc., are
   all used metaphorically here), and, if so, what is it a metaphor for?
   Is there any way to give a literal statement of the theory? Let's not
   tarry over those questions, however, and pretend we have a reasonably
   good grasp of the alleged theory: is there any reason to believe it?

   Here I think things stand as with Freud's account of religious belief
   as wish-fulfillment (chapter 5). We are confronted with a question: how
   is it that some people display this ardent desire and love for God? One
   sort of answer would be: "Well, God himself, according to Scripture and
   Christian belief, is essentially love; union with him is also the chief
   end of us human beings; it is therefore no surprise that he would
   create us in such a way that we have a deep desire for union with him,
   even if that desire has been partly suppressed and effaced by sin." But
   suppose you think there is no God and that Christian (and other) theism
   is an illusion (and delusion) of some kind: then how does it happen
   that many of us display this love for God? I take it Freud's suggestion
   is an answer to that question, or to that question with that
   presupposition. The answer is supposed to help us understand what would
   otherwise be (from that atheistic perspective) a puzzling phenomenon.
   The proposed explanation is that there is the natural, unsurprising,
   well-established phenomenon of sexual energy; we then imagine that this
   energy (for one reason or another) gets diverted' (in those deprived of
   the natural outlets) into another direction, a direction that may have
   some psychological function. In this way, we come to understand erotic
   love for God.

   Like his account of theistic belief as wish-fulfillment, this account
   (assuming we can make real sense of it) is of the sort that is vastly
   more likely to be true if theism is false than if it is true. It is, of
   course, possible that something like it is true, even if theism is true
   too. Even if theism is true, it is possible that (due, e.g., to sin)
   there is something like a drying up of the natural sources of love of
   God, and a sort of makeshift interim arrangement whereby sexual energy
   is commandeered for this purpose. Perhaps it is even possible that we
   were originally designed, in the unfallen state, in such a way that it
   was sexual energy that was somehow diverted and used in this other
   fashion--that is, for love of God (although, if that was part of the
   original human design plan, why call the energy in question sexual'?).
   These things are possible, though not likely (given theism or
   Christianity). Even if they were true, however, there would remain an
   important difference: from the Christian or theistic perspective, this
   system or set of systems would have been designed or redesigned with
   love of God as its aim or end: that is what it would be for. Not so, of
   course, from Freud's perspective.

   From a Christian perspective, then, here (as often) Freud has things
   just backwards. It isn't that religious eros, love for God, is really
   sexual eros gone astray or rechanneled, and it isn't sexual eros
   (important as it is) that is basic or fundamental, with religious eros
   somehow derivative from it. The fact is things are just the other way
   around. It is sexual desire and longing that is a sign of something
   deeper: it is a sign of this longing, yearning for God that we human
   beings achieve when we are graciously enabled to reach a certain level
   of the Christian life. It is love for God that is fundamental or basic,
   and sexual eros that is the sign or symbol or pointer to something else
   and something deeper. (Of course I don't mean to say that the
   importance and worth of sexual eros is exhausted in its being a sign of
   love of God.)

   In fact sexual eros points to two deeper realities. First, it points to
   human love for God, which is a passionate desire for the central
   condition for which God has designed us. According to the Westminster
   Catechism, the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him
   forever. What is this "glorifying God and enjoying him forever"? The
   first is not fundamentally a matter of telling God how great he is,
   paying him effusive compliments, metaphysical or otherwise. God is,
   indeed, great, magnificent, and awe-inspiring beyond description; but
   he already knows that, and doesn't need to hear it from us, as with
   someone who is insecure, or whose swollen ego needs constant feeding of
   this type. More likely, it is a matter of perceiving, noting,
   appreciating, delighting in, relishing, God's glory and loveliness, his
   amiability and sweetness--the whole list of divine properties so often
   mentioned by Jonathan Edwards--and a natural expression of that
   perception and delight. [404] And the second--"enjoying him
   forever"--is some kind of union with God, a being united to, at one
   with him. To quote Samuel Willard again, "We shall then dwell at the
   Fountain of his Love, and the reciprocal ardours of Affection between
   him and us, shall break over all Banks and Bounds, and we shall be
   entirely satisfied, both in Soul and in Body." [405] Sexual eros with
   its longing and yearning is a sign and foreshadowing of the longing and
   yearning for God that will characterize us in our healed and renewed
   state in heaven; and sexual satisfaction and union, with its transports
   and ecstasy, is a sign and foreshadowing of the deeper reality of union
   with God--a union that is at present for the most part obscure to us.
   Bernard Williams seems to believe that heaven would be a bit boring for
   a person of taste and sensibility; [406] and Michael Levine suggests
   that friendship with God could be fairly interesting, but doubts that
   it would be "supremely worthwhile." [407] Perhaps these reactions are
   as spiritually immature as those of a nine-year-old child on first
   hearing of the pleasures of sex: could it really match marbles, or
   chocolate? [408]

   Of course it isn't only sexual eros that is in this way a sign or
   symbol of love for God. Sexual eros and love for God are both
   passionate desires for union, a passionate desire to be united with the
   object of desire. And there are other manifestations of the same kind
   of desire for union. Think of the haunting, supernal beauty of the
   prairie on an early morning in June, or the glorious but slightly
   menacing aspect of the Cathedral group in the Grand Tetons, or the
   gleaming splendor of Mount Shuksan and Mount Baker from Skyline Ridge,
   or the timeless crash and roar of the surf, or the melting sweetness of
   Mozart's "Dona Nobis Pacem" that can bring hot tears to your eyes, or
   the incredible grace, beauty, and power of an ice-skating routine or a
   kickoff returned for ninety-eight yards. In each, there is a kind of
   yearning, something perhaps a little like nostalgia, or perhaps
   homesickness, [409] a longing for one knows not what. This longing is
   different from sexual eros, though no doubt connected with it at a deep
   level (which is perhaps one of the things Freud did see). In these
   cases it isn't easy to say with any precision what the longing is a
   longing for, but it can seem to be for a sort of union: it's as if you
   want to be absorbed into the music, to become part of the ocean, to be
   at one with the landscape. You would love to climb that mountain,
   certainly, but that isn't enough; you also somehow want to become one
   with it, to become part of it, or to have it, or its beauty, or this
   particular aspect of it, somehow become part of your very soul. [410]
   Of course you can't; you remain unsatisfied. Jean-Paul Sartre says that
   man (and I doubt that he meant to single out just males) is too much,
   "de trop"; perhaps the truth is more like "not enough." He also says
   that man is a "useless passion." What he should have said is that man
   is an unfulfilled passion. When confronted with beauty, it is never
   enough; we are never really satisfied; there is more beyond, a more
   that we yearn for, but can only dimly conceive. We are limited to mere
   fleeting glimpses of the real satisfaction--unfulfilled until filled
   with the love of God. These longings too are types of longing for God;
   and the brief but joyous partial fulfillments are a type and foretaste
   of the fulfillment enjoyed by those who "glorify God and enjoy him
   forever."

   Sexual eros points to something deeper in a second way. As we have just
   seen, it is a sign or type of a deeper reality, a kind of love for God
   of which we now just have hints and intimations. It is also a sign,
   symbol, or type of God's love--not just of the love God's children will
   someday have for him but of the love he also has for them. As we noted
   above (p. 312), Scripture regularly compares God's love for his people
   and Christ's love for his church to the love of a groom for his new
   bride. Now a widely shared traditional view of God has been that he is
   impassible, without desire or feeling or passion, unable to feel sorrow
   at the sad condition of his world and the suffering of his children,
   and equally unable to feel joy, delight, longing, or yearning. The
   reason for so thinking, roughly, is that in the tradition originating
   in Greek philosophy, passions were thought of (naturally enough) as
   passive, something that happens to you, something you undergo, rather
   than something you actively do. You are subject to anger, love, joy,
   and all the rest. God, however, is pure act; he doesn't undergo'
   anything at all; he acts, and is never merely passive; and he isn't
   subject to anything. As far as eros is concerned, furthermore, there is
   an additional reason for thinking that it isn't part of God's life:
   longing and yearning signify need and incompleteness. One who yearns
   for something doesn't yet have it, and needs it, or at any rate thinks
   he needs it; God is of course paradigmatically complete and needs
   nothing beyond himself. How, then, could he be subject to eros? God's
   love, according to this tradition, is exclusively agape, benevolence,
   [411] a completely other-regarding, magnanimous love in which there is
   mercy but no element of desire. God loves us, but there is nothing we
   can do for him; he wishes nothing from us.

   On this particular point I think we must take leave of the tradition;
   this is one of those places where it has paid too much attention to
   Greek philosophy and too little to the Bible. I believe God can and
   does suffer; his capacity for suffering exceeds ours in the same
   measure that his knowledge exceeds ours. Christ's suffering was no
   charade; he was prepared to endure the agonies of the cross and of hell
   itself ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"). [412] God the
   Father was prepared to endure the anguish of seeing his Son, the second
   person of the trinity, consigned to the bitterly cruel and shameful
   death of the cross. [413] And isn't the same true for other passions?
   "There is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than
   over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent" (Luke
   15:7); is God himself to be excluded from this rejoicing?

   Similarly for eros: "As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will
   your God rejoice over you" (Isaiah 62:5). The bridegroom rejoicing over
   his bride doesn't love her with a merely agapeic love. He isn't like
   her benevolent elder brother (although Christ is also said to be our
   elder brother). He desires and longs for something outside himself,
   namely union with his beloved. The church is the bride of Christ, not
   his little sister. He is not her benevolent elder brother, but her
   husband, lover. These scriptural images imply that God isn't impassive,
   and that his love for us is not exclusively agapeic. They suggest that
   God's love for his people involves an erotic element of desire: he
   desires the right kind of response from us, and union with us, just as
   we desire union with him.

   We can take this one step further (and here we may be crossing the
   boundary into groundless speculation). According to Jonathan Edwards,
   "The infinite happiness of the Father consists in the enjoyment of His
   Son." [414] This presumably isn't agape. It doesn't involve an element
   of mercy, as in his love for us. It is, instead, a matter of God's
   taking enormous pleasure, enjoyment, delight, happiness, delectation in
   the Son. Given the necessary existence of the Father and the Son, and
   their having their most important properties essentially, there is no
   way in which God could be deprived of the Son; [415] but if (per
   impossible) he were, it would occasion inconceivable sadness. The love
   in question is eros, not agape. [416] It is a desire for union that is
   continually, eternally, and joyfully satisfied. And our being created
   in his image involves our capacity for eros and for love of what is
   genuinely lovable, as well as knowledge and agenthood.

   Accordingly, the eros in our lives is a sign or a symbol of God's
   erotic love as well. Human erotic love is a sign of something deeper,
   something so deep that it is uncreated, an original and permanent and
   necessarily present feature of the universe. Eros undoubtedly
   characterizes many creatures other than human beings; no doubt much of
   the living universe shares this characteristic. More important, all of
   us creatures with eros reflect and partake in this profound divine
   property. So the most fundamental reality here is the love displayed by
   and in God: love within the trinity. [417] This love is erotic. It is a
   matter of perceiving and desiring and enjoying union with something
   valuable, in this case, Someone of supreme value. And God's love for us
   is manifested in his generously inviting us into this charmed circle
   (though not, of course, to ontological equality), thus satisfying the
   deepest longings of our souls. Within this circle, there is mercy,
   self-sacrifice, overflowing agape; there is also that longing and
   delight, that yearning and joy that make up eros. [418]

   Suppose we use the term human eros' to refer to sexual eros and also to
   the kinds of longing involved in our experience of beauty, nostalgia,
   and the like. I say that human eros is a sign, a symbol, a type, a
   figure, [419] a foreshadowing, both of God's love, and also of
   spiritually mature human love for God: but exactly what does that mean,
   and why can't I settle on just one of those five words? To take the
   easier question first, let's settle on the word type'; human eros is a
   type of God's love and of love for God. Of course this is just to give
   it a name: what is that relationship? This is a large and nontrivial
   question; here I can only try to mention a few of the surface
   essentials. First, the relation is not symmetrical: human eros is a
   type of God's love, but God's love is not a type of human eros. Second,
   the relationship in question is not, of course, the familiar type-token
   relationship. A horse is a token of the type the horse; an inscription
   of the word fish' is a token of that word. But sexual eros is not a
   token of divine love, and divine love is not a token of sexual eros;
   hence, neither is a token of the other.

   Third, like the type-token relation and unlike the relation between a
   word and what it denotes, the type-relationship here is not
   conventional. The word fish' stands for fish; the relationship between
   fish' and fish is conventional in the sense that this relationship
   holds by virtue of the existence of a certain linguistic convention.
   (Perhaps this relationship goes by way of the convention's establishing
   a relationship between the word fish' and the property of being a fish,
   the former expressing the latter.) The relationship between fish' and
   fish depends on us human beings and what we do; it holds because we (or
   some of us) have done what it takes to establish the convention whereby
   the former is a word for the latter. The fish (the type) is also a
   symbol for Jesus Christ. The connection between the fish and Jesus
   Christ is also conventional, though in a slightly different way. The
   former was adopted as a symbol for the latter because of a relation
   between the Greek word for fish (icthus) and a certain Greek phrase:
   Iesouz Chriztoz Theou Uikz Soter. The letters of the word, taken in
   order, are the first letters of the words of that phrase, taken in
   order. That relationship isn't itself merely conventional; but the
   relation between the fish and Jesus Christ is, in that it depends
   essentially upon our treating that type and some of its tokens in a
   certain conventional way. Not so for the way in which human eros is a
   type of divine love: this relationship doesn't depend on the
   establishment of any human conventions.

   Still, none of this tells us what this relationship is. Perhaps we can
   make a little progress by considering a biblical example. In Hebrews
   8:5, we read that the high priest "serves at a sanctuary that is a copy
   and shadow of what is in heaven"; and in the next chapter, that "It was
   necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified
   with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better
   sacrifices than these" (9:23). What is meant here, I take it, is that
   the earthly sanctuary, the temple, is a type of what is in heaven,
   whatever exactly it is. The sacrifice of an animal, furthermore, is a
   type of the sacrifice of Christ, and the animals themselves types of
   Christ. The relationship here is that there is a certain kind of
   (sometimes functional) resemblance between the earthly copy and the
   heavenly exemplar, a relationship that is independent of any human
   convention. Of course that isn't saying much: any two things resemble
   each other in indefinitely many ways (and indefinitely many ways
   independent of human convention); what's at issue here is a relevant
   relationship, where it is easy to give examples but hard to say what
   relevance consists in.

   Perhaps the answer lies in the following area. There are features or
   properties of God that are very good--that is, features or properties
   such that exemplifications of them are good. These features would
   include his love, power, knowledge, mercy, justice, beauty, glory, and
   the like, and it is by exemplifying these features to the maximal
   degree that God is supremely good. [420] In creating creatures who are
   also good, God intends to make them in such a way that they resemble
   him by virtue of displaying some of these same features. They reflect
   and recapitulate the features of God in question. Of course there will
   be enormous differences; God's creatures are finite, created, and
   conditional, while he himself is infinite, uncreated, and
   unconditional; the theme in question is, so to say, transposed into
   another key. [421] Where b is a type of a, therefore, a will be of
   great value in some respect; b will resemble a in that respect, though
   b will be of less value than a (hence the asymmetry). Still further,
   part of what it is for human eros to be a type, a sign, or an analogue
   of divine love is God's intending to create something that resembles
   him in the relevant respect, and intending to create it just because it
   does resemble him in that respect. (The sound made by a deer drinking
   at a water hole may vaguely resemble the sound made by a very small
   mountain stream; neither stream nor deer, one thinks, is created
   because of that relationship.) These things are (I think) necessary;
   are they also sufficient? I doubt it, but do not know what further
   condition to add.

   The fact that human eros is a type of divine love means that this
   feature of our lives can be explained or understood a certain way. We
   understand it better, see what it is all about, see what is most
   important about it, when we see that it is a type or sign of divine
   love. We see how it fits in with the rest of reality, and how it is
   connected with what is most real. There are, of course, various
   evolutionary accounts of erotic love; they center, naturally enough, in
   the connection of eros with reproduction or, more broadly, with the
   mechanisms of survival and reproduction. Why do human beings display
   eros, and what is its significance? From an evolutionary or
   sociobiological point of view, the answer has to do with how this
   feature of our nature came to be, bit by bit, in small stages, each
   stage proving to be fitness inducing (or genetically connected with
   something fitness inducing). From a Christian perspective, however,
   things look quite different. The significance of this feature of our
   lives lies in the fact that displaying it is part of what it is to be
   created in the image of God; in this way, we human beings share in one
   of the fundamental properties of the First Being of the universe. The
   questions Why is it there?' and What's most significant about it?' are
   to be answered in terms of its being a type of divine love.

   In sum, then: according to the model, faith is a matter of a sure and
   certain knowledge, both revealed to the mind and sealed to the heart.
   This sealing, according to the model, consists in the having of the
   right sorts of affections; in essence, it consists in loving God above
   all and one's neighbor as oneself. There is an intimate relation
   between revealing and sealing, knowledge and affection, intellect and
   will; they cooperate in a deep and complex and intimate way in the
   person of faith. And the love involved is, in part, erotic; it involves
   that longing and yearning with which we are all familiar. Finally, love
   between human beings--between men and women, between parents and
   children, among friends--is a sign or type of something deeper: mature
   human love for God, on the one hand, and, on the other, the love of God
   displayed both among the members of the trinity and in God's love for
   his children.

   [412] Can we say that Christ qua human being (according to his human
   nature) suffered while Christ qua divine (according to his divine
   nature) did not? This is hardly the place to try to address a question
   as ancient and deep as this one, but I'm inclined to think this
   suggestion incoherent. There is this person, the second person of the
   divine trinity who became incarnate. It is this person who suffers; if
   there really were two centers of consciousness here, one suffering and
   the other not, there would be two persons here (one human and one
   divine) rather than the one person who is both human and divine. See my
   "On Heresy, Mind, and Truth," Faith and Philosophy, 16, no. 2 (April
   1999), p. 182.

   [413] He no doubt also suffers at the sufferings and defections of all
   his children: "this bitter grief is inflicted upon God, when a soul
   falls away from Him" (Kuyper, To Be near unto God, p. 30).

   [415] And this is the answer to one of the traditional arguments for
   the conclusion that God has no passions: the Father and the Son do
   indeed need each other, but it is a need that is necessarily and
   eternally fulfilled.

   [416] "So when we say that God loves his Son, we are not talking about
   a love that is self-denying, sacrificial, or merciful. We are talking
   about a love of delight and pleasure. . . . He is well-pleased with his
   Son. His soul delights in the Son! When he looks at his Son he enjoys
   and admires and cherishes and prizes and relishes what he sees" (John
   Piper, The Pleasures of God [Portland: Multnomah Press, 1991], p. 31).

   [417] The thought that God is trinitarian distinguishes Christianity
   from other theistic religions; here we see a way in which this doctrine
   makes a real difference, in that it recognizes eros and love for others
   at the most fundamental level of reality. Does this suggest that we
   should lean toward a social conception of the trinity, the conception
   of Gregory and the Cappadocian fathers, rather than the Augustinian
   conception, which flirts with modalism? See Cornelius Plantinga Jr.,
   "Social Trinity & Tritheism," in Trinity, Incarnation, and Atonement,
   ed. Ronald Feenstra and Cornelius Plantinga Jr. (Notre Dame: University
   of Notre Dame Press, 1989).

   [418] For a more poetic account of connections between human romantic
   love and divine love, see Charles Williams, Religion and Love in Dante:
   The Theology of Romantic Love (Westminster: Dacre Press, 1941). (See
   also, of course, Dante's Divine Comedy, the Paradiso.) Williams argues
   (p. 11) that being in love (that more or less ordinary but also utterly
   extraordinary way in which most of us are at one time or another) is a
   way of participating in the divine Love himself.

   [419] See Erich Auerbach's powerful "Figura" in Scenes from the Drama
   of European Literature (New York: Meridian Books, 1959).

   [420] Of course I don't mean to suggest that God somehow depends on
   these features, or is ontologically subsequent to them (whatever
   exactly that means); these features themselvess, as well as other
   properties, can perhaps best be thought of as divine concepts. See my
   Does God Have a Nature? (Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1980).

Objections

   It is often taken for granted by the wise of this world, believers and
   unbelievers alike, that "religious experience" is a purely subjective
   phenomenon. Although it may have various psychosocial functions to
   play, any claims to its cognitive value can be safely dismissed without
   a hearing.

   William P. Alston

   Or, as we shall see, with at best a perfunctory hearing. In this
   chapter, we shall note and evaluate some alleged results of those
   perfunctory hearings.

   The extended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model of the last three chapters is
   intended to show how specifically Christian belief can have
   justification, internal and external rationality, and warrant.
   According to the model, we human beings have fallen into sin, a
   grievous condition from which we cannot extricate ourselves. Jesus
   Christ, both a human being and the divine son of God, made atonement
   for our sin by way of his suffering and death, thus making it possible
   for us to stand in the right relationship to God. The Bible is (among
   other things) a written communication from God to us human beings,
   proclaiming this good news. Because of our sinful condition, however,
   we need more than this information: we also need a change of heart.
   This is provided by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit (IIHS);
   he both turns our affections in the right direction and enables us to
   see the truth of the great things of the gospel. The process whereby we
   come to believe those things, therefore, satisfies the conditions for
   warrant (and also the conditions for the affective analogue of
   warrant). But it is obvious that the beliefs in question are also such
   that they can be and often are both justified and internally rational.

   In this chapter, I shall do two things. First, I wish to consider some
   of the arguments for the conclusion that theistic and/or Christian
   belief lacks warrant; second, I want to consider objections to my
   arguments and claims about the way in which Christian belief can have
   warrant. What I have argued so far, in order of ascending strength, is
   that (1) the extended A/C model depicts a way in which Christian belief
   could have warrant; (2) given the truth of Christian belief, there are
   no cogent objections to its having warrant in the way suggested by the
   A/C model; and (3) given the truth of Christian belief, it very likely
   does have warrant, if not by way of the extended A/C model, then by way
   of a closely similar model. (3) is stronger than (2). (2) says that,
   given the assumption that Christian belief is true, there aren't any
   cogent objections to the A/C model and hence none to Christian belief's
   having warrant; but of course there might be no cogent objections to a
   proposition p, even if p is, as it turns out, false. (3) adds that in
   fact Christian belief very likely has warrant, given its truth. A
   successful argument for the conclusion that Christian or theistic
   belief lacks warrant, therefore, will be a successful argument against
   both (2) and (3)--provided, of course, that it doesn't assume (or argue
   for) the falsehood of Christian belief. Such an objection, therefore,
   will have to be independent of the question of the truth or falsehood
   of Christian belief; it will have to be cogent even on the supposition
   that Christian belief is true. Our question is really this: are there
   general epistemological reasons, independent of doubts about the truth
   of Christian or theistic belief, to think that it lacks warrant? If any
   of the objections is successful, therefore, it will remain successful
   even if we assume that indeed there is such a person as God and that
   Christian belief is, as a matter of fact, true.

   There is also an initial difficulty. Those who raise the de jure
   question about Christian or theistic belief typically complain that it
   is "irrational," or "unjustified," or "unreasonable," or "rationally
   unjustified," or "rationally indefensible" or the like; they seldom
   make a serious attempt to explain what they mean by these terms.
   Instead, they typically take it for granted that we know perfectly well
   what these terms mean; then they argue that theistic belief has the
   unflattering properties expressed by them. But these terms and their
   associated concepts have had an enormously checkered career in modern
   and contemporary epistemology; to assume that their meanings are
   perfectly clear is excessively naive. It is also confusing, making it
   hard to construe the objector's complaints with any exactitude. We have
   seen that the relevant de jure question is really the question whether
   Christian belief does or can have warrant: the property or quantity,
   enough of which is what distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief;
   I shall therefore handle this problem by construing the objections as
   arguments for the claim that Christian belief has no warrant. This
   course has the added attraction that, in at least some cases, it is
   likely that this is what the objector intended.

   A number of thinkers consider the question whether Christian belief can
   be justified or warranted by way of religious experience, and go on to
   argue that it cannot. Now I argued in chapter 6 that it isn't clear
   what it means to say that a belief is warranted by way of experience,
   and so didn't propose to say whether or not, on the model, theistic and
   Christian belief gets its warrant from or by way of religious
   experience. Technically speaking, therefore, these objections wouldn't
   apply to my claims about how it can be that such belief has warrant.
   For the purpose of considering these objections, however, let's concede
   what may well be false--namely that (on the model) these beliefs do get
   their warrant from experience. Then at any rate we can see the
   objections as initially relevant.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Warrant and the Argument from Religious Experience

   The first objection is really less an objection, so it seems to me,
   than a confusion, a failure to make an important distinction. Anthony
   O'Hear considers the idea that theistic belief might be justified or
   receive warrant (it is hard to tell which he is thinking of) in a
   direct way, not by way of argument or inference. (In my terms, the
   question is whether theistic belief might be properly basic, either
   with respect to warrant or with respect to justification.) Referring to
   William James, John Baillie, and others, he notes that one suggestion
   as to how this might go would be by way of religious experience,
   broadly conceived. He then goes on to say:

   It is the idea of direct personal contact with a non-sensory reality
   that non-believers will find hard to grasp. In order to bring out the
   nature of the difficulty, I will consider the extent to which religious
   experience can provide evidence for the existence of a reality beyond
   the experience itself. Presumably people who are convinced that they
   are in personal contact with some super-reality will not often attempt
   to argue or prove their conviction at all, nor will their conviction be
   arrived at inferentially, any more than we naturally infer from
   statements about our sensations to statements about physical objects.
   Nevertheless the question of the extent to which the conviction can be
   justified by the experience naturally arises. [422]

   Here there are several questions. First, note that this quotation
   illustrates that initial difficulty I mentioned above: is O'Hear
   talking about justification, or rationality, or warrant, or what? This
   isn't clear from what he says here or elsewhere. Despite the occurrence
   of justified' in the last line of the quotation, I don't think he's
   really speaking of justification--and in any event, as we have already
   seen (above, pp. 99ff.), the question of justification is too easily
   answered to be interesting. Although O'Hear speaks of "personal
   contact," perhaps his question is best construed in the present context
   as the question whether religious experience could put us in epistemic
   contact with a nonsensory reality (i.e., one that can't, ordinarily, be
   seen, heard, touched, etc.) such as God; and that question, I take it,
   is the question whether beliefs about such a nonsensory reality could
   acquire warrant by way of religious experience.

   Now his initial suggestion is that there is something problematic about
   the very idea of a human person's being in cognitive contact (the kind
   required by warrant) with a nonsensory reality such as God. Why is this
   problematic? O'Hear doesn't directly answer that question, but proposes
   to "bring out the difficulty" by turning to the question whether
   "religious experience can provide evidence for the existence of a
   reality beyond the experience itself." This sounds like he thinks the
   way to answer the question

   Does religious experience make it possible for us to have the right
   sort of cognitive connection with God?

   is to ask

   Is there a good argument from the existence of the experience in
   question to the existence of God: an argument whose premises report the
   experience in question and whose conclusion is that there is such a
   person as God?

   That this is what he has in mind is confirmed by what he says a bit
   later:

   Christians, for example, tend to explain this unpredictability [of
   religious experience of the relevant sort] by saying that these
   experiences are a gift of God. This may be so, but saying it certainly
   weakens attempts to argue from the experience to the reality. (p. 44)

   This clearly suggests that what is at issue, here, with respect to the
   question whether theistic belief can have warrant by virtue of
   religious experience, is whether there is a good argument from premises
   reporting that experience to the existence of God. O'Hear goes on to
   say that what we are really asking for is

   grounds on which the religious experiences we have . . . could be
   regarded as experiences of an objective sort. (p. 45)

   the answer, he says,

   will have to be in terms of the explanatory power of the hypothesis
   that religious experiences are due at least in part to the existence
   and operation of an objective religious reality, rather than due to
   merely worldly factors, such as features of a person's psychology,
   chemistry or upbringing. (p. 45)

   His thought, then, as far as I can make it out, is twofold:

   (a) theistic belief can have warrant by virtue of religious experience
   only if there is a good (noncircular) argument from premises reporting
   the occurrence of such experiences to the existence of God

   and

   (b) such an argument will have to involve as a premise the proposition
   that the existence of God is the best explanation of religious
   experiences.

   (Of course such an argument would also have to provide reasons for
   thinking that premise true.)

   I say (a) is part of O'Hear's thought; perhaps assumption' would be a
   better term because he doesn't explicitly make this claim but rather
   just takes it for granted. Another way to put the assumption: theistic
   belief can have warrant by way of religious experience only if some
   theistic argument from religious experience is successful. This
   assumption is widely shared and seldom argued; as I shall maintain,
   however, it has the substantial disadvantage of being false. In fact,
   one of the main points to see here is that the question whether
   theistic belief can receive warrant by way of religious experience (and
   thus in the basic way) is a wholly different question from the question
   whether there is a good argument from the existence of religious
   experience to the existence of God. (Not only are these different
   questions: an affirmative answer to the first does not require an
   affirmative answer to the second.) I shall argue that (a) is false.
   (a)'s being false doesn't distinguish religious experience and theistic
   or Christian belief from other kinds of experience and belief:
   perceptual experience and belief, memorial experience and belief, a
   priori experience and belief, and the like, all resemble Christian
   belief in this respect. In each of these cases, it is entirely possible
   that the beliefs in question have warrant even if there is no good
   argument from the existence of the experience in question to the truth
   of those beliefs. [423]

   This is one of the most important things to see here; before arguing
   this claim, however, I want to note another writer who also simply
   assumes that (a) is true, without so much as raising the question
   whether it is. According to the late J. L. Mackie,

   an experience may have a real object: we ordinarily suppose our normal
   perceptual experience to be or to include awareness of independently
   existing material spatio-temporal things. The question then is whether
   specifically religious experiences should be taken to have real
   objects, to give us genuine information about independently existing
   supernatural entities or spiritual beings. [424]

   So far so good: this is the question whether religious experience can
   or does provide warrant for belief in "independently existing
   supernatural entities or spiritual beings" such as God. But Mackie goes
   on:

   Whether their content [i.e., the content of religious experiences] has
   any objective truth is the crucial further question. . . . The issue is
   whether the hypothesis that there objectively is a something more gives
   a better explanation of the whole range of phenomena than can be given
   without it. (p. 183)

   Mackie concludes his examination of the possible warrant conferred by
   religious experience with these words:

   if the religious experiences do not yield any argument for a further
   supernatural reality, and if, as we have seen in previous chapters,
   there is no other good argument for such a conclusion, then these
   experiences include in their content beliefs that are probably false
   and in any case unjustified. [I take it unjustified', here, means
   without warrant'.] (p. 186)

   Here we see the very same assumption at work as in O'Hear. Like the
   latter, Mackie assumes that theistic (or other religious) belief could
   get warrant by way of religious experience only if there is a good
   argument from the existence and character of that experience to the
   existence of God (or "something more"). (And like O'Hear, he also seems
   to endorse (b).) Neither Mackie nor O'Hear argues for this claim,
   simply taking it utterly for granted that the only way a belief (or at
   any rate a religious or theistic belief) could possibly receive warrant
   from experience would be by way of an implicit argument from the
   existence and properties of that experience to the truth of the belief
   in question. But why think a thing like that? It certainly isn't
   self-evident. In fact, once we explicitly raise the question whether it
   is true, (a) looks extremely problematic. Presumably one wouldn't want
   to say that perceptual beliefs get warrant from experience only if
   there is a good (noncircular) argument from the existence of perceptual
   experience to the truth of perceptual beliefs; if not, however, what is
   the reason for saying it in the case of theistic or Christian belief?

   Mackie makes this assumption, I believe, because he makes another: that
   theistic and Christian belief is or is relevantly like a scientific
   hypothesis--something like special relativity, for example, or quantum
   mechanics, or the theory of evolution. Still speaking of whether
   theistic belief can receive warrant by way of religious experience, he
   (characteristically) remarks: "Here, as elsewhere, the supernaturalist
   hypothesis fails because there is an adequate and much more economical
   naturalistic alternative" (p. 198). This remark is relevant only if we
   think of belief in God as or as like a sort of scientific hypothesis, a
   theory designed to explain some body of evidence, and acceptable or
   warranted to the degree that it explains that evidence. On this way of
   looking at the matter, there is a relevant body of evidence shared by
   believer and unbeliever alike; theism is one hypothesis designed to
   explain that body of evidence, and naturalism is another; and theism
   has warrant only to the extent that it is a good explanation thereof,
   or at any rate a better explanation than naturalism.

   But why should we think of theism like this? Why should we think of it
   as a kind of hypothesis, a sort of incipient science? Consider the
   extended A/C model of chapters 8 and 9. On that model, it is not that
   one notes the experiences, whatever exactly they are, connected with
   the operation of the sensus divinitatis, and then makes a quick
   inference to the existence of God. One doesn't argue thus: I am aware
   of the beauty and majesty of the heavens (or of my own guilt, or that I
   am in danger, or of the glorious beauty of the morning, or of my good
   circumstances): therefore there is such a person as God. The Christian
   doesn't argue: "I find myself loving and delighting in the great things
   of the gospel and inclined to believe them; therefore they are true."
   Those would be silly arguments; fortunately they are neither invoked
   nor needed. The experiences and beliefs involved in the operation of
   the sensus divinitatis and IIHS serve as occasions for theistic belief,
   not premises for an argument to it.

   The same holds for, say, memory beliefs. Obviously one could take a
   Mackie-like view here as well. One could hold that our beliefs about
   the past are really like scientific hypotheses, designed to explain
   such present phenomena as (among other things) apparent memories, and
   if there were a more "economical" explanation of these phenomena that
   did not postulate past facts, then our usual beliefs in the past would
   have no warrant. But of course this is merely fantastic; we don't in
   fact accept memory beliefs as hypotheses to explain present experience
   at all. Everyone, even small children and others with no interest in
   explaining anything, accepts memory beliefs. We all remember such
   things as what we had for breakfast, and we never or almost never
   propose such beliefs as good explanations of present experience and
   phenomena. And the same holds for theism and Christian belief in the
   suggested model.

   So Mackie apparently believes that

   (c) theistic belief is or is relevantly like a quasi-scientific
   hypothesis, designed to explain religious experience (perhaps among
   other things).

   This explains why he believes (a), that is, that theistic belief can
   get no warrant from religious experience unless there is a good
   argument from premises reporting the experiences to the existence of
   God. As we have seen, however, (c) is false.

   Well, perhaps Mackie would insist on (a) even if it is clear that
   Christians do not take belief in God or Christian belief generally as
   hypotheses; perhaps he would nonetheless insist that the only way in
   which such belief could possibly get warrant would be by being
   successful quasi-scientific hypotheses. But precisely this is what is
   refuted by the A/C model of chapter 6 and the extended A/C model of
   chapters 8 and 9. These models show that it is clearly possible that
   theistic and Christian belief have warrant, but not by way of being
   hypotheses that nicely explain a certain range of data. For if
   Christian belief is, in fact, true, then obviously there could be such
   cognitive processes as the sensus divinitatis and IIHS or faith. As we
   saw, beliefs produced by these processes would meet the conditions
   necessary and sufficient for having warrant: they would be the result
   of cognitive faculties functioning properly in a congenial epistemic
   environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth.
   Hence (a) is plainly false. It is plainly false that Christian belief
   has warrant (and could constitute knowledge) only if there is also a
   good argument from the existence of the experiences involved in the
   operation of IIHS to the truth of Christian belief; and the same point
   holds for theistic belief and the sensus divinitatis. Why suppose that
   if God proposes to enable us to have knowledge of a certain sort, he
   must arrange things in such a way that we can see an argumentative
   connection between the experiences involved in the cognitive processes
   he selects and the truth of the beliefs these processes produce? That
   requirement is both entirely gratuitous and also false, since it
   doesn't hold for such splendid examples of sources of knowledge as
   perception, memory, and a priori intuition.

  II. What Can Experience Show?

   A second objection is that Christian and theistic belief could never
   receive warrant from religious experience because religious experience
   could never indicate or show anything as specific as that there is such
   a person as God--let alone such beliefs as that in Christ God was
   reconciling the world to himself. How could experience of any sort
   reveal the existence of a being who is omniscient, omnipotent, wholly
   good, and a fitting object of worship? How could it reveal that there
   is only one being like that? How could experience carry that kind of
   information? John Mackie is a spokesman for this objection too:

   Religious experience is also essentially incapable of supporting any
   argument for the traditional central doctrines of theism. Nothing in an
   experience as such could reveal a creator of the world, or omnipotence,
   or omniscience, or perfect goodness, or eternity, or even that there is
   just one god. (182)

   Now why would Mackie say a thing like that? And what precisely does he
   mean? For present purposes, suppose we restrict ourselves to the
   experience involved in the operation of the sensus divinitatis. I think
   what Mackie means is this: given any course of experience, religious or
   otherwise--that is, given any course of sensuous imagery, affective
   experience, and inclinations to believe I might have--that experience
   could be exactly as it is and there be no omnipotent being, or
   omniscient being, or perfectly good or eternal being. My experience
   could be precisely what it is, and there be no such person as God or
   anyone or anything at all like God. I could feel the very way I do
   feel, and there be no God. [425]

   I think this is what he means; I can't be sure. That is because it
   seems of only dubious relevance. Perhaps it is true that my experience
   could be just as it is and there be no such person as God; perhaps the
   existence and character of my experience don't entail the existence of
   God. What follows? Why should it follow that my experience cannot
   reveal a creator of the world or an omnipotent or omniscient being?
   Consider an analogy: in WPF (pp. 50ff.), I noted that we all ordinarily
   think we have existed for many years (or, in the case of you younger
   readers, many months). It is logically possible, however, that I should
   have existed for only a microsecond or two, displaying all the
   temporally specific properties I do in fact display. Then I wouldn't
   have such properties as being more than sixty years old or being
   responsible for something that happened ten minutes ago, although I
   would have such properties as thinking that I am more than sixty years
   old and that I am responsible for something that happened ten minutes
   ago.

   Not only is this logically possible, it is also compatible with the
   existence and character of all of my present experience. It is not
   compatible with my beliefs, of course (in that I believe I've existed
   for quite a while); still, it is compatible with the existence of those
   beliefs. It is possible that I should have precisely the beliefs and
   experiences I now have, despite my having come into existence just a
   second or less ago. (In fact [see WPF, pp. 50ff.], that is precisely
   what happens, according to those who think the word I', as I use it,
   denotes something like a momentary person stage.) For any course of
   experience and any set of beliefs I might have at this very moment, it
   is possible that I have that experience and hold those beliefs but
   nonetheless have existed for only a second or less.

   Does it follow that nothing in my experience can reveal that I have
   existed for more than the last second or so? Certainly not. To assume
   that it does follow is to assume something more general and vastly
   stronger than O'Hear's (a) (above, p. 328)--which, as we have already
   seen, is itself too strong to be true. There isn't the slightest reason
   to believe that if experience can reveal p, then the existence of that
   experience (or the proposition that it occurs) must entail the truth of
   p. There is no reason to think that if experience can reveal a
   proposition p, then that experience must be such that it (logically)
   cannot so much as exist if p is false. For consider perception, and
   consider your experience--the sensuous imagery, the affective
   experience, the doxastic experience--on an occasion when you see a
   horse. It is compatible with those experiences that there be no horse
   there then, that there be no horses at all, that there be no material
   objects that exist when I am not undergoing those experiences, and,
   indeed, that there be no material objects at all. Does it follow that
   perceptual experience doesn't reveal an external world? Does it follow
   that I can't tell from my experience that there is a horse in my
   backyard? Or that the lilacs are not in bloom? Surely not; that would
   be a leap of magnificent (if grotesque) proportions.

   Well then, how does perceptual experience reveal an external world--a
   horse, say? When I perceive a horse, I am the subject of experiences of
   various kinds: sensuous imagery (I am appeared to in a certain
   complicated and hard-to-describe fashion) and also, ordinarily,
   affective experience (perhaps I am frightened by the horse, or feel a
   certain admiration for it, or delight in its speed and strength or
   whatever). There is also doxastic experience. When I perceive a horse,
   there is that sensuous and affective experience, but also the feeling,
   experience, intimation with respect to a certain proposition (that I
   see a horse) that that proposition is true, right, to be believed, the
   way things really are. This doxastic experience plays a crucial role in
   perception. How does perceptual experience teach me that there is a
   horse in my backyard? By way of this belief's being occasioned (in
   part) by the experience, and by way of the belief's having
   warrant--being produced by properly functioning cognitive faculties in
   an appropriate epistemic environment (both mini and maxi), according to
   a design plan successfully aimed at truth. So can I tell from my
   experience that there is a horse there? Certainly. Telling such a thing
   from one's experience is forming the belief that a horse is there in
   response to the sensuous and doxastic experience, the belief's being
   formed under the conditions that confer warrant. The fact is, this
   happens all the time.

   My point here is not that, in fact, people do tell from their
   experience such things as that there is a horse in the backyard, but
   rather that this is possible. More exactly, my point is that your
   seeing a horse in your backyard (thus determining by experience that
   there is a horse there) is not precluded by the fact that your
   experience is logically compatible with there being no horse there (or
   anywhere else). Your experience is logically compatible with there
   being no horse there: fair enough; but it simply doesn't follow that
   you can't tell by experience that there is a horse there. (How else
   would you tell? Deduce it from first principles and self-evident
   truths?) That's the way it is with horses; can I also tell from my
   experience that I have existed for more than a microsecond or so?
   Certainly. I do this by remembering, for example, that I had breakfast
   much more than a microsecond ago and that I went to college
   embarrassingly long ago. True, my experience here (in particular, my
   doxastic experience) is compatible with its being the case that I have
   existed for only a microsecond; it simply doesn't follow that I can't
   tell by experience that I have existed for at least a good hour, say. I
   determine by experience that I have existed for more than a microsecond
   if the belief that I did something more than a microsecond ago is
   occasioned by my experience (doxastic and otherwise) and if that belief
   is formed under conditions that confer warrant upon it. This happens
   often: so we often tell (by experience) that we have existed for more
   than a microsecond.

   And of course the same goes for religious experience and theistic
   belief. True: the existence of the experiences that go with the
   operation of the sensus divinitatis (or IIHS) are compatible with there
   being no omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good creator of the universe.
   It doesn't follow from that, however, that we can't tell--and tell,
   broadly speaking, by experience--that there is such a person. For here,
   as elsewhere, there is doxastic experience: the belief that there is an
   almighty person to whom I owe allegiance and obedience just seems
   right, proper, true, the way things are. And one tells by experience
   that there is such a person if (1) the beliefs in question are formed
   in response to the experience (doxastic and otherwise) that go with the
   operation of the sensus divinitatis and (2) those beliefs are formed
   under the conditions of warrant. That these conditions should be met
   is, of course, entirely compatible with the fact that the existence of
   the experience, doxastic and otherwise, accompanying the operation of
   the sensus divinitatis is compatible with the falsehood of its
   deliverances. These beliefs can have warrant, and enough warrant to
   constitute knowledge, even if the existence of those experiences is
   compatible with the denials of those beliefs. [426] The same goes for
   belief in the great things of the gospel: they too can have warrant
   (and warrant sufficient for knowledge), even if, in fact, the existence
   of the experiences accompanying the IIHS is compatible with the
   falsehood of those beliefs.

   Could it be that Mackie's point lies in a different direction? Perhaps
   he's thinking like this: an experience could reveal a blue object, all
   right, but not an omnipotent object. The claim is not that experience
   can't reveal any objects at all; the claim is rather that there are
   some properties such that experience could not reveal that there is an
   object with those properties. Examples would be such properties as
   omniscience, omnipotence, being divine, being the son of God, and the
   like. Here Mackie would presumably be relying on the analogy with
   sensuous experience: sensuous experience can perhaps reveal the
   existence of objects with color and shape properties (it can reveal the
   existence of blue and square objects) but not the existence of objects
   with properties like omnipotence.

   By way of response: this is perhaps true of sensuous experience and of
   perception. It is not true of experience generally, however; in
   particular, it isn't true of doxastic experience. Memory and a priori
   belief formation involve doxastic experience; and the deliverances of
   memory and reason are not limited to the existence of things with
   perceptible properties. The same goes for the sensus divinitatis and
   the IIHS. Should we therefore conclude that what one learns, if
   anything, by way of these sources of belief is not really something
   learned by experience? Perhaps. If we do, however, then the claim that
   one can't learn by experience that there is for example an omnipotent
   being is no longer relevant to the model's stipulation that one can
   learn these things by way of the sensus divinitatis or the IIHS. Maybe
   one can't learn that sort of thing by experience; it will not follow
   that one cannot learn that sort of thing by way of the sensus
   divinitatis and the IIHS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [425] Conceding for purposes of argument that God is not a necessary
   being. Of course if God is a necessary being, as most of the Christian
   tradition has thought, then his existence is entailed by the existence
   of my experience, because entailed by the existence of anything at all.

   [426] I point out that this is so on my account of warrant, but the
   same goes for the other main accounts. Clearly beliefs produced by IIHS
   could be coherent with the appropriate body of belief, or formed by a
   reliable belief-producing mechanism, or justified, even if, as Mackie
   points out, the existence of the relevant experiences is compatible
   with the falsehood of the beliefs in question.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III. A Killer Argument?

   Richard Gale asks whether religious experience is cognitive', as he
   puts it. [427] What precisely does he mean? I think he means to ask
   whether religious experience is or could be part of a cognitive process
   that puts us in epistemic touch with God. The question is whether
   religious experience resembles sense experience in being part of a
   cognitive process that issues in knowledge of or warranted belief about
   an independent reality: God, for example. Gale argues that in fact
   religious experience is not cognitive, in this sense. He gives this
   argument in the course of addressing what he calls "the analogical
   argument for cognitivity," which he associates with William Alston,
   Gary Gutting, Richard Swinburne, and William Wainwright. Their
   argument, he says, has two premises:

   1. Religious experiences are analogous to sense experiences.

   2. Sense experiences are cognitive.

   Therefore:

   3. Religious experiences are cognitive. (p. 288)

   Gale directs most of his fire at the first premise.

   Here we must issue a couple of caveats. First, strictly speaking, Gale
   is objecting to this argument by objecting to premise 1; so, strictly
   speaking, his conclusion would not be that religious experience or
   belief is not cognitive, but only that this particular argument for its
   cognitivity fails. For present purposes, this doesn't matter: in fact
   Gale does much more than merely object to premise 1. What he really
   offers and what I want to consider is an argument for the conclusion
   that religious experience and belief are necessarily not cognitive.
   This argument, if successful, would show that it isn't possible that we
   should have anything like a perceptual awareness of God. Second, he
   also seems to believe or assume that any experiential awareness of God
   would have to be or be like perceptual awareness of God (that any
   experience of God that was part of a cognitive process yielding
   knowledge of or warranted belief about God would have to play the same
   role, in that process, as perceptual experience plays in perception);
   he therefore concludes, I think, that it is not possible to have
   knowledge of God by way of experience--that is, that religious
   experience is not cognitive.

   Now it isn't entirely clear just how Gale's argument bears on my
   argument for the conclusion that theistic and Christian belief can have
   warrant by way of the sensus divinitatis and the IIHS (that, given the
   truth of these beliefs, there are no cogent objections to their having
   warrant in that way, so that any objection to these beliefs will have
   to be to their truth rather than to their rationality or
   reasonability). First of all, Gale didn't have my argument in mind, an
   omission that is entirely excusable, given that he proposed his
   argument well before I proposed mine. But second, the bearing of his
   argument on mine isn't clear because it isn't clear whether knowledge
   by way of the sensus divinitatis and the IIHS is properly thought of as
   knowledge by way of experience. It would be a shame, however, to pass
   up the chance to consider an argument as engaging as Gale's; so suppose
   we assume, for purposes of argument, that if there is any such thing as
   knowledge by way of these processes, that knowledge is knowledge by way
   of experience. Then we can consider Gale's argument as an argument
   against my conclusion. (Of course it could turn out that his argument
   is only dubiously relevant to mine precisely because it is dubious that
   knowledge by way of the sensus divinitatis and the IIHS, if there is
   any such knowledge, should be thought of as knowledge by experience.)

   So how does the argument go? It begins with a playful threat directed
   at those who, as Gale thinks, accept the analogical argument for the
   cognitivity of religious experience:

   We have yet to unearth a deep disanalogy between sense and religious
   experience that will totally destroy the analogical premise of its
   analogical argument. This "big disanalogy" will prove to be the
   shipwreck of this defense of cognitivity, a time for Alston, Gutting,
   Swinburne, and Wainwright to join their fellow analogical arguers on
   the deck for a few heart-felt choruses of "Nearer My God to Thee." (pp.
   326)

   Brave words! Does Gale speak with the tongue of an angel, or is he only
   a clanging cymbal? Precisely what is this killer argument?

   Necessarily, any cognitive perception is a veridical perception of an
   objective reality. It now will be argued that it is conceptually
   impossible for there to be a veridical perception of God . . . from
   which it follows by modus tollens that it is impossible that there be a
   cognitive religious experience. . . . A veridical sense perception must
   have an object that is able to exist when not actually perceived and be
   the common object of different sense perceptions. For this to be
   possible, the object must be housed in a space and time that includes
   both the object and perceiver. It then is shown that there is no
   religious experience analogue to this concept of objective existence,
   there being no analogous dimensions to space and time in which God,
   along with the perceiver, is housed and which can be invoked to make
   sense of God existing when not actually perceived and being the common
   object of different religious experiences. Because of this big
   disanalogy, God is categoreally unsuited to serve as the object of a
   veridical perception, whether sensory or nonsensory. (pp. 326-27)

   Note first the implied claim in the second sentence: if it is
   conceptually impossible that there be a veridical perception of God,
   then it follows that it is impossible that there be "a cognitive
   religious experience"; Gale seems to believe that any variety of
   religious experience would be cognitive only if it were a part of a
   veridical perception of God. This seems wrong: as I argued in chapters
   6 and 8, we can appropriately think of the sensus divinitatis and IIHS,
   on the extended A/C model, as providing knowledge of God that is
   knowledge by way of experience, but not perceptual knowledge. Consider
   the sensus divinitatis: you are in grave danger and form the belief
   that God is able to help; there needn't be anything here we can
   sensibly refer to as perception. You suddenly realize that what you did
   was despicable; you form the belief that God disapproves, acknowledging
   to him that you did it; again, there need be nothing present that is
   properly called perception. On the model, there is knowledge of God
   here, and experience plays a crucial role--both the doxastic experience
   and also the experience that goes with feeling afraid or guilty or
   ashamed. This experience is closely associated with the operation of
   the sensus divinitatis, and perhaps triggers the production of the
   relevant belief. But the result is not, I should think, a perceptual
   belief. Furthermore, it is if anything clearer yet that knowledge of
   God and of the great things of the gospel by the IIHS is not perceptual
   knowledge (above, p. 288). If we don't think of the sensus divinitatis
   and IIHS as issuing in perceptual knowledge, however, then Gale's
   objection would be irrelevant.

   For present purposes then, suppose we also temporarily concede that
   knowledge of God by way of sensus divinitatis or IIHS would be
   perceptual knowledge of God, at least in an appropriately analogical
   sense. Alternatively, suppose we consider Gale's objection to
   perceptual knowledge of God, bracketing, for the moment, the question
   of its bearing on the extended A/C model. How does this objection go?
   "A veridical sense perception," he says, "must have an object that is
   able to exist when not actually perceived and be the common object of
   different sense perceptions." That seems right, or at any rate
   plausible; and if there is such a thing as experience of God, God will,
   of course, be able to exist when [428] not being experienced by any
   human cognizer (even if in fact his presence is always experienced by
   some human being or other). Furthermore, God himself, the very same
   being, would be grasped, cognized, or apprehended by many different
   persons. So what exactly is supposed to be the problem with supposing
   that you and I are both aware of God, and that God continues to exist
   when neither of us is aware of him? The problem, he thinks, is that if
   an object can exist when unperceived, and can be perceived by different
   perceivers, then "the object must be housed in a space and time that
   includes both the object and perceiver." Why so? Gale's strongest
   argument here is contained in the following passages:

   Another invidious consequence of their nondimensionality is that no
   analogous explanation can be given of how they can exist unperceived
   and be common objects of different perceptions to that which was
   previously given for empirical particulars. Whereas we could explain
   our failure to perceive an empirical particular, as well as our
   perceiving numerically one and the same empirical particular, in terms
   of our relationship to it in some nonempirical dimension, no such
   analogous explanation can be offered for our failure to perceive God
   and the like, or our perceiving numerically one and the same God. . . .

   Similarly, how is Gutting going to decide when two religious
   experiences of a very powerful and loving nonhuman person had by two
   people at one time or by one person at two different times are of
   numerically one and the same being or only qualitatively similar ones?
   (pp. 341-42)

   The alleged problem, therefore, seems to be twofold: it concerns (a)
   perceiving God at one time but not at another and (b) two different
   people's both perceiving God--that is, perceiving the very same
   all-powerful, all-knowing, and loving nonhuman person. It isn't as easy
   to see, however, just what Gale is claiming about (a) and (b). Two
   possibilities present themselves for (a) and three for (b). With
   respect to (a), Gale could be claiming that (1) if God is not in time
   and space, then no explanation could be given of our perceiving him at
   one time but not at another, and (2) if God is not in time and space,
   then it would not be possible that we experience him at one time but
   not at another. With respect to (b), the same two possibilities present
   themselves, and in addition there is the possibility that (3) if God is
   not in time and space, then we couldn't decide (tell) when two people
   are both perceiving God--that is, both perceiving the very same divine
   person.

   Well, consider (1) with respect to (a). Strictly speaking, I suppose,
   it wouldn't damage the sensus divinitatis model or the claim that it is
   possible to perceive God if there were no explanation of our perceiving
   God at one time but not at another. All the model says is that such
   knowledge occurs; it doesn't go on to add that there is an explanation
   of it, unless the model itself is an explanation. Still, I believe Gale
   is really claiming, in this first possibility, that we can't see any
   way in which it could happen that we should perceive God at one time
   but not at another. More strongly, I think he means to claim that we
   can see that a person could perceive God at one time and not at another
   only if he and we were in the same time and space. We can see that this
   is the only condition under which such a thing could happen. So really,
   (1) and (2) with respect to (a) come to the same claim: it would be
   possible for us to perceive or experience God at one time but not at
   another only if he were in the same space and time (spacetime) as we.

   So says Gale; is he right? I think not. Even with respect to things
   that are in space and time, there are a wide variety of explanations
   for my perceiving a thing at one time and not at another. I might
   perceive the thing at t[1], but then at t[2] have my eyes closed, or be
   asleep, or thinking of something else, or have lost my glasses, or have
   a brown paper bag over my head, or be under water, or be suffering from
   cognitive malfunction. Similarly for perceiving or cognizing God. God
   is, of course, always existent; furthermore, because (as we may assume
   for purposes of argument) he isn't in space, he is never related to me
   spatially in different ways at different times. Still, why should that
   mean that I couldn't perceive him or experience him at one time and not
   at another? I might perceive or experience him at t[1] but not at t[2]
   because at the latter I am asleep, or my attention might be elsewhere
   (I have just hit my thumb with a hammer or shot myself in the foot), or
   I might be suffering from cognitive malfunction, or I might be angry
   with God because of my friend's suffering and thus not in the right
   frame of mind. There are plenty of ways in which I might perceive him
   at one time but not at another, even if it's not possible that I be
   spatially related to him in different ways at different times.

   Even if I am wide awake and eager to feel his presence, eager to
   receive an answer to prayer, or guidance, or a sense of his love, or a
   perception of his beauty and grace, I might not get what I am hoping
   for. This might be because at that time, and for reasons of his own,
   God doesn't propose to communicate with me in those ways. Even if I am
   properly related to you both spatially and temporally and ask you a
   question, I still might not get an answer. I ask you why you are
   smiling in that enigmatic way: you make no reply, perhaps because you
   think the question is an impertinence, or not worth answering, or
   because answering would interfere with your desire to remain enigmatic.
   When it comes to knowing and knowing about other persons, their
   cooperation is often required. Naturally enough, the same would be true
   of God, and perhaps on many or most occasions he chooses not to be
   perceived. As I argued in chapter 6, it isn't easy to say just what the
   necessary and sufficient conditions for perception are; whatever they
   are, however, they involve a certain sort of experience, an experience
   in which the perceived object seems to be present to or given to the
   percipient. Clearly, this experience could be absent at one time and
   present at another, whether or not God is in space.

   This argument, then--the argument for the claim that if God is not in
   space and time, then we couldn't experience or perceive him at one time
   but not at another--seems to me to be entirely without promise. But
   what about Gale's claims with respect to (b)? Here he makes a double
   assertion: if God is not in time and space, then there could be no
   explanation of two people's both perceiving or experiencing him (we
   can't conceive of any way in which this could happen), and furthermore
   there couldn't be any way of telling that it was God, the very same
   person, that I experienced on two different occasions. Is there any
   reason to accept either of the suggestions? How could it happen that
   two different people should both perceive or experience God? Suppose
   both had the right kind of experience, including that sense of God's
   being present, being given. Suppose, furthermore, both formed the right
   kind of true belief about God--for example, that he is indeed present,
   given to them. And suppose, finally, the conditions of warrant are met:
   this belief is produced in them by cognitive faculties functioning
   properly in a congenial epistemic environment according to a design
   plan successfully aimed at truth. Then they would both be perceiving
   God, despite the fact that God is not in space. Is there really a
   problem here? If so, it is well concealed. Gale or someone else might
   claim that there is a problem with the very idea of our forming beliefs
   about God: what would make it God the belief was about? But this is a
   wholly different kind of objection and is really the objection dealt
   with in chapters 1 and 2; it is as inconclusive here as it was there.

   Similarly for the other part of the suggestion: that it would be
   impossible to tell whether it was the same divine person one
   experienced on two different occasions. Because God is not in space, so
   the claim goes, we could never tell whether we encountered the same
   divine being on occasion B that we had encountered on occasion A. But
   is there any reason for thinking this true? This argument, I think, is
   as fatally flawed as the last. The idea seems to be that with objects
   not in space, one can't, in principle, tell when one has encountered
   the same one again, or only encountered another thing that is
   appropriately like the first thing. But is this in fact true? What
   exactly is the problem? Suppose your experience is related to God in
   the right way and you form beliefs about him on two subsequent
   occasions, t[1] and t[2]; at t[2] you form the true belief that the
   being about whom you are then forming a belief is the same being about
   whom you formed a belief at t[1]: if this belief is formed under
   warrant-conferring conditions, then you would have told that the being
   about whom you formed a belief at t[2] is the very same being as the
   one about whom you formed the belief at t[1]. Indeed, that's just what
   it is to tell that the t[2] belief is about the same being as the t[1]
   belief. Well, perhaps the claim is that one can never tell that a t[2]
   belief is about the same being as a t[1] belief, if both beliefs are
   about a nonspatial object. This also seems quite wrong. At t[1] I think
   of the null set, or the proposition that all men are mortal; I then
   read Gale's book or watch a football game on TV, and at t[2] think
   again about the null set (or that proposition). Is there really a
   problem with my telling or knowing that it is the same thing I think
   about at t[2] as at t[1]? Should I be in doubt as to whether the set I
   think of at t[2] really is the same set as that I thought of at t[1]?

   Could it be that Gale's suggestion is that if a dispute arose over
   whether what I experience on a given occasion is the same being as you
   experience on a given occasion, the dispute might turn out to be
   intractable? Alternatively, might I not (like Teresa of Avila and
   others) be uncertain, on a given occasion, whether it was God I was in
   contact with, as opposed to Satan, who appears as an angel of light and
   is out to deceive me? Couldn't this happen? Of course it could. But it
   doesn't show I could never tell that I am experiencing God; what it
   shows is only that perhaps on those occasions I can't tell whether it
   is God with whom I am in contact. True: it is possible that appearances
   be just what they are and I not experience God. As we have already
   seen, however, nothing follows from this: the same is true with respect
   to perception, memory, and my knowledge that I have existed for a
   substantial length of time. It is clearly possible that I have the
   experience that goes with perceiving a horse and yet no horse is there.
   [429] So it could be that on some occasion I really can't tell: still,
   this hardly shows that I can never tell. And once more: the way I tell
   whether it is God, that very person, whom I perceive or experience on
   two different occasions, is by forming (under warrant-conferring
   conditions) the true belief that indeed I encountered God on both
   occasions.

   I think it is clear, therefore, that these arguments don't even begin
   to show that perception of God is impossible, or that religious
   experience is never cognitive, or that there couldn't be knowledge of
   God by way of the sensus divinitatis and IIHS. Gale's arguments depend
   upon a lot of assumptions that have little or no claim to assent: that
   if you sometimes can't tell whether p, for example, then you can never
   tell whether p, or that if God is not in space and time, then you could
   never tell that it was he with whom you were in contact on successive
   occasions; or that if God is not in space and time, it couldn't be that
   you should experience him on one occasion and not on another. All of
   these assumptions seem monumentally dubious at best. [430]

  IV. Son of Great Pumpkin?

   Now according to the extended A/C model, belief in God and belief in
   the central tenets of the Christian faith can be rational and have
   warrant when they are not accepted on the evidential basis of other
   beliefs. On this model, they can have warrant that they don't get by
   way of being believed on the evidential basis of other beliefs; they
   can have warrant that they don't get by way of warrant transfer from
   other beliefs. In this respect, they are like memory beliefs,
   perceptual beliefs, some a priori beliefs, and so on. The beliefs of
   the Christian faith, on the suggestion in question, are a proper
   starting point for thought. Another way to put this: these beliefs are
   properly basic, and properly basic with respect to warrant. What I mean
   to consider next is a nest of objections to the thought that these
   beliefs could receive warrant in the basic way. Now objections of this
   sort have so far been centered on the claim that belief in God (as
   opposed to specifically Christian belief) is or can be properly basic;
   that is because for the most part it is belief in God, not specifically
   Christian belief, that has so far been claimed to be or possibly to be
   properly basic. To simplify matters, I will confine discussion to the
   sensus divinitatis and belief in God; what I say, however, will apply
   equally well to the IIHS and the beliefs produced by it.

   First, there is the claim that if belief in God is really properly
   basic with respect to warrant, then arguments and objections will not
   be relevant to it; it will be beyond rational scrutiny and will be
   insulated from objections and defeaters. But obviously objection and
   argument are relevant to theistic belief: therefore, it isn't
   warrant-basic. Thus Michael Martin: "Plantinga's foundationalism is
   radically relativistic and puts any belief beyond rational appraisal
   once it is declared basic." [431]

   Why think a thing like that? Theistic belief would certainly not be
   immune to argument and defeat just by virtue of being basic. In this,
   theistic belief only resembles other kinds of beliefs accepted in the
   basic way. You tell me that you went to the Grand Tetons this summer; I
   acquire the belief that you did so and hold it in the basic way. [432]
   But then your wife tells me that the fact is you went to the Wind
   Rivers, which, she says, you always confuse with the Tetons.
   Furthermore, the next time I see you, you go on at great length about
   the glories of Gannett Peak (which is in the Wind Rivers). Then I will
   no longer believe you went to the Tetons, despite the fact that I
   originally formed that belief in the basic way. Another example: I see
   what looks like a sheep in the field across the road, and I form in the
   basic way the belief that there is a sheep there; you, the owner of the
   field, tell me that there aren't any sheep in it, although there is a
   dog in the neighborhood that looks just like a sheep from this
   distance. Then I will no longer believe that I see a sheep, despite the
   fact that the belief is accepted in the basic way. Still another
   example: Gottlob Frege formed in the basic way the belief that for
   every property or condition, there exists the set of just those things
   that have the property or satisfy the condition; he learned to his
   sorrow that this is not so (Bertrand Russell pointed out that it leads
   to paradox [433] ), and this despite the fact that the original belief
   had been basic.

   So it is not true, in general, that if a belief is held in the basic
   way, then it is immune to argument or rational evaluation; why,
   therefore, think it must hold for theistic belief? The fact, if it is a
   fact, that belief in God is properly basic doesn't for a moment imply
   that it is immune to argument, objection, or defeat; it is surely no
   consequence of my foundationalism or of the A/C model (simpliciter or
   extended) that basic beliefs are beyond rational appraisal. [434] I
   wouldn't so much as mention this, except that there seems to be a
   fairly widespread impression to the contrary.

   A related complaint: according to the Great Pumpkin Objection, [435] if
   belief in God can be properly basic, then so can any other belief, no
   matter how bizarre: if belief in God can be properly basic, then all
   bets are off, and anything goes. You might as well claim that belief in
   the Great Pumpkin (who returns every Halloween to the most sincere
   pumpkin patch) is properly basic with respect to warrant. You might as
   well make the same claim for atheism, voodoo, astrology, witchcraft,
   and anything else you can think of. According to Dostoevski, if God
   does not exist, everything is possible; according to this objection, if
   belief in God is properly basic, everything is warranted. This
   objection, of course, is plainly false. To recognize that some kinds of
   belief are properly basic with respect to warrant doesn't for a moment
   commit one to thinking all other kinds are; even if the extended A/C
   model is correct, it doesn't follow that these other beliefs are
   properly basic with respect to warrant. Descartes and Locke thought
   some beliefs were properly basic with respect to warrant; should we
   object that they were therefore committed to thinking just any belief
   is properly basic?

   So the Great Pumpkin Objection as it stands is obviously a nonstarter.
   Michael Martin recognizes this, [436] but raises a related objection;
   it is this objection, I think, that underlies his claim that my views
   are "radically relativistic":

   Although reformed epistemologists would not have to accept voodoo
   beliefs as rational, voodoo followers would be able to claim that
   insofar as they are basic in the voodoo community they are rational
   and, moreover, that reformed thought was irrational in this community.
   Indeed, Plantinga's proposal would generate many different communities
   that could legitimately claim that their basic beliefs are rational. .
   . . Among the communities generated might be devil worshipers, flat
   earthers, and believers in fairies, just so long as belief in the
   devil, the flatness of the earth, and fairies was basic in the
   respective communities. (p. 272)

   Call this objection Son of Great Pumpkin' (SGP). How exactly does it
   go? The first thing to see here is that SGP has moved up a level from
   the Great Pumpkin Objection itself. The latter complains that, on the
   view I've been presenting, just any proposition, no matter how
   fantastic, would have to be accepted as properly basic; this complaint,
   as Martin sees, is obviously false. SGP, therefore, moves up a level:
   according to SGP, someone who took any proposition p in the basic way
   could legitimately claim that p was properly basic--properly basic with
   respect to rationality, says Martin--that is, such that it can be both
   rationally accepted and accepted in the basic way. Take any possible
   community and any beliefs accepted as basic in that community: the
   epistemologists of that community could legitimately claim that these
   beliefs are rationally accepted in the basic way. Could, if what? What
   does Martin mean? There is more than one possibility, but I think he
   means this: could, if the Reformed epistemologist' can legitimately
   claim that theistic belief is properly basic. So the structure of the
   objection would have to be this:

   (1) If Reformed epistemologists can legitimately claim that belief in
   God is rationally acceptable in the basic way, then for any other
   belief accepted in some community, the epistemologists of that
   community could legitimately claim that it was properly basic, no
   matter how bizarre the belief.

   But

   (2) The consequent of this conditional is false.

   So

   (3) The Reformed epistemologist can't legitimately claim that belief in
   God is rationally acceptable in the basic way.

   Is this a good argument? One initial problem is that the argument is
   pretty loosely stated; Martin doesn't tell us what he means by
   rational', and he doesn't tell us what he means by legitimately'. As to
   the first, perhaps the best candidates would be rationality as
   justification (deontological justification), internal rationality, and
   rationality in the sense of warrant. We needn't linger long over
   rationality as justification: obviously the voodooists could be within
   their intellectual rights in thinking what they do think (if only by
   virtue of cognitive malfunction); hence they could be justified. But
   then, presumably someone (the voodoo epistemologists, e.g.) could
   legitimately claim that those voodooists were justified, no matter
   what, precisely, Martin means by legitimately'. Premise (2) of the
   argument, specified with respect to justification, is thus clearly
   false.

   Well, suppose we specify the argument to internal rationality; take
   rationally acceptable' to mean internally rational'. Then again the
   answer is pretty easy. A belief is internally rational if it is
   produced by faculties functioning properly downstream from experience'
   (see above, p. 110)--if, given your experience (including doxastic
   experience) at the time in question, it is compatible with proper
   function that you accept the belief in question. That could certainly
   be so for the voodooists. Perhaps they have always been taught that
   these voodoo beliefs are true, and all alleged contrary evidence is
   cleverly explained away by the priests; or perhaps they are all in the
   grip of some cognitive malfunction upstream from experience, one that
   skews their doxastic experience. If that could be so for the voodoists,
   then the voodoo epistemologists could no doubt know that the voodoists
   are internally rational in these judgments, and hence (one supposes,
   legitimately) report this fact. Premise (2) fails for internal
   rationality, just as for justification.

   Accordingly, if we are to have something worth considering here, the
   argument must presumably be specified to rationality in the sense of
   warrant. The question is whether, if I can legitimately claim that
   belief in God is properly basic with respect to warrant, the
   epistemologists of the voodoo community can legitimately claim that
   those voodoo beliefs are properly basic with respect to warrant. But
   now we do need to know what is meant, here, by legitimately claim'.
   There seem to be three salient possibilities: claim truthfully, claim
   justifiably, and claim warrantedly. First, therefore, Martin could mean
   that if belief in God can truthfully be said to be warrant basic, then
   the same goes for voodoo belief. We have already seen, however, that
   this is false. It is entirely possible that belief in God have warrant
   in the basic way and voodoo belief not have it in the basic way; this
   state of affairs would obtain, for example, if the A/C model is true,
   but voodoo belief originates in some kind of cognitive error. So
   premise (1) of the argument would fail.

   Second, Martin might mean that if belief in God can justifiably be said
   to be warrant basic, then the same goes for voodoo belief: it too can
   justifiably be said to be warrant basic. Again, this is too easy:
   obviously those epistemologists might be justified in thinking that
   voodoo belief was warrant basic: it might seem just obvious to them,
   after protracted reflection and after considering objections, that,
   indeed, voodoo belief is warrant basic. So taken, premise (2) fails.

   If we are to locate a respectable objection, then, it looks as if we
   must specify legitimately' to warrantedly'. Take both rationally
   acceptable' and legitimately' as warrantedly': then is the argument a
   good one? Martin's claim, so construed, would be that (1) if the claim
   made by the Reformed epistemologist--namely, that belief in God is
   properly basic with respect to warrant--has warrant, then for any
   proposition p (no matter how bizarre) accepted by some community, if
   the epistemologists of that community were to claim that p is properly
   basic with respect to warrant, their claim would itself have warrant;
   (2) the consequent of (1) is false; the conclusion of the argument
   would be that the Reformed epistemologist's claim does not enjoy
   warrant. A problem with evaluating this version of the argument is that
   the Reformed epistemologist (this Reformed epistemologist, anyway)
   doesn't claim as part of his philosophical position that belief in God
   and the deliverances of IIHS do have warrant. That is because (above,
   p. 186ff.) in all likelihood they have warrant only if they are true,
   and I am not arguing that these beliefs are in fact true. No doubt the
   Reformed epistemologist does believe that they are true, and is
   prepared to claim that they are, even if he doesn't propose to argue
   for that claim. So for the nonce, suppose we think of the Reformed
   epistemologists as actually claiming that belief in God and the
   deliverances of the IIHS enjoy warrant in the basic way; suppose
   further that they claim this legitimately'--that is, under the current
   interpretation, suppose this claim itself has warrant for them. Would
   it follow that for any proposition p, if there were a community who
   endorsed p, these people (or the epistemologists of their community)
   would be warranted in believing that p is properly basic with respect
   to warrant for those in this community?

   It would not follow. Suppose the extended A/C model is true (not just
   possible); then (a) the central claims of the Christian faith are, in
   fact, true, (b) there really are such cognitive processes as the sensus
   divinitatis and IIHS, and (c) their deliverances do meet the conditions
   for warrant. Suppose a Reformed epistemologist believes the great
   things of the gospel on the basis of the sensus divinitatis and IIHS;
   suppose he notes, further, that his belief and that of many others is
   accepted in the basic way (where, of course, accepting p on the basis
   of testimony is one way to believe p in the basic way). Suppose he
   further comes to see or believe that God intends his children to know
   about him and to know the great things of the gospel, but also that it
   isn't possible for enough of us to know enough about him by way of
   inference from other beliefs; he therefore concludes (correctly) that
   God has instituted cognitive processes by virtue of which we human
   beings can form these true beliefs in the basic way. He concludes still
   further that the cognitive processes or mechanisms by way of which we
   form these beliefs are functioning properly when it delivers them, and
   are also functioning in an epistemically congenial environment
   according to a design plan successfully aimed at truth: that is, he
   concludes that Christian belief, taken in this basic way, has warrant.
   He thus concludes that these beliefs are properly basic with respect to
   warrant, drawing this conclusion from beliefs that themselves have
   warrant; but forming a belief in that way itself meets the conditions
   for warrant; hence, his view that theistic belief is properly basic
   with respect to warrant is itself warranted.

   It doesn't follow, of course, that the voodoo epistemologist is also
   warranted in claiming that voodoo belief is properly basic with respect
   to warrant. For suppose voodoo belief is in fact false, and suppose
   further that it arose originally in some kind of mistake or confusion,
   or out of a fearful reaction to natural phenomena of one sort or
   another, or in the mind of some group hoping to gain or perpetuate
   personal political power. If so, then those original voodoo beliefs did
   not possess warrant. Suppose still further that these voodoo beliefs
   were passed on to subsequent generations by way of testimony and
   teaching. Now if a testifier testifies to some belief p that has no
   warrant for her, then p will also have no warrant for anyone believing
   it on just the basis of her testimony. If p has no warrant for the
   testifier, then it has none for the testifiee either--even if the
   latter's faculties are working perfectly properly. [437] I am taught a
   lot of garbage by my parents (out of profound ignorance, they teach me
   that the stars are really pinholes in a giant canvass stretched over
   the earth each night in order to give humankind a good night's sleep,
   or that Frisians are politically inferior and should not be allowed to
   vote); then, even if my own cognitive faculties are functioning
   properly in the conditions propitious for warrant, my beliefs acquired
   by way of this testimony lack warrant.

   So consider the voodoo epistemologist, and suppose he accepts those
   voodoo views on the basis of testimony and (analogous to the Reformed
   epistemologist) reasons from their truth together with other premises
   to their being properly basic with respect to warrant. Then his
   conclusion that voodoo beliefs are warrant-basic will not itself be
   warranted, because it is accepted on the basis of an argument at least
   one premise of which has no warrant for him. That is because inference
   exhibits the same sort of warrant-dependent structure as testimony. I
   believe p and q; these together yield (deductively, or in some other
   way) r; r will have warrant for me if p and q do (and perhaps we must
   add if p and q, the conjunction of p and q does); but if either p or q
   lacks warrant for me, the same will go for r. (Clearly I can't come to
   know some proposition by inferring it from propositions some of which I
   don't know. [438] ) The voodoo philosophers are mistaken in holding
   their voodoo views; furthermore, their claim that voodoo views are
   properly basic with respect to warrant is both false and not itself
   warranted.

   It could certainly happen, therefore, that the views of the Reformed
   epistemologist are legitimate in the sense of being warranted, and
   those of the voodoo epistemologist, who arrives at his views in
   structurally the same way as the Reformed epistemologist, are not. That
   could be if, for example, the central claims of the Christian faith are
   true and voodoo belief is false. It is therefore not the case that if
   the claim that belief in God and in the great things of the gospel is
   properly basic with respect to warrant is itself warranted, then by the
   same token the claim that voodoo belief is properly basic with respect
   to warrant is itself warranted. Martin's argument, construed as we are
   currently construing it, therefore fails; its first premise is false.

   By way of summary: Martin's complaint, apparently, is that if the
   Reformed epistemologist can legitimately claim that Christian belief is
   properly basic with respect to rationality, then the philosophers of a
   community with clearly crazy beliefs could, with equal legitimacy,
   claim that those crazy beliefs are properly basic with respect to
   rationality; but clearly they couldn't claim this; so the Reformed
   epistemologist can't legitimately make his claim. This complaint is
   multiply ambiguous, inheriting the multiple ambiguity of legitimately'
   and rationality'. Most of the disambiguations, however, show no promise
   at all. The last disambiguation, where both legitimately' and
   rationality' are both understood as referring to warrant, is at least
   interesting; the argument so construed, however, suffers from the
   annoying defect of having a false premise. Son of Great Pumpkin does no
   better than Great Pumpkin. [439]

   Now in the spirit of Son of Great Pumpkin, we might raise a slightly
   more general question here. I propose the extended A/C model as a way
   in which Christian belief can have warrant in the basic way and argue
   three things: (a) this model is possible, both logically and
   epistemically; (b) given the truth of Christian belief, there are no
   philosophical objections to this model's also being not merely possible
   but true; and (c) if Christian belief is indeed true, then very
   probably it does have warrant, and has it in some way similar to the
   extended A/C model. Now couldn't this be argued with equal cogency with
   respect to any set of beliefs, no matter how weird? And wouldn't that
   at any rate reduce the interest of my claim?

   Certainly not. Many propositions are not such that, if they are true,
   then very likely they have warrant: the proposition No beliefs have
   warrant comes to mind. But, you say, isn't this just a bit of logical
   legerdemain; are there any systems of beliefs seriously analogous to
   Christian belief for which these claims cannot be made? For any such
   set of beliefs, couldn't we find a model under which the beliefs in
   question have warrant, and such that, given the truth of those beliefs,
   there are no philosophical objections to the truth of the model? Well,
   probably something like that is true for the other theistic religions:
   Judaism, Islam, some forms of Hinduism, some forms of Buddhism, some
   forms of American Indian religion. Perhaps these religions are like
   Christianity in that they are subject to no de jure objections that are
   independent of de facto objections. Still, that isn't true for just any
   such set of beliefs. It isn't true, for example, for voodooism, or the
   belief that the earth is flat, or Humean skepticism, or philosophical
   naturalism.

   For consider the set of beliefs involved in Hume's skepticism with
   respect to his origins and the origins of his cognitive faculties
   (above, p. 218). Hume--at any rate, as we understood him in chapter
   7--holds that we ought to be skeptical of the reliability of our
   belief-forming processes. He thinks he can see that what nature
   inevitably leads us to believe is unlikely, or arbitrary, or at best
   extremely dubious; hence the right cognitive attitude with respect to
   the beliefs induced in us by nature is that attitude of ironic
   detachment. We recognize that we can't help holding these beliefs; we
   also recognize that they are not to be relied upon. But if we are
   skeptical of the reliability of our cognitive processes, then we also
   have reason to be skeptical of any particular deliverances of those
   processes, including the beliefs that lead us to be skeptical of
   them--hence the reflexive, self-referential character of the irony.
   Now: can we find a possible model in which these beliefs--including the
   beliefs that what nature leads us to believe is arbitrary, or not to be
   relied upon--are warranted? More poignantly, can we find a model such
   that if this belief is true, then very likely it is warranted? Clearly
   not.

   Perhaps someone will think that Hume's skepticism about his origins and
   the origins of his cognitive faculties is not much like Christian
   belief; no doubt this is true. So consider instead philosophical
   naturalism: the view that there is no such person as God or anyone (or
   anything) at all like him. (Contemporary naturalists ordinarily add
   that the only things there are, are the entities hypothesized or
   acknowledged by contemporary science.) Such naturalists also add that
   we and our cognitive faculties have arisen by way of the processes
   pointed to in contemporary evolutionary theory--principally random
   genetic mutation and natural selection. This is, of course, a great
   deal more like Christian belief. For many, perhaps particularly many
   academics, it plays some of the same roles as those played by religious
   belief: it tells us where we come from, where we are going, and what
   the fundamental explanations are for the main features of our own
   nature. But if I am right in the argument I gave in chapter 12 of WPF
   (and corrected in this volume, pp. 227ff.), this set of beliefs is not
   such that if it is true, then very likely it has warrant. For what the
   argument shows is that if these beliefs are true, then it is not likely
   that our belief-producing processes and mechanisms are, in fact,
   reliable, in which case the beliefs that they produce, including the
   belief that naturalism is true, do not have warrant. So it is false
   that what I argue for Christian belief is true for just any set of
   beliefs; indeed, it isn't true for what (in the Western academic world,
   at any rate) is perhaps the main alternative to Christian belief.

   [432] I don't hold it on the evidential basis of such an argument as

   such an argument, and perhaps in certain special circumstances (a

     __________________________________________________________________

  V. Circularity?

   Still, isn't there something circular in my argument? According to Paul
   Noble, Jonathan Edwards's "theistic defense of passional reason raises
   the spectre of epistemic circularity: the theistic metaphysics grounds
   one's belief in the legitimacy of spiritual perception', and yet
   Edwards also appeals to such perceptions as vindicating the truth of
   theism." [440] Wouldn't something like the same be true of my model?
   Isn't it true that my own proposal has warrant for me (or anyone who
   accepts it) only if theistic belief is in fact true and, indeed,
   warranted? I propose the extended A/C model as a model for the way in
   which Christian and theistic belief can have warrant, but won't it be
   the case that I am warranted in proposing this model only if, in fact,
   the model or something like it is correct, and Christian belief does
   have warrant? No. What I claim for the model is only that it is (1)
   possible, (2) subject to no philosophical objections that do not assume
   that Christian belief is false, and (3) such that if Christian belief
   is true, the model is at least close to the truth. But obviously it is
   not the case that my assertion of or belief in the truth of (1), (2),
   or (3) has warrant only if the model is true or Christian belief is
   warranted.

   Now suppose I proposed the model as indeed the truth (or close to the
   truth) about the way Christian belief has warrant: then, would my
   proposal be in some way circular? Well, why should we think so? Perhaps
   the idea is something like this: because central Christian beliefs are
   included in or entailed by the model, I am warranted in thinking the
   model true only if I am warranted in accepting Christian belief; those
   central Christian beliefs must already have warrant, for me, if my
   belief that the model is true is to have warrant. But then am I not
   involved in some kind of objectionable circle?

   I can't see how. It is indeed true that I will have to be warranted in
   accepting Christian belief if I am to be warranted in accepting the
   extended A/C model as true; that is because the former is included in
   the latter. It is not the case, however, that if Christian belief has
   warrant for me, then the model must also have warrant for me. That
   would be true if I argued for Christian belief by way of an argument
   one premise of which was the extended A/C model. More exactly, that
   would be true if such an argument were the only source of warrant, for
   me, of Christian belief. For then any warrant enjoyed by my Christian
   belief would accrue to it by way of warrant transfer from the premises
   of that argument; but one premise of that argument would be a
   conjunction, one conjunct of which was itself part of Christian belief.
   There would therefore be a vicious circle in the
   receives-its-warrant-from relation.

   So if the source of the warrant of my Christian belief were this
   argument, then indeed the project would suffer from vicious
   circularity. But it isn't, and it doesn't. The source of warrant for
   Christian belief, according to the model, is not argument of any sort;
   in particular, its warrant does not arise from some argument about how
   Christian belief can have warrant. To show that there is circularity
   here, the objector would have to show that any warrant enjoyed by
   Christian belief must, somehow, have come from argument of some sort;
   and this, as we have seen, can't be done. This objection, then, is no
   more successful than the others.

   No doubt there are other objections, perhaps even other sensible
   objections. I don't know of any, however, and am therefore obliged to
   refrain from responding to them until I hear about them. In the
   meantime, I shall provisionally take it that there aren't any such
   objections. Now the objections considered in this chapter are
   objections to the claim that Christian belief can have warrant in the
   basic way. They are therefore philosophical objections to a
   philosophical claim. Now of course it is possible that Christian belief
   could have warrant in this way, even if in fact it has little or no
   warrant. For perhaps there is a source of warrant, for Christian
   belief, but the warrant in question is defeated. No doubt the belief
   that the earth is flat once had warrant for many. But then people
   encountered defeaters for this belief: for example, there is the
   peculiar way in which ships disappear over the horizon, along with the
   other arguments that led people to give up this belief. (Even if you
   are skeptical with respect to those arguments, you may be swayed by
   pictures of the earth taken from a satellite and by eyewitness reports
   as to what the earth looks like from three hundred miles away.) Might
   not the same be true for Christian belief? Aren't there serious
   defeaters for it--defeaters that are prominent now, even if they
   weren't available 250 years ago? That is the topic of the next (and
   last) section of this book.

Defeaters and Defeat

   The philosophical case against theism is rather easily dealt with.
   There is no philosophical case against theism.

   G. K. Chesterton

   I've argued that Christian belief--the full panoply of Christian
   belief, including trinity, incarnation, atonement, resurrection--can,
   if true, have warrant, can indeed have sufficient warrant for
   knowledge, and can have that warrant in the basic way. There are no
   cogent philosophical objections to the notion that these beliefs can
   have warrant in this way. It is easily possible to work out an
   account--for example, the extended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model--of how
   it is that beliefs of these sorts do indeed have warrant. This way does
   not involve arguments from other beliefs. Rather, the fundamental idea
   is that God provides us human beings with faculties or belief-producing
   processes that yield these beliefs and are successfully aimed at the
   truth; when they work the way they were designed to in the sort of
   environment for which they were designed, the result is warranted
   belief. Indeed, if these beliefs are true and the degree of their
   warrant sufficiently high, they constitute knowledge.

   Of course this hardly settles the issue as to whether Christian belief
   (even if true) has or can have warrant in the circumstances in which
   most of us actually find ourselves. Someone might put it like this:
   "Well, perhaps these beliefs can have warrant, and perhaps (if they are
   true) even warrant sufficient for knowledge: there are circumstances in
   which this can happen. Most of us, however--for example, most of those
   who read this book--are not in those circumstances. What you have
   really argued so far is only that theistic and Christian belief (taken
   in the basic way) can have warrant, absent defeaters. But defeaters are
   not absent." The claim is that there are serious defeaters for
   Christian belief: propositions we know or believe that make Christian
   belief--at any rate, Christian belief held in the basic way and with
   anything like sufficient firmness to constitute knowledge--irrational
   and hence unwarranted. Philip Quinn, for example, believes that for
   "intellectually sophisticated adults in our culture" there are
   important defeaters for belief in God--at least if, as in the extended
   A/C model, held in the basic way. As a result, belief in God held in
   the basic way, as in the model, is for the most part irrational: "I
   conclude that many, perhaps most, intellectually sophisticated adults
   in our culture are seldom if ever in conditions which are right for
   [theistic beliefs] to be properly basic for them." [441] The defeaters
   that particularly impress Quinn are, first, natural evil (evil that is
   not due to human free will) and, second, projective theories of
   theistic belief, such as those of Freud, Marx, and Durkheim.

   In this and the next chapters, I'll deal with four proposed defeaters
   for Christian belief. In this chapter, after a brief investigation of
   the nature of defeaters, I'll argue that the projective theories Quinn
   mentions do not in fact constitute a defeater for Christian belief. In
   chapter 12, I'll argue that contemporary historical biblical criticism
   (higher criticism') doesn't serve as a defeater for Christian belief,
   even when its alleged results do not support Christian belief and,
   indeed, even when they go counter to it. In chapter 13 I'll examine the
   claim that the facts of religious pluralism constitute a defeater for
   Christian belief; I'll also look into the idea that the development of
   postmodern thought is, in some way, a defeater for such belief. I'll
   argue that neither offers such a defeater. Finally, in chapter 14 I'll
   consider what has often been seen as the most formidable challenge of
   all to Christian belief: the facts of suffering and evil. This
   challenge too, I'll argue, does not as such constitute a defeater for
   Christian belief.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. The Nature of Defeaters

   Now what we need initially is some account of what a defeater, for a
   belief, is. The fact is there is a great deal to be said about
   defeaters. [442] First, however, we need some examples. As in the last
   chapter I see (at a hundred yards) what I take to be a sheep in a field
   and form the belief that there is a sheep in the field; I know that you
   are the owner of the field; the next day you tell me that there are no
   sheep in that field, although you own a dog who looks like a sheep at a
   hundred yards and who frequents the field. Then (in the absence of
   special circumstances) I have a defeater for the belief that there was
   a sheep in that field and will, if rational, no longer hold that
   belief. This is a rebutting defeater--what you learn (that there are no
   sheep in that field) is inconsistent with the defeated belief. But
   there are also undercutting defeaters. Here is an example due to John
   Pollock. You enter a factory and see an assembly line on which there
   are a number of widgets, all of which look red. You form the belief
   that indeed they are red. Then along comes the shop superintendent, who
   informs you that the widgets are being irradiated by red and infrared
   light, a process that makes it possible to detect otherwise
   undetectable hairline cracks. You then have a defeater for your belief
   that the widget you are looking at is red. In this case, what you learn
   is not something incompatible with the defeated belief (you aren't told
   that this widget isn't red); what you learn, rather, is something that
   undercuts your grounds or reasons for thinking it red. (You realize
   that it would look red even if it weren't.) Defeaters are reasons for
   giving up a belief b you hold; if they are rebutting defeaters, they
   are also reasons for accepting a belief incompatible with b. Acquiring
   a defeater for a belief puts you in a position in which you can't
   rationally continue to hold the belief.

   Defeaters of this kind are rationality defeaters; given belief in the
   defeating proposition, you can retain belief in the defeated
   proposition only at the cost of irrationality. There are also warrant
   defeaters that are not rationality defeaters. Thus in Carl Ginet's fake
   barn example, as you are driving through southern Wisconsin, you seem
   to see many fine barns. Fixing on a particular one, you say to
   yourself, "That is a splendid barn!" What you don't know, however, is
   that the local Wisconsinites have erected many clever barn facades
   (from the road indistinguishable from real barns) to make themselves
   look more prosperous. What you are actually looking at, however, is a
   real barn, not a barn facade. Still, you don't know that it is a barn;
   it is only by sheer serendipitous good fortune that the belief you form
   is true. (You might just as well have been looking at a barn
   facade--indeed, you might better have been looking at a barn facade,
   because the ratio of barn facades to barns in this area is 3:1.) To put
   the matter in the terminology of chapter 5 (above, pp. 158ff.), you are
   in an unfavorable cognitive minienvironment, and it is those barn
   facades that make the minienvironment unfavorable. The presence of the
   fake barns is a warrant defeater for you: given the presence of the
   fake barns there, you don't know that the thing you are looking at is,
   indeed, a barn--even though it is and you believe that it is. The
   existence of the fake barns is not a rationality defeater, however, for
   there is nothing irrational, in your circumstances, in believing that
   what you see is a barn.

   Defeaters depend on and are relative to the rest of your noetic
   structure, the rest of what you know and believe. Whether a belief A is
   a defeater for a belief B doesn't depend merely on my current
   experience; it also depends on what other beliefs I have, how firmly I
   hold them, and the like. Consider, for example, the above case, where
   your saying that there are no sheep in the field is a defeater for my
   belief that I see a sheep there; this depends on my assuming you to be
   trustworthy, at least on this occasion and on this topic. By contrast,
   if I know you are a notorious practical joker especially given to
   misleading people about sheep, what you say will not constitute a
   defeater; neither will it if I am inspecting the sheep through powerful
   binoculars and clearly see that it is a sheep, or if there is someone I
   trust standing right in front of the sheep, who tells me by cell phone
   that it is indeed a sheep.

   As a result of this relativity to noetic structure, it can happen that
   you and I both learn a given proposition p, that it constitutes a
   defeater for another belief q for me, but does not do so for you. For
   example, you and I both believe that the University of Aberdeen was
   founded in 1495; you but not I know that the current guidebook to
   Aberdeen contains an egregious error on this very matter. We both win a
   copy of the guidebook in the Scottish national lottery; we both read
   it; sadly enough, it contains the wholly mistaken affirmation that the
   university was founded in 1595. Given my noetic structure (which
   includes the belief that guidebooks are ordinarily to be trusted on
   matters like this), I thereby acquire a defeater for my belief that the
   university was founded in 1495; you, however, knowing about this
   improbable error, do not. The difference, of course, is with respect to
   the rest of what we know or believe: given the rest of what I believe,
   I now have a reason to reject the belief that the university was
   founded in 1495; the same does not hold for you. You already know that
   the current guidebook contains an error on the matter of the date of
   the university's foundation; this neutralizes in advance (as we might
   put it) the defeating potential of the newly acquired bit of knowledge,
   that is, that the current guidebook to Aberdeen says the university was
   founded in 1595. So this new bit of knowledge is a defeater for that
   belief with respect to my noetic structure but not with respect to
   yours.

   A defeater for a belief b, then, is another belief d such that, given
   my noetic structure, I cannot rationally hold b, given that I believe
   d. In the typical case of defeat, I will first believe b and then later
   come to believe the defeater d: I believe that there is a sheep in the
   pasture before me; then you come along with that information about the
   sheep dog. I believe that the widget I'm looking at is red; then the
   shop superintendent tells me about the irradiation by red light.
   Sometimes, however, I already believe the defeater (or, strictly
   speaking, part of the defeater), but do not initially realize its
   bearing on the defeatee. I believe that you were at the basketball game
   last night at 9:30; I also believe that you are never at a game without
   your husband, that Sam, whom I trust, reported seeing either Tom or
   your husband at a bar at that time, and that George, whom I also trust,
   reports that Tom was not at the bar then. This is sufficiently
   complicated that I might not initially see the connection between these
   propositions and my belief that you were at the game then. As long as I
   haven't noticed the connection, I don't have a defeater, although I do
   have what we might call a potential defeater. Once I see the
   connection, then I have a defeater: the defeater is the conjunction of
   those propositions, together with the proposition that if that
   conjunction is true, then you weren't at the game at 9:30.

   A famous similar kind of case: Frege once believed that

   (F) For every condition or property P, there exists the set of just
   those things that have P.

   Bertrand Russell wrote him a letter, pointing out that (F) has very
   serious problems. If it is true, then there exists the set of
   non-self-membered sets (because there is the property or condition of
   being non-self-membered). This set, however, inconsiderately fails to
   exist. That is because if it did exist, it would exemplify itself if
   and only if it did not exemplify itself; that is, it would both
   exemplify itself and fail to exemplify itself, which is wholly
   unacceptable behavior for a set. Before he realized this problem with
   (F), Frege did not have a defeater for it. Once he understood Russell's
   letter, however, he did; and the defeater was just the fact that (F),
   together with the truth that there is such a condition as being
   non-self-membered, entails a contradiction.

   We might initially try explaining the notion of a defeater as follows:

   (D) D is a defeater of B for S at t if and only if (1) S's noetic
   structure N (i.e., S's beliefs and experiences and salient relations
   among them) at t includes B, and S comes to believe D at t, and (2) any
   person (a) whose cognitive faculties are functioning properly in the
   relevant respects, (b) whose noetic structure is N and includes B, and
   (c) who comes at t to believe D but nothing else independent of or
   stronger than D would withhold B (or believe it less strongly [443] ).

   The idea, roughly speaking, is that belief D is a defeater of B for you
   if proper function requires giving up belief B when you acquire D. This
   fits the above examples of defeaters rather well; still, it is
   nonetheless not quite what we want. To see the problem, imagine a canny
   Freudian replying as follows:

   Consider the optimistic overrider'. You are suffering from what you
   know to be a really serious disease; nonetheless, you believe that you
   will recover within six months. You then learn some statistics that
   accurately fit your case--statistics according to which the probability
   that you will recover is very low. Does your belief in these statistics
   give you a defeater for the belief that you will recover? One would
   think so; but it need not on (D). For perhaps there is a kind of
   mechanism that operates in these cases to maintain optimism about your
   chances of recovery, just because such optimism enhances the chances of
   recovery. That is, what proper function requires in a case like this is
   believing that you will recover, despite your knowledge of the
   statistics. What proper function requires in this case, then, is (a)
   the belief that those statistics are in fact accurate, but also (b) the
   belief that you will nevertheless recover. So the definition is
   incorrect. It fails to take account of the fact that not all cognitive
   processes are aimed at the production of true belief. Furthermore, this
   is directly relevant to the case of belief in God. For, as Freud
   pointed out, belief in God arises from wish-fulfillment, not from
   belief-producing processes or faculties aimed at the truth. The
   function of the processes that produce theistic belief is psychological
   health, enabling us to carry on in this otherwise grim and threatening
   world. The function of these processes is not to provide us with true
   beliefs. So suppose you are a believer in God, and someone provides you
   with a powerful argument against the existence of God--some version of
   the problem of evil, for example. Suppose, indeed, someone shows you
   that the existence of God is logically incompatible with the existence
   of evil. What does proper function require in that case? Well,
   conceivably it requires that you continue to believe in God. Even if it
   did, however, you would have a defeater. So the definition is faulty.

   Agreed, the definition is indeed faulty. [444] Here we need a
   distinction. Say that (D) above defines the notion of a defeater
   simpliciter. We also need the notion of a purely epistemic defeater:

   (D*) D is a purely epistemic defeater of B for S at t if and only if
   (1) S's noetic structure N at t includes B and S comes to believe D at
   t, and (2) any person S* (a) whose cognitive faculties are functioning
   properly in the relevant respects, (b) who is such that the bit of the
   design plan governing the sustaining of B in her noetic structure is
   successfully aimed at truth (i.e., at the maximization of true belief
   and minimization of false belief) and nothing more, (c) whose noetic
   structure is N and includes B, and (d) who comes to believe D but
   nothing else independent of or stronger than D, would withhold B (or
   believe it less strongly).

   A couple of comments. First, it is of course the addition of clause (b)
   that distinguishes (D*) from (D); very roughly speaking, the idea is
   that a purely epistemic defeater for B is a belief D that would be a
   defeater simpliciter for B if the only processes governing the
   sustaining of B were processes aimed at truth (and not, for example, at
   survival, or psychological comfort). The point is then that D could be
   a purely epistemic defeater of B even if proper function requires the
   maintenance of B, in S's noetic structure, despite the formation of D;
   that can occur if the processes maintaining B are not aimed at truth.
   Second, with respect to clause (a), it is not required, of course, that
   all of S*'s faculties are functioning properly in every respect. For
   example, the fact that S*'s memory for names is defective need not be
   relevant. Further, it isn't required that D itself arise rationally or
   by way of proper function; as I'll argue below, it is possible for a
   belief that is irrationally acquired to be a defeater, even for a
   belief that is rationally acquired. Perhaps (D*) is a bit unwieldy;
   still, in practice there shouldn't be any difficulty in applying it to
   the cases of interest. The above canny Freudian, therefore, will
   presumably hold that the theist does have a purely epistemic defeater
   in the facts of evil (once she reflects on the facts of evil and sees
   how they are related to the existence of a perfectly good God), even if
   she does not have a defeater simpliciter.

   And she may go on to make one final claim: once you see that belief in
   God is not sustained by truth-aimed processes (arising, instead, from
   wishful thinking), then you will also have a defeater simpliciter for
   theistic belief. You will have this defeater in two different ways.
   First, once you see that the cognitive processes responsible for a
   given belief you hold are not aimed at the truth, and also clearly see
   the facts of evil, then, she claims, you will be in a situation where
   the rational response is to give up belief in God. For, she says, you
   see that you really have evidence against the existence of God, while
   on the other side your belief in God is without evidence and without
   warrant. She adds that even if we ignore evil altogether, the theist
   who sees that her theistic belief issues from wish-fulfillment (or any
   other cognitive process that is not aimed at the truth) has a defeater
   for that belief. Merely seeing that the sources of a given belief are
   not aimed at truth (but at some other desideratum such as survival,
   psychological welfare, or the ability to carry on in this hostile and
   indifferent world) is sufficient (in the absence of other evidence),
   she says, to give you a defeater simpliciter for that belief. The
   rational response, once you see the source of such a belief, is to give
   up the belief.

   What further conditions (if any) must a defeater belief meet? In
   particular, must such a belief itself be warranted or rationally
   formed? Suppose I hold a belief B, but then come to accept a belief D
   that goes against B in some way, where this belief D I accept has no
   warrant. Can it still be a defeater for B? I should think so. I've
   believed for years that you were born in Yankton, South Dakota; this
   belief has a good deal of warrant for me. (I was told this by your
   uncle, whom I know to be a generally reliable person.) One day,
   however, you tell me in all seriousness that you were born not in
   Yankton, but in New Haven (and you add some story as to why your uncle
   thinks you were born in Yankton). Then (under normal circumstances) I
   have a rationality defeater for my belief that you were born in
   Yankton. If there are no special circumstances (if I have no reason to
   think you were joking, or trying to deceive me, or are misinformed
   about where you were born, or the like), the rational response would be
   to give up the belief that you were born in Yankton. Suppose, however,
   the fact is you yourself were misinformed by your parents; you actually
   were born in Yankton, but for reasons having to do with academic
   prestige your parents tell you that you were born in New Haven. Then
   your belief that you were born in New Haven has little or no warrant.
   That is because (as I argued in Warrant and Proper Function, pp. 83ff.)
   a belief acquired by way of testimony has warrant for the testifiee
   only if it has warrant for the testifier; because your parents don't
   even hold this belief, it is not among their warranted beliefs. Hence
   my newly acquired belief that you were born in New Haven also lacks
   warrant. Nevertheless, this belief still gives me a defeater for my old
   belief that you were born in Yankton. So it is quite possible for a
   belief A to serve as a defeater for another belief B even if A has
   little or no warrant, and even when B has more warrant than A.

   But what if the potential defeating belief is acquired irrationally?
   Can it still be a defeater? Suppose I've always thought you a genial
   sort who is rather well disposed to me. Unhappily, I start sinking into
   a paranoid condition; because of cognitive malfunction, it comes to
   seem to me that you are, in fact, trying to harm me by destroying my
   academic reputation. Because of the cognitive malfunction, this just
   seems wholly obvious to me; it has a great deal of what I have been
   calling doxastic evidence'. Can my belief D that you are trying to
   destroy my reputation serve as a defeater for my belief B that you are
   favorably disposed toward me?

   Here we must recall the distinction between internal and external
   rationality. Internal rationality is a matter of proper function
   downstream from experience' (including doxastic experience: see above,
   pp. 110ff.). Given my experience, I am internally rational just if I
   form the right beliefs in response to that experience. What internal
   rationality requires, therefore, is the appropriate doxastic response
   to experience, including doxastic experience. For present purposes, we
   may think of internal rationality as also including epistemic
   justification, being within one's epistemic rights, having flouted no
   epistemic duties or obligations. External rationality, by contrast, is
   a matter of the proper function of the sources of experience,
   including, in particular, the sources of doxastic experience. External
   irrationality can arise in several ways. For example, it can happen by
   way of impedance. I write a book on topic X; because of pride and
   egoism, I think it easily the best book on X, even though your book on
   X is better, and even though I would have recognized that fact had it
   not been for the way in which my pride has impeded the proper function
   of the relevant rational faculties. This is a case of external
   irrationality: the problem is that, because of my pride and arrogance,
   my book just seems to me much better than yours; the proposition that
   it is better has, for me, a great deal of doxastic evidence. In a case
   like this, therefore, my irrationally formed belief can give me a
   defeater, I think, for my previous and rationally formed belief that
   your book is the best book on X.

   Return now to the case of paranoia: I think we see a similar situation.
   My belief that you are out to get me is externally irrational; it
   arises from sources of doxastic experience that are not functioning
   properly. By virtue of their malfunction, however, my experience is
   such that I am powerfully impelled to believe D, that you are trying to
   ruin me. This now seems to me much more obvious than that you are
   favorably disposed toward me: the doxastic evidence for D is much
   stronger than that for B. What internal rationality calls for, under
   those circumstances, therefore, is my giving up B; I have a defeater
   for it in D, even though D is arrived at irrationally. I can therefore
   have a defeater D for a belief B even where B is rationally held and D
   is irrationally acquired.

   There is still another way in which I can acquire a defeater by way of
   irrationality. Suppose I believe B, but by virtue of cognitive
   malfunction do not believe it nearly as strongly as rationality
   requires; it isn't nearly as resistant to the challenge of other
   beliefs as it should be. For example, due to cognitive malfunction (a
   brain lesion, perhaps) I am arithmetically challenged: like everyone
   else, I believe that 2 + 1 = 3, but no more strongly than I believe,
   for example, that my wife's social security number is n. You, a
   mathematics professor whom I trust, tell me that as a matter of fact it
   is false that 2 + 1 = 3. I take your word for it, just as I might
   believe the government expert who informs me that my wife's social
   security number really isn't n (there was some kind of mix-up when she
   lost her card and applied for a new one). This then gives me a defeater
   for my belief that 2 + 1 = 3. I have this defeater for this belief,
   however, only because of failure of cognitive proper function, only
   because the doxastic evidence for me for 2 + 1 = 3 isn't nearly as
   strong as proper function requires.

   partial defeat, at least if we stipulate that coming to withhold B is a
   special case of coming to believe B less strongly. For the sake of

  II. Defeaters for Christian or Theistic Belief

   What we've seen so far is that you have a defeater for one of your
   beliefs B just if you acquire another belief D such that, given that
   you hold that belief, the rational response is to reject B (or hold it
   less firmly). What we want to know, however, is (for example) whether
   the suffering and evil the world displays or the facts of pluralism
   provide a defeater for Christian belief. Of course they might for some
   people, but not for others; there is that relativity to noetic
   structures. So what are we really asking when we ask whether these
   things constitute defeaters? There are various directions we could go
   here; suppose we follow Philip Quinn (above, p. 358) in thinking about
   the noetic structures of "intellectually sophisticated adults in our
   culture." We are asking whether these proposed defeaters would in fact
   constitute defeaters for Quinn's sophisticated believers. Of course
   they will constitute defeaters, for a given person S, only if S
   believes them. And not just any proposition which is such that, if I
   believed it, I would have a defeater for Christian or theistic belief
   will do the trick. As we have seen, an irrationally acquired belief can
   serve as a defeater; but clearly you don't give me a defeater in the
   relevant sense for Christian belief by causing me to come to believe
   something in an irrational way--by hypnosis say, or by injecting
   mind-altering drugs. You give me a defeater in the relevant sense only
   if you propose to me a belief which is such that a rational
   sophisticated believer (rational both internally and externally) would
   accept it upon being presented with it. Hence you don't necessarily
   provide a defeater for theistic belief just by asserting, even loudly
   or slowly, that belief in God is false, or stupid, or that God is dead,
   or given electricity and the wireless (below, p. 403), we now know
   better. Although these propositions, if I accepted them, might provide
   me with defeaters for Christian belief, they are not, just by
   themselves, such that rationality would require a sophisticated
   believer to accept them. Something further is required.

   What? One way that could be relevant would be to give an argument for
   the falsehood of the relevant proposition from premises a sophisticated
   believer accepts. Of course there are subtleties here. It might be that
   the rational thing to do, once I see the inconsistency between those
   premises and B, is to hang on to B and give up instead (the conjunction
   of) those premises. I believe p[1], . . . p[n]; you show me that p[1],
   . . . p[n] entail that there aren't any persisting selves; once I see
   this, perhaps the rational thing to do is to give up (one or more of)
   the p[i] rather than the belief that there are persisting selves. So
   merely giving an argument with premises a sophisticate accepts is not
   sufficient for providing a defeater; the premises must also be such
   that once I see the conflict, rationality requires that I give up the
   prospective defeatee rather than the premises. Still, argument is one
   way to give me a defeater.

   Is there any other way? Yes; you can put me in a position where I have
   experiences such that, given those experiences (and given my noetic
   structure), the rational thing to do is to give up the purported
   defeatee. I claim that there are no prickly pear cacti in the upper
   peninsula of Michigan; you take me into the woods up there and show me
   a particularly luxuriant specimen; rationality requires that I drop my
   now discredited belief. So another way to provide a defeater for
   Christian or theistic belief would be to point to or provide a kind of
   experience such that a sophisticate who underwent that experience would
   be rationally required to give up the belief in question.

  III. Projective Theories a Defeater for Christian Belief?

   Now we can turn to the projective theories of religious--in particular,
   theistic--belief Quinn mentions. These theories propose to explain
   theistic belief and other religious belief in terms of our projecting
   into the heavens something like an idealized father. Freud proposes
   such a theory, as do Marx, Durkheim, and others; according to Quinn,
   such projective theories, along with natural evil, constitute defeaters
   for theistic and hence Christian belief. I'll deal with evil in the
   last chapter; but what about Freud and Marx? Aren't their theories, as
   Quinn says, reasons for responsible and informed contemporary Christian
   believers to give up belief in God, or at any rate accept it less
   firmly?

   I don't think so; allow me to explain. The fact is I've already given
   some of my reasons in chapter 6, pp. 192ff. As I argued there, the
   heart and soul of the F&M (Freud-and-Marx) complaint is that theistic
   belief lacks warrant: it is not produced by cognitive faculties
   functioning properly according to a design plan successfully aimed at
   truth. According to Marx, such belief arises from a sort of cognitive
   disorder produced by a disordered society; according to Freud, it is
   produced by cognitive processes that are aimed at psychological comfort
   or survival rather than truth. Now if I believed these things, then
   perhaps I would have a reason to give up theistic belief. [445] But why
   should I believe them? Is there a rationally compelling argument for
   one or another of them? Freud and Marx certainly give no reasons for
   thinking these theories true; they simply announce them. More
   important, as I argued in chapter 6, their attack on the warrant of
   theistic belief really presupposes that theistic belief is false; it
   presupposes atheism. If I am aware of that, however, how can their
   attack constitute a defeater, for me, of theistic belief? If theistic
   belief is false, then perhaps the F&M thesis would be a good way to
   think of it; but, of course, I do not believe that theistic belief is
   false. Freud and Marx's declarations, therefore, do not give me a
   defeater for theistic belief; what they announce might be a defeater,
   if I came to believe it, but they provide no reason at all for my
   coming to believe it. A person can easily be apprised of Freud's views,
   here, and continue to accept theistic belief in complete rationality.

   Projective theories like Freud's could be a defeater for theistic
   belief (and hence for Christianity) for some people. Suppose I believe
   very firmly that if theism is true, there couldn't be any coherent
   projective theories of religious or theistic belief; suppose I also
   accept theism, though not particularly firmly. Now suppose I then come
   to believe that

   (F) Freud's theory (or some other projective theory) is indeed
   coherent.

   Then (F) will be a defeater--perhaps a partial defeater--for my
   theistic belief; as long as I accept it and continue to accept the rest
   of my noetic structure (including the idea that theism is true only if
   there are no coherent projective theories of theistic belief), I can't
   rationally also accept theism. Of course that idea is false; but a
   false belief can nonetheless serve as a defeater. Or suppose I don't
   realize either that Freud's theory really presupposes atheism, or that
   he gives no argument either for atheism or for his theory. Then too I
   might have a defeater, at least a partial defeater, for my theistic
   belief. So I could acquire a defeater in learning about these theories.
   However, the point is that rationality does not require that I acquire
   such a defeater under those conditions. The point is that a rational
   person could perfectly well be a theist, learn about and be well
   acquainted with Freud's (and others') projective theories, and
   rationally remain a theist--in particular, if she sees that Freud's
   views are unargued and in any event really presuppose atheism.
   Alternatively, a theist for whom Freud's views did constitute a
   defeater could acquire a defeater for that defeater (a
   defeater-defeater) by coming to be apprised of these or other
   epistemological truths. Here is a place, then, where the philosopher
   can be of service to the Christian community by pointing out truths
   which, when added to a Christian noetic structure, can preserve
   Christian or theistic belief from defeat or provide a defeater-defeater
   for a defeater of such belief.

   Now Quinn argues that projective theories of theistic belief are
   defeaters for such belief if they successfully explain theistic belief:

   I believe it is useful to think of projection theories of religious
   belief as constituting a research program in the human sciences. . . .
   The unifying idea of the research program is that there is in us a
   mechanism of belief formation and maintenance that involves projecting
   attributes of individual humans or their societies outwards and
   postulating entities in which the projected attributes are
   instantiated. . . . The existence of the postulated entities is
   supposed to play no role in explaining the formation or persistence of
   belief in the postulates. If such hypotheses can explain religious
   beliefs in a wide variety of circumstances, leaving unexplained no more
   anomalies than other good theories, then appeal to some principle of
   economy such as Ockham's razor can be made to justify the conclusion
   that the entities whose existence is postulated as a result of the
   operation of the projection mechanism do not exist because they are
   explanatorily idle. [446]

   If I understand Quinn's suggestion as specified to theistic belief, it
   is that:

   (Q1) the existence of God is not needed in order to explain theistic
   belief;

   hence

   (Q2) the existence of God is explanatorily idle;

   and

   (Q3) that is a good reason for holding that there is no such person as
   God.

   It's not clear that Quinn accepts (Q1) through (Q3); perhaps he is only
   proposing them as possibilities. (And even if he did accept them, he
   might also hold that there are also good reasons for theistic belief.)
   In any event, I believe there are several serious problems with these
   suggestions. First, according to the theory in question, believers in
   God postulate the existence of God ("there is in us a mechanism of
   belief formation and maintenance that involves projecting attributes of
   individual humans or their societies outwards and postulating entities
   in which the projected attributes are instantiated.") Belief in God,
   however, is clearly not a result of postulation; believers in God do
   not ordinarily postulate that there is such a person, just as believers
   in other persons or material objects do not ordinarily postulate that
   there are such things. Postulation is a process that goes with
   scientific theories; one postulates entities of a certain sort (e.g.,
   quarks or gluons) as part of an explanatory theory. Christians,
   however, do not ordinarily propose the existence of God as an
   explanation of anything at all (see above, pp. 330ff.). Still, perhaps
   this is not a central point. It shouldn't be essential to the theories
   in question that belief in God be formed by way of postulation; indeed,
   the theories would work as well or better if what they claimed was that
   believers in God came to believe as they do by way of unconscious
   mechanisms of one sort or another.

   Second, even if the existence of theistic belief can be explained'
   (whatever exactly that amounts to) without postulating the existence of
   God, it might still be that theism itself explains lots of other
   things. Theistic belief is only one of the things that theism can be
   invoked to explain. Theism has also been used to explain the
   fine-tuning of the universe; the existence of propositions, properties,
   and other abstract entities; the origin of life; the nature and
   existence of morality; the reliability of our epistemic faculties; and
   much else besides. Hence the fact that it is explanatorily idle with
   respect to theistic belief doesn't by itself show that it is
   explanatorily idle tout court; there is no reason, so far, to infer
   (Q2) from (Q1).

   Third, given (Q2), why infer (Q3)? According to Ockham's famous razor,
   entia non multiplicandum sunt praetor necessitatem; "entities ought not
   to be multiplied beyond necessity." [447] Taken as the suggestion that
   one ought not postulate entities of a certain kind unless required to
   in some way, the razor manifests a certain robust common sense.
   (Perhaps one can explain certain phenomena by way of postulating the
   existence of mice in the garage; then it would be multiplying entities
   beyond necessity if one were to postulate both mice and fairies to
   explain the phenomena.) But theism isn't ordinarily accepted as an
   explanatory hypothesis. So suppose theistic belief is indeed
   explanatorily idle: why should that compromise it, or suggest that it
   has low epistemic status? If theistic belief is not proposed as an
   explanatory hypothesis in the first place, why should its being
   explanatorily idle, if indeed it is, be held against it? Beliefs such
   as that I had an orange for breakfast are not (ordinarily) accepted as
   hypotheses; should we take the fact that they don't explain much of
   anything as a point against them, a defeater for them? So it is hard to
   see why theistic belief's being explanatorily idle (if it is) is a
   point against it. Indeed, (Q3) actually says something much stronger:
   explanatory idleness, it says, is a reason for taking theistic belief
   to be, not just epistemically suspect, but false. But why think that?
   Suppose (contrary to fact, as I see it) explanatory idleness is
   something against theistic belief. Why go on to infer that it gives one
   a reason for denying the existence of God? Wouldn't agnosticism,
   withholding belief, be sufficient? Maybe I don't know of any phenomena
   that I can explain only by supposing there is intelligent life on other
   planets. Should I then deny that there is any such life? Wouldn't
   simple agnosticism be sufficient?

   The crucial point, here, is that on the model (and in actuality as
   well) theistic belief is not ordinarily accepted as an explanation. It
   is not that the theist sizes up what the world appears to be like
   (including the existence of theistic belief itself) and then proposes
   the existence of God as the best explanation of these phenomena. If
   that were how she was thinking, then the fact that theistic belief is
   explanatorily idle (if it is) with respect to some range of data might
   be relevant. But it isn't. On the model, the believer in God ordinarily
   believes in the basic way, not on the evidential basis of other
   propositions, and not by way of proposing belief in God as an
   explanation of something or other. Hence the fact that there are better
   explanations of some range of phenomena (if there are) does not so far
   cast any doubt on belief in God.

   Allow me to return to an analogy I have used elsewhere. I apply for a
   National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship; realizing I am not
   really qualified, I offer you five hundred dollars to write a glowing
   if inaccurate letter of recommendation. Perhaps, as they say, everyone
   has a price; as it turns out, yours is definitely more than five
   hundred dollars. You indignantly refuse, and write a blistering letter
   to the chair of my department. The letter mysteriously disappears from
   her office. One of the most respected members of the department,
   however, reports having seen me apparently trying to enter her office
   through a second-story window. I have means, motive, and opportunity.
   Further, I am known to have done this sort of thing before. But I
   clearly remember being on a solitary hike in the mountains the entire
   afternoon during which the letter disappeared. I believe that I did not
   remove that letter, and that belief has warrant for me. But I do not
   propose my belief that I am innocent, or that I took a walk in the
   woods, as an explanation of the facts pointing to my guilt. I don't
   propose my innocence or my going for a hike as an explanation of
   anything at all: these beliefs enter my noetic structure in quite a
   different way. Suppose, then, that these beliefs are, in fact,
   explanatorily idle; and add, if you like, that there is a good (if
   false) explanation of x's claiming to have seen me trying to gain
   entrance to the office: namely, that I took the letter in order to
   avoid further embarrassment. Does the explanatory idleness of my
   beliefs constitute a defeater for them? Of course not. They aren't
   proposed as explanations. [448] Similarly for theistic belief.

   Taken as they stand, therefore, Quinn's claims do not seem to show that
   projective hypotheses furnish a defeater for Christian or theistic
   belief. Could it be that a stronger argument of the same sort is
   lurking in the neighborhood? As Quinn states the objection, the fact
   that theistic belief is explanatorily idle gives us reason to believe
   that there is no such person as God, so that the theist who realizes
   that this belief is indeed explanatorily idle has a rebutting defeater.
   But there may be another and possibly stronger way to put the
   objection. Perhaps the problem is not just that belief in the existence
   of God is explanatorily idle (if it is); after all, many of our beliefs
   do not function as explanations, or at least don't function primarily
   as explanations. Perhaps the idea, instead, is that

   (Q4) If S can give an explanation of a certain range of her beliefs
   without assuming the existence of the entities whose existence those
   beliefs affirm, then S has an undercutting defeater for those beliefs.

   The idea would then be that when the theist learns of these projective
   theories, she sees that the existence of her theistic belief can be
   explained without assuming the existence of God; that, according to
   (Q4), provides her with a rebutting defeater for her belief in the
   existence of God. This way of putting the objection differs from
   Quinn's in two ways. First, what provides a defeater for belief in the
   existence of God is not the fact that this belief is explanatorily idle
   (if it is), but rather the fact that there is an explanation of belief
   in God available that does not presuppose the truth of that
   belief--that is, does not presuppose the existence of God. Second, the
   kind of defeater allegedly provided is undercutting, not rebutting.

   Still, is (Q4) really true? There are at least two versions of (Q4). On
   the one hand, (Q4) could require that the proposed explanation must
   involve only entities whose existence S already accepts; on the other,
   the explanation could involve either entities whose existence she
   already accepts or entities whose existence she does not already
   accept. Because the first version is the weaker and hence more
   plausible, suppose we confine our attention to it. So imagine that I
   can give an explanation of a certain range of my beliefs without
   assuming the existence of the entities E those beliefs affirm; suppose
   further I can give the explanation in terms of entities I already do
   accept. Does that give me a defeater for belief in the existence of
   those entities E? I don't think so. Consider my belief in the external
   objects of perception (trees, houses, horses, other people): perhaps I
   could explain these beliefs as implanted in me by God, for reasons of
   his own. This explanation does not presuppose the existence of those
   objects, and it is in terms of entities (God) whose existence I already
   accept. Would the availability of this explanation give me a defeater
   for those perceptual beliefs? I doubt it. Another possibility: perhaps
   I could also explain them (in accordance with the projection theories
   we are considering) as projections I myself unconsciously make: I am
   appeared to in various ways and, as a result, project beliefs to the
   effect that there are material objects that persist even when I am not
   having any experience. Would that explanation of such beliefs give me a
   defeater for them? Again, I doubt it. Perhaps there is also a
   projective explanation of my belief in the existence of other people: I
   see these bodies around me; I project the belief that they are, or are
   the bodies of other thinking, feeling creatures like myself (the
   alternative is pretty lonely); does that give me a defeater for my
   belief that there are other persons? Again, I don't think so. The fact
   is there is little reason to accept (Q4), at least if taken with
   complete generality. This means, I believe, that we have no good reason
   to think one acquires a defeater for theistic belief in learning of
   these alleged projective explanations of it.

   Of course even if alleged projective explanations of theistic belief do
   not give me a defeater for such belief, there are many more candidates
   for that post. In the next chapters, we will move on to a consideration
   of some of those other alleged defeaters: contemporary historical
   biblical criticism, pluralism and postmodernism, and the facts of evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [445] Although, as I argued above (p. 197), it is possible that
   theistic belief originates in something like wishful thinking, but
   nonetheless has warrant. If I also believe this, then coming to think
   that belief in God is a product of wish-fulfillment would not
   automatically give me a defeater for such belief.

   [447] As the razor is ordinarily understood. There is apparently some
   doubt as to whether Ockham himself ever put it just this way.

   [448] Granted: if the evidence for my having taken the letter continues
   to mount (the letter turns up in my back pocket; my fingerprints are
   all over the file it was kept in; the mountain I thought I was hiking
   on that afternoon was destroyed by a volcanic eruption the preceding
   morning), I may eventually have to conclude that my memory is playing
   me tricks. The point is only that the explanatory idleness of my belief
   does not constitute any kind of defeater for it--because it isn't
   accepted as an explanation.

Two (or More) Kinds of Scripture Scholarship


   In chapter 8, I presented a model for the way Christian belief has or
   can have warrant. According to the model, Scripture is perspicuous: the
   main lines of its teaching--creation, sin, incarnation, atonement,
   resurrection, eternal life--can be understood and grasped and properly
   accepted by anyone of normal intelligence and ordinary training. As
   Jonathan Edwards said, the Housatonic Indians can easily grasp and
   properly appropriate this message; a Ph.D. in theology or history or
   biblical studies is not necessary. Underlying this point is a second:
   there is available a source of warranted true belief, a way of coming
   to see the truth of these teachings, that is quite independent of
   historical study: Scripture/the internal instigation of the Holy
   Spirit/faith (IIHS for short). By virtue of this process, an ordinary
   Christian, one quite innocent of historical studies, the ancient
   languages, the intricacies of textual criticism, the depths of
   theology, and all the rest can nevertheless come to know that these
   things are, indeed, true; furthermore, his knowledge need not trace
   back (by way of testimony, for example) to knowledge on the part of
   someone who does have this specialized training. Neither the Christian
   community nor the ordinary Christian is at the mercy of the expert
   here; they can know these truths directly.

   Nevertheless, of course, the serious and scholarly study of the Bible
   is of first importance for Christians. The roll call of those who have
   pursued this project is maximally impressive: Chrysostom, Augustine,
   Aquinas, Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, and Karl Barth, just for starters.
   These people and their successors begin from the idea that Scripture is
   divinely inspired in such a way that the Bible constitutes (among other
   things) a divine revelation, a special message from God to humankind;
   they then try to ascertain the Lord's teaching in the whole of
   Scripture or (more likely) a given bit. Since the Enlightenment,
   however, another kind of scripture scholarship has also come into view.
   Variously called higher criticism', historical criticism', biblical
   criticism', or historical critical scholarship', this variety of
   scripture scholarship brackets or prescinds from what is known by faith
   and aims to proceed scientifically', strictly on the basis of reason; I
   shall call it historical biblical criticism'--HBC for short. Scripture
   scholarship of this sort brackets the belief that the Bible is a
   special word from the Lord, as well as any other belief accepted on the
   basis of faith rather than reason. Now it often happens that the
   declarations of those who pursue this latter kind are in apparent
   conflict with the main lines of Christian thought; one who pursues this
   sort of scholarship is quite unlikely to conclude, for example, that
   Jesus was really the preexistent second person of the divine trinity
   who was crucified, died, and then literally rose from the dead the
   third day. As Van Harvey says, "So far as the biblical historian is
   concerned . . . there is scarcely a popularly held traditional belief
   about Jesus that is not regarded with considerable skepticism." [449] I
   shall try to describe both of these kinds of scripture scholarship.
   Then I shall ask the following question: how should a classical
   Christian, one who accepts "the great things of the gospel," respond to
   the deflationary aspect of HBC? How should he think about its
   apparently corrosive results with respect to traditional Christian
   belief? Given the extended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model, I shall argue
   that he need not be disturbed by the conflict between alleged results
   of HBC and traditional Christian belief. [450] That conflict does not
   offer a defeater for acceptance of the great things of the gospel--nor,
   to the degree that those alleged results rest on epistemological
   assumptions he doesn't share, of anything else he accepts on the basis
   of biblical teaching.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Scripture Divinely Inspired

   Now according to the A/C model, Scripture or the Bible figures
   importantly into the process whereby the believer comes to believe the
   great things of the gospel, and also into the process whereby these
   beliefs have warrant for him. Roughly speaking, he reads or hears the
   central message of Scripture; moved by the invitation or instigation of
   the Holy Spirit, he comes to believe. The Bible also figures into the
   intellectual economy of traditional Christians in quite another way. By
   way of the above process, perhaps I come to believe that a specific
   teaching--say, that in Christ, God was reconciling the world to
   himself--is true and is a divine revelation. But a traditional
   Christian also believes, for example, that the Gospel of John and
   Paul's epistle to the Romans and the book of Acts are divinely inspired
   and hence authoritative for Christian belief and practice. Indeed, he
   will believe this of the entire Bible. The whole Bible is a message
   from the Lord to humankind; this entire book is authoritative for
   Christian belief and practice.

   Now that belief itself is not one of the great things of the gospel--it
   is not an essential element of Christian belief. It wasn't accepted by
   the earliest Christians and isn't to be found in the ecumenical creeds.
   This is partly because there were Christians before these books were
   written, and, barring divine revelation to them that the books were
   indeed soon to be written and would indeed be authoritative, they
   wouldn't have known about them. The apostle Paul himself, for example,
   was certainly a Christian believer before he wrote his first epistles;
   he was a person of faith and held the essentials of Christian belief.
   Still, he no doubt didn't believe that the Bible--the Bible as we now
   have it, in Protestant or Catholic (or Orthodox) version--was divinely
   inspired. So the belief that God has inspired, say, the New Testament
   in such a way that it is a communication from God to us human
   beings--that belief is not itself an essential element of Christian
   belief. Strictly speaking, therefore, giving an account of how it is
   that this belief about the Bible has warrant for the Christian, if it
   does, lies outside the scope of my project, which concerns the way in
   which traditional Christian belief has warrant. Yet that belief does
   figure heavily into Christian practice; at millions of worship services
   every week, Christians all over the world hear passages of Scripture
   and respond by saying, "This is the Word of the Lord."

   I shall therefore begin this chapter by inquiring into the epistemology
   of the belief that the Bible is divinely inspired in a special way, and
   in such a way as to constitute divine discourse--the belief that the
   Lord speaks in a special way to us human beings in and through this
   book. How does a Christian come to believe that the Gospel of Mark, the
   book of Acts, or the entire New Testament is authoritative because
   divinely inspired? What (if anything) is the source of warrant for this
   belief? There are several possibilities. For many of us it will be by
   way of ordinary teaching and testimony. Perhaps I am brought up to
   believe that the Bible is, indeed, the Word of God (just as I am
   brought up thinking that thousands perished in the American Civil War),
   and I've never encountered any reason to doubt this. But an important
   feature of warrant is that if I accept a belief B just on testimony,
   then B has warrant for me only if it had warrant for the testifier as
   well. The warrant a belief has for the testifiee is derivative from the
   warrant it has for the testifier. [451] Our question, therefore,
   becomes this: what is the epistemological status of this belief for
   those members of the community who don't accept it on the testimony of
   other members? What is the source of the warrant (if any) this belief
   has for the Christian community? Well, perhaps a Christian might come
   to think something like the following:

   Suppose the apostles were commissioned by God through Jesus Christ to
   be witnesses and representatives (deputies) of Jesus. Suppose that what
   emerged from their carrying out this commission was a body of apostolic
   teaching which incorporated what Jesus taught them and what they
   remembered of the goings-on surrounding Jesus, shaped under the
   guidance of the Spirit. And suppose that the New Testament books are
   all either apostolic writings, or formulations of apostolic teaching
   composed by close associates of one or another apostle. Then it would
   be correct to construe each book as a medium of divine discourse. And
   an eminently plausible construal of the process whereby these books
   found their way into a single canonical text, would be that by way of
   that process of canonization, God was authorizing these books as
   together constituting a single volume of divine discourse. [452]

   So a Christian might come to think something like the above: she
   believes

   (1) that the apostles were commissioned by God through Jesus Christ to
   be witnesses and deputies,

   (2) that they produced a body of apostolic teaching that incorporated
   what Jesus taught,

   and

   (3) that the New Testament books are all either apostolic writings or
   formulations of apostolic teaching composed by close associates of one
   or another apostle.

   She also believes

   (4) that the process whereby these books found their way into a single
   canon is a matter of God's authorizing these books as constituting a
   single volume of divine discourse.

   She then concludes that indeed

   (5) the New Testament is a single volume of divine discourse.

   But our question then would be: how does she know, why does she believe
   each of (1) through (4)? What is the source of these beliefs?

   Could it be, perhaps, by way of ordinary historical investigation? I
   doubt it. The problem, once more, is the principle of dwindling
   probabilities. In chapter 8 (pp. 271ff.), we saw that this principle is
   a real obstacle for those who think that Christians might come to know
   the great things of the gospel by way of ordinary historical
   investigation--by coming to know, in this way, that the Bible is indeed
   the Word of God and that God does indeed teach these things. Of course
   the problem isn't as severe in the present case. We are imagining the
   Christian as already convinced of the great things of the gospel; her
   knowledge of them does not depend on her beliefs about the authority or
   divine inspiration of the Bible. According to the model, she doesn't
   reason thus: the Bible is the Word of God; it says that in Christ, God
   was reconciling the world to himself; therefore, in Christ, God was
   reconciling the world to himself. It is rather that upon hearing the
   gospel preached, reading the Bible, or in some other way encountering
   its message, she comes to believe these things immediately (i.e., not
   by way of inference), as a result of the work of the Holy Spirit in her
   heart. So suppose a Christian proposes to give a historical argument
   for the divine inspiration and consequent authority of the New
   Testament, say: we are to think of her as already knowing the central
   truths of Christianity. She already knows that there is such a person
   as God, that the man Jesus is also the divine son of God, and that
   through his ministry, passion, death, and resurrection we sinners can
   have life. These constitute part of her background information and can
   be employed in the historical argument in question. Her body of
   background information with respect to which she estimates the
   probability of (1) through (4), therefore, includes the main lines of
   Christian teaching. And of course she also knows that the books of the
   New Testament--some of them, anyway--apparently teach or presuppose
   these things. So her epistemic condition is much more favorable to (1)
   through (4) than it would be if she didn't already know these things.
   With respect to her background information B, therefore, perhaps each
   of (1) through (4) could be considered at least quite plausible and
   perhaps even likely to be true.

   Still, each is only probable. Perhaps, indeed, each is very likely and
   has a probability as high as .9 with respect to that body of belief B;
   more exactly, perhaps the probability of (1) on B is as high as .9, the
   probability of (2) on (1)&B as high as .9, and the same for
   P((3)/(B&(1)&(2))) and P((4)/(B&(1)&(2)&(3))) (see above, pp. 272ff.).
   Even so, we can conclude only that the probability of their
   conjunction, on B, is at least somewhat more than .5. In that case,
   belief that the New Testament is the Word of God would not be
   appropriate; what would be appropriate is the belief that it is rather
   likely that the New Testament is the Word of God. (The probability that
   the next throw of this die won't come up either 1 or 2 is greater than
   .5; that is nowhere nearly sufficient for my believing that it won't
   come up 1 or 2. [453] ) We could quibble about these probabilities: no
   doubt they could sensibly be thought to be greater than I suggested. No
   doubt; but they could also sensibly be thought to be less than I
   suggested. The historical argument for (1) to (4) will at best yield
   probabilities, and at best only a fairly insubstantial probability of
   (5) itself. The estimates of the probabilities involved, furthermore,
   will be vague, variable, and not really well-founded. If the belief in
   question is to have warrant for Christians, its epistemic status for
   them must be something different from that of a conclusion of ordinary
   historical investigation.

   Now most Christian communities have taught that the warrant enjoyed by
   this belief is not conferred on it just by way of ordinary historical
   investigation. For example, the Belgic Confession, one of the most
   important confessions of the Reformed churches, gives a list (the
   Protestant list) of the canonical books of the Bible; it then goes on:

   And we believe without a doubt all things contained in them--not so
   much because the church receives them and approves them as such, but
   above all because the Holy Spirit testifies in our hearts that they are
   from God, and also because they prove themselves to be from God.

   There is a possible ambiguity here: "we believe all things contained in
   them not so much because the church receives them"--to what does this
   last them' refer? The teachings contained in the books, or the books
   themselves? If the former, then what we have here is another example of
   what we've already noted: the Holy Spirit leading us to see, not that a
   given book is from God, but that some teaching--for example, in Christ,
   God was reconciling the world to himself--is true. If the latter,
   however, what we would be led to believe is such propositions as the
   Gospel of John is from God. I think it is at least fairly clear that
   the latter is what the confession intends. According to the confession,
   then, there are two sources for the belief that (e.g.) the Gospel of
   John is from God. The first is that the Holy Spirit testifies in our
   hearts that this book is indeed from God; the Holy Spirit doesn't
   merely impel us to believe, with respect to a given teaching of this
   book, that it is from God but impels us as well to believe that the
   Gospel of John itself is from God. The second is that the book "proves
   itself" to be from God. Perhaps here the idea is that the believer
   first comes to think, with respect to many of the specific teachings of
   that book, that they are, indeed, from God; that is, the Holy Spirit
   causes her to believe this with respect to many of the teachings of the
   book. She then infers (with the help of other premises) that the whole
   book has that same status. [454]

   This is only one way in which this belief could have warrant; there are
   other possibilities. Perhaps the believer knows by way of the IIHS that
   the Holy Spirit has guided and preserved the Christian church, making
   sure that its teachings on important matters are, in fact, true; then
   the believer would be warranted in believing, at any rate of those
   books of the Bible endorsed by all or nearly all traditional Christian
   communities, that they are from God. Or perhaps, guided by the Holy
   Spirit, she recapitulates the process whereby the canon was originally
   formed, paying attention to the original criteria of apostolic
   authorship, consistency with apostolic teaching, and the like, and
   relying on testimony for the propositions that such and such books were
   composed by apostles. There are also combinations of these ways. All
   (and still others besides) are consistent with the extended A/C model;
   the model need not choose among them. However precisely this belief
   receives its warrant, traditional Christians have accepted the belief
   that the Bible is the Word of God and that in it the Lord intends to
   teach us truths. [455]

   [453] If I believe whatever is quite likely with respect to my
   background information or what I know, I will wind up believing
   contradictions: for each number n between 1 and 6, it is likely that
   the die won't come up n; but, of course, it is also likely that the die
   will come up n for one of those numbers. I do not mean to say that
   historical investigation can never furnish enough evidence so that the
   appropriate attitude is that of belief (rather than just believing
   probable). That there was a Holocaust, an American Civil War, a French
   Revolution, a war between the Athenians and Spartans, and a Roman
   conquest of the Jews are all to be believed, not just believed
   probable. But the same doesn't go for (1) through (4). We don't have
   anywhere near that level of evidence for, for example, the claim that
   the apostles were commissioned by God, or that God authorized the books
   of the New Testament as constituting a volume of divine discourse.

   [454] Jonathan Edwards, The Religious Affections (New Haven: Yale

   clearness, such a world of wonderful and glorious truth in the gospel,
   that before was unknown, being quite above the view of a natural eye,
   but appearing so clear and bright, has a powerful and invincible
   influence on the soul to persuade of the divinity of the gospel."

   [455] I don't for a moment mean to suggest that teaching us truths is
   all that the Lord intends in Scripture: there is also raising
   affection, teaching us how to praise, how to pray, how to see the depth
   of our own sin, how marvelous the gift of salvation is, and a thousand
   other things.

  II. Traditional Christian Biblical Commentary

   Of course it isn't always easy to tell what the Lord is teaching us in
   a given passage: what he teaches is indeed true; still, sometimes it
   isn't clear just what his teaching is. Part of the problem is the fact
   that the Bible contains material of so many different sorts; it isn't
   in this respect like a contemporary book on theology or philosophy. It
   isn't a book full of declarative sentences, with proper analysis and
   logical development and all the accoutrements academics have come to
   know and love and demand. The Bible does, indeed, contain sober
   assertion, but there is also exhortation, expression of praise, poetry,
   the telling of stories and parables, songs, devotional material,
   history, genealogies, lamentations, confession, prophecy, apocalyptic
   material, and much else besides. Some of these (apocalyptic, for
   example) present real problems of interpretation (for us, at present):
   what exactly is the Lord teaching in Daniel, or Revelation? That's not
   easy to say. What are we to learn from the imprecatory psalms? Again,
   not easy to say.

   Even if we stick to straightforward assertion, there are a thousand
   questions of interpretation. Just a couple of examples. In Matthew
   5:17-20, Jesus declares that not a jot or a tittle of the law shall
   pass away and that "unless your righteousness surpasses that of the
   Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the
   kingdom of heaven," but in Galatians Paul seems to say that observance
   of the law doesn't count for much; how can we put these together? How
   do we understand Colossians 1:24: "Now I rejoice in what was suffered
   for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to
   Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body which is the church"? Is
   Paul suggesting that Christ's sacrifice is incomplete, insufficient,
   that it requires additional suffering on the part of Paul or the rest
   of us? That seems unlikely. Is it that our suffering can be a type of
   Christ's, thus standing to the latter in the relation in which a type
   stands to the reality it typifies? Or shall we understand it like this:
   we must distinguish between two kinds of Christ's suffering, the
   redemptive suffering, the expiatory and vicarious Atonement to which
   nothing can be added or taken away, on the one hand, and, on the other
   hand, another kind, also "for the sake of his body," in which we human
   beings can genuinely participate? Perhaps suffering which can build up,
   edify the body of Christ, even as our response to Christ can be
   deepened by our meditating on Christ's sacrifice for us and the amazing
   selfless love displayed in it? Or what? Do Paul and James contradict
   each other on the relation between faith and works? Or rather, since
   God is the author of Scripture, is he proposing an inconsistent or
   self-contradictory teaching for our belief? Well no, surely not, but
   then how shall we understand the two in relation to each other? More
   generally, given that God is the principal author of Scripture, how
   shall we think about the apparent tensions the latter displays? 1 John
   seems to say that Christians don't sin; in Paul's epistle to the
   Romans, he says that everyone sins; shall we draw the conclusion that
   there are no Christians? There are also problems about how to take the
   parables of Jesus. In Luke 18:1-13, for example, is Jesus suggesting
   that God will hear us just from sheer perseverance on our part, perhaps
   finally answering just because he's finally had enough? That doesn't
   sound right, but then how do we take the parable?

   Some of these issues are important to the way the church conducts its
   day-to-day business: how shall we understand the Eucharist? Should
   infants be baptized? What is the proper structure of authority in the
   church? Although these issues are important, the scriptural teaching on
   them isn't very clear--which is why Christians of wisdom and good will
   disagree about them. There are other issues--for example, whether a
   conversion experience is necessary for salvation, how important
   glossolalia is to a proper Christian life, the extent to which
   Christians should live in the world and accommodate to contemporary
   culture (how to be in but not of the world), what the structure of a
   worship service should be--on which the scriptural teaching is even
   less plain. And there are still others--whether it is infralapsarianism
   or supralapsarianism or neither that is the truth, whether Christ died
   for everyone or only for the elect, just what and when the millennium
   will be--on which scriptural teaching is less plain yet.

   And here we must pause to note a serious blemish on the face of
   Christendom. Christians have been at each other's throats and fought
   enormously destructive battles over all of these matters. In some
   cases, of course, the battles were literal battles; and the sight of
   Christians (with their teachings about peace and love and turning the
   other cheek) at each other's throats must surely have been an important
   cause of modern and Enlightenment apostasy. [456] Nowadays, perhaps, we
   don't engage in literal battles; [457] nevertheless, serious Christians
   still spend an enormous amount of time and energy in disputes over
   these matters. Isn't it obvious, however, that the path of wisdom for
   Christians is to proportion willingness to fight, here, both to the
   degree to which it is clear that the item in question is, indeed,
   proposed for our belief by God and also to its importance for the
   Christian life? Christians will have much to answer for, along these
   lines, and it is not going to be pleasant.

   Scripture, therefore, is inspired: what it teaches is true; yet it
   isn't always trivial to tell what it does teach. Indeed, many of the
   sermons and homilies preached in a million churches every Sunday
   morning are devoted in part to bringing out what might otherwise be
   obscure in scriptural teaching. Given that the Bible is a communication
   from God to humankind, a divine revelation, there is much about it that
   requires deep and perceptive reflection, much that taxes our best
   scholarly and spiritual resources to the utmost. This fact wasn't lost
   on Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, and the others I mentioned above;
   between them they wrote an impressively large number of volumes devoted
   to powerful reflection on the meaning and teachings of Scripture.
   (Calvin's commentaries alone run to some twenty-two volumes.) Their aim
   was to determine as accurately as possible just what the Lord proposes
   to teach us in the Bible. Call this enterprise traditional biblical
   commentary' and note that it displays at least the following three
   features.

   First, Scripture itself is taken to be a wholly authoritative and
   trustworthy guide to faith and morals; it is authoritative and
   trustworthy, because it is a revelation from God, a matter of God's
   speaking to us. Once it is clear, therefore, what the teaching of a
   given bit of Scripture is, the question of the truth and acceptability
   of that teaching is settled. In a commentary on Plato, we might decide
   that what Plato really meant to say was XYZ; we might then go on to
   consider and evaluate XYZ in various ways, asking whether it is true,
   or close to the truth, or true in principle, or superseded by things we
   have learned since Plato wrote, and the like; we might also ask whether
   Plato's grounds or arguments for XYZ are slight, or acceptable, or
   substantial or compelling. These questions are out of place in the kind
   of scripture scholarship under consideration. Once convinced that God
   is proposing XYZ for our belief, we do not go on to ask whether it is
   true, or whether God has made a good case for it. God is not required
   to make a case.

   Second, an assumption of the enterprise is that the principal author of
   the Bible--the entire Bible--is God himself (according to Calvin, God
   the Holy Spirit). Of course each of the books of the Bible has a human
   author or authors as well; still, the principal author is God. This
   impels us to treat the whole more like a unified communication than a
   miscellany of ancient books. Scripture isn't so much a library of
   independent books as itself a book with many subdivisions but a central
   theme: the message of the gospel. By virtue of this unity, furthermore
   (by virtue of the fact that there is just one principal author), it is
   possible to "interpret Scripture with Scripture." If a given passage
   from one of Paul's epistles is puzzling, it is perfectly proper to try
   to come to clarity as to what God's teaching is in this passage by
   appealing not only to what Paul himself says elsewhere in other
   epistles but also to what is taught elsewhere in Scripture (for
   example, the Gospel of John [458] ). Passages in Psalms or Isaiah can
   be interpreted in terms of the fuller, more explicit disclosure in the
   New Testament; the serpent elevated on a pole to save the Israelites
   from disaster can be seen as a type of Christ (and thus as getting some
   of its significance by way of an implicit reference to Christ, whose
   being raised on the cross averted a greater disaster for the whole
   human race). A further consequence is that we can quite properly accept
   propositions that are inferred from premises coming from different
   parts of the Bible: once we see what God intends to teach in a given
   passage A and what he intends to teach in a given passage B, we can put
   the two together, and treat consequences of these propositions as
   themselves divine teaching. [459]

   Third (and connected with the second point), the fact that the
   principal author of the Bible is God himself means that one can't
   always determine the meaning of a given passage by discovering what the
   human author had in mind. Of course various postmodern hermeneuticists
   aim to amuse by telling us that, in this case as in all others, the
   author's intentions have nothing whatever to do with the meaning of a
   passage, that the reader herself confers on the passage whatever
   meaning it has, or perhaps that even entertaining the idea of a text's
   having meaning is to fall into "hermeneutical innocence"--adding, with
   a certain air of insouciant bravado, that such innocence is
   ineradicably sullied by its inevitable association with homophobic,
   sexist, racist, oppressive, and other unacceptable modes of thought.
   This is, indeed, amusing. Returning to serious business, however, it is
   obvious (given that the principal author of the Bible is God) that the
   meaning of a biblical passage will be given by what it is that the Lord
   intends to teach in that passage, and it is precisely this that
   biblical commentary tries to discern. But we can't just assume that
   what the Lord intends to teach us is identical with what the human
   author had in mind; [460] the latter may not so much as have thought of
   what is, in fact, the teaching of the passage in question. Thus, for
   example, Christians take the suffering servant passages in Isaiah to be
   references to Jesus; Jesus himself says (Luke 4:18-21) that the
   prophecy in Isaiah 61:1-2 is fulfilled in him; John (19:28-37) takes
   passages from Exodus, Numbers, Psalms, and Zechariah to be references
   to Jesus and the events of his life and death; Matthew (21:5) and John
   (12:15) take it that Zechariah 9:9 is a reference to Jesus' triumphal
   entry into Jerusalem; Hebrews 10 takes passages from Psalms, Jeremiah,
   and Habakkuk to be references to Christ and events in his career, as
   does Paul for passages from Psalms and Isaiah in his speech in Acts 13.
   Indeed, Paul refers to the Old Testament on nearly every page of Romans
   and both Corinthian epistles, and frequently in other epistles. There
   is no reason to suppose the human authors of Exodus, Numbers, Psalms,
   Isaiah, Jeremiah, or Habakkuk had in mind Jesus' triumphal entry, his
   incarnation, or other events of Jesus' life and death--or, indeed,
   anything else explicitly about Jesus. But the fact that it is God who
   is the principal author here makes it quite possible that what we are
   to learn from the text in question is something rather different from
   what the human author proposed to teach.

   [456] And perhaps also of contemporary apostasy. In explaining why
   "contemporary theologians" are not interested in the topics
   contemporary philosophers of religion discuss, the theologian Gordon
   Kaufman proposes that it now seems that the Christian faith, Christian
   ways of understanding the world and the human place within the world, a
   powerful Christian sense of divine authorization and thus superiority
   over other religions, Christian imperialism, Christian racism and
   sexism, and other characteristics of the Christian religion and of
   "Christian civilization," bear some significant responsibility for most
   of the evils I have just mentioned . . . two horrible world wars, the
   Nazi holocaust and other instances of genocide, the ecological crisis,
   the use of atomic bombs in World War II and the ever-present
   possibility of nuclear obliteration of the human race. . . . Christian
   theologians today have thus been driven, in a way unprecedented
   historically, to ask some hard questions about Christian faith,
   practices and institutions, questions that force close examination of
   the very symbols and ideas that have traditionally informed this faith.
   ("Evidentialism: A Theologian's Response," Faith and Philosophy
   [January 1989], pp. 41-42) Kaufman's essential position here, I think,
   is that contemporary philosophy of religion still (or again) takes
   seriously traditional Christianity, with its belief in God,
   incarnation, atonement, and so on, while contemporary theologians,
   paying attention to the factors he mentions, have "gone beyond" all
   that. See above, chapter 2. (Of course, as Kaufman acknowledges, he
   speaks for only some contemporary theologians.)

   [457] But I won't easily forget the sight (in Belfast) of a Protestant
   preacher shaking his jowls and roaring about "the God-cursed blasphemy
   of the idolatrous whore of Rome!" and looking for all the world as if
   there is nothing he would like better than to sink his sword into the
   breast of some hapless Roman Catholic.

   [458] See, for example, Richard Swinburne (Revelation [Oxford:
   Clarendon Press, 1992], p. 192), who suggests that Paul's Christology
   at Romans 1:4 should be understood in terms of the high' Christology of
   the first chapter of John's Gospel. We could say the same for Paul's
   Christology in his speech in Acts 13, where he seems to suggest that a
   special status was conferred on Jesus, as opposed to John 1, according
   to which Jesus is the incarnation of the preexistent Word. See also
   Raymond Brown, New Testament Christology (New York: Paulist Press,
   1994), pp. 133ff.

   [459] Of course this procedure, like most others, can be and has been
   abused; that possibility in itself, however, is nothing against it,
   though it should serve as a salutary caution.

   [460] A further complication: we can't simply assume that there is some
   one thing, the same for everyone, that the Lord intends to teach in a
   given passage; perhaps what he intends to teach me or my relevant
   sociological group is not the same as what he intended to teach a
   fifth-century Christian.

  III. Historical Biblical Criticism

   For at least the last couple of hundred years, there has also been a
   quite different kind of scripture scholarship: historical biblical
   criticism (HBC). There is much to be grateful for with respect to HBC;
   it has enabled us to learn a great deal about the Bible we otherwise
   might not have known. Furthermore, some of the methods it has developed
   (form criticism, source criticism, others) can be and have been
   employed to excellent effect in traditional biblical commentary. It
   differs importantly from the latter, however. HBC is fundamentally an
   Enlightenment project; it is an effort to look at and understand
   biblical books from a standpoint that relies on reason alone; that is,
   it is an effort to determine from the standpoint of reason alone what
   the scriptural teachings are and whether they are true. Thus HBC
   eschews the authority and guidance of tradition, magisterium, creed, or
   any kind of ecclesial or "external" epistemic authority. The idea is to
   see what can be established (or at least made plausible) using only the
   light of what we could call "natural, empirical reason." The faculties
   or sources of belief invoked, therefore, would be those that are
   employed in ordinary history: perception, testimony, reason taken in
   the sense of a priori intuition together with deductive and
   probabilistic reasoning, Reid's sympathy, by which we discern the
   thoughts and feelings of another, and so on--but bracketing any
   proposition one knows by faith or by way of the authority of the
   church. Spinoza (1632-77) already lays down the charter for this
   enterprise: "The rule for [biblical] interpretation should be nothing
   but the natural light of reason which is common to all--not any
   supernatural light nor any external authority." [461]

   This doesn't preclude, of course, a rational argument (an argument from
   reason alone) for the proposition that indeed there has been a divine
   revelation, and that the Bible (or some part of it) is precisely that
   revelation: exactly this is the Lockean project (see above, pp. 79ff.).
   Nor does it preclude a direct argument, one that proceeds independently
   of any claim to revelation, for the central claims of Christianity.
   Indeed, many critics of the Christian faith seem to take it for granted
   that if Christian belief were to be rationally acceptable, it would
   have to be held on the basis of just such argument. Christian belief
   would have to be or be like a scientific explanation (as they think of
   it): any rational justification or warrant it enjoyed would have to be
   by way of its being a good explanation of the observed phenomena. [462]
   From this point of view, a Christian must presumably be thinking along
   the following lines: "What is the best explanation for all that
   organized complexity in the natural world and the characteristic
   features of human life and all the rest of what we see about us? Well,
   let's see, perhaps there is an omniscient, omnipotent, wholly good
   being who created the world. Yes that's it; and perhaps this being is
   one of three persons, the other two being his divine son and a third
   person proceeding from the first two (or maybe just the first), yet
   there are not three gods but one; the second person became incarnate,
   suffered, was crucified, and died, thus atoning for our sins and making
   it possible for us to have life and have it more abundantly. Right;
   that's got to be it; that's a dandy explanation of the facts." The
   critics then conclude, naturally enough, that Christian belief leaves a
   good bit to be desired.

   This project or enterprise is often thought of as part and parcel of
   the development of modern empirical science, and indeed practitioners
   of HBC like to drape about their shoulders the mantle of modern
   science. The attraction is not just that HBC can perhaps share in the
   prestige of modern science, but also that it can share in the obvious
   epistemic power and excellence of the latter. [463] It is common to
   think of science itself as our best shot at getting to know what the
   world is really like; HBC is, among other things, an attempt to apply
   these widely approved methods to the study of Scripture and the origins
   of Christianity. Thus Raymond Brown, a scripture scholar than whom none
   is more highly respected, believes that HBC is "scientific biblical
   criticism"; [464] it yields "factual results" (p. 9); he intends his
   own contributions to be "scientifically respectable" (p. 11); and
   practitioners of HBC investigate the Scriptures with "scientific
   exactitude" (pp. 18-19). [465]

   What is it, exactly, to study the Bible scientifically? That's not so
   clear; as we'll see below, there is more than one answer to this
   question. One theme that seems to command nearly universal assent,
   however, is that in working at this scientific project (however exactly
   it is to be understood) one doesn't invoke or employ any theological
   assumptions or presuppositions. You don't assume, for example, that the
   Bible is inspired by God in any special way, or contains anything like
   specifically divine discourse. You don't assume that Jesus is the
   divine son of God, or that he arose from the dead, or that his
   suffering and death are in some way a propitiatory atonement for human
   sin, making it possible for us to get into the right relationship to
   God. You don't assume any of these things because, in pursuing science,
   you don't assume or employ any proposition which you know by faith.
   [466] (As a consequence, the meaning of a text will be what the human
   author intended to assert [if it is assertive discourse]; divine
   intentions and teaching don't enter into the meaning. [467] ) The idea,
   says E. P. Sanders, is to rely only on "evidence on which everyone can
   agree." [468] According to Jon Levenson,

   Historical critics thus rightly insist that the tribunal before which
   interpretations are argued cannot be confessional or "dogmatic"; the
   arguments offered must be historically valid, able, that is, to compel
   the assent of historians whatever their religion or lack thereof,
   whatever their backgrounds, spiritual experiences, or personal beliefs,
   and without privileging any claim of revelation. [469]

   Barnabas Lindars explains that

   There are in fact two reasons why many scholars are very cautious about
   miracle stories. . . . The second reason is historical. The religious
   literature of the ancient world is full of miracle stories, and we
   cannot believe them all. It is not open to a scholar to decide that,
   just because he is a believing Christian, he will accept all the Gospel
   miracles at their face value, but at the same time he will repudiate
   miracles attributed to Isis. All such accounts have to be scrutinized
   with equal detachment. [470]

   And even Luke Timothy Johnson, who is in general astutely critical of
   HBC:

   It is obviously important to study Christian origins historically. And
   in such historical inquiry, faith commitments should play no role.
   Christianity is no more privileged for the historian than any other
   human phenomenon. [471]

   In practice, this emphasis means that HBC tends to deal especially with
   questions of composition and authorship, these being the questions most
   easily addressed by the methods employed. When was the document in
   question composed--or, more exactly, since we can't assume that we are
   dealing with a single unified document here, when were its various
   parts composed? How was the Gospel of Luke, for example, composed? Was
   it written by one person, relying on his memory of Jesus and his words
   and deeds, or was it assembled from various reports, alleged
   quotations, songs, poems, and the like in the oral tradition? Was it
   dependent on one or more earlier written or oral sources? Why did the
   editor or redactor put the book together in just the way he did? Was it
   perhaps to make a theological point in a then-current controversy?
   Where traditional biblical commentary assumes that the entire Bible is
   really one book with a single principal author, HBC tends to give us a
   collection of books by many authors. And even within the confines of a
   single book, it may give us a collection of discontinuous sayings and
   episodes (pericopes), stitched together by one or more redactors. How
   much of what is reported as the sayings and discourse of Jesus really
   was said by Jesus? Can we discern various strata in the book--perhaps a
   bottom stratum including the actual sayings of Jesus himself, and then
   successive overlaying strata? As Robert Alter says, scholarship of this
   kind tends to be "excavative"; the idea is to dig behind the document
   as we actually have it to see what can be determined of its history.
   [472]

   Of course the idea is also to see, as far as this is possible, whether
   the events reported--in the Gospels, for example--really happened, and
   whether the picture they give of Jesus is accurate. Did he say the
   things they say he said, and do the things they say he did? Here the
   assumption is that we can't simply take at face value the Gospels as we
   now have them. There may have been all sorts of additions and
   subtractions and alterations made in the interest of advancing
   theological points. Further, the New Testament books are written from
   the standpoint of faith--faith that Jesus really was the Christ, did
   indeed suffer and die and rise from the dead, and did accomplish our
   salvation. From the standpoint of reason alone, however, this faith
   must be bracketed; hence (from that standpoint) the hermeneutics of
   suspicion is appropriate here. (This suspicion is sometimes carried so
   far that it reminds one of the way in which the CIA's denial that Mr. X
   is a spy is taken as powerful evidence that Mr. X is a spy.)
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Varieties of Historical Biblical Criticism

   Those who practice HBC, therefore, propose to proceed without employing
   theological assumptions or anything one knows by faith (if indeed there
   is anything one knows by faith); these things are to be bracketed.
   Instead, one proceeds scientifically, on the basis of reason alone.
   Beyond this, however, there is vastly less concord. What is to count as
   reason? Precisely what premises can be employed in an argument from
   reason alone? What exactly does it mean to proceed scientifically? Here
   I think we find at least three distinct positions.

      1. Troeltschian Historical Biblical Criticism

   Many contemporary biblical critics appeal to the thought and teaching
   of Ernst Troeltsch. [473] Thus John Collins:

   Among theologians these principles received their classic formulation
   from Ernst Troeltsch in 1898. Troeltsch sets out three principles . . .
   (1) The principle of criticism or methodological doubt: since any
   conclusion is subject to revision, historical inquiry can never attain
   absolute certainty but only relative degrees of probability. (2) The
   principle of analogy: historical knowledge is possible because all
   events are similar in principle. We must assume that the laws of nature
   in biblical times were the same as now. Troeltsch referred to this as
   "the almighty power of analogy." (3) The principle of correlation: the
   phenomena of history are inter-related and interdependent and no event
   can be isolated from the sequence of historical cause and effect. [474]

   Collins adds a fourth principle, this one taken from Van Harvey's The
   Historian and the Believer, [475] a more recent locus classicus for the
   proper method of historical criticism:

   To these should be added the principle of autonomy, which is
   indispensable for any critical study. Neither church nor state can
   prescribe for the scholar which conclusions should be reached. (p. 2)

   Now the first thing to note is that each of these principles is
   multiply ambiguous. In particular, each (except perhaps the second) has
   a noncontroversial, indeed, platitudinous interpretation. The first
   principle seems to be a comment on historical inquiry rather than a
   principle for its practice: historical inquiry can never attain
   absolutely certain results. (Perhaps the implied methodological
   principle is that in doing historical criticism, you should avoid
   claiming absolute certainty for your results.) Fair enough. I suppose
   nearly everyone would agree that few historical results of any
   significance are as certain as, say, that 2 + 1 = 3; if so, however,
   they don't achieve absolute certainty. (The only reasonably plausible
   candidates for historical results that are absolutely certain, I
   suppose, would be such historical' claims as that either Caesar crossed
   the Rubicon or else he didn't.)

   The third also has a platitudinous interpretation. Troeltsch puts the
   principle like this: "The sole task of history in its specifically
   theoretical aspect is to explain every movement, process, state and
   nexus of things by reference to the web of its causal relations." [476]
   This too can be seen as toothless if not platitudinous. Every event is
   to be explained by reference to the web of its causal relations--which,
   of course, would also include the intentions and actions of persons.
   Well then, consider even such an event as the resurrection of Jesus
   from the dead: according to the principle at hand, this event too would
   have to be explained by reference to the web of its causal relations.
   No problem; on the traditional view, this event was caused by God
   himself, who caused it in order to achieve certain of his aims and
   ends, in particular making it possible for human beings to be
   reconciled with him. So taken, this principle would exclude very
   little.

   I say the second principle is perhaps the exception to the claim that
   each has a banal, uncontroversial interpretation: that is because on
   any plausible interpretation the second principle seems to entail the
   existence of natural laws. That there are such things as natural laws
   was a staple of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century science and
   philosophy of science; [477] what science discovers (so they thought)
   is just these laws of nature. [478] Empiricists have always been
   dubious about natural laws, however, and at present the claim that
   there are any such things is, at best, extremely controversial. [479]

   Among the main problems is the alleged necessity of these laws. A
   natural law is supposed to be a universal generalization. Consider, for
   example, Newton's first law: "Every body continues in its state of
   rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled
   to change that state by forces impressed on it." The idea is that this
   universal generalization is in some sense necessarily true. The alleged
   kind of necessity (natural' or physical' necessity) is supposed to be
   weaker than the broadly logical necessity enjoyed by truths of logic,
   arithmetic, and the like (natural laws are ordinarily thought to be
   contingent in the broadly logical sense) but necessary in some sense
   nonetheless. In what sense? That's not easy to say, but here is a
   picture. Think of natural necessity in terms of the ordinary semantics
   for counterfactuals: we imagine the possible worlds as constituting a
   space--for simplicity, a three-dimensional space; we somehow settle on
   or at any rate postulate the existence of a distance measure on this
   space of possible worlds; and the larger the sphere of possible worlds
   (centered on the actual world [480] ) in which a given proposition is
   true, the more necessary that proposition is. Then the idea would be
   that natural laws are propositions true in very large spheres (centered
   on the actual world); they remain true as we proceed outward from the
   actual world for a very long ways.

   This is a pretty little picture (though both metaphorical and highly
   speculative); still, why saddle the historian or scripture scholar with
   an opinion on this topic? It is hard to see that the practice of HBC
   actually requires allegiance to the view that there is such a thing as
   natural necessity or, that there are such things as natural laws,
   explained in this way or in any other. Why must the historian take a
   hand in this philosophical dispute? But perhaps Troeltsch and Collins
   don't really mean to insist that the critical historian has to believe
   in natural laws; perhaps they could put their claims just as well by
   saying the same empirical generalizations or physical regularities
   obtained in the past as obtain now. Newtonian physics (at least
   approximately, and for middle-sized objects traveling at moderate
   speed) held then as now; special and general relativity were true then
   just as now (if indeed they are true now); quantum electrodynamics
   applied at earlier times (at any rate times not too close to the Big
   Bang) just as at present. And this whether we think of these as
   statements of natural law, with that peculiar sort of necessity, or as
   statements of exceptionless regularities, or as regularities holding
   for the vast majority of cases, or (as in the case of some quantum
   mechanical regularities) probabilistic.

   So Troeltsch's principles have platitudinous interpretations; but these
   are not, in fact, the interpretations given to them in the community of
   HBC. Within that community, those principles are understood in such a
   way as to preclude direct divine action in the world. Not that all in
   this community accept Troeltsch's principles in their nonplatitudinous
   interpretation; rather, those who think of themselves as accepting (or
   rejecting) those principles think of themselves as accepting (or
   rejecting) their nonplatitudinous versions. (Presumably everyone
   accepts them taken platitudinously.) So taken, these principles imply
   that God has not, in fact, specially inspired any human authors in such
   a way that what they write is really divine speech addressed to us; nor
   has he raised Jesus from the dead, turned water into wine, or performed
   miracles of any other sorts. Thus Rudolf Bultmann:

   The historical method includes the presupposition that history is a
   unity in the sense of a closed continuum of effects in which individual
   events are connected by the succession of cause and effect.

   This continuum, furthermore,

   cannot be rent by the interference of supernatural, transcendent
   powers. [481]

   Many other theologians, oddly enough, chime in with agreement: God
   cannot or at any rate would not and will not act directly in the world.
   Thus John Macquarrie:

   The way of understanding miracles that appeals to breaks in the natural
   order and to supernatural interventions belongs to the mythological
   outlook and cannot commend itself in a post-mythological climate of
   thought. . . .

   The traditional conception of miracle is irreconcilable with our modern
   understanding of both science and history. Science proceeds on the
   assumption that whatever events occur in the world can be accounted for
   in terms of other events that also belong within the world; and if on
   some occasions we are unable to give a complete account of some
   happening . . . the scientific conviction is that further research will
   bring to light further factors in the situation, but factors that will
   turn out to be just as immanent and this-worldly as those already
   known. [482]

   And Langdon Gilkey:

   contemporary theology does not expect, nor does it speak of, wondrous
   divine events on the surface of natural and historical life. The causal
   nexus in space and time which the Enlightenment science and philosophy
   introduced into the Western mind . . . is also assumed by modern
   theologians and scholars; since they participate in the modern world of
   science both intellectually and existentially, they can scarcely do
   anything else. Now this assumption of a causal order among phenomenal
   events, and therefore of the authority of the scientific interpretation
   of observable events, makes a great difference to the validity one
   assigns to biblical narratives and so to the way one understands their
   meaning. Suddenly a vast panoply of divine deeds and events recorded in
   scripture are no longer regarded as having actually happened. . . .
   Whatever the Hebrews believed, we believe that the biblical people
   lived in the same causal continuum of space and time in which we live,
   and so one in which no divine wonders transpired and no divine voices
   were heard. [483]

   Gilkey says no divine wonders have transpired and no divine voices have
   been heard; Macquarrie adds that in this postmythological age, we can't
   brook the idea of "breaks in the natural order and supernatural
   intervention." Each therefore, is ruling out the possibility of
   miracle, including the possibility of special divine action in
   inspiring human authors in such a way that what they write constitutes
   an authoritative communication from God. Now it is far from easy to say
   just what a miracle is; this topic is connected with deep and thorny
   questions about occasionalism, natural law, natural potentialities, and
   so on. We needn't get into all that, however. The Troeltschian idea is
   that there is a certain way in which things ordinarily go; there are
   certain regularities, whether or not due to natural law, and God can be
   counted on to act in such a way as not to abrogate those regularities.
   Of course God could, if he chose, abrogate those regularities (after
   all, even those natural laws, if there are any, are his creatures); but
   we can be sure, somehow, that he will not. Troeltschian scripture
   scholarship, therefore, will proceed on the basis of the assumption
   that God never does anything specially; in particular, he neither
   raised Jesus from the dead nor specially inspired the biblical authors.

   A thousand questions arise about these regularities: what sort are we
   thinking of? Suppose there has never been and never will be a
   combination of three dimes and two nickels in my pocket, or a
   freshwater lake the size of Lake Baikal surrounded by mainly Japanese
   speakers, or heavily glaciated mountains in Australia contemporaneous
   with a Dutch-speaking population, or dinosaurs and humans at the same
   time: are these the sorts of regularities in question? Presumably not.
   What about the fact that none of the Great Lakes has ever been or ever
   will be filled with single-malt Scotch whiskey? Or that there has never
   been or ever will be a sphere of gold a mile in diameter? Probably not.
   How about the fact that there has never been a sphere of plutonium a
   mile in diameter? Probably so: such a sphere would contain a quantity
   of plutonium greater than the critical mass and would therefore have
   exploded. How, precisely, do we characterize the regularities we are
   talking about? That's very difficult. At any rate the idea is that
   there are such regularities; and among them would be that human beings,
   once they are dead, do not come back to life, that water doesn't change
   into wine, and that human beings are not specially inspired by God in
   such a way that what they write is properly regarded as divine speech
   and revelation.

      2. Duhemian Historical Biblical Criticism

   Not all who accept and practice HBC accept Troeltsch's principles, and
   we can see another variety of HBC by thinking about an important
   suggestion made by Pierre Duhem. Duhem was both a serious Catholic and
   a serious scientist; he was accused (as he thought) by Abel Rey [484]
   of allowing his religious and metaphysical views as a Christian to
   enter his physics in an improper way. Duhem repudiated this suggestion,
   claiming that his Christianity didn't enter his physics in any way at
   all and a fortiori didn't enter it in an improper way. [485]
   Furthermore, the correct or proper way to pursue physical theory, he
   said, was the way in which he had in fact done it; physical theory
   should be completely independent of religious or metaphysical views or
   commitments.

   Why did he think so? What did he have against metaphysics? Here he
   strikes a characteristic Enlightenment note: if you think of
   metaphysics as ingressing into physics, he says, then your estimate of
   the worth of a physical theory will depend on the metaphysics you
   adopt. Physical theory will be dependent on metaphysics in such a way
   that someone who doesn't accept the metaphysics involved in a given
   physical theory can't accept the physical theory either. And the
   problem with that is that the disagreements that run riot in
   metaphysics will ingress into physics, so that the latter cannot be an
   activity we can all work at together, regardless of our metaphysical
   views:

   Now to make physical theories depend on metaphysics is surely not the
   way to let them enjoy the privilege of universal consent. . . . If
   theoretical physics is subordinated to metaphysics, the divisions
   separating the diverse metaphysical systems will extend into the domain
   of physics. A physical theory reputed to be satisfactory by the
   sectarians of one metaphysical school will be rejected by the partisans
   of another school. (p. 10)

   Duhem's main point, I think, is that if a physical theorist employs
   metaphysical assumptions or other notions that are not accepted by
   other workers in the field, and employs them in such a way that those
   who don't accept them can't accept his physical theory, then to that
   extent his work cannot be accepted by those others; to that extent,
   furthermore, the cooperation important to science will be compromised.
   He therefore proposes a conception of science (of physics in
   particular) according to which the latter is independent of
   metaphysics:

   I have denied metaphysical doctrines the right to testify for or
   against any physical theory. . . . Whatever I have said of the method
   by which physics proceeds, or the nature and scope that we must
   attribute to the theories it constructs, does not in any way prejudice
   either the metaphysical doctrines or religious beliefs of anyone who
   accepts my words. The believer and the nonbeliever may both work in
   common accord for the progress of physical science such as I have tried
   to define it. (pp. 274-75)

   Duhem's proposal, reduced to essentials, is that physicists shouldn't
   make essential use of religious or metaphysical assumptions in doing
   their physics: that way lies chaos and cacophony, as each of the
   warring sects does things its own way. If we want to have the sort of
   commonality and genuine dialogue that promote progress in physics, we
   should avoid assumptions, metaphysical, religious, or otherwise, that
   are not accepted by all parties to the discussion. [486]

   This is an interesting suggestion. Although Duhem himself didn't do so,
   it can obviously be applied far beyond the confines of physical theory,
   for example, to scripture scholarship. Suppose we say that Duhemian
   scripture scholarship is scripture scholarship that doesn't involve any
   theological, religious, or metaphysical assumptions that aren't
   accepted by everyone in the relevant community. [487] Thus the Duhemian
   scripture scholar wouldn't take for granted either that God is the
   principal author of the Bible or that the main lines of the Christian
   story are in fact true; these are not accepted by all who are party to
   the discussion. She wouldn't take for granted that Jesus rose from the
   dead, or that any other miracle has occurred; she couldn't so much as
   take it for granted that miracles are possible because these claims are
   rejected by many who are party to the discussion. On the other hand, of
   course, Duhemian scripture scholarship can't take it for granted that
   Christ did not rise from the dead or that no miracles have occurred, or
   that miracles are impossible. Nor can it employ Troeltsch's principles
   (taken nonplatitudinously); not everyone accepts them. Duhemian
   scripture scholarship fits well with Sanders's suggestion that "what is
   needed is more secure evidence, evidence on which everyone can agree"
   (above, p. 388). It also fits well with John Meier's fantasy of "an
   unpapal conclave" of Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, and agnostic
   scholars, locked in the basement of the Harvard Divinity School library
   until they come to consensus on what historical methods can show about
   the life and mission of Jesus. [488] Among the proposed benefits of
   Duhemian HBC, obviously, are just the benefits Duhem cites: people of
   very different religious and theological beliefs can cooperate in this
   enterprise. Of course this is not a reason for thinking the results of
   Duhemian scholarship are more likely to be true or closer to the truth
   than, say, traditional biblical commentary; still, although in
   principle the traditional biblical commentator and the Troeltschian
   biblical scholar could discover whatever is unearthed by Duhemian
   means, it is, in fact, likely that much will be learned in this
   cooperative enterprise that would not be learned by either group
   working alone.

      3. Spinozistic Historical Biblical Criticism

   Troeltschian and Duhemian HBC do not exhaust HBC; one can be a
   practitioner of HBC and accept neither. You might propose to follow
   reason alone in scripture scholarship, but think that the Troeltschian
   principles, taken in the strong version in which they imply that God
   never acts specially in the world, are not, in fact, deliverances of
   reason. Reason alone, you say, certainly can't demonstrate that God
   never acts specially in the world, or that no miracles have ever
   occurred. If so, you wouldn't be a Troeltschian. But you might reject
   Duhemianism as well: you might think that, as a matter of fact, there
   are deliverances of reason not accepted by everyone party to the
   project of scripture scholarship. (The deliverances of reason are
   indeed open to all; nevertheless, impeding factors of one kind or
   another can sometimes prevent someone from seeing the truth of one or
   another of them.) Then you might yourself employ those deliverances of
   reason in pursuing scripture scholarship, thereby employing assumptions
   not accepted by everyone involved in the project, and thereby rejecting
   Duhemianism. You might therefore propose to follow reason alone, but be
   neither Troeltschian nor Duhemian. Suppose we use the term Spinozistic
   HBC' [489] to denote this last variety of HBC. The Spinozist concurs
   with the Troeltschian and Duhemian that no theological assumptions or
   beliefs are to be employed in HBC. She differs from the Troeltschian in
   paying the same compliment to Troeltsch's principles: they too are not
   deliverances of reason and hence are not to be employed in HBC. And she
   differs from the Duhemian in holding that there are some deliverances
   of reason not accepted by all who are party to the project of scripture
   scholarship; hence she proposes to employ some propositions or beliefs
   rejected by the Duhemian.

   A final point: It is clearly inaccurate to suppose that every scripture
   scholar falls neatly into one or another of these four categories. Not
   every work of scripture scholarship is either a clear example of
   traditional biblical commentary or else a clear example of HBC. Not
   every work of HBC is a clear example of just one of Troeltschian,
   Duhemian, or Spinozistic HBC. There are all sorts of halfway houses,
   lots of haltings between two opinions, many who fall partly into one
   and partly into another, and many who have never clearly seen that
   there are these categories. A real live scripture scholar is unlikely
   to have spent a great deal of thought on the epistemological
   foundations of the discipline and is likely to straddle one or more of
   the categories I mention.

   [486] Of course this proposal must be qualified, nuanced,
   sophisticated. It makes perfect sense for me to continue to work on a
   hypothesis after others have decided it is a dead end; science has
   often benefited from such disagreements. But in these cases there is
   ordinarily a deeper agreement as to what the aims of science are, what
   counts as genuine science, and what the proper methods to be employed
   might be. Furthermore, the disputes can often be settled on the basis
   of this deeper agreement; it is possible for one of the disputants to
   turn out to be right in a way that is recognized by all the disputants.

   [487] It may be difficult to specify the relevant community. Suppose I
   am a scripture scholar at a denominational seminary: what is my
   relevant community? Scripture scholars of any sort, all over the world?
   Scripture scholars in my own denomination? In Western academia? The
   people, academics or not, in my denomination? Christians generally? The
   first thing to see here is that our scripture scholar clearly belongs
   to many different communities and may accordingly be involved in
   several different scholarly projects.

    B. Tensions with Traditional Christianity

   There has been a history of substantial tension between HBC and
   traditional Christians. Thus David Strauss in 1835: "Nay, if we would
   be candid with ourselves, that which was once sacred history for the
   Christian believer is, for the enlightened portion of our
   contemporaries, only fable." Of course the unenlightened faithful were
   not so unenlightened that they failed to notice this feature of
   biblical criticism. Writing ten years after the publication of
   Strauss's book, William Pringle complains, "In Germany, Biblical
   criticism is almost a national pursuit. . . . Unhappily, [the critics]
   were but too frequently employed in maintaining the most dangerous
   errors, in opposing every inspired statement which the mind of man is
   unable fully to comprehend, in divesting religion of its spiritual and
   heavenly character, and in undermining the whole fabric of revealed
   truth." [490]

   Perhaps among Pringle's complaints were the following. First,
   practitioners of HBC tend to treat the Bible as a set of separate books
   rather than a unified communication from God. Thus they tend to reject
   the idea that Old Testament passages can be properly understood as
   making reference to Jesus Christ or to events in his life: "Critical
   scholars rule out clairvoyance as an explanation axiomatically. Instead
   of holding that the Old Testament predicts events in the life of Jesus,
   critical scholars of the New Testament say that each Gospel writer
   sought to exploit Old Testament passages in order to bolster his case
   for the messianic and dominical claims of Jesus or of the church on his
   behalf." [491] More generally, Brevard Childs: "For many decades the
   usual way of initiating entering students in the Bible was slowly to
   dismantle the church's traditional teachings regarding scripture by
   applying the acids of criticism." [492]

   Second, following Ernst Troeltsch, HBC tends to discount miracle
   stories, taking it as axiomatic that miracles don't and didn't really
   happen or, at any rate, claiming that the proper method for HBC can't
   admit miracles as either evidence or conclusions. Perhaps Jesus
   effected cures of some psychosomatic disorders, but nothing that modern
   medical science can't explain. Many employing this method propose that
   Jesus never thought of himself as divine, or as the (or a) Messiah, or
   as capable of forgiving sin [493] --let alone as having died and then
   risen from the dead. "The Historical Jesus researchers," says Luke
   Timothy Johnson, "insist that the real Jesus' must be found in the
   facts of his life before his death. The resurrection is, when
   considered at all, seen in terms of visionary experience, or as a
   continuation of an empowerment' that began before Jesus' death. Whether
   made explicit or not, the operative premise is that there is no real
   Jesus' after his death." [494]

   Those who follow these methods sometimes produce quite remarkable
   accounts--and accounts remarkably different from traditional Christian
   understanding. According to Barbara Thiering's Jesus and the Riddle of
   the Dead Sea Scrolls, [495] for example, Jesus was buried in a cave; he
   didn't actually die and was revived by the magician Simon Magus,
   whereupon he married Mary Magdalene, settled down, fathered three
   children, was divorced, and finally died in Rome. According to Morton
   Smith, Jesus was a practicing homosexual and conjurer. [496] According
   to German scripture scholar Gerd LÃ¼demann: the resurrection is "an
   empty formula that must be rejected by anyone holding a scientific
   world view." [497] G. A. Wells goes so far as to claim that our name
   Jesus', as it turns up in the Bible, is empty; like Santa Claus', it
   doesn't trace back to or denote anyone at all. [498] John Allegro
   apparently thinks there was no such person as Jesus of Nazareth;
   Christianity began as a hoax designed to fool the Romans and preserve
   the cult of a certain hallucinogenic mushroom (Amanita muscaria).
   Still, the name Christ' isn't empty: it is really a name of that
   mushroom. [499] As engaging a claim as any is that Jesus, while neither
   merely legendary, nor actually a mushroom, was, in fact, an atheist,
   the first Christian atheist. [500] And even if we set aside the lunatic
   fringe, Van Harvey is correct: "So far as the biblical historian is
   concerned . . . there is scarcely a popularly held traditional belief
   about Jesus that is not regarded with considerable skepticism." [501]

   part of a human author for a passage from a given time to refer to
   something that happens much later. All that is required is God's

   [463] To understand historical criticism and its dominance properly,
   says David Yeago, one must understand "the historic coupling of
   historical criticism with a project of the Enlightenment' aimed at
   liberating mind and heart from the shackles of ecclesiastical
   tradition. In the modern context, claims to Enlightenment' must be
   backed up with the claim to have achieved a proper method, capable of
   producing real knowledge to replace the pre-critical confusion and
   arbitrariness of tradition" ("The New Testament and the Nicene Dogma,"

   [466] Nor can you employ a proposition which is such that the warrant
   it has for you comes from some proposition you know or believe by
   faith; we might put this by saying that in doing science you can't
   employ any proposition whose epistemic provenance, for you, includes a
   proposition you know or believe by faith. But is this really true? Why
   should we believe it? What is the status of the claim that if what you
   are doing is science, then you can't employ, in your work, any
   proposition you believe or know by faith? Is it supposed to be true by
   definition? If so, whose definition? Is there a good argument for it?
   Or what? See my "Methodological Naturalism?" in Facets of Faith and
   Science, ed. J. van der Meer (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America,
   1995).

   [467] Thus Benjamin Jowett (the nineteenth-century master of Balliol
   College and eminent translator of Plato): "Scripture has one
   meaning--the meaning which it had to the mind of the prophet or
   evangelist who first uttered or wrote, to the hearers or readers who
   first received it" ("On the Interpretation of Scripture," in The
   Interpretation of Scripture and Other Essays [London: George Routledge,
   1906], p. 36; quoted in Jon D. Levenson, The Hebrew Bible, the Old
   Testament, and Historical Criticism [Louisville, Ky.: Westminster/John
   Knox Press, 1993], p. 78). Jowett was not a paragon of intellectual
   modesty, which may explain a poem composed and circulated by
   undergraduates at Balliol:

   First come I, my name is Jowett.

   There's no knowledge but I know it.

   I am the master of the college.

   the historian as such cannot properly employ what he knows by faith. In
   personal communication he informs me that, in his opinion, history is
   by its nature limited in this way. Proper biblical scholarship,
   however, is not; hence the sort of project in which one brackets what
   one knows by faith is not epistemically superior but, in fact,
   epistemically inferior to biblical scholarship informed by faith. His
   view, therefore, resembles the one outlined below, pp. 401ff.

   [472] I don't mean to suggest that the traditional biblical commentator
   cannot also investigate these questions; if she does, however, it will
   be in the ultimate service of an effort to discern what the Lord is
   teaching in the passages in question.
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV. Why Aren't Most Christians More Concerned?

   So HBC has not in general been sympathetic to traditional Christian
   belief; it has hardly been an encouragement to the faithful. The
   faithful, however, seem relatively unconcerned; they find traditional
   biblical commentary of great interest and importance, but the beliefs
   and attitudes of HBC have not seemed to filter down to them, despite
   its dominance in mainline seminaries. According to Van Harvey, "Despite
   decades of research, the average person tends to think of the life of
   Jesus in much the same terms as Christians did three centuries ago."
   [502] Harvey finds this puzzling: "Why is it that, in a culture so
   dominated by experts in every field, the opinion of New Testament
   historians has had so little influence on the public?" [503] Are
   traditional Christians just ignoring inconvenient evidence? In what
   follows, I'll try to answer these questions. Obviously HBC has
   contributed greatly to our knowledge of the Bible, in particular the
   circumstances and conditions of its composition; it has given us new
   alternatives as to how to understand the human authors, and this has
   also given us new ideas about how to understand the divine Author.
   Nevertheless, there are in fact excellent reasons for tending to ignore
   that "considerable skepticism" of which Harvey speaks. I don't mean to
   claim that the ordinary person in the pew ignores it because she has
   these reasons clearly in mind; no doubt she doesn't. I say only that
   these reasons are good reasons for a traditional Christian to ignore
   the deflationary results of HBC.

   What might these reasons be? Well, one reason might be that skeptical
   scripture scholars display vast disagreement among themselves. [504]
   There is also the fact that quite a number of the arguments they
   propose seem at best wholly inconclusive. [505] Perhaps the endemic
   vice or at any rate the perennial temptation of HBC is what we might
   call "the fallacy of creeping certitude," which is committed by those
   who ignore the principle of dwindling probabilities. To practice this
   fallacy, you note that some proposition A is probable (to .9, say) with
   respect to your background knowledge k; you therefore annex A to k.
   Then you note that a proposition B is probable with respect to k&A; you
   therefore add it too to k. Then you note that C is probable to .9 with
   respect to A&B&k, and also annex it to k; similarly for (say) D, E, F,
   and G. You then pronounce A&B&C&D&E&F&G highly probable with respect to
   k, our evidence or background information. But the fact is (as we learn
   from the probability calculus) that these probabilities must be
   multiplied: so that in fact the probability of A&B&C&D&E&F&G is .9 to
   the seventh power, that is, less than .5! [506]

   Suppose we look into reasons or arguments for preferring the results of
   HBC to those of traditional commentary. Why should we suppose that the
   former take us closer to the truth than the latter? Troeltsch's
   principles are particularly important here. As understood in the
   interpretative community of HBC, they preclude special divine action,
   including special divine inspiration of Scripture and the occurrence of
   miracles. As Gilkey says, "Suddenly a vast panoply of divine deeds and
   events recorded in scripture are no longer regarded as having actually
   happened." Many academic theologians and scripture scholars appear to
   believe that Troeltschian HBC is de rigueur; it is often regarded as
   the only intellectually respectable variety of scripture scholarship,
   or the only variety that has any claim to the mantle of science. (And
   many who arrive at relatively traditional conclusions in scripture
   scholarship nevertheless pay at least lip service to the Troeltschian
   ideal, somehow feeling in a semiconfused way that this is the
   epistemically respectable or privileged way of proceeding.) Still, why
   think scripture scholarship should proceed in this specific way--as
   opposed both to traditional biblical commentary and varieties of HBC
   that do not accept Troeltsch's principles? Are there any reasons or
   arguments for those principles?
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Force Majeure

   If so, they are extraordinarily well hidden. One common suggestion,
   however, seems to be a sort of appeal to force majeure: we simply can't
   help it. Given our historical position, there is nothing else we can
   do; we are all in the grip of historical forces beyond our control
   (this thing is bigger than either one of us). This reaction is typified
   by those who (like Harvey, Macquarrie, and Gilkey) claim that nowadays,
   given our cultural situation, we just don't have any options. There are
   potent historical forces that impose these ways of thinking on us; like
   it or not, we are blown about by these powerful winds of doctrine; we
   can't help ourselves. "The causal nexus in space and time which the
   Enlightenment science and philosophy introduced into the Western mind .
   . . is also assumed by modern theologians and scholars; since they
   participate in the modern world of science both intellectually and
   existentially, they can scarcely do anything else," says Gilkey (above,
   p. 394); another example is Bultmann's famous remark to the effect that
   "it is impossible to use electrical light and the wireless and to avail
   ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same
   time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles."
   [507]

   But isn't this view--that we are all compelled by contemporary
   historical forces to hold the sort of view in question--historically
   naive? First, why think we proceed together in lockstep through
   history, all at any given time perforce holding the same views and
   making the same assumptions? Clearly we don't do any such thing. The
   contemporary intellectual world is much more like a horse race (or
   perhaps a demolition derby) than a triumphal procession, [508] more
   like a battleground than a Democratic party fund-raiser, where everyone
   can be counted on to support the same slate. At present, for example,
   there are many like Macquarrie, Harvey, and Gilkey who accept the
   semideistic view that God (if there is any such person) couldn't or
   wouldn't act miraculously in history. Of course this is not the view of
   nearly everyone at present; hundreds of millions would reject it. Far
   more people reject this view than accept it. (So even if Gilkey and the
   others were right about the inevitable dance of history, they would be
   wrong in their elitist notion to the effect that what they do is the
   current step.)

   The utter obviousness of this fact suggests a second interpretation of
   this particular justification of Troeltschian HBC. Perhaps what the
   apologists really mean is not that everyone nowadays accepts this
   semideism (that is trivially false); it's rather that everyone in the
   know does. Everyone who is properly educated and has read his Kant and
   Hume (and Troeltsch) and reflected on the meaning of the wireless and
   electric light knows these things; as for the rest of humanity
   (including, I suppose, those of us who have read our Kant and Hume but
   are unimpressed), their problem is simple ignorance. Perhaps people
   generally don't march lockstep through history; still, those in the
   know do; and right now they all or nearly all reject special divine
   action.

   Even if we chauvinistically stick to educated Westerners, this is still
   doubtful in excelsis. "The traditional conception of miracle,"
   Macquarrie says, "is irreconcilable with our modern understanding of
   both science and history": to whom does this our', here, refer? To
   those who have gone to university, are well-educated, know at least a
   little science, and have thought about the bearing of these matters on
   the possibility of miracles? If so, the claim is once more whoppingly
   false. Very many well-educated people (including even some theologians)
   understand science and history in a way that is entirely compatible
   both with the possibility and with the actuality of miracles. Many
   physicists and engineers, for example, understand "electrical light and
   the wireless" vastly better than Bultmann or his contemporary
   followers, but nonetheless hold precisely those New Testament beliefs
   Bultmann thinks incompatible with using electric lights and radios.
   There are large numbers of educated contemporaries (including even some
   with Ph.D's!) who believe Jesus really and literally arose from the
   dead, that God performs miracles in the contemporary world, and even
   that there are both demons and spirits who are active in the
   contemporary world. As a matter of historical fact, there are any
   number of contemporaries, and contemporary intellectuals very well
   acquainted with science, who don't feel any problem at all in pursuing
   science and also believing in miracles, angels, Christ's resurrection,
   the lot.

   Once more, however, Macquarrie and the others must know this as well as
   anyone else; so what do he and his friends really mean? How can they
   make these claims about what we' [509] --we who use the products of
   science and know a bit about it--can and can't believe? How can they
   blithely exclude or ignore the thousands, indeed, millions of
   contemporary Christians who don't think as they do? The answer must be
   that they think those Christians somehow don't count. What they really
   mean to say, I fear, is that they and their friends think this way, and
   anyone who demurs is so ignorant as to be properly ignored. But that's
   at best a bit slim as a reason for accepting the Troeltschian view; it
   is more like a nasty little piece of arrogance. Nor is it any better
   for being tucked away in the suggestion that somehow we just can't help
   ourselves. Of course it is possible that Gilkey and his friends can't
   help themselves; in that case, they can hardly be blamed for accepting
   the view in question. [510] This incapacity on their parts, however, is
   no recommendation of Troeltsch's principles.

   So this is at best a poor reason for thinking serious biblical
   scholarship must be Troeltschian. Is there a better reason? A second
   suggestion, perhaps connected with the plea of inability to do
   otherwise, is given by the idea that the very practice of science
   presupposes rejection of the idea of miracle or special divine action
   in the world. "Science proceeds on the assumption that whatever events
   occur in the world can be accounted for in terms of other events that
   also belong within the world," says Macquarrie; perhaps he means to
   suggest that the very practice of science requires that one reject the
   idea (e.g.) of God's raising someone from the dead. Of course the
   argument form

   If X were true, it would be inconvenient for science; therefore, X is
   false

   is at best moderately compelling. We aren't just given that the Lord
   has arranged the universe for the comfort and convenience of the
   National Academy of Science. To think otherwise is to be like the drunk
   who insisted on looking for his lost car keys under the streetlight, on
   the grounds that the light was better there. (In fact it would go the
   drunk one better: it would be to insist that because the keys would be
   hard to find in the dark, they must be under the light.)

   But why think in the first place that we would have to embrace this
   semideism in order to do science? [511] Many contemporary physicists,
   for example, believe that Jesus was raised from the dead; this belief
   seems to do little damage to their physics. To be sure, that's physics;
   perhaps the problem would be (as Bultmann suggests) with medicine. Is
   the idea that one couldn't do medical research or prescribe medications
   if one thought that God has done miracles in the past and might even
   occasionally do some nowadays? To put the suggestion explicitly is to
   refute it; there isn't the faintest reason why I couldn't sensibly
   believe that God raised Jesus from the dead and also engage in medical
   research into, say, Usher Syndrome or multiple sclerosis, or into ways
   of staving off the ravages of coronary disease. What would be the
   problem? That it is always possible that God should do something
   different, thus spoiling my experiment? But that is possible: God is
   omnipotent. (Or do we have here a new antitheistic argument? If God
   exists, he could spoil my experiment; nothing can spoil my experiment;
   therefore. . . .) No doubt if I thought God often or usually did things
   in an idiosyncratic way, so that there really aren't much by way
   discoverable regularities to be found, then perhaps I couldn't sensibly
   engage in scientific research; the latter presupposes a certain
   regularity, predictability, stability in the world. But that is an
   entirely different matter. What I must assume to do science, is only
   that ordinarily and for the most part these regularities hold. [512]
   This reason, too, then, is monumentally insufficient as a reason for
   holding that we are somehow obliged to accept the principles underlying
   Troeltschian biblical scholarship.

   It is therefore difficult to see any reason for supposing that
   Troeltschian scripture scholarship is somehow de rigueur or somehow
   forced on us by our history.

   [510] Some, however, might see here little more than an effort to gain
   standing and respectability in a largely secular academia by adopting a
   stance that is, so to say, more Catholic than the pope.

   [511] Here I can be brief; William Alston has already proposed a
   compelling argument for the claim I support--namely, that one can
   perfectly well do science even if one thinks God has done and even
   sometimes still does miracles. See his "Divine Action: Shadow or

    B. A Moral Imperative?

   Van Harvey proposes another reason for pursuing Troeltschian
   scholarship and preferring it to traditional biblical commentary; [513]
   his reason is broadly moral or ethical. He begins [514] by referring to
   a fascinating episode in Victorian intellectual history [515] in which
   certain Victorian intellectuals found themselves wrestling with a
   problem of intellectual integrity. As Harvey sees it, they "believed
   that it was morally reprehensible to insist that these claims
   [Christian claims about the activities and teachings of Jesus] were
   true on faith while at the same time arguing that they were also the
   legitimate objects of historical inquiry" (NTS, 195). Now I think this
   is a tendentious account of the problem these intellectuals
   faced--tendentious, because it makes it look as if these intellectuals
   were endorsing, with unerring prescience, precisely the position Harvey
   himself proposes to argue for. The fact is, I think, their position was
   both less idiosyncratic and far more plausible. After all, why should
   anyone think it was immoral to believe by faith what could also be
   investigated by other sources of belief or knowledge? I am curious
   about your whereabouts last Friday night: were you perhaps at the
   Linebacker's Bar? Perhaps I could find out in three different ways: by
   asking you, by asking your wife, and by examining the bar for your
   fingerprints (fortunately, the bar is never washed.) Would there be
   something immoral in using one of these methods when, in fact, the
   others were available? That's not easy to believe.

   It wasn't just that that troubled the Victorians. Had they been
   confident that both faith and historical investigation were reliable
   avenues to the truths in question, they surely wouldn't have thought it
   immoral to believe on the basis of one of these as opposed to the other
   or both. Their problem was deeper. They were troubled (among other
   things) by the German scripture scholarship, about which they knew
   relatively little; still, they did know enough to think (rightly or
   wrongly) that it posed a real threat to the Christian beliefs that for
   many of them were, in any event, already shaky. They suspected or
   feared that this scripture scholarship could show or would show or
   already had shown that essential elements of the Christian faith were
   just false. They were also troubled by what many saw as the
   antisupernaturalistic and antitheistic bent of science: could one
   really believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles in
   the era of the steam engine and ocean liner? They were troubled by the
   advent of Darwinism, which seemed to many to contradict the Christian
   picture of human origins. They were convinced, following Locke and the
   whole classical foundationalist tradition, that the right way to hold
   beliefs on these topics is by following the (propositional) evidence
   wherever it leads; and they were deeply worried about where this
   evidence was, in fact, leading. They were troubled, in short, by a
   variety of factors, all of which seemed to suggest that traditional
   Christian belief was really no more than a beautiful story: inspiring,
   uplifting, perhaps necessary to public morality, but just a story.
   Given our scientific coming of age, they feared, informed people would
   regretfully have to jettison traditional Christian belief, perhaps
   (especially on ceremonial occasions) with an occasional nostalgic
   backward look.

   On the other hand, many of them also longed for the comfort and
   security of serious Christian belief; to lose it was like being thrown
   out of our Father's house into a hostile or indifferent world. And of
   course many of the Victorians had strong moral opinions and a highly
   developed moral sense. They thought it weak, spineless, cowardly to
   refuse to face these specters, to hide them from oneself, to engage in
   self-deception and double-think. All this, they thought, is unworthy of
   a serious and upright person. They abhorred the weakness and moral
   softness of the sort of stance in which you suspect the bitter truth,
   but refuse to investigate the matter, preferring to hide the truth from
   yourself, perhaps hoping it will somehow go away. Many of them thought
   this was precisely what some of the clergy and other educators were
   doing, and despised them for it. Far better to face the sad truth with
   intellectual honesty, manly courage, and a stiff upper lip. So it
   wasn't just that they thought it reprehensible to believe on faith what
   can also be addressed by reason or historical investigation. It was
   rather that they suspected and deeply feared that the latter (together
   with the other factors I mentioned) would undermine the former. And
   they scorned and detested a sort of willful head-in-the-sand attitude
   in which, out of timidity or fear or a desire for comfort, one refuses
   to face the facts. Reasons such as these account for the moral fervor
   (indeed, stridency) of W. K. Clifford's oft-anthologized "The Ethics of
   Belief." [516]

   However things may have stood with the Victorians, Harvey proposes the
   following bit of moral dogma:

   The gulf separating the conservative Christian believer and the New
   Testament scholar can be seen as the conflict between two antithetical
   ethics of belief. . . . New Testament scholarship is now so specialized
   and requires so much preparation that the layperson has simply been
   disqualified from having any right to a judgment regarding the truth or
   falsity of certain historical claims. Insofar as the conservative
   Christian believer is a layperson who has no knowledge of the New
   Testament scholarship, he or she is simply not entitled to certain
   historical beliefs at all. Just as the average layperson is scarcely in
   a position to have an informed judgment about the seventh letter of
   Plato, the relationship of Montezuma to Cortez, or the authorship of
   the Donation of Constantine, so the average layperson has no right to
   an opinion about the authorship of the Fourth Gospel or the
   trustworthiness of the synoptics. (NTS, p. 197)

   "The layperson has simply been disqualified from having any right to a
   judgment regarding the truth or falsity of certain historical claims":
   strong words! In an earlier age, priests and ministers, often the only
   educated members of their congregations, would exercise a certain
   intellectual and spiritual leadership, hoping the flock would come to
   see, appreciate, and believe the truth. On Harvey's showing, the flock
   doesn't so much as have a right to an opinion on these points--not even
   an opinion purveyed by the experts! Harvey complains (p. 193) that many
   students seem unreceptive to the results of scripture scholarship. If
   he's right, however, the students don't have a right to believe the
   results of scripture scholarship; they are therefore doing no more than
   their simple duty in refusing to believe them. One hopes Harvey
   remembers, when teaching his classes, not to put his views on these
   matters in an attractive and winsome fashion; after all, if he did so,
   some of the students might believe them, in which case they would be
   sinning and he himself would be giving offense in the Pauline sense
   (Romans 14, not to mention 1 Corinthians 8:9).

   Suppose we sadly avert our gaze from this elitism run amok: why does
   Harvey think that only the historian has a right to hold an opinion on
   these matters? Clearly enough, because he thinks the only way to
   achieve accurate and reliable information on these matters is by way of
   Troeltschian scholarship. And that opinion, obviously, presupposes the
   philosophical and theological opinion that there isn't any other
   epistemic avenue to these matters; it presupposes that, for example,
   faith (and the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit) is not a source
   of warranted belief or knowledge on these topics. If the latter were a
   source of warranted belief, and if the "average layperson" had access
   to this source, then presumably there would be nothing whatever wrong
   with her holding views on these matters on this basis. "Just as the
   average layperson is scarcely in a position to have an informed
   judgment about the seventh letter of Plato, the relationship of
   Montezuma to Cortez, or the authorship of the Donation of Constantine,
   so the average layperson has no right to an opinion about the
   authorship of the Fourth Gospel or the trustworthiness of the
   synoptics," says Harvey. The only way to determine the truth about the
   seventh letter of Plato is by way of ordinary historical investigation;
   the same goes, Harvey assumes, for questions about the life and
   ministry of Christ, whether he rose from the dead, whether he thought
   of himself as a messiah, and the like. What lies at the bottom of this
   moral claim is really a philosophical-theological judgment: that
   traditional Christian belief is completely mistaken in taking it that
   faith is, in fact, a reliable source of true and warranted belief on
   these topics. [517]

   This view is not, of course, a result of historical scholarship,
   Troeltschian or otherwise; nor is it supported by arguments that will
   appeal to anyone who doesn't already agree with him--or, indeed, by any
   arguments at all. Harvey's view is rather a presupposition, a
   methodological prescription of the pursuit of Troeltschian historical
   criticism and proscription of traditional biblical commentary. So it
   can hardly be thought of as an independent good reason for preferring
   the former to the latter. What we have are different
   philosophical-theological positions that dictate different ways of
   pursuing scripture scholarship. A way to show that the one really is
   superior to the other would be to give a good argument either for the
   one philosophical-theological position or against the other. Harvey
   does neither, simply assuming (uncritically, and without so much as
   mentioning the fact) the one position and rejecting the other. He
   assumes there is no source of warrant or knowledge in addition to
   reason. This is not self-evident; millions, maybe billions of
   Christians and others reject it. Is it sensible, then, just to assume
   it, without so much as acknowledging this contrary opinion, without so
   much as a feeble gesture in the direction of argument or reason?

   was raised from the dead" (p. 242).
     __________________________________________________________________

    C. Historical Biblical Criticism More Inclusive?

   John Collins recognizes that Troeltschian scholarship involves
   theological assumptions not nearly universally shared. He doesn't argue
   for the truth of these assumptions, but recommends them on a quite
   different basis. Criticizing Brevard Childs's proposal for a canonical'
   approach to scripture scholarship, [518] he claims that the problem is
   that Childs's approach doesn't provide an inclusive context for the
   latter:

   If biblical theology is to retain a place in serious scholarship, it
   must be . . . conceived broadly enough to provide a context for debate
   between different viewpoints. Otherwise it is likely to become a
   sectarian reservation, of interest only to those who hold certain
   confessional tenets that are not shared by the discipline at large.
   Childs's dogmatic conception of the canon provides no basis for
   advancing dialogue. In my opinion historical criticism still provides
   the most satisfactory framework for discussion. [519]

   He adds that

   One criterion for the adequacy of presuppositions is the degree to
   which they allow dialogue between differing viewpoints and accommodate
   new insights. . . . Perhaps the outstanding achievement of historical
   criticism in this century is that it has provided a framework within
   which scholars of different prejudices and commitments have been able
   to debate in a constructive manner. [520]

   So why should we prefer Troeltschian scripture scholarship over
   traditional Bible commentary? Because it offers a wider context, one in
   which people with conflicting theological opinions can all take part.
   We may be conservative Christians, theological liberals, or people with
   no theological views whatever: we can all take part in Troeltschian
   scripture scholarship, provided we acquiesce in its fundamental
   assumptions. This is why it is to be preferred to the more traditional
   sort.

   Now this would perhaps be a reason for practicing Duhemian scripture
   scholarship, but of course Troeltschian scripture scholarship is not
   Duhemian: the principles on which it proceeds are not accepted by
   nearly everyone. They would be accepted by only a tiny minority of
   contemporary Christians, for example. And this shows a fundamental
   confusion, so it seems to me, in Collins's defense of Troeltschian
   scholarship. The defense he offers is appropriate for Duhemian
   scholarship; it isn't at all appropriate for Troeltschian scholarship.
   The principles of Troeltschian historical scholarship, so interpreted
   as to preclude miracle, direct divine action, and special divine
   inspiration of the Bible, are extremely controversial philosophical and
   theological assumptions. Those who do not accept these controversial
   assumptions will not be inclined to take part in Troeltschian HBC, just
   as those who don't accept traditional Christian philosophical and
   theological views will not be likely to engage in traditional biblical
   commentary. (If you don't think the Lord speaks in Scripture, you will
   be unlikely to spend a great deal of your time trying to figure out
   what it is he says there.) As Jon Levenson puts it, historical
   criticism "does not facilitate communication with those outside its
   boundaries: it requires fundamentalists, for example, to be born again
   as liberals--or to stay out of the conversation altogether." [521] He
   adds that "if inclusiveness is to be gauged quantitatively, then
   [Brevard] Childs would win the match hands down, for far more people
   with biblical interests share Christian faith than a thoroughgoing
   historicism. Were we historical critics to be classed as a religious
   body we should have to be judged a most minuscule sect indeed--and one
   with a pronounced difficulty relating to groups that do not accept our
   beliefs."

   identifies HBC with Troeltschian HBC.

   [504] This lack of accord is especially well documented by Stephen
   Evans, The Historical Christ and the Jesus of Faith, pp. 322ff.

   [505] For example, John Dominick Crosson argues that Jesus' body was
   eaten by dogs; hence he did not rise from the dead. What is the
   evidence for the proposition that his body was eaten by dogs? Just that
   this is what ordinarily happened to criminals executed by crucifixion.
   But then Crosson could have made a much briefer argument: Jesus didn't
   rise from the dead, because most people don't.

   [506] Eleonore Stump criticizes another very good illustration of this
   procedure in chapter 3, "Historical Biblical Studies: Practices," of
   her The Knowledge of Suffering (not yet published). In "Biblical
   Criticism and the Resurrection" (not yet published), William Alston
   suggests his own version of the fallacy of creeping certitude, and he
   also mentions the widespread use of the argument from silence, which,
   so to say, promotes the failure to assert p to the assertion of not-p.
   (For example, Thomas Sheehan says that according to Matthew, "He
   [Christ] does not ascend into heaven" [The First Coming, p. 97], giving
   as a reference Matthew 28:16-20. Matthew 28:16-20, however, does not
   say that Jesus did not ascend into heaven; it simply doesn't say that
   he did.) Stump and Alston argue (with great cogency, in my opinion)
   that a good bit of negative HBC doesn't satisfy ordinary canons of
   proper scholarship; I shall argue that even if the scholarship were
   impeccable, the epistemological assumptions I have been mentioning make
   the work of dubious relevance to traditional Christian belief.
     __________________________________________________________________

  V. Nothing to be Concerned About

   We are now prepared to return to Harvey's original question: why is it
   that the person in the pew pays little attention to contemporary HBC
   and, despite those decades of research, retains rather a traditional
   picture of the life and ministry of Jesus? As to why in actual
   historical fact this is the case, this is a job for an intellectual
   historian. What we have seen so far, however, is that there is no
   compelling or even reasonably decent argument for supposing that the
   procedures and assumptions of HBC are to be preferred to those of
   traditional biblical commentary. A little epistemological reflection
   enables us to see something further: the traditional Christian (whether
   in the pew or not) has good reason to reject the skeptical claims of
   HBC and continue to hold traditional Christian belief despite the
   allegedly corrosive acids of HBC.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Troeltschian Historical Biblical Criticism Again

   As we have seen, there are substantially three types of HBC. For
   present purposes, however, we can consider Duhemian and Spinozistic HBC
   together. Let's say, therefore, that we have both Troeltschian and
   non-Troeltschian HBC. Consider the first. The Troeltschian scripture
   scholar accepts Troeltsch's principles for historical research, under
   an interpretation according to which they rule out the occurrence of
   miracles and the divine inspiration of the Bible (along with the
   corollary that the latter enjoys the sort of unity accruing to a book
   that has one principal author). But then it is not at all surprising
   that the Troeltschian tends to come up with conclusions wildly at
   variance with those accepted by the traditional Christian. As Gilkey
   says, "Suddenly a vast panoply of divine deeds and events recorded in
   scripture are no longer regarded as having actually happened." Now if
   (instead of tendentious claims about our inability to do otherwise) the
   Troeltschian offered some good reasons to think that, in fact, these
   Troeltschian principles are true, then traditional Christians would
   have to pay attention; then they might be obliged to take the skeptical
   claims of historical critics seriously. Troeltschians, however,
   apparently don't offer any such good reasons. They simply declare that
   nowadays we can't think in any other way, or (following Harvey) that it
   is immoral to believe in, for example, Christ's resurrection on other
   than historical grounds.

   Neither of these is remotely persuasive as a reason for modifying
   traditional Christian belief in the light of Troeltschian results. As
   for the first, of course, the traditional Christian knows that it is
   quite false: she herself and many of her friends nowadays (and hundreds
   of millions of others) do think in precisely that proscribed way. And
   as far as the implicit claims for the superiority of these Troeltschian
   ways of thinking go, she won't be impressed by them unless some decent
   arguments of one sort or another are forthcoming, or some other good
   reason for adopting that opinion is presented. The mere claim that this
   is what many contemporary experts think will not and should not
   intimidate her. And the second proposed reason (Harvey's reason) seems
   to be itself dependent on the very claim at issue. Why does the critic
   think it immoral to form beliefs about historical facts on grounds
   other than historical research? Because he believes that the only
   reliable ground for beliefs of the former type is research of the
   latter type. Again, however, he offers no argument for this assumption,
   merely announcing it as what those in the know believe, and perhaps
   also adopting an air of injured puzzlement about the fact that people
   in the pews don't seem to pay much attention.

   To see the point here, consider an analogy: suppose your friend is
   accused and convicted of stealing an ancient and valuable Frisian vase
   from the museum in Franeker. As it happens, you remember clearly that
   at the time this vase was stolen, your friend was in your office,
   defending his eccentric views about the Gospel of John. You have
   testified to this in court, but to no avail. I come along and offer to
   do a really scientific investigation to see whether your view here is,
   in fact, correct. You are delighted, knowing as you think you do that
   your friend is innocent. When I explain my methods to you, however,
   your delight turns to dismay. I refuse to accept the testimony of
   memory; I propose to ignore completely the fact that you remember your
   friend's being in your office. Further, my method precludes from the
   start the conclusion that your friend is innocent, even if he is
   innocent. Could I blame you for losing interest in my scientific'
   investigation? I think the traditional Christian ought to view
   Troeltschian HBC with the same suspicion: it refuses to admit a source
   of warranted belief (faith and divine revelation, both of which the
   traditional Christian takes to be sources of warrant) the traditional
   Christian accepts, and it is precluded in advance from coming to such
   conclusions as that Jesus really did arise from the dead and really is
   the divine son of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    B. Non-Troeltschian Historical Biblical Criticism

   Troeltschian HBC, therefore, has no claim on serious Christians; it is
   wholly reasonable for them to form and maintain their beliefs quite
   independently of it. How about non-Troeltschian (Duhemian and
   Spinozistic) HBC? This is a very different kettle of fish. The
   non-Troeltschian proposes to employ only assumptions that are clearly
   deliverances of reason (or accepted by everyone party to the project).
   She doesn't (for purposes of scholarship) accept the traditional
   Christian's views about the Bible or the life of Christ, but she also
   doesn't accept Troeltsch's principles. She doesn't assume that miracles
   did or could happen; but that is quite different from assuming that
   they didn't or couldn't, and she doesn't assume that either. She
   doesn't assume that the Bible is, in fact, a word from the Lord and
   hence authoritative and reliable; but she also doesn't assume that it
   isn't.

   Of course that may not leave her a lot to go on. The non-Troeltschian
   is handicapped in this area in a way in which she isn't in such areas
   as physics or chemistry. In the latter (apart, perhaps, from a bit of
   controversy about the anthropic principle and the principle of
   indifference [522] ), there is little by way of theological controversy
   that seems relevant to the pursuit of the subject. Not so for scripture
   scholarship; here the very foundations of the subject are deeply
   disputed. Does the Bible have one principal author, namely God himself?
   If not, then perhaps Jowett ("Scripture has one meaning--the meaning
   which it had to the mind of the prophet or evangelist who first uttered
   or wrote, to the hearers or readers who first received it") is right;
   otherwise, he is wrong. [523] Is it divinely inspired, so that what it
   teaches is both true and to be accepted? If it reports miraculous
   happenings--risings from the dead, a virgin birth, the changing of
   water into wine, healings of people blind or lame from birth--are these
   to be taken more or less at face value, or dismissed as contrary to
   "what we now know"? Is there an entry into the truth about these
   matters--faith or divine testimony by way of Scripture, for
   example--quite different from ordinary historical investigation? If we
   prescind from all these matters and proceed responsibly (remembering to
   pay attention to the law of dwindling probabilities), what we come up
   with is likely to be pretty slender.

   A. E. Harvey, for example, proposes the following as beyond reasonable
   doubt from everyone's point of view (i.e., Duhemianly): "that Jesus was
   known in both Galilee and Jerusalem, that he was a teacher, that he
   carried out cures of various illnesses, particularly demon-possession
   and that these were widely regarded as miraculous; that he was involved
   in controversy with fellow Jews over questions of the law of Moses: and
   that he was crucified in the governorship of Pontius Pilate." [524] It
   isn't even clear whether Harvey means that the conjunction of these
   propositions is beyond reasonable doubt, or only each of the conjuncts;
   [525] in either case what we have is pretty slim.

   Or consider John Meier's monumental A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the
   Historical Jesus. (The first volume has 484 pages; the second has 1,055
   pages; a third volume is expected soon.) Meier aims to be Duhemian, or
   anyway Spinozistic: "My method follows a simple rule: it prescinds from
   what Christian faith or later Church teaching says about Jesus, without
   either affirming or denying such claims" (p. 1). (I think he also means
   to eschew assumptions incompatible with traditional Christian belief.)
   Meier's fantasy of "an unpapal conclave" of Jewish, Catholic,
   Protestant, and agnostic scholars, locked in the basement of the
   Harvard Divinity School library until they come to consensus on what
   historical methods can show about the life and mission of Jesus, is
   thoroughly Duhemian. This conclave he says, would yield "a rough draft
   of what that will-o'-the-wisp all reasonable people' could say about
   the historical Jesus" (p. 2). Meier sets out, judiciously, objectively,
   carefully, to establish that consensus. [526] What is striking about
   his conclusions, however, is how slender they are, and how
   tentative--and this despite the fact that, on occasion, he cannot
   himself resist building towers of probability. About all that emerges
   from Meier's painstaking work is that Jesus was a prophet, a proclaimer
   of an eschatological message from God, someone who performed powerful
   deeds, signs, and wonders that announce God's kingdom and also ratify
   his message. [527] As Duhemian or Spinozist, of course, we can't add
   that these signs and miracles involve special or direct divine action;
   nor can we say that they don't. We can't say that Jesus rose from the
   dead, or that he did not; we can't conclude that Scripture is specially
   inspired, or that it isn't.

   Now what is characteristic of non-Troeltschian HBC is just that it
   doesn't involve those Troeltschian principles: but it also rejects any
   alleged source of warranted belief in addition to reason (Spinozistic)
   and any theological assumptions not shared by everyone party to the
   discussion. [528] Traditional Christians, rightly or wrongly, think
   they do have sources of warranted belief in addition to reason: divine
   testimony in Scripture and also faith and the work of the Holy Spirit,
   or testimony of the Spirit-led church. They may be mistaken about that;
   but until someone gives a decent argument for the conclusion that they
   are mistaken, they need not be impressed by the result of scholarship
   that ignores this further source of belief. If you want to learn the
   truth about a given area, you shouldn't restrict yourself to only some
   of the sources of warranted belief (as does the Spinozist) or only to
   beliefs accepted by everyone else (with the Duhemian); maybe you know
   something some of the others don't. Perhaps you remember that your
   friend was in your office expostulating about the errors of
   postmodernism at the very time he is supposed to have been stealing
   that Frisian vase; if no one else was there, then you know something
   the rest don't.

   So the traditional Christian needn't be fazed by the fact that
   non-Troeltschian HBC doesn't support his views about what Jesus did and
   said. He thinks he knows some things by faith and the IIHS--that Jesus
   arose from the dead, for example. He may concede that if you leave out
   of account all that he knows in this way, then with respect to the
   remaining body of knowledge or belief the resurrection isn't
   particularly probable. Still, that hardly presents him with an
   intellectual or spiritual crisis. We can imagine a renegade group of
   whimsical physicists proposing to reconstruct physics by refusing to
   use belief that comes from memory, say, or perhaps memory of anything
   more than one minute ago. Perhaps something could be done along these
   lines, but it would be a poor, paltry, truncated, trifling thing. And
   now suppose that, say, Newton's laws or special relativity turned out
   to be dubious and unconfirmed from this point of view: that would
   presumably give little pause to more traditional physicists. This
   truncated physics could hardly call into question physics of the fuller
   variety.

   Similarly here. The traditional Christian thinks he knows by faith that
   Jesus was divine and that he rose from the dead. Hence, he will be
   unmoved by the fact that these truths are not especially probable on
   the evidence to which non-Troeltschian HBC limits itself--that is,
   evidence that explicitly excludes what one knows by faith. Why should
   that matter to him? So this is the rest of the answer to Harvey's
   question: if the HBC in question is non-Troeltschian, then the fact
   that it doesn't verify traditional Christian beliefs is due to its
   limiting itself in the way it does, to its refusing to use all the data
   or evidence the Christian thinks he has in his possession. For a
   Christian to confine himself to the results of non-Troeltschian HBC
   would be a little like trying to mow your lawn with a nail scissors or
   paint your house with a toothbrush; it might be an interesting
   experiment if you have time on your hands, but otherwise why limit
   yourself in this way?

   As we saw above (pp. 388-89) E. P. Sanders, Barnabas Lindars, Jon
   Levenson, and many others all declare that what one knows by faith or
   theological assumptions not endorsed by all should play no role in
   proper scripture scholarship; and perhaps we can think of this as a
   sort of unspecific endorsement of Duhemian scholarship. Why should they
   play no role? We must rely only on "evidence on which everyone can
   agree," says Sanders. "The arguments offered must be historically
   valid, able, that is, to compel the assent of historians whatever their
   religion or lack thereof, whatever their backgrounds, spiritual
   experiences, or personal beliefs, and without privileging any claim of
   revelation," says Levenson. "It is not open to a scholar to decide
   that, just because he is a believing Christian, he will accept all the
   Gospel miracles at their face value, but at the same time he will
   repudiate miracles attributed to Isis. All such accounts have to be
   scrutinized with equal detachment," says Lindars. Construed as
   endorsement of non-Troeltschian HBC, the claim here, I think, is that
   only such scholarship is properly objective.

   Is this true, and is objectivity required or desirable in this
   enterprise? Here we must go back to a distinction outlined in chapter
   1. Objectivity can be thought of as a matter of being oriented toward
   or paying attention to the object of knowledge or opinion, as opposed
   to the subject; what is objective may be thought of as coming from the
   object rather than from myself as subject. It is thus an objective fact
   that Amsterdam is larger than Aberdeen. But the term is also used to
   denote an opinion that is shared by nearly everyone; it is then
   contrasted with subjective', taken as in the phrase, "Well, that's only
   my subjective opinion." My own subjective opinions are the ones that
   are peculiar to me (and perhaps my friends). In which of these senses
   is it claimed that non-Troeltschian scholarship is objective? In the
   second, clearly enough; everyone will accept (with the Duhemian) those
   assumptions no one party to the project rejects; and presumably nearly
   everyone will accept the deliverances of reason. Of course it is far
   from obvious that if you want to learn the truth about a given area,
   the reasonable thing to do is to employ only assumptions accepted by
   everyone party to the dispute. Maybe you know something some of the
   others don't.

   More generally, then, HBC is either Troeltschian or non-Troeltschian.
   If the former, then it begins from assumptions entailing that much of
   what the traditional Christian believes is false; it comes as no
   surprise, then, that its conclusions are at odds with traditional
   belief. It is also of little direct concern to the classical Christian.
   It offers her no reason at all for rejecting or modifying her beliefs;
   it also offers little promise of enabling her to achieve better or
   deeper insight into what actually happened. As for non-Troeltschian
   HBC, however, this variety of historical criticism omits a great deal
   of what she sees as relevant evidence and relevant considerations. It
   is therefore left with little to go on. Again, the fact that it fails
   to support traditional belief need not be upsetting to the traditional
   believer; given those limitations, that is only to be expected, and it
   casts no doubt at all on Christian belief. Either way, therefore, the
   traditional Christian can rest easy with the claims of HBC; she need
   feel no obligation, intellectual or otherwise, to modify her belief in
   the light of its claims and alleged results. [529]

   [525] It could be that each of the conjuncts is beyond reasonable doubt
   but that their conjunction is not. Suppose (just to arbitrarily choose
   a number) what is probable to degree .95 or higher is beyond reasonable
   doubt. Then if each of the above is beyond reasonable doubt, their
   conjunction might still be little more than twice as probable as its
   denial.

   Timothy Johnson, The Real Jesus, p. 128).

   [527] Johnson, The Real Jesus, pp. 130-31.

   [528] Of course one might in fact accept those additional sources of
   warranted belief, but be interested in seeing just how much can be
   argued from a strictly Duhemian or Spinozistic point of view; to pursue
   a Duhemian or Spinozistic project is not necessarily to believe that
   there are no such additional sources. It is only to bracket them for
   the project in question.

   [529] Alleged results: because of the enormous controversy and
   disagreement among followers of HBC, it is very difficult to find
   anything one could sensibly call results' of this scholarship. Thus
   Harold Attridge (in "Calling Jesus Christ," in Hermes and Athena, ed.
   Eleonore Stump and Thomas Flint [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame
   Press, 1993], p. 211): There remains enormous diversity among those who
   attempt to describe what Jesus really did, taught, and thought about
   himself. For some contemporary scholars he was a Hellenistic magician;
   for others, a Galilean charismatic or rabbi; for yet others, a
   prophetic reformer; for others, a sly teller of wry and engaging tales;
   for some he had grandiose ideas; for others he eschewed them. In
   general, the inquirer finds the Jesus that her historical method allows
   her to see. It is as true today as it was at the end of the liberal
   quest for the historical Jesus catalogued by Albert Schweitzer that we
   moderns tend to make Jesus in our own image and likeness. The
   Schweitzer reference is to his Von Reimarus zu Wrede (1906), tr. W.
   Montgomery as The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of
   Its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede (New York: Macmillan, 1956).
     __________________________________________________________________

    C. Conditionalization

   Still, she may perfectly properly pay attention to it, and may even
   join in the game. Perhaps, for example, she is convinced (mistakenly,
   in my opinion) that any enterprise (like traditional biblical
   commentary) that makes religious or theological assumptions isn't
   really science; and perhaps she thinks it is important to engage in
   science in this area. Perhaps she likes to pursue scripture scholarship
   in conjunction with her friends who don't make the assumptions she
   does; or perhaps she thinks much of interest may emerge from a venture
   pursued by people of very different assumptions. Perhaps she concurs
   with the Thomist of Etienne Gilson's The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy
   [530] in thinking that science and philosophy are purely rational
   pursuits; they involve no assumptions that are not deliverances of
   reason alone. Then she might think it important to engage in
   Spinozistic or Duhemian science, even if the results are pretty slim.
   [531] So she might sensibly take part in Duhemian scripture
   scholarship.

   Can traditional biblical commentary also be pursued in Duhemian
   fashion? The traditional Christian wants to know the answer to various
   questions about the Bible, among others, the questions to which
   traditional biblical commentary addresses itself. Now the sensible
   thing to do, in pursuing the answer to a question, is to use all that
   you believe or think you know (insofar as it is relevant); that will
   give you the best shot at reaching the correct answer. But suppose you
   are also convinced that it is important to investigate these matters
   scientifically, and that if you employ beliefs you accept by faith, the
   resulting inquiry will not be science. Suppose you decide you want to
   do science, but also want to work on these questions. What can you do?

   You can conditionalize. [532] Instead of addressing a given question,
   What is the best way to think about x, employing all that you know
   including what you know by faith?' you address instead the question
   What would be the best way to think about x, if in fact the
   deliverances of faith were true?' This question can then be approached
   Duhemianly (or Spinozistically), using only beliefs that are among the
   deliverances of reason; no theological assumptions or deliverances of
   faith need be involved. In pursuing this enterprise you are doing
   Duhemian scholarship. Your results can be displayed as a conditional if
   F, then P; where F represents the deliverances of faith. When you work
   at this conditional, you are doing Duhemian science. Of course when you
   affirm the antecedent of the conditional and detach its consequent,
   then you have left Duhemian (and Spinozistic) science for theology; but
   that's no problem. You have the dual aim of working Duhemianly while
   also trying to discover the best way to think about the topic at issue
   from the perspective of Christian faith: in this way you can accomplish
   both. Indeed, this will be a project in which people who don't share
   your faith can sensibly cooperate, just as a Christian might engage
   (questions of frivolity aside), in this conditional fashion, in
   Troeltschian HBC. [533]

  VI. Concluding Coda

   But isn't all of this just a bit too sunny? Isn't it a recipe for
   avoiding hard questions, for hanging onto belief no matter what, for
   guaranteeing that you will never have to face negative results, even if
   there are some? "HBC is either Troeltschian or non-Troeltschian: in the
   first case, it proceeds from assumptions I reject; in the second, it
   fails to take account of all of what I take to be the evidence; either
   way, therefore, I needn't pay attention to it." Couldn't I say this a
   priori, without even examining the results of HBC? But then there must
   be something defective in the line of thought in question. Isn't it
   clearly possible that historians should discover facts that put
   Christian belief into serious question, count heavily against it? Well,
   maybe so. How could this happen? As follows: HBC limits itself to the
   deliverances of reason; it is possible, at any rate in the broadly
   logical sense, that just by following ordinary historical reason, using
   the methods of historical investigation endorsed or enjoined by the
   deliverances of reason, someone should find powerful evidence against
   central elements of the Christian faith; [534] if this happened,
   Christians would face a genuine faith-reason clash. A series of letters
   could be discovered, letters circulated among Peter, James, John, and
   Paul, in which the necessity for the hoax and the means of its
   perpetration are carefully and seriously discussed; these letters might
   direct workers to archaeological sites in which still more material of
   the same sort is discovered. . . . [535] The Christian faith is a
   historical faith, in the sense that it essentially depends upon what
   did in fact happen: "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is
   futile" (1 Corinthians 15:17). It could certainly happen that by the
   exercise of reason we come up with powerful evidence [536] against
   something we take or took to be a deliverance of the faith. It is
   conceivable that the assured results of HBC should include such
   evidence. Then Christians would have a problem, a sort of conflict
   between faith and reason.

   However, nothing at all like this has emerged from HBC, whether
   Troeltschian or non-Troeltschian; indeed, there is little of any kind
   that can be considered assured results', if only because of the
   wide-ranging disagreement among those who practice HBC. We don't have
   anything like assured results (or even reasonably well-attested
   results) that conflict with traditional Christian belief in such a way
   that belief of that sort can continue to be accepted only at
   considerable cost; nothing at all like this has happened. What would be
   the appropriate response if it did happen or, rather, if I came to be
   convinced that it had happened? Would I have to give up Christian
   faith, or else give up the life of the mind? What would be the
   appropriate response? Well, what would be the appropriate response if I
   came to be convinced that someone had given a wholly rigorous,
   ineluctable disproof of the existence of God, perhaps something along
   the lines of J. N. Findlay's alleged ontological disproof? [537] Or
   what if, with Reid's Hume (above, pp. 218-19), I come to think that my
   cognitive faculties are probably not reliable, and go on to note that I
   form this very belief on the basis of the very faculties whose
   reliability this belief impugns? If I did, what would or should I
   do--stop thinking about these things, immerse myself in practical
   activity (maybe play a lot of backgammon, maybe volunteer to help build
   houses for Habitat for Humanity), commit intellectual suicide? I don't
   know the answer to any of these questions. There is no need to borrow
   trouble, however: we can think about crossing these bridges when (more
   likely, if) we come to them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [534] Or, less crucially, evidence against what appears to be the
   teaching of Scripture. For example, archaeological evidence could
   undermine the traditional belief that there was such a city as Jericho.

   [535] The example is Bas van Fraassen's; see his "Three-Sided
   Scholarship: Comments on the Paper of John R. Donahue, S. J.," in
   Hermes and Athena, p. 322. "Finish it yourself, if you have the heart
   to do it," says van Fraassen.

   [536] Or think we come up with it; even if we are mistaken about the
   evidence in question, it could still precipitate this sort of problem
   for us.

Postmodernism and Pluralism

   What is truth?

   Pontius Pilate

   To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is
   false; while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it
   is not, is true.

   Aristotle

   You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.

   Jesus

   I was planning to title this chapter "Postmodernism and Pluralism"; in
   fact that is what I did title the chapter. But the title may be a
   misnomer. Our project, in this fourth and last part of the book, is to
   evaluate various possible defeaters for Christian belief. The problem
   with postmodernism, though, is that it is extremely hard to find in it
   anything that is a sensible candidate for being a defeater for
   Christian belief. Religious pluralism, perhaps, can be thought with
   some show of reason to be such a defeater; it's much harder to find a
   likely candidate in postmodernism. Permit me to explain.
     __________________________________________________________________

    I. Postmodernism

   Postmodernism, of course, is variously characterized. Among the views
   that go under this rubric are to be found a rejection of classical
   foundationalism; the declaration that there are no foundations of any
   sort, classical or otherwise; the claim that there is no such thing as
   objectivity (and it's a good thing too); deconstruction (the
   deconstruction company'); the claim that there is no such thing as
   truth, or that if there is, it is something totally different from what
   we thought (perhaps it is a social construction, "what our peers will
   let us get away with saying," or something else of that sort); the
   claim that truths are made, not discovered; the claim that there aren't
   any objective normative standards and that we somehow make whatever
   standards there are; and the claim that all that really matters is
   power. There is opposition to metanarratives', there is the insistence
   that God is dead (which is ordinarily intended to imply, I believe,
   that there is no such person as God), and there are patronizing
   references to God ("good old God," as Jacques Lacan refers to him [538]
   ). There is also a kind of exultation or apotheosis of autonomy, so
   that (as with Heidegger [539] ) one feels guilty for not having created
   the world (along with the suggestion that God should be ashamed for
   having the temerity to interfere with one's autonomy [540] ). There is
   a sort of recrudescence of the nineteenth-century romantic exultation
   of the self, self-deification and its rejection of all things
   bourgeois. There is historicism, the idea that our historical and
   cultural setting determines what we can think, so that we can't but
   think what we do think (and right now we can't accept serious Christian
   belief); there is warmed-over Nietzschean and Sartrian bombast, lots of
   Sturm und Drang (or "sturm und drang und tenure," as Ernest Gellner
   says [541] ) and much else besides.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Is Postmodernism Inconsistent with Christian Belief?

   Now many of these claims are not sensible candidates for the post of
   being defeaters of Christian belief, and indeed some of them are
   entirely congenial to it. For example, postmoderns typically reject
   classical foundationalism, which has also been rejected by such doughty
   spokespersons for Christian belief as Abraham Kuyper, William Alston,
   and Nicholas Wolterstorff and, for that matter, in anticipatory fashion
   by Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, and Edwards. (Its rejection is also a
   central motif of this book.) Many other themes of postmodernism can
   elicit only enthusiastic applause from a Christian perspective: one
   thinks of sympathy and compassion for the poor and oppressed, the
   strong sense of outrage at some of the injustices our world displays,
   celebration of diversity, and the unmasking' of prejudice, oppression,
   and power-seeking masquerading as self-evident moral principle and the
   dictates of sweet reason. Another theme on which Christian and
   postmodern can heartily agree is the way in which, even in the best of
   us, our vision of what is right and wrong, true or false, is often
   clouded and covered over by self-interest. True, postmoderns tend to
   see these beams in the eyes of others, not in their own; but in this
   they don't differ from the rest of us including Christians.

   Other postmodern claims, however, do appear to be incompatible with
   Christian belief: for example, the claims that God is dead, that there
   are no objective' moral standards, and perhaps also the claim that
   there isn't any such thing as truth, at least as commonsensically
   thought of. With respect to rejection of truth, there is an initial
   problem: what, precisely, is it to reject truth? To do that, must you
   assert that there simply isn't any such thing as truth, or is it
   sufficient to say that there is such a thing, all right, but it is very
   different from what we thought (and there is nothing else at all like
   what we thought truth was)? [542] According to Aristotle's marvelously
   monosyllabic account of truth quoted in the epigraph, "To say of what
   is that it is, or of what is not that it is not, is true," if someone
   claims there is no such thing as truth, is he committed to denying, for
   example, that snow is white is true if and only if snow is white? Do
   postmoderns propose to deny that? These are tough questions. Still,
   there is one common postmodern sort of view of truth according to which
   what is true depends on what we human beings say or think, and that
   does seem incompatible with Christian belief. At any rate it does if we
   accept the plausible proposition that

   (1) Necessarily, there is such a person as God if and only if it is
   true that there is such a person as God.

   For the postmodern claim about truth implies that whether it is true
   that there is such a person as God depends upon us and what we do or
   think. But if the truth of this proposition depends on us, then, given
   (1) so does the very existence of God. According to (1) there is such a
   person as God if and only if it is true that there is; hence if its
   being true that there is such a person as God depends on us and what we
   do and think, then so does there being such a person as God; God
   depends on us for his existence. From a Christian perspective, that is
   wholly absurd. This way of thinking about truth, therefore, is
   incompatible given (1) with Christian belief.

   The same goes for the idea that there simply is no such thing as truth.
   One of our most fundamental and basic ideas is that there is such a
   thing as the way things are. Things could have been very different from
   the way they are; there are many ways things could have been, but among
   them is the way they actually are. There actually are horses; there
   aren't any unicorns, although (perhaps) there could have been; there
   being horses, then, is part of the way things are. Now the existence of
   truth is intimately connected with there being a way things really are,
   a way the world is. For it is true that there are horses if and only if
   there being horses is part of the way things are. Of course a
   postmodernist might reply, "Well, obviously there is such a thing as
   the way things are--who could deny that? But when I say there is no
   such thing as truth, I don't mean to deny that at all. I only mean to
   say that there is no such thing as truth understood a certain way.
   There is no such thing as truth understood, for example, as requiring a
   sort of detailed structural correspondence between the way the world is
   and English (or German or Swahili or Chinese) sentences." This latter
   would be harmless enough; it would also be uninteresting. Postmoderns
   sometimes seem to oscillate between a momentous but clearly false claim
   (there simply is no such thing as truth at all) and a sensible but
   rather boring claim (there is no such thing as truth, conceived in some
   particular and implausible way). Taken the strong way, however, as the
   suggestion there really is no such thing as the way the world is, and
   hence no such thing as truth, the postmodern claim is incompatible with
   Christian belief. For it is certainly crucial to Christian belief to
   suppose that there is a way things are, and that it includes the great
   things of the gospel; it is crucial to Christian belief to suppose that
   such propositions as God created the world and Christ's suffering and
   death are an atonement for human sin are true.

    B. Do These Claims Defeat Christian Belief?

   Various claims plausibly labeled postmodern' do indeed conflict with
   Christian belief. As we saw in chapter 11 (above, p. 366), however,
   this is not yet to say that these claims or the making of them
   constitute defeaters for Christian belief. One often hears that this or
   that element of Christian belief has been "called into question" by
   postmodernism or postmodern ways of thinking, or that postmodernism has
   "destroyed" this or that traditional way of looking at the world. But
   you don't automatically produce a defeater for Christian belief just by
   standing on your roof and proclaiming (even loudly and slowly), "God is
   dead!" (Not even if you add: "And everybody I know says so too.") Nor
   can you call Christian belief (or anything else) into question just by
   declaring, "I hereby call that into question!" You can't destroy a way
   of thinking just by announcing, "I hereby destroy that way of
   thinking!" This will not do the job, not even if it is embodied in
   writing of coruscating wit and style, and not even if you adopt a
   superior air and elegant gestures while intoning it. Something further
   is required. What? Well, as we saw in chapter 11, to provide me with a
   defeater for my belief B, you have to do or say something such that
   (given that I am aware of it and have heard and understood it) I can no
   longer rationally continue to believe B, or continue to believe it as
   firmly as before. In the typical case, you will do this either by
   putting me into a position where I can see that my belief is to be
   rejected (e.g., by arranging for me to have the right sorts of
   experience) or by giving me an argument of some kind.

   Here someone will point out that many postmoderns would not agree. They
   typically don't think arguments are either necessary or sufficient for
   anything of importance; they may be unsure that there is any such thing
   as rationality; indeed, they may even reject the whole
   warrant-and-defeaters structure of our discussion. If so, wouldn't it
   be a waste of time to inquire whether postmodern thought does provide a
   defeater for Christian belief? Not necessarily. Their rejection of the
   notion of defeaters does not imply that, in fact, they have not
   provided a defeater. They could certainly provide a defeater even if
   they (mistakenly) rejected the whole line of thought presupposed by the
   idea that there are or could be defeaters for Christian belief. You are
   a card-carrying postmodern and reject all talk about defeaters; I am
   not. I believe there are no cacti in the Upper Peninsula; you show me
   one. The fact that you don't yourself think much of defeaters doesn't
   for a minute imply that you haven't given me one, anymore than the fact
   that I don't believe in viruses means that I can't give you a cold. If
   I am right about viruses, then I can't; but I'm wrong. The same goes
   for the postmodern who doesn't believe in defeaters: if she's right
   about there being no such things, then no doubt she can't give me one;
   but perhaps she's wrong. In adopting the warrant-and-defeaters
   framework, we are, of course, presupposing that she is wrong. If so,
   she might be able to produce a defeater for Christian belief, even if
   she doesn't think she can.

   Still, she can't do it by bare assertion, no matter how impassioned or
   confident. Must it be by way of argument then? We saw in chapter 11
   that you can give me a nonargumentative defeater for certain kinds of
   beliefs; but could she give me a defeater for an element of Christian
   belief without giving me an argument? Here is a possibility: perhaps
   she can give me a defeater by citing the trajectory of her own
   intellectual and spiritual life. Perhaps she was raised as a
   traditional believer; in her sophomore year in college, she is
   introduced to Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche; the next year she advances to
   Heidegger, Derrida, and Rorty. She is captivated by Nietzsche's
   brilliant, sparkling style, by Heidegger's air of Teutonic profundity,
   by Derrida's mischievous and playful spirit, and by the brave,
   making-the-best-of-a-really-lousy-situation' attitude of Rorty. She
   tells me about these authors and their ideas, presenting them in an
   attractive and favorable light. Does that give me a defeater? Not
   automatically. Nor do I automatically get a defeater by retracing her
   steps and reading these authors myself: where she finds profound
   insight, I may find posturing obscurantism. Reading these authors is
   unlike perceiving a cactus (realizing that it is a cactus one sees) in
   the Upper Peninsula. One can't see the cactus and rationally continue
   to believe that there are no cacti there. On the other hand, one can
   sensibly read these authors and--despite verbal pyrotechnics and airs
   of profundity--remain unmoved, rationally continuing to accept
   Christian belief.

   Are there other possibilities for nonargumentative defeaters here?
   Postmoderns sometimes point out the involvement of Christians in the
   injustice and oppression our sad world displays. As I'll argue in the
   next chapter, however, the suffering and evil our world contains don't
   automatically give me a defeater for Christian belief. Neither does the
   fact that Christians are responsible for a good bit of it; after all,
   it is part of Christian belief to see human beings, Christians
   included, as deeply flawed and sinful. Are there still other
   possibilities? Perhaps, but it is hard to see what they could be. So it
   seems that something like an argument is needed. Postmoderns, however,
   don't ordinarily give arguments for claims inconsistent with Christian
   belief. Indeed, they don't ordinarily give arguments for anything at
   all, perhaps because they think the whole frame of mind that makes
   argument seem useful is something we should get beyond'. Still, there
   are at least a couple of postmodern arguments worth considering here,
   although neither is such that its relevance to Christian belief is
   completely obvious.

      1. The Argument from Historical Conditionedness

   The first argument appeals to historicist consideration: we are all of
   us heavily constrained and conditioned by the society within which we
   live and within which we have been socialized. Had I been born at a
   different time and place, I would have failed to believe many of the
   things I do in fact believe--among them being, perhaps, some of the
   things I take most seriously. Perhaps, for example, I wouldn't have
   been a Christian or even a theist; perhaps I would have thought of
   those outside my tribe or clan as subhuman; perhaps I would have
   thought slavery was entirely acceptable, and so on. So the claim is
   that in my doxastic life I can't transcend my cultural setting--at any
   rate with respect to religious and philosophical belief. [543] But then
   those beliefs are somehow substandard, unwarranted, irrational, or in
   some other way not up to par. Christian belief, therefore, is
   irrational or at any rate unwarranted. Now what we have here so far is
   not a purported defeater for Christian belief itself, but for the
   different belief that Christian belief is warranted. Still, if I come
   to see or believe that Christian belief is not warranted for me, then
   perhaps I thereby acquire a defeater for it.

   Why should we accept the argument? There are powerful reasons not to.
   First, like many such skeptical arguments, it discredits itself if it
   discredits anything; it falls into the very snare it sets for others.
   For consider its central premise:

   (CP) Suppose a person S holds a religious or philosophical belief B: if
   B is such that if S had been born elsewhere or else-when, she would not
   have accepted B, then B is not warranted for S.

   But suppose I accept (CP), which is itself a religious or philosophical
   belief. Isn't it clear that there are times and places such that if I
   had been born there and then, I would not have accepted it? If I'd been
   born in nineteenth-century New Guinea, or medieval France, or
   seventeenth-century Japan, I would (very likely) not have accepted
   (CP); so according to (CP), (CP) is not warranted for me; and once I
   see that it isn't warranted, I have a defeater for it; so I shouldn't
   believe it. Perhaps you think that this argument is just a nasty little
   dialectical trick, not worth taking seriously. Well, I disagree: if you
   see that a belief really does defeat itself, then you can't sensibly
   hold that belief.

   No matter what you think of that argument, however, why can't it be
   that we know more at some times than at others? Had Einstein been born
   in the eighteenth century, he would not have believed special
   relativity; nothing follows about special relativity. Many now think it
   is wrong to treat someone with hatred or contempt or indifference on
   the mere grounds that they are of a different race: their views are not
   automatically unwarranted just because they might have believed
   otherwise if they had been brought up in Nazi Germany or ancient
   Sparta. Perhaps we should think, instead, that if they had been brought
   up in Nazi Germany or ancient Sparta, they wouldn't have known
   something they do know. I argued in Warrant and Proper Function that
   warrant is relative to circumstances; some circumstances are warrant
   conferring and others are not. I could therefore have been in other
   circumstances, circumstances that would not have conferred warrant on
   some belief B I actually have. Indeed, some of those circumstances are
   such that if I had been in them, I would not have held B at all. At
   present, for example, I believe I hear a crow cawing in the woods
   behind my house; had I been out of town, I would not have believed
   that. That fact, however, does nothing at all to suggest that my
   present belief lacks warrant. As it stands, therefore, (CP) is clearly
   too strong. No doubt the partisan of (CP) will say that he didn't
   intend (CP) to apply to all beliefs; it is to apply only to religious
   and philosophical beliefs. But why think it is true even thus
   restricted? You believe there aren't any things that do not exist; the
   philosopher Alexius Meinong, notoriously, did not. Now suppose you had
   been his student; given his charismatic personality and powerful
   intellect, perhaps you would have been misled into thinking there are
   some things--unicorns and golden mountains, for example--that do not
   exist. How would that so much as slyly suggest that you don't in fact,
   as things stand, know that there aren't any things that do not exist?
   This argument therefore fails. No doubt there are various ways in which
   to complicate the argument and make it subtler; none of these is
   successful, I think, because the basic idea of the argument is just a
   mistake.

      2. Do Human Beings Construct the Truth?

   There is a second argument I wish to consider briefly. Richard Rorty is
   widely credited (some might say "debited") with the view that "truth is
   what our peers will let us get away with saying." [544] Now this is a
   bit vague, but if taken seriously, it does, indeed, seem to be
   incompatible with Christian belief. That is because if a proposition is
   true (true for me', I suppose) if and only if my peers will let me get
   away with saying it, then, given proposition (1) on p. 424, God is
   dependent (for me', if that makes sense) for his very existence on my
   peers. For if they were to let me get away with saying that there is no
   such person as God, then it would be true that there is no such person,
   in which case there would be no such person. So whether there is such a
   person as God depends upon the behavior of my peers. [545] Not easy to
   believe. The view in question has still other peculiar consequences.
   For example, it promises an auspicious way of dealing with war,
   poverty, disease, and the other ills our flesh is heir to. Take AIDS:
   if we all let each other get away with saying that there just isn't any
   such thing as AIDS, then on this Rortyesque view it would be true that
   there isn't any such thing as AIDS; and if it were true that there is
   no such thing as AIDS, then there would be no such thing. So all we
   have to do to get rid of AIDS, or cancer, or poverty is let each other
   get away with saying there is no such thing. That seems much easier
   than the more conventional methods, which involve all that time,
   energy, and money.

   Similarly, consider the Chinese authorities who murdered those students
   at Tiananmen Square and then compounded their wickedness with
   bald-faced lies, claiming they'd done no such thing. From the present
   point of view, this is a most uncharitable way to think about the
   matter. For in denying that it ever happened, the authorities were
   merely trying to bring it about that their peers would let them get
   away with saying it had never happened, in which case it would have
   been true that it had never happened, in which case it would never have
   happened. So the charitable thought here, from a Rortian point of view,
   is that the Chinese authorities were only trying to bring it about that
   this terrible thing had never happened: and who can fault them for a
   thing like that? The same goes for those Nazi skinhead types who claim
   there was no Holocaust and that Hitler and his cohorts were as gentle
   as lambs and never harmed a soul; they too should charitably be seen as
   trying to see to it that those terrible things never did happen. And in
   your own personal life, if you have done something wrong, no problem:
   lie about it, get your peers to let you get away with saying you didn't
   do it. If you succeed, then in fact you won't have done it;
   furthermore, as an added bonus, you won't have lied about it either!

   Now you will no doubt say that all this is belaboring a straw man;
   Rorty couldn't mean to assert, as the sober truth, that truth is what
   your peers will let you get away with saying. That is just a
   rough-and-ready, informal, and conversational way of conveying his real
   opinion. Putting it thus informally accords with his idea that
   philosophy is best thought of as a sort of conversation, and with his
   scorn for the analytic philosopher's panoply of definitions,
   principles, necessary and sufficient conditions, attempts at rigor, and
   all the rest. (If you and a friend were having a conversation, would
   you begin a sentence by saying, "Necessarily, a proposition P is true
   if and only if?" Well, maybe it depends on the friend.)

   Perhaps that's right; unfortunately it does complicate matters. My aim
   is to ask whether Rortian thought offers a defeater for Christian
   belief; one of the most prominent strands in Rorty's thought is what he
   has to say about truth; but then I need to know whether what he means
   to say about truth is or isn't incompatible with Christian belief. For
   that, it would be nice to have a relatively serious way of stating what
   this strand of thought might be. What could he mean? Well, presumably
   Rorty's claim is that the truth of a belief or proposition depends in
   some important way on social reality of one sort or another; truth is
   in some way a function of society and what it does or would do. What is
   true for us', then, will depend somehow on our own society. For any
   proposed truth B, there is some property P--some property a society can
   have--such that B is true (for us') if and only if our society displays
   P. [546] Of course Rorty might regard that way of putting the matter as
   a bit gradgrindian if not outright silly (perhaps on a par with that
   obsessive concern with quotation marks which Derrida playfully ascribes
   to Oxford philosophers [547] ); but life is too short to worry about a
   thing like that.

   So our problem is that one can't easily tell, without further
   elucidation, whether Rorty's view of truth is or is not incompatible
   with Christian belief. This problem about determining what Rorty
   intends here is not trivial. Gary Gutting, for example, suggests that
   Rorty doesn't really intend to say anything at all shocking or
   paradoxical about truth, or anything out of accord with robust common
   sense. He doesn't really mean to say that what is true depends in some
   way upon properties of society; instead, he is only rejecting certain
   eminently rejectable theories of truth. "The key point," says Gutting,
   "is that our discourse on truth' should be limited to an assertion,
   without philosophical commentary or elaboration, of the baseline
   commonplaces about truth; and a review of the arbitrariness and/or
   incoherence of efforts to criticize (i.e., analyze, modify, or justify)
   the baseline truths." [548] The basic idea is that there are a number
   of commonplace and commonsense truths about truth: that beliefs are
   true or false but not both, that you can't ordinarily make a belief
   true just by wishing it to be true, that it is possible that we all
   hold false beliefs (just as we think people once held false beliefs
   about the shape of the earth), that the belief that all men are mortal
   is true if and only if all men are mortal, and so on. These platitudes
   are all true and are all to be accepted; furthermore, any philosophical
   criticism of them, or elaboration of them, or modification of them, or
   rejection of them is bound to wind up in "arbitrariness or
   incoherence." Gutting proposes this as an interpretation of Rorty, at
   least of Rorty "by his own best lights."

   So construed, Rorty seems a bit like Thomas Reid transposed into a
   conversational key, perhaps seasoned with a dash of Wittgenstein. If
   this is what Rorty means, then he is certainly not vulnerable to those
   charges of dissolute antirealism and relativism often flung his way.
   Thus taken, his views aren't so much as mildly shocking; they certainly
   don't constitute defeaters for Christian belief. But could this really
   be what he meant when, for example, he sided with Dewey in suggesting
   that truth is what our peers will let us get away with saying? If so,
   he has expressed himself a little carelessly. And even making all due
   allowances for the license conferred by his intent to be conversational
   and not pedantic, wouldn't it be a bit of a stretch to think that what
   he intends here is only a rejection of some philosophical criticism of
   those baseline platitudes? And isn't it also a little hard to swallow
   the suggestion that Rorty is ambiguous as between rejecting truth
   itself, on the one hand, and some particular theory of truth, on the
   other? This would be a little like being ambiguous between rejecting
   some theory of kangaroos and rejecting kangaroos themselves. This
   suggestion, it seems to me, implausibly emasculates Rorty.

   What Rorty really opposes, according to Gutting, is a view ordinarily
   associated with realism with respect to truth--that is,
   representationalism. This is the idea that we (or our minds) possess
   and think by way of representations, which are true just if they
   "correspond to reality." The problem with this view, according to Rorty
   (according to Gutting), is that it inevitably encounters the question
   how we know and whether we know that our representations do, in fact,
   correspond to reality. Here further problems arise. According to
   Gutting, Rorty endorses all the commonsense, baseline platitudes about
   truth and our relation to it; but don't these platitudes themselves
   include this very representationalism? Isn't representationalism--at
   any rate the basic version of it--itself platitudinous? It is a
   baseline platitude that beliefs are about things of one kind or
   another; for example, some of my beliefs are about the moon. It is
   another baseline platitude that beliefs can represent things as being
   one way or another; for example, one of my beliefs about the moon
   represents it as a satellite of the earth. And it is still another
   baseline platitude that this belief is true if and only if, in fact,
   the moon is a satellite of the earth--that is, if and only if the way
   that belief represents the moon as being, is the way the moon really
   is--i.e., if and only if the belief about the moon corresponds to what
   the moon is like. Representationalism itself seems to be included in
   that stock of baseline platitudes; at any rate, there is a
   platitudinous version of it. So Rorty really can't both reject
   representationalism and accept all those baseline platitudes. [549]

   On Gutting's semi-interpretation, then, Rorty isn't open to those
   charges of irresponsible antirealism and relativism; on the other hand,
   his views do turn out to be a bit pedestrian, and of course taken this
   way they don't constitute a defeater for Christian belief (or much of
   anything else). So suppose we take Rorty the more robust way, as making
   substantive and controversial claims about truth. Let's take him as
   claiming that truth is a human construction and that a belief or other
   candidate for truth is true (for us') just if it stands in a certain
   relationship to (our) society. As I suggested above, this does indeed
   seem incompatible with Christian belief. First, it seems to make the
   truth about God (if only the truth about God for us') dependent on what
   we do or think. This is clearly incompatible with Christian views about
   God, according to which God is not dependent on anything at all. And
   second, this Rortian doctrine implies that there is some contingent
   property (some non-Cambridge contingent property) P such that it is
   true (for us') that there is such a person as God if and only if our
   society has P. Now presumably our society can have a property only if
   our society exists; hence it looks as if the existence of God entails
   the existence of our society, so that if our society had not existed,
   God would not have existed either. Again, this is clearly incompatible
   with Christian theism.

   Of course this claim on Rorty's part will constitute a defeater only if
   he also makes us aware of some reason why we should believe it; the
   mere fact that he or someone else merely makes the claim doesn't
   provide a defeater. Now in general, Rorty is a bit standoffish about
   arguments; still, he does present something that could perhaps be
   construed as an argument for the conclusion that truth relevantly
   depends on us as a society. He begins his book Contingency, Irony, and
   Solidarity (hereafter CIS) by claiming, "About two hundred years ago,
   the idea that truth was made rather than found began to take hold of
   the imagination of Europe," thus apparently contradicting one of those
   platitudes, the one according to which (in the general case, anyway)
   truth is discovered or found rather than made. This certainly sounds
   like the nonplatitudinous suggestion that truth is a social
   construction, and that a given candidate for truth depends for its
   being true, if it is, on something we human beings do. In any event,
   here is Rorty's argument:

   To say that truth is not out there is simply to say that where there
   are no sentences there is no truth, that sentences are elements of
   human languages, and that human languages are human creations.

   Truth cannot be out there--cannot exist independently of the human
   mind--because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there. (CIS, p. 5)

   How exactly shall we understand this? It is hard to be sure, but here
   is a possibility: truths are sentences, sentences are elements of
   language, and languages are human creations; therefore truths are human
   creations, and if there weren't any human beings (or other
   language-using creatures), there wouldn't be any truths. According to
   this thought, we human beings create truths. The way we do this is
   perhaps not within anyone's direct control (just as the stock market
   isn't within anyone's direct control), but still we somehow do it. I
   think this is what Rorty intends to assert; what he actually says, of
   course, is terse and enigmatic (as befits a conversational
   contribution). If it is what he means, however, there are two sorts of
   objections to the argument, one serious and the other fatal.

   First, the serious objection. Sentences are indeed true or false, but
   they aren't the only things that are. Beliefs are also true or false,
   as are assertions, claims, suggestions, and the like. Rorty's argument
   seems to presuppose that beliefs, assertions, claims, suggestions, and
   so on are all themselves sentences. Alternatively, perhaps his idea is
   that it is sentences that are true or false in the primary sense, with
   other things (beliefs and assertions, for example) being true in a
   secondary way. (Thus he might say that an assertion is true if it is
   the assertion of a true sentence.)

   This is at best dubious. Here is a reason for thinking that at least
   some things true in the fundamental sense are not sentences. Suppose we
   use the term proposition' to denote the things that are true or false
   in the primary sense, leaving open just what they are and, in
   particular, whether or not they are all sentences. Consider, then, the
   proposition (the truth) that 2 + 1 = 3. Now this truth, as we
   ordinarily think, is necessarily true; that means, among other things,
   that it couldn't have failed to be true; there are no possible
   circumstances in which it is not true. But the sentence 2 + 1 = 3'
   could have failed to be true. That is because it is a sentence, and is
   true, on Rorty's view, because of something we do with it. Furthermore,
   what we do with it is something we could have failed to do. Therefore,
   on Rorty's view, things could have been such that this sentence would
   not have been true; indeed, before there were human beings, Rorty
   thinks, there was no such thing as the sentence 2 + 1 = 3'; under those
   conditions, that sentence would not have been true. Hence the sentence
   could have failed to be true. The proposition 2 + 1 = 3, therefore, has
   a property that the sentence 2 + 1 = 3', does not have: being
   necessarily true--that is, being such that it could not have failed to
   be true. The proposition (truth) that 2 + 1 = 3, therefore, is not the
   sentence 2 + 1 = 3'. [550] The same will go, naturally enough, for any
   other necessary truth. This is an argument for the conclusion that some
   truths--necessary truths--are not sentences; but we can make a similar
   if slightly more complicated argument for the same conclusion with
   respect to contingent truths. In the interests of brevity (whose
   interest you may already think has been shamefully slighted in this
   book) I shall omit that argument.

   That was the serious objection: at least some of the things that are
   true or false in the primary sense are not, contra Rorty's assumption,
   sentences. I turn now to the fatal objection. Suppose for the moment
   that sentences were the only things that are true (or false) in the
   primary sense. Then perhaps we could say that truths are made by us
   human beings: for we make it the case that a given sequence of sounds
   or marks is, indeed, a sentence and thus capable of being true or
   false. (What we make to be sentences, I take it, are types as opposed
   to tokens.) For take any given truth: it is a sequence of shapes or
   sounds, and is also a sentence. We don't make the string of shapes or
   sounds; perhaps we create tokens of those types, but the types would be
   there whatever we did or didn't do. Still, that string of shapes or
   sounds owes its being a sentence to what we, the users of language, do
   with it. And perhaps we could express this by saying that truths are
   made.

   Of course it wouldn't follow that we make a given sentence true, or
   that it is by virtue of something we do that a given sentence is in
   fact true. We make it the case that the sequence of marks There once
   were dinosaurs' is a sentence and thus capable of being true or false.
   It doesn't follow that we make it true that there once were dinosaurs.
   By virtue of our language-making activity, we bring it about that a
   certain string of marks--there once were dinosaurs'--is true if and
   only if there once were dinosaurs. But that is not sufficient for
   making that sentence true. For the sentence to be true, there must once
   have been dinosaurs; and that, presumably, is not something we have
   made to be the case, by our language-making activities or in any other
   way. Taken one way, therefore, the conclusion of Rorty's argument is
   that we human beings are responsible for the existence of sentences
   (for the fact that certain strings of marks or sounds are sentences)
   and thus for the existence of the things that are true or false; so
   taken, the conclusion is unobjectionable, platitudinous, and certainly
   not a candidate for a defeater of Christian belief. Taken the other
   way, as the nonplatitudinous claim that we human beings are
   responsible, not just (for example) for the sentencehood of God created
   the world', but for God's having created the world, the conclusion of
   the argument is, indeed, incompatible with Christian belief; taken that
   way, however, there is not the slightest reason (beyond a certain
   confusion) for thinking that conclusion true. It certainly doesn't
   follow from the premises. Either way, therefore, there is no defeater
   here.

   [544] What he actually says is: For philosophers like Chisholm and
   Bergmann, such explanations must be attempted if the realism of common
   sense is to be preserved. The aim of all such explanations is to make
   truth something more than what Dewey called Warranted assertability':
   more than what our peers will, ceteris paribus, let us get away with
   saying. (Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature [Princeton: Princeton

   (and elsewhere) that Rorty sides with Dewey against Chisholm and
   Bergmann.

   [545] And what if my peers are an unusually tolerant bunch who will

    C. Postmodernism a Failure of Nerve

   One final note. Postmodernists nearly all reject classical
   foundationalism; in this they concur with most Christian thinkers and
   most contemporary philosophers. Momentously enough, however, many
   postmodernists apparently believe that the demise of classical
   foundationalism implies something far more startling: that there is no
   such thing as truth at all, no way things really are. Why make that
   leap, when as a matter of logic it clearly doesn't follow? For various
   reasons, no doubt. Prominent among those reasons is a sort of
   Promethean desire not to live in a world we have not ourselves
   constituted or structured. With the early Heidegger, a postmodern may
   refuse to feel at home in any world he hasn't himself created. [551]
   Now some of this may be a bit hard to take seriously (it may seem less
   Promethean defiance than foolish posturing); so here is another
   possible reason. As I pointed out (above, p. 73), classical
   foundationalism arose out of uncertainty, conflict, and clamorous (and
   rancorous) disagreement; it emerged at a time when everyone did what
   was right (epistemically speaking) in his own eyes. Now life without
   sure and secure foundations is frightening and unnerving; hence
   Descartes's fateful effort to find a sure and solid footing for the
   beliefs with which he found himself. (Hence also Kant's similar effort
   to find an irrefragable foundation for science.)

   Such Christian thinkers as Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Kuyper, however,
   recognize that there aren't any certain foundations of the sort
   Descartes sought--or, if there are, they are exceedingly slim, and
   there is no way to transfer their certainty to our important
   non-foundational beliefs about material objects, the past, other
   persons, and the like. This is a stance that requires a certain
   epistemic hardihood: there is, indeed, such a thing as truth; the
   stakes are, indeed, very high (it matters greatly whether you believe
   the truth); but there is no way to be sure that you have the truth;
   there is no sure and certain method of attaining truth by starting from
   beliefs about which you can't be mistaken and moving infallibly to the
   rest of your beliefs. Furthermore, many others reject what seems to you
   to be most important. This is life under uncertainty, life under
   epistemic risk and fallibility. I believe a thousand things, and many
   of them are things others--others of great acuity and seriousness--do
   not believe. Indeed, many of the beliefs that mean the most to me are
   of that sort. I realize I can be seriously, dreadfully, fatally wrong,
   and wrong about what it is enormously important to be right. That is
   simply the human condition: my response must be finally, "Here I stand;
   this is the way the world looks to me."

   There is, however, another sort of reaction possible here. If it is
   painful to live at risk, under the gun, with uncertainty but high
   stakes, maybe the thing to do is just reduce or reject the stakes. If,
   for example, there just isn't any such thing as truth, then clearly one
   can't go wrong by believing what is false or failing to believe what is
   true. If we reject the very idea of truth, we needn't feel anxious
   about whether we've got it. So the thing to do is dispense with the
   search for truth and retreat into projects of some other sort:
   self-creation and self-redefinition as with Nietzsche and Heidegger, or
   Rortian irony, [552] or perhaps playful mockery, as with Derrida. [553]
   So taken, postmodernism is a kind of failure of epistemic nerve.

   [552] Although here as elsewhere Rorty is ambiguous. Note that his
   ironist thinks there is no intrinsically final vocabulary; she believes
   that no way of thinking is intrinsically closer to the truth than any
   other ("The difficulty faced by a philosopher who, like myself, is
   sympathetic to this suggestion--one who thinks of himself as auxiliary
   to the poet rather than to the physicist--is to avoid hinting that this
   suggestion gets something right, that any sort of philosophy
   corresponds to the way things really are" [CIS, p. 8]). Paradoxically,
   however, the ironist is also nervous about her own final vocabulary,
   thinking she may somehow have it wrong: "The ironist spends her time
   worrying about the possibility that she has been initiated into the
   wrong tribe, taught to play the wrong language game. She worries that
   the process of socialization which turned her into a human being by
   giving her a language, may have given her the wrong language, and so
   turned her into the wrong kind of human being" (CIS, p. 75).

    II. Pluralism

   Postmodernism, therefore, doesn't offer anything that can sensibly be
   thought a defeater for Christian belief. But what about the facts of
   religious pluralism, the fact that the world displays a bewildering and
   kaleidoscopic variety of religious and antireligious ways of thinking,
   all pursued by people of great intelligence and seriousness? There are
   theistic religions, but also at least some nontheistic religions (or
   perhaps nontheistic strands of religion) among the enormous variety of
   religions going under the names Hinduism' and Buddhism'. Among the
   theistic religions, there are Christianity, Islam, Judaism, strands of
   Hinduism and Buddhism, American Indian religions, some African
   religions, and still others. All of these differ significantly from
   each other. Furthermore, there are those who reject all religions.
   Given that I know of this enormous diversity, isn't it somehow
   arbitrary, or irrational, or unjustified, or unwarranted (or maybe even
   oppressive and imperialistic) to endorse one of them as opposed to all
   the others? How can it be right to select and accept just one system of
   religious belief from all this blooming, buzzing confusion? Won't that
   be in some way irrational? And don't we therefore have a defeater for
   Christian belief? As the sixteenth-century writer Jean Bodin put it,
   "each is refuted by all." [554] According to John Hick: "In the light
   of our accumulated knowledge of the other great world faiths,
   [Christian exclusivism] has become unacceptable to all except a
   minority of dogmatic diehards." [555]

   This is the problem of pluralism, and our question is whether a
   knowledge of the facts of pluralism constitutes a defeater for
   Christian belief. The specific problem I mean to discuss can be thought
   of as follows. To put it in an internal and personal way, I find myself
   with religious beliefs, and religious beliefs that I realize aren't
   shared by nearly everyone else. For example, I believe both

   (1) The world was created by God, an almighty, all-knowing and
   perfectly good personal being (the sort of being who holds beliefs, has
   aims and intentions, and can act to accomplish these aims)

   and

   (2) Human beings require salvation, and God has provided a unique way
   of salvation through the incarnation, life, sacrificial death, and
   resurrection of his divine son. [556]

   Now I realize there are many who do not believe these things. First,
   there are those who agree with me on (1) but not (2): there are
   non-Christian theistic religions. Second, there are those who don't
   accept either (1) or (2), but nonetheless do believe that there is
   something beyond the natural world, a something such that human
   well-being and salvation depend on standing in a right relation to it.
   And third, in the West and since the Enlightenment, anyway, there are
   people--naturalists, we may call them--who don't believe any of these
   three things. Some speak here of a new awareness of religious
   diversity, and speak of this new awareness as constituting (for us in
   the West) a crisis, a revolution, an intellectual development of the
   same magnitude as the Copernican revolution of the sixteenth century
   and the alleged discovery of evolution and our animal origins in the
   nineteenth. [557] No doubt there is at least some truth to this. Of
   course the fact is all along many Western Christians and Jews have
   known that there are other religions, and that not nearly everyone
   shares their religion. The ancient Israelites--some of the prophets,
   say--were clearly aware of Canaanite religion; and the apostle Paul
   said that he preached "Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and
   folly to the Greeks" (1 Corinthians 1:23). Other early Christians, the
   Christian martyrs, say, must have suspected that not everyone believed
   as they did. The church fathers, in offering defenses of Christianity,
   were certainly apprised of this fact; Origen, indeed, wrote an
   eight-volume reply to Celsus, who urged an argument very similar to
   those urged by contemporary pluralists. [558] Aquinas, again, was
   clearly aware of those to whom he addressed the Summa contra Gentiles;
   and the fact that there are non-Christian religions would have come as
   no surprise to the Jesuit missionaries of the sixteenth and seventeenth
   centuries or to the Methodist missionaries of the nineteenth. Still, in
   recent years probably more Western Christians have become aware of the
   world's religious diversity; we have probably learned more about people
   of other religious persuasions, and we have come to see more clearly
   that they display what looks like real piety, devoutness, and
   spirituality. What is new, perhaps, is a more widespread sympathy for
   other religions, a tendency to see them as more valuable, as containing
   more by way of truth, and a new feeling of solidarity with their
   practitioners.

   Now one way to react to these other religious responses to the world is
   to continue to believe what I have all along believed; I learn about
   this diversity, but continue to believe (i.e., take to be true), such
   propositions as (1) and (2) above, consequently taking to be false any
   beliefs, religious or otherwise, that are incompatible with (1) and
   (2). Following current practice, I shall call this exclusivism; the
   exclusivist holds that the tenets or some of the tenets of one
   religion--Christianity, let's say--are in fact true; he adds, naturally
   enough, that any propositions, including other religious beliefs, that
   are incompatible with those tenets are false. Here we need a couple of
   initial qualifications. First, I shall use the term exclusivism' in
   such a way that you don't count as an exclusivist unless you are rather
   fully aware of other faiths, have had their existence and their claims
   called to your attention with some force and perhaps fairly frequently,
   have noted that the adherents of other religions sometimes appear to
   display great intelligence, moral excellence, and spiritual insight,
   and have to some degree reflected on the problem of pluralism, asking
   yourself such questions as whether it is or could be really true that
   the Lord has revealed himself and his programs to Christians, say, in a
   way in which he hasn't revealed himself to those of other faiths. And
   second, suppose I am an exclusivist with respect to (1), for example,
   but reasonably believe, like Thomas Aquinas, say, that I have a
   knockdown, drag-out argument, a demonstration or conclusive proof of
   the proposition that there is such a person as God; and suppose I think
   further that if those who don't believe (1) were to be apprised of this
   argument (and had the ability and training necessary to grasp it, and
   were to think about the argument fairly and reflectively), they too
   would come to believe (1). Then, obviously, the facts of religious
   pluralism would not furnish me with a defeater for (1). My condition
   would be like that of Kurt GÃ¶del, upon his recognition that he had a
   proof for the incompleteness of arithmetic. True, many of his
   colleagues and peers didn't believe that arithmetic was incomplete, and
   some believed that it was complete; these facts did not give GÃ¶del a
   defeater for his belief; he had his proof, after all. Furthermore, he
   wouldn't have had a defeater in these facts even if he were mistaken in
   thinking he had a proof.

   Accordingly, I shall use the term exclusivist' in such a way that you
   don't count as an exclusivist if you rationally think you know of a
   demonstration or conclusive argument for the belief with respect to
   which you are an exclusivist, or even if you rationally think you know
   of an argument that would convince all or most intelligent and honest
   people of the truth of that proposition. And our question is whether it
   is possible to be a rational exclusivist in the above sense; our
   question, that is, is whether I have a defeater for my Christian belief
   in my knowledge of the facts of religious pluralism, coupled with my
   belief that I do not have a proof or argument that can be counted on to
   convince those who disagree with me. Must I recognize that the
   existence of these other ways of thinking gives me a defeater for my
   own?
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. A Probabilistic Defeater?

   Precisely how would such a defeater work? Suppose we begin by
   considering a probabilistic antitheistic argument from pluralism. J. L.
   Schellenberg asks us to "Consider first the case of one who supposes
   there to be a number of mutually exclusive religious alternatives to a
   certain religious belief r having probabilities equal to the
   probability of r." [559] He then suggests that such a person ought to
   suppose that r is improbable (less likely than its denial)--at any rate
   if she thinks there is more than one alternative having a probability
   equal to that of r; hence she ought not believe it. Schellenberg then
   concedes that the typical believer will not suppose that what she
   believes is no more probable than alternatives to it (if she did, why
   would she be believing it?); but he thinks his argument can nonetheless
   be restated as follows:

   Summarizing (and allowing for a non-uniform assignment of probabilities
   to alternatives), we can say quite generally that the following may be
   held by the critic to be a sufficient condition for the improbability
   of any religious belief r with an epistemic status superior to that of
   each of its alternatives: r is improbable if the number of times by
   which its probability exceeds that of each of the available mutually
   exclusive alternatives (or the average of their probabilities) is
   exceeded by the number of those alternatives.

   By way of example:

   Even if a Christian were to suppose her trinitarian belief to be
   significantly more likely to be true than each of the various Jewish,
   Hindu, Buddhist . . . alternatives, the application of the approach
   here described could still yield the conclusion that her belief was
   probably false. For it might upon reflection seem intuitively obvious
   or at any rate very likely to the Christian that the degree of
   superiour probability she could credibly claim would not be sufficient
   to prevent the combined probability of the relevant alternatives from
   outweighing that of the beliefs she holds. (p. 148)

   The basic idea, therefore, is that reflection on the facts of pluralism
   should lead the believer to think that the probability of her belief is
   relatively low, perhaps even less than .5. But here is the crucial
   question: probability with respect to what? What is the body of
   evidence with respect to which Schellenberg thinks the Christian's
   belief must be more probable than not, if she is not to be irrational?
   If it is the set of beliefs actually accepted by the believer, then, of
   course, the probability of her beliefs will be 1. After all, the
   believer doesn't just think it likely that, for example, Jesus Christ
   is the divine son of God; she believes it; it is a member of the set of
   propositions she believes; hence its probability with respect to that
   set is 1. If that set isn't the one Schellenberg has in mind, however,
   which one is it? What is the body of beliefs Christian belief must be
   probable with respect to in order to be reasonable? Schellenberg's
   approach (like so many others) seems to make sense only if the
   believer, to be rational, must hold her Christian beliefs on the basis
   of their relation to other beliefs she has--or, at any rate, only if
   those Christian beliefs are probable with respect to those other
   beliefs. One of the main burdens of this book, however, is that the
   believer can be perfectly rational in accepting some of her beliefs in
   the basic way--not on the basis (probabilistic or otherwise) of other
   beliefs.

   No doubt there are subsets S of her total set of beliefs with respect
   to which Christian belief is indeed improbable; perhaps, in fact, it is
   improbable with respect to the rest of what she believes (supposing,
   for the moment, that there is some neat way to segregate her Christian
   belief from her other beliefs). But how is that relevant? The same will
   be true, no doubt, with respect to many other beliefs she holds in
   perfect rationality. She is playing bridge and is dealt all the sevens
   and eights. The odds against this are pretty formidable; there are many
   alternatives that are at least equally probable; does that mean that
   her belief that she was dealt all the sevens and eights is irrational?
   Of course not. The reason, clearly, is that this belief has a source of
   warrant independent of any it gets by way of its probabilistic
   relations to her other beliefs. The same goes for Christian belief. If
   there is a source of warrant for Christian belief that is independent
   of any it acquires by way of probabilistic relations to other beliefs,
   then the fact (if it is a fact) that Christian belief isn't
   particularly likely with respect to those others doesn't show anything
   of much interest. It certainly doesn't provide a defeater for Christian
   belief.

    B. The Charge of Moral Arbitrariness

   This approach, therefore, appears to be a nonstarter. Is there
   something else in the nearby bushes that could produce a defeater?
   Perhaps the most important suggestion in the neighborhood is that there
   is something arbitrary about accepting Christian belief. This
   arbitrariness is thought to have both a moral and an intellectual
   component: it is thought to be both unjustified (contrary to doxastic
   duty) and irrational. The moral charge is that there is a sort of
   egoism, perhaps pride or hubris, in accepting beliefs when one realizes
   both that others do not accept them and that in all likelihood one
   possesses no arguments that would convince those dissenters. The
   epistemic charge also focuses on arbitrariness: here the claim is that
   the exclusivist is treating similar things differently, thus falling
   into intellectual arbitrariness. And the idea would be that in either
   case, when the believer comes to see these things, then she has a
   defeater for her belief, a reason for giving it up or, at the least,
   holding it with less firmness. I shall focus on the moral charge,
   dealing with the charge of epistemic arbitrariness ambulando.

      1. The Abstract Case

   The moral charge is that there is a sort of self-serving arbitrariness,
   an arrogance or egoism, in accepting such propositions as (1) or (2);
   one who accepts them is guilty of some serious moral fault or flaw.
   According to Wilfred Cantwell Smith, "except at the cost of
   insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible actually to go
   out into the world and say to devout, intelligent, fellow human beings:
   . . . we believe that we know God and we are right; you believe that
   you know God, and you are totally wrong'." [560] So what can the
   believer say for herself? Well, it must be conceded immediately that if
   she believes (1) or (2), then she must also think that those who
   believe something incompatible with them are mistaken and believe what
   is false; that's just logic. Furthermore, she must also believe that
   those who do not believe as she does--those who believe neither (1) nor
   (2), whether or not they believe their negations--fail to believe
   something that is true, deep, and important. Of course she does believe
   this truth; hence she must see herself as privileged with respect to
   those others--those others of both kinds. There is something of great
   value, she must think, that she has and they lack. They are ignorant of
   something--something of great importance--of which she has knowledge.
   But does this make her properly subject to the above censure?

   I think the answer must be no. Or if the answer is yes, then I think we
   have here a genuine moral dilemma, a situation in which no matter what
   you do, you are wrong. Given the pluralistic facts of the matter, there
   is no real alternative; there is no reflective attitude that is not
   open to the same strictures. These charges of arrogance are a
   philosophical tar baby: get close enough to them to use them against
   the Christian believer, and you are likely to find them stuck fast to
   yourself. How so? As follows: as an exclusivist, while I realize that I
   can't convince others that they should believe as I do, I nonetheless
   continue to believe as I do. And the charge is that I am, as a result,
   arrogant or egoistical, arbitrarily preferring my way of doing things
   to other ways. [561] But what are my alternatives with respect to a
   proposition like (1) or (2)? There are three choices. [562] I can
   continue to hold it; I can withhold it, in Roderick Chisholm's sense,
   believing neither it nor its denial; or I can accept its denial.
   Consider the third way, a way taken by those pluralists who, like John
   Hick, hold that such propositions as (1) and (2) and their colleagues
   from other faiths are literally false, although in some way still valid
   responses to the Real. This seems to me to be no advance at all with
   respect to the arrogance or egoism problem; this is not a way out. If I
   do this I will then be in the very same condition as I am now: I will
   believe many propositions others don't believe, realizing that I have
   no argument that will necessarily convince those others. For I will
   then believe the denials of (1) and (2) (as well as the denials of many
   other propositions explicitly accepted by those of other faiths). Many
   others, of course, do not believe the denials of (1) and (2), and in
   fact believe (1) and (2). I am therefore in the condition of believing
   propositions that many others do not believe; I also realize I have no
   demonstrations of what I believe. If, in the case of those who believe
   (1) and (2), that is sufficient for intellectual arrogance or egoism,
   the same goes for those who believe their denials. This third
   alternative, therefore, is no help at all with respect to the
   arrogance-egoism-arbitrariness problem.

   So consider the second option: I can instead withhold the proposition
   in question. I can say to myself: "The right course here, given that I
   can't or couldn't convince these others of what I believe, is to
   believe neither these propositions nor their denials." The pluralist
   objector can say that the right course is to abstain from believing the
   offending proposition, and also abstain from believing its denial; call
   him, therefore, the abstemious pluralist'. Does he thus really avoid
   the condition that, on the part of the exclusivist, leads to the
   charges of egoism and arrogance? Not really. Think, for a moment, about
   disagreement. Disagreement, fundamentally, is a matter of adopting
   conflicting attitudes with respect to a given proposition. In the
   simplest and most familiar case, I disagree with you if there is some
   proposition p such that I believe p and you believe -p. That's just the
   simplest case, however; there are also others. The one that is
   presently of interest is this: you believe p and I withhold it, fail to
   believe it. Call the first kind of disagreement contradicting'; call
   the second dissenting'.

   My claim is that if contradicting others is arrogant and egoistical, so
   is dissenting. For suppose you believe some proposition p that I don't
   believe: perhaps you believe that it is wrong to discriminate against
   people simply on the grounds of race, while I, recognizing that there
   are many people who disagree with you, do not believe this proposition.
   I don't disbelieve it either, of course; but in the circumstances I
   think the right thing to do is to abstain from belief. Then am I not
   implicitly condemning your attitude, your believing the proposition, as
   somehow improper--naive, perhaps, or unjustified, or unfounded, or in
   some other way less than optimal? I am implicitly saying that my
   attitude is the superior one; I think my course of action here is the
   right one and yours somehow wrong, inadequate, improper, in the
   circumstances at best second-rate. I realize that there is no question,
   here, of showing you that your attitude is wrong or improper or naive;
   so am I not guilty of intellectual arrogance? Of a sort of egoism,
   thinking I know better than you, arrogating to myself a privileged
   status with respect to you? The problem for the believer was that she
   was obliged to think she possessed a truth missed by many others; the
   problem for the abstemious pluralist is that he is obliged to think
   that he possesses a virtue others don't, or acts rightly where others
   don't. If one is arrogant by way of believing a proposition others
   don't, isn't one equally arrogant by way of withholding a proposition
   others don't?

   Perhaps you will respond by saying that the abstemious pluralist gets
   into trouble, falls into arrogance, by way of implicitly saying or
   believing that his way of proceeding is better or wiser than other ways
   pursued by other people; and perhaps he can escape by abstaining from
   that view as well. Can't he escape the problem by refraining from
   believing that racial bigotry is wrong, and also refraining from
   holding the view that it is better, under the conditions that obtain,
   to withhold that proposition than to assert and believe it? Well, yes,
   he can; then he has no reason for his abstention; he doesn't believe
   that abstention is better or more appropriate; he simply does abstain.
   Does this get him off the egoistical hook? Perhaps. Of course he can't,
   in consistency, also hold that there is something wrong with not
   abstaining, with coming right out and believing that bigotry is wrong;
   he loses his objection to the exclusivist. Accordingly, this way out is
   not available for the abstemious pluralist who accuses the exclusivist
   of arrogance and egoism.

   Indeed, I think we can see that the abstemious pluralist who brings
   charges of intellectual arrogance against the believer is in a familiar
   but perilous dialectical situation; he shoots himself in the foot, is
   hoist with his own petard, holds a position that in a certain way is
   self-referentially inconsistent in the circumstances. For he believes

   (3) If S knows that others don't believe p (and, let's add, knows that
   he can't find arguments that will persuade them of p), then S should
   not believe p;

   this or something like it is the ground of the charges he brings
   against the believer. The abstemious pluralist realizes, no doubt, that
   many do not accept (3); and I suppose he also realizes that it is
   unlikely that he can find arguments for (3) that will convince them.
   Given his acceptance of (3), therefore, the right course for him is to
   abstain from believing (3), to withhold or disbelieve it. Under the
   conditions that do in fact obtain--namely, his knowledge that others
   don't accept it--he can't properly accept it. So if (3) is true, nobody
   can believe it without being arrogant. (3) is either true or false; if
   the first, I fall into arrogance if I believe it; if the second, I fall
   into falsehood if I believe it; so I shouldn't believe it.

   I am therefore inclined to think that one can't, in the circumstances,
   properly hold (3) or any other proposition that will do the job the
   objector wants done. One can't find here some principle on the basis of
   which to hold that the believer is doing the wrong thing, suffers from
   some moral fault--that is, one can't find such a principle that
   doesn't, as we might put it, fall victim to itself.

   The abstemious pluralist is therefore self-referentially inconsistent;
   but even apart from this dialectical argument (which in any event some
   will think unduly cute), aren't the charges against the exclusivist
   unconvincing and implausible? I must concede that there are a variety
   of ways in which I can be and have been intellectually arrogant and
   egoistic; I have certainly fallen into this vice in the past, will no
   doubt fall into it in the future, and am not free of it now. Still, am
   I really arrogant and egoistic just by virtue of believing something I
   know others don't believe, where I can't show them that I am right?
   Suppose I think the matter over, consider the objections as carefully
   as I can, realize that I am finite and furthermore a sinner, certainly
   no better than those with whom I disagree, and indeed inferior both
   morally and intellectually to many who do not believe what I do. But
   suppose it still seems clear to me that the proposition in question is
   true: am I really immoral in continuing to believe it? I am dead sure
   that it is wrong to try to advance my career by telling lies about my
   colleagues. I realize there are those who disagree (even if they would
   never so much as consider lying about their colleagues, they think
   nothing is really right or wrong); some of these are people whom I
   deeply respect. I also realize that in all likelihood there is no way I
   can show them that they are wrong. Nonetheless, I think they are wrong.
   If I think this after careful reflection--if I consider the claims of
   those who disagree as sympathetically as I can, if I try my level best
   to ascertain the truth here--and it still seems to me sleazy,
   despicable, wrong to lie about my colleagues to advance my career,
   could I really be doing something immoral in continuing to believe as
   before? I can't see how. If, after careful reflection and thought, you
   find yourself convinced that the right propositional attitude to take
   to (1) and (2), in the face of the facts of religious pluralism, is
   abstention from belief, how could you properly be taxed with egoism for
   so abstaining? Even if you knew others did not agree with you? And
   won't the same hold for believing them? So I can't see how the moral
   charge against exclusivism can be sustained, and if it can't, this
   charge does not provide a defeater for Christian belief.

      2. A Concrete Case: Gutting

   So far we have been considering this charge of moral arbitrariness in
   abstraction from any actual presentation of a pluralistic case for the
   arbitrariness or egoism of accepting Christian belief. To remedy that
   defect, I propose to consider the argument Gary Gutting [563] gives for
   this conclusion. As we saw above, the classical foundationalist holds
   that there is a duty or obligation to accept only what one sees to be
   at least probable with respect to foundational certainties. Gutting
   accepts the deontology of the classical picture, but proposes a
   different duty. Because of "the modern phenomenon of religious
   disagreement," he says, Christian and theistic belief requires
   justification (p. 11). Gutting means to investigate the question
   whether someone can justifiably, dutifully accept Christian belief,
   given that there is disagreement about it (and presumably given that
   she is aware of the disagreement). The question is not (as with the
   classical picture) whether being justified in accepting Christian
   belief requires evidence just as such; the question is whether being
   justified requires evidence or argument once you know that others
   disagree with you.

   His conclusion, in brief, goes as follows. (1) We must begin by
   distinguishing "decisive assent" from "interim assent." When I give
   decisive assent for p:

   I view the present case for p as allowing me to end the search for
   reasons for or against believing p. Interim assent, on the other hand,
   accepts p but without terminating inquiry into the truth of p. Its
   effect is to put me on the side of p in disputes about its truth.
   However, my endorsement of p is combined with a commitment to the
   epistemic need for continuing discussions of p's truth. (105)

   That is, I believe that "further discussion is needed for the project
   of determining the truth of p." (2) A person has a right to give
   decisive assent to a proposition that she knows others don't assent to
   only if she has a good argument for that proposition. (3) She has a
   right to give interim assent to a proposition which others reject, even
   if she doesn't have good arguments for it. (4) Since there is a good
   argument (one from religious experience) for the existence of God,
   taken vaguely as "a good and powerful being, concerned about us, who
   has revealed himself to human beings" (p. 171), we have a right to give
   this proposition decisive assent. Finally, (5) there is no argument of
   this sort for specific Christian doctrines (for the belief, e.g., that
   in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself) or for more
   specific beliefs about God, such as that he is all-powerful, or wholly
   good, or all-knowing, or the creator of the heavens and the earth.

   Clearly there is much to discuss here, and much to question. I shall
   restrict myself to the following. (1) What does Gutting mean by
   justification'? And (2) why am I not justified in giving decisive
   assent to a proposition for which I don't have a good argument and
   about which I know people disagree? As to the first, he clearly thinks
   of justification in deontological terms, in terms of right and wrong,
   duty and obligation, being within one's epistemic rights. Someone who
   accepts traditional Christian belief in the face of disagreement and
   without having an argument for her beliefs, he charges, is not
   satisfying her intellectual obligations. What duty, specifically, is it
   that she violates? The duty to avoid epistemological egoism. That's the
   duty that is violated by the Christian who is aware of disagreement but
   has no good arguments:

   First believing p [when I don't have an argument and know that others
   disagree] is arbitrary in the sense that there is no reason to think
   that my intuition (i.e., what seems obviously true to me) is more
   likely to be correct than that of those who disagree with me. Believing
   p because its truth is supported by my intuition is thus an
   epistemological egoism just as arbitrary and unjustifiable as ethical
   egoism is generally regarded to be. (p. 86, Gutting's emphasis)

   [A] neutral epistemic observer has no intuitions pro or con about p and
   has not thought about p to an extent sufficient to make his not having
   any intuitions significant. From the point of view of such an observer,
   the facts are simply these (taking for simplicity the case of
   disagreement between two peers): (1) person A has an intuition that p
   is true; (2) person B has an intuition that p is false; (3) there is no
   reason to think that either A or B is more likely to be correct in his
   intuition. Surely the only proper attitude for such an observer is to
   withhold judgment on p. But even if I am A or B, should I not judge the
   situation in the same way as the neutral observer? Surely it is wrong
   to prefer my intuition simply because it is mine. (p. 87)

   So there is a moral problem with the believer who knows others disagree
   with her but does not have an argument for her own views: she is being
   epistemically arrogant, egoistic, and self-centered in thus arbitrarily
   preferring the way she thinks things are to the way others think they
   are. (And perhaps, once she sees this, she will have a defeater for
   those beliefs.)

   Here we must ask some questions. First, is it really true that if I am
   such a person, then I "prefer my intuition simply because it is mine"?
   Not really. I think it is wrong to discriminate against someone just
   because he's of a different race (even though I know others disagree).
   I am not aware of any arguments for my belief here, or at any rate any
   arguments that would convince those dissenters; the view just seems
   right to me. Still, it isn't the case that I accept this belief on the
   grounds that it is my belief or my intuition: that makes no sense. I
   don't accept it as the conclusion of an argument, the premise of which
   is that this is my intuition; I am not reasoning as follows: p seems to
   me to be right, therefore p. I don't accept it on the basis of other
   propositions at all. It is true that I accept it because, when I think
   about it, it seems right; the because', however, doesn't mean that the
   latter is my reason, or argument or evidence for the former.

   If Gutting's position is to have real bite, he must tell us more about
   those arguments the possession of which protects me from
   epistemological egoism when I believe something others do not believe.
   What kind of an argument is required? Well, such an argument, he says,
   must be a good argument. Fair enough; bad arguments won't do the job;
   but what is goodness, for an argument? In the chapter on Rorty to which
   I referred above (p. 431), Gutting apparently agrees with Rorty that a
   good argument (good for me') consists in reasons that are accepted by
   my epistemic community. If that is how the wind blows, however, there
   will be little problem for the Christian; after all, the Christian
   epistemic community may be quite prepared to accept reasons for
   Christian belief (e.g., that Scripture affirms it) that those outside
   that community will not accept. So taken, Gutting's requirement is easy
   to meet--trivially easy to meet.

   So let's suppose he has something more stringent in mind. A good
   argument, presumably, will be valid, and must also have some nonformal
   virtues: it must not be circular or beg the question against those with
   whom I disagree. But then what about its premises? If my argument is
   valid, won't the same disagreement break out with respect to the
   premises? If they are also propositions that wouldn't be accepted by
   those who disagree with me, then presumably I won't have a right to
   accept them either, unless I have a further argument for them. Of
   course the premises of that further argument will have to meet the same
   conditions: if others don't accept them, then I can't give them
   decisive assent unless I have a further good argument for them. The
   result seems to be that my duty precludes my being party to any
   ultimate disagreements, at least any ultimate disagreements of which I
   am aware, and at least as far as decisive assent goes. Can that be
   right? Perhaps there is no way you can find much moral common ground
   with a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Perhaps you can't find any premises
   you both accept that will serve in a good argument for your views and
   against his. Would it really follow that you don't have a right to give
   decisive assent to the proposition that racial bigotry is wrong?
   Hardly.

   Well, perhaps it is Gutting's idea that if I don't have an argument for
   p and know that others don't believe it, then I am being egoistical,
   even if I don't reason in the above fashion--that is, don't believe or
   accept the intuition just because it is mine. But is this really true?
   Certainly not just as it stands. We can see this by going back to an
   earlier example. The police haul me in, accusing me of a serious crime:
   stealing your Frisian flag again. At the police station, I learn that
   the mayor claims to have seen me lurking around your back door at the
   time (yesterday midafternoon) the crime occurred; I am known to resent
   you (in part because I am peeved about your article in The National
   Enquirer according to which I am really an alien from outer space). I
   had means, motive, and opportunity; furthermore there have been other
   such sordid episodes in my past. However, I recall very clearly
   spending the entire afternoon on a solitary hike near Mount Baker. My
   belief that I was hiking there then isn't based on argument. (I don't
   note, e.g., that I feel a little tired, that my hiking boots are muddy,
   and that there is a topographical map of Mount Baker in my parka
   pocket, and then conclude that the best explanation of these phenomena
   is that I was hiking there.) Furthermore, I can't think of any argument
   or any other way to convince the police that I was at Mount Baker
   (sixty miles from the crime scene) when the theft took place.
   Nevertheless, I believe that's where I was. So I hold a belief for
   which I can't give an argument and which I know is disputed by others.
   Am I therefore guilty of epistemological egoism? Surely not.

   Why not? Because I remember where I was, and that puts me within my
   rights in believing that I was off hiking, even if others disagree with
   me. Well, not quite; strictly speaking, it is, I suppose, my believing
   that I remember, rather than my actually remembering, that puts me in
   the right, morally speaking. I am justified, am not going contrary to
   duty or obligation here, because I believe, and nonculpably believe,
   that I have a source of knowledge or information about my movements
   that the police don't have: my memory. If I thought that I knew no more
   than they knew, and still held firmly to the belief that I was
   innocent, then, perhaps, I would be epistemically egoistical. But I
   think I know something they don't, and know it by way of a means to
   knowledge they don't have. (They know about where they were by memory,
   not about where I was.) It is because of this that I am not flouting
   any duties or obligations; this is what confers justification on me. It
   is because of this that I can't properly be accused of arbitrariness or
   egoism in preferring my view to theirs.

   Because this is the crucial point here, let's look into it a bit
   further. Both rationality and epistemic duty, says the critic, requires
   that one treat similar cases similarly. The Christian believer, however
   (she says), violates this duty by arbitrarily believing (1) and (2)
   (above, p. 438) in the face of the plurality of conflicting religious
   beliefs the world presents. Well, let's suppose that rationality and
   epistemic duty do, indeed, require treating similar cases similarly.
   Clearly you do not violate this requirement if the beliefs in question
   are not on a par. And the Christian believer thinks they are not on a
   par: she thinks (1) and (2) true and those incompatible with either of
   them false. So they aren't relevantly similar, as she sees it, and she
   isn't treating similar cases differently. To make his case, therefore,
   the critic would have to argue that Christian belief is, in fact,
   false; but presumably he doesn't intend his charge of arbitrariness to
   depend on the assumption that Christian belief is false.

   The rejoinder, of course, will be that it is not alethic parity (their
   having the same truth value) that is at issue: it is epistemic parity
   that counts. What kind of epistemic parity? Well, perhaps the critic is
   thinking initially of internal epistemic parity: parity with respect to
   what is internally available to the believer. What is internally
   available includes, for example, detectable relationships between the
   belief in question and other beliefs you hold; so internal parity would
   include parity of propositional evidence. What is internally available
   to the believer also includes the phenomenology that goes with the
   belief in question: the sensuous phenomenology, and also the
   nonsensuous phenomenology involved, in doxastic evidence, in the
   belief's just having the feel of being right. Once more, then, (1) and
   (2) are not on an internal par, for the Christian believer, with
   beliefs that are incompatible with them. After all, (1) and (2) do seem
   to her to be true; they do have for her the phenomenology that
   accompanies that seeming, and they do have doxastic evidence for her;
   the same cannot be said for propositions incompatible with them.

   The next rejoinder: isn't it likely that those who reject (1) and (2)
   in favor of other beliefs have propositional evidence for their beliefs
   that is on a par with that of the Christian for her beliefs; and isn't
   it also probably true that the same or similar phenomenology
   accompanies their beliefs as accompanies hers? So that those beliefs
   really are epistemically and internally on a par with (1) and (2), and
   the believer is still treating like cases differently? I don't think
   so: I think there really are arguments available for (1), at least,
   that are not available for its competitors. As for similar
   phenomenology, this is not easy to say; it is not easy to look within
   the breast of another; it is hard indeed to discover this sort of
   thing, even with respect to someone you know really well. Still, I am
   prepared to stipulate both sorts of parity. Let's agree for the purpose
   of argument that these beliefs are on an epistemic par in the sense
   that those of a different religious tradition have the same sort of
   internally available markers--evidence, phenomenology, and the
   like--for their beliefs as the Christian has for (1) and (2). What
   follows?

   Return to the case of moral belief. King David saw the beautiful
   Bathsheba, was smitten, sent for her, slept with her, and made her
   pregnant. After the failure of various stratagems to get her husband,
   Uriah, to think he was the father of the baby, David arranged for Uriah
   to be killed by telling his commander to "put Uriah in the front line
   where the fighting is fiercest; then withdraw from him so he will be
   struck down and die" (2 Samuel 11:15). Then the prophet Nathan came to
   David and told him a story about a rich man and a poor man. The rich
   man had many flocks and herds; the poor man had only a single ewe lamb,
   which grew up with his children, "ate at his table, drank from his cup,
   lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him." The rich man had
   unexpected guests. Instead of slaughtering one of his own sheep, he
   took the poor man's single ewe lamb, slaughtered it, and served it to
   his guests. David exploded in anger: "The man who did this deserves to
   die!" Then, in one of the most riveting passages in all the Bible,
   Nathan turns to David, stretches out his arm, points to him, and
   declares, "You are that man!" And then David sees what he has done.

   My interest here is in David's reaction to the story. I agree with
   David: such injustice is utterly and despicably wrong; there are
   scarcely words for it. I believe that such an action is wrong, and I
   believe that the proposition that it isn't wrong--either because really
   nothing is wrong, or because even if some things are wrong, this
   isn't--is false. As a matter of fact, there isn't a lot I believe more
   strongly. I recognize, however, that plenty of people disagree with me;
   many believe that some actions are better, in one way or another, than
   others, but that none is really right or wrong in the full-blooded
   sense in which I think this action is. Once more, I doubt that I could
   find an argument to show them that I am correct and they incorrect.
   Further, for all I know, their conflicting beliefs have for them the
   same internally available epistemic markers, the same phenomenology,
   mutatis mutandis, as mine have for me; perhaps they have the same
   degree of doxastic evidence. Am I then being arbitrary, treating
   similar cases differently in continuing to hold, as I do, that in fact
   that kind of behavior is dreadfully wrong? I don't think so. Am I wrong
   in thinking racial bigotry despicable, even though I know that others
   disagree, and even if I think they have the same internal markers for
   their beliefs as I have for mine? Again, I don't think so. I believe in
   serious actualism, the view that no objects have properties in worlds
   in which they do not exist, not even nonexistence. Others do not
   believe this; I am unable to convince them; and perhaps the internal
   markers of their dissenting views have for them the same qualities as
   mine have for me. Am I being arbitrary in continuing to think as I do?
   I can't see how.

   And the reason here is this: in each of these cases, the believer in
   question doesn't really think the beliefs in question are on a relevant
   epistemic par. She may agree that she and those who dissent are equally
   convinced of the truth of their belief, and even that they are
   internally on a par, that the internally available markers are similar,
   or relevantly similar. Still, she must think that there is an important
   epistemic difference: she thinks that somehow the other person has made
   a mistake, or has a blind spot, or hasn't been wholly attentive, or
   hasn't received some grace she has, or is blinded by ambition or pride
   or mother love or something else; she must think that she has access to
   a source of warranted belief the other lacks. [564] If the believer
   concedes that she doesn't have any special source of knowledge or true
   belief with respect to Christian belief--no sensus divinitatis, no
   internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, no teaching by a church
   inspired and protected from error by the Holy Spirit, nothing not
   available to those who disagree with her--then, perhaps, she can
   properly be charged with an arbitrary egoism, and then, perhaps, she
   will have a defeater for her Christian belief. But why should she
   concede these things? She will ordinarily think (or at least should
   ordinarily think) that there are indeed sources of warranted belief
   that issue in these beliefs. (And here we have a way in which the
   epistemologist can be of use to the believer.)

   She believes, for example, that in Christ, God was reconciling the
   world to himself; she may believe this on the basis of what the Bible
   or church teaches. She knows that others don't believe this and
   furthermore don't accept the Bible's (or church's) authority on this or
   any other point. She has an explanation: there is the testimony of the
   Holy Spirit (or of the divinely founded and guided church); the
   testimony of the Holy Spirit enables us to accept what the Scriptures
   teach. It is the Holy Spirit who "seals it upon our hearts, so that we
   may certainly know that God speaks"; it is the work of the Spirit "to
   convince our hearts that what our ears receive has come from him."
   [565] She therefore thinks she is in a better epistemic position with
   respect to this proposition than those who do not share her
   convictions; for she believes she has the witness of the divinely
   guided church, or the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit, or perhaps
   still another source for this knowledge. She may be mistaken, in so
   thinking, deluded, in serious and debilitating error, but she needn't
   be culpable in holding this belief. In this case, as in the Frisian
   flag episode, the believer nonculpably believes that she has a source
   of knowledge or true belief denied those who disagree with her. This
   protects her from epistemic egoism, as well as from the defeater that
   might accompany awareness of it. [566]

   As a result, of course, the serious believer will not take it that we
   are all, believers and unbelievers alike, epistemic peers on the topic
   of Christian belief. She will probably feel considerable sympathy for
   Cardinal Newman:

   in the schools of the world, the ways towards Truth are considered high
   roads open to all men, however disposed, at all times. Truth is to be
   approached without homage. Everyone is considered on a level with his
   neighbor, or rather, the powers of the intellect, acuteness, sagacity,
   subtlety and depth, are thought the guides into Truth. Men consider
   that they have as full a right to discuss religious subjects, as if
   they were themselves religious. They will enter upon the most sacred
   points of Faith at the moment, at their pleasure--if it so happen, in a
   careless frame of mind, in their hours of recreation, over the wine
   cup. [567]

   Newman's idea is that there is something in addition to "the powers of
   the intellect, acuteness, sagacity, subtlety and depth" that is needed
   for a proper discussion of religious subjects, or at least for a proper
   grasp of the truth with respect to them. Here he is echoing Jesus: "I
   praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden
   these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little
   children" (Luke 10:21). If these things are hidden from the wise and
   learned, it won't be relevant to complain that the wise and learned
   don't accept them (adding that it is epistemically egoistic to accept
   what the wise and learned do not unless you have a good argument). The
   Christian believer will therefore think there is an important source of
   knowledge, here, in addition to the powers of intellect mentioned. So
   on this point he believes, presumably nonculpably, that those who
   disagree with him are really not his epistemic peers on this topic,
   even though he might be vastly inferior to them, epistemically
   speaking, on other topics.

   The central question here, therefore, is whether the Christian's
   beliefs are or are not on an epistemic par with the beliefs of those
   who disagree with her. This is the crucial issue. If something like the
   extended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model presented in chapter 8 is in fact
   correct, then there is a significant difference between the epistemic
   situation of those who accept Christian belief and those who do not;
   the objector is therefore assuming, unjustifiably and without argument,
   that neither that model nor any other according to which there is a
   source of warranted Christian belief is in fact correct and that there
   is no such source for Christian belief. That assumption has nothing to
   be said for it; the arbitrariness charge therefore disintegrates.

   Now Gary Gutting, to be sure, claims (p. 84) that the believer does not
   have a right, in this context, to the view that he is better off,
   epistemically speaking, than the unbeliever. He gives two reasons.
   [568] First, the believer's view that he is the beneficiary of the
   sensus divinitatis or the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, or
   the teaching of a church inspired and protected from error by the Holy
   Spirit or "derives from theological doctrines that presuppose theism
   and so cannot be legitimately called upon in a defense of the
   believer's epistemic right to accept theism"; and second, "there are at
   least some believers who themselves do not see God exists' as obviously
   properly basic; it is very hard to see how the believer can
   nonarbitrarily apply Calvin's views to deny that they are his epistemic
   peers."

   These arguments seem mistaken. Gutting's second reason for thinking the
   Christian doesn't have a right to think there are such sources of
   warranted belief seems irrelevant: the fact that some believers do not
   think belief in God is properly basic does not so much as slyly suggest
   that there are no such sources. What about the first reason, the claim
   that the believer is involved in some objectionable form of circularity
   if she thinks that she is the beneficiary of one of those sources of
   belief? But how can she be involved in circularity? She isn't putting
   forward an argument for anything; nor is she proposing a definition: so
   how does circularity so much as rear its ugly head? If she were giving
   an argument for theism and then proposed as a premise that she enjoyed
   the benefits of one of those special sources of belief, then her
   argument might be circular. But she isn't arguing for that; nor need
   she be arguing for anything else. Am I engaged in objectionable
   circularity if I appeal to physics to help explain how it is that I can
   perceive trees and grass--even if my knowledge of physics rests in part
   on observation? Not if I am not arguing for the conclusion that
   perception is a source of warranted belief.

   But don't the realities of religious pluralism count for anything? Is
   there nothing at all to the claims of the pluralists? [569] Could that
   really be right? Of course not. For at least some Christian believers,
   an awareness of the enormous variety of human religious responses does
   seem to reduce the level of confidence in their own Christian belief.
   It doesn't or needn't do so by way of an argument. Indeed, there aren't
   any respectable arguments from the proposition that many apparently
   devout people around the world dissent from (1) and (2) to the
   conclusion that (1) and (2) are false or can be accepted only at the
   cost of moral or epistemic deficiency. Nevertheless, knowledge of
   others who think differently can reduce one's degree of belief in
   Christian teaching. From a Christian perspective, this situation of
   religious pluralism is itself a manifestation of our miserable human
   condition; and it may indeed deprive Christians of some of the comfort
   and peace the Lord has promised his followers. It can also deprive the
   believer of the knowledge that (1) and (2) are true, even if they are
   true and he believes that they are. Since degree of warrant depends in
   part on degree of belief, it is possible, though not necessary, that
   knowledge of the facts of religious pluralism should reduce his degree
   of belief and hence the degree of warrant (1) and (2) enjoy for him; it
   can therefore deprive him of knowledge of (1) and (2). He might be such
   that if he hadn't known the facts of pluralism, then he would have
   known (1) and (2), but now that he does know those facts, he doesn't
   know (1) and (2). In this way he may come to know less by knowing more.

   Things could go this way, with the exclusivist. On the other hand, they
   needn't go this way. Consider once more the moral parallel. Perhaps you
   have always believed it deeply wrong for a counselor to use his
   position of trust to seduce a client. Perhaps you discover that others
   disagree; they think it more like a minor peccadillo, like running a
   red light when there's no traffic; and you realize that possibly these
   people have the same internal markers for their beliefs that you have
   for yours. You think the matter over more fully, imaginatively
   re-create and rehearse such situations, become more aware of just what
   is involved in such a situation (the breach of trust, the injustice and
   unfairness, the nasty irony of a situation in which someone comes to a
   counselor seeking help but receives only hurt), and come to believe
   even more firmly that such an action is wrong. In this way, this belief
   could acquire more warrant for you by virtue of your learning and
   reflecting on the fact that some people do not see the matter your way.
   Something similar can happen in the case of religious beliefs. A fresh
   or heightened awareness of the facts of religious pluralism could bring
   about a reappraisal of one's religious life, a reawakening, a new or
   renewed and deepened grasp and apprehension of (1) and (2). From the
   perspective of the extended A/C model, it could serve as an occasion
   for a renewed and more powerful working of the belief-producing
   processes by which we come to apprehend (1) and (2). In this way
   knowledge of the facts of pluralism could initially serve as a
   defeater; in the long run, however, it can have precisely the opposite
   effect. The facts of religious pluralism, therefore, like historical
   biblical criticism and the facts of evil, do not or need not constitute
   a defeater for Christian belief.

   own form of religious experience, together with that of the tradition
   of which we are a part, is veridical whilst others are not. We can of
   course claim this; and indeed virtually every religious tradition has
   done so, regarding alternative forms of religion either as false or as
   confused and inferior versions of itself. . . . Persons living within
   other traditions, then, are equally justified in trusting their own
   distinctive religious experience and in forming their beliefs on the
   basis of it. . . . let us avoid the implausibly arbitrary dogma that
   religious experience is all delusory with the single exception of the
   particular form enjoyed by the one who is speaking (An Interpretation
   of Religion, p. 235). On the topic of epistemic arrogance, see also

   [562] To speak of choice here suggests that I can simply choose which
   of these three attitudes to adopt, which is wholly unrealistic. Perhaps
   we have very little control over our beliefs; then the moral critic of
   belief can't properly accuse the believer of dereliction of moral duty,
   but he could still argue that her stance is unhappy, regrettable, a
   miserable state of affairs. Even if I can't help it that I am
   overbearing and conceited, my being that way is a bad state of affairs.

   [564] And of course the pluralist critic must think the same sort of
   thing. He thinks the thing to do when there is internal epistemic
   parity is to withhold judgment; he knows that there are others who
   don't think so (and won't be convinced by any argument he can muster),
   and, for all he knows, that belief has internal parity with his. If he
   continues in that belief, therefore, he will be in the same condition
   as the person he criticizes; but if he doesn't continue in this belief,
   he no longer has an objection.

   [566] Even if she isn't egoistic in accepting Christian belief, won't
   she nevertheless have a defeater, here, if, in fact, Christian belief
   is on an epistemic par with its denial? Not if she doesn't believe that
   it is. She could perhaps be given such a defeater, if Gutting or
   someone could produce a powerful argument for the claim that there is
   epistemic parity here. As we saw in chapter 8, however, it is likely
   that Christian belief is such that if it is true, then it is warranted
   for those who accept it. This means that an argument for the conclusion
   that Christian belief is on an epistemic par with unbelief would
   require a previous argument that Christian belief is false. But if the
   critic already has an argument for the falsehood of Christian belief,
   why is he bothering with this charge of arbitrariness?

   should really have given a third, which would be to reapply his
   principle that one can justifiably give only interim assent to any
   proposition she knows is not accepted by others; for presumably the
   believer knows that others, such as the objector, won't agree that the
   believer is better off, epistemically speaking, than the unbeliever.

Suffering and Evil


   Why do you make me look at injustice?

   Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the
   wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?

   Habakkuk

   Our world contains an appalling amount and variety both of suffering
   and of evil; perhaps no century rivals ours for the magnitude of
   either. I'm thinking of suffering as encompassing any kind of pain or
   discomfort: pain or discomfort that results from disease or injury, or
   oppression, or overwork, or old age, but also disappointment with
   oneself or with one's lot in life (or that of people close to one), the
   pain of loneliness, isolation, betrayal, unrequited love; and there is
   also suffering that results from awareness of others' suffering. I'm
   thinking of evil, fundamentally, as a matter of free creatures' doing
   what is wrong, including particularly the way we human beings mistreat
   and savage each other. Often pain and suffering result from evil, as in
   some of the events for which our century will be remembered--the
   Holocaust, the horrifying seventy-year-long Marxist experiment in
   eastern Europe with its millions of victims, the villainy of Pol Pot
   and his followers, genocide in Bosnia and Africa. Of course much
   suffering and evil are banal and everyday, and are none the better for
   that.

   Now the evil and suffering in our world have, indeed, baffled and
   perplexed Christians and other believers in God. This bafflement and
   perplexity are widely represented in Christian and Hebrew Scriptures,
   especially, though by no means exclusively, in Psalms and the book of
   Job. Faced with the shocking concreteness of a particularly horrifying
   example of suffering or evil in his own life or the life of someone
   close to him, a believer can find himself tempted to take toward God an
   attitude he himself deplores--an attitude of mistrust, or suspicion, or
   bitterness, or rebellion. Such a problem, broadly speaking, is a
   spiritual or pastoral problem. A person in its grip may not be much
   tempted to doubt the existence or even the goodness of God;
   nevertheless he may resent God, fail to trust him, be wary of him, be
   unable to think of him as a loving father, think of him as if he were
   far off and unconcerned.

   Now many philosophers and others have argued that knowledge of the
   amount, variety, and distribution of suffering and evil ("the facts of
   evil," for short) confronts the believer with a problem of quite
   another sort. [570] These facts, they argue, can serve as the premise
   of a powerful argument against the very existence of God--against the
   existence, that is, of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and wholly good
   person who has created the world and loves the creatures he has
   created. Call such an argument atheological'; atheological arguments go
   all the way back to the ancient world, to Epicurus, whose argument is
   repeated in the eighteenth century by Hume:

   Epicurus' old questions are yet unanswered.

   Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then he is impotent. Is he
   able, but not willing? then he is malevolent. Is he both able and
   willing? whence then is evil? [571]

   And the claim is that this argument (more exactly, knowledge of this
   argument) constitutes a defeater for theistic belief--and if for
   theistic belief, then also for Christian belief.

   Our question in this chapter, therefore, is whether knowledge of the
   facts of evil does constitute a defeater for theistic and Christian
   belief. Does knowledge of the facts of evil, together with the rest of
   what I know, give me a reason to give up belief in God? Does this
   knowledge make it the case that I cannot continue to hold Christian
   belief rationally? Note that this is not the traditional problem of
   theodicy: I will not be making any attempt to "justify the ways of God
   to man" or to give an answer to the question why God permits evil
   generally or why he permits some specially heinous forms of evil. Our
   question is, instead, epistemological: given that theistic and
   Christian belief can have warrant in the way suggested in chapters 6
   through 8, does knowledge of the facts of evil provide a defeater for
   this belief?

   Of course the answer need not be the same for all Christians: perhaps
   the facts of suffering and evil, in our sad world, do not constitute
   such a defeater for very young Christians, or for culturally insulated
   Christians, or for Christians who know little about the suffering and
   evil our world contains, or for those who don't have an adequate
   appreciation of the seriousness of what they do know about. Our
   question, however, is about Philip Quinn's "intellectually
   sophisticated adults in our culture" (above, p. 358); can I be mature,
   both intellectually and spiritually, be aware of the enormous and
   impressive amounts and depths of suffering and evil in our world, be
   aware also of the best atheological arguments starting from the facts
   of evil, and still be such that Christian belief is rational and
   warranted for me? Could it still have warrant sufficient for knowledge,
   for me? I shall argue that the right response is, "Yes indeed." And it
   isn't that this can be so just for an exceptional few, perhaps the
   Mother Teresas of the world. I shall argue that for any serious
   Christian with a little epistemology, the facts of evil, appalling as
   they are, offer no obstacle to warranted Christian belief.

   Now until twenty or twenty-five years ago, the favored sort of
   atheological argument from evil was for the conclusion that there is a
   logical inconsistency in what Christians believe. They believe both
   that there is such a person as God (a person who is omnipotent,
   omniscient, and wholly good), and also that there is evil in the world;
   it isn't logically possible (so went the claim) that both of these
   beliefs be true. Thus the late John Mackie:

   I think, however, that a more telling criticism can be made by way of
   the traditional problem of evil. Here it can be shown, not merely that
   religious beliefs lack rational support, but that they are positively
   irrational, that the several parts of the essential theological
   doctrine are inconsistent with one another. [572]

   Mackie goes on to argue that the existence of God is logically
   incompatible with the existence of evil; he concludes that since the
   theist is committed to both, theistic belief is clearly irrational.

   At present, however, it is widely conceded that there is nothing like
   straightforward contradiction or necessary falsehood in the joint
   affirmation of God and evil; the existence of evil is not logically
   incompatible (even in the broadly logical sense) with the existence of
   an all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good God. [573] An
   important line of thought in the demise of the traditional claim of
   contradiction has involved the notion of free will: although it is
   logically possible that there be free creatures (creatures whose
   actions are not antecedently determined, e.g., by God, or by natural
   law and antecedent conditions) who always do only what is right, it is
   not within God's power to create free creatures and cause them to do
   only what is right. (If he causes someone to do what is right, then
   that person does not do what is right freely.) Of course that doesn't
   necessarily suffice to get the theist off the hook. There is also no
   logical contradiction in the thought that the earth is flat, or that it
   rests on the back of a turtle, which rests on the back of another
   turtle, and so on, so that it's turtles all the way down; nevertheless
   these views (given what we now think we know) are irrational. (You
   would be distressed if your grown children adopted them.) Those who
   offer atheological arguments from evil have accordingly turned from the
   claim that the existence of God is flatly incompatible with that of
   evil to evidential or probabilistic arguments of one sort or another.
   Here the claim is not that Christian belief is logically inconsistent,
   but rather that the facts of evil offer powerful evidence against the
   existence of God. These evidential arguments are also typically
   probabilistic: in the simplest cases, they claim that the existence of
   God is unlikely or improbable with respect to the facts of evil
   together with the rest of our background knowledge--that is, what we
   all know, or perhaps what all reasonable and well-informed people now
   believe. So the typical atheological claim at present is not that the
   existence of God is incompatible with that of evil; it is rather that
   the latter offers the resources for a strong evidential or
   probabilistic argument against the former.

   Now from an atheological point of view, the old argument for
   inconsistency in Christian belief had a lot to be said for it. It was
   short and sweet; if there is a contradiction in Christian belief, then
   Christian belief is false, and that's all there is to it. It doesn't
   matter what else is or isn't true, and it doesn't matter whether there
   are any good arguments or evidence of other kinds for Christian belief:
   if it is inconsistent, it's false, and that settles the matter.
   Furthermore, once you see that a proposition is false, you can't
   rationally continue to believe it; so such an argument would show at
   one stroke that Christian belief is false and that it is irrational, at
   least for those apprised of the argument. But things are very different
   with contemporary evidential arguments from evil. First, suppose evil
   does constitute evidence, of some kind, against theism: what follows
   from that? Not much. There are many propositions I believe that are
   true, and rationally accepted, and such that there is evidence against
   them. The fact that Peter is only three months old is evidence against
   his weighing nineteen pounds; nevertheless I might rationally (and
   truly) believe that's how much he weighs. Is the idea, instead, that
   the existence of God is improbable with respect to our total evidence,
   all the rest of what we know or believe? To show this, the atheologian
   would have to look into all the evidence for the existence of God--the
   traditional ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments, as
   well as many others; [574] he would be obliged to weigh the relative
   merits of all of these arguments, and weigh them against the evidential
   argument from evil in order to reach the indicated conclusion. This is
   vastly messier and more problematic than a terse and elegant
   demonstration of a contradiction Ã  la Mackie.

   Another problem for this atheological argument can be brought out by
   considering responses to the most popular contemporary version of the
   argument from design--the so-called fine-tuning argument. This argument
   begins from the apparent fact that the fundamental constants of
   physics--the speed of light, the gravitational constant, the strength
   of the weak and strong nuclear forces--must apparently have values that
   fall within an exquisitely narrow range for life to be so much as
   possible. If these values had been even minutely different (if, for
   example, the gravitational constant had been different in even the most
   minuscule degree), habitable planets would not have developed and life
   (at least life at all like ours) would not have been possible. And this
   suggests or makes plausible the thought that the world was designed or
   created by a Designer who intended the existence of living creatures
   and eventually rational, intelligent, morally significant creatures.
   One contemporary response is that possibly "there has been an evolution
   of worlds (in the sense of whole universes) and the world we find
   ourselves in is simply one among countless others that have existed
   throughout all eternity." [575] And given infinitely many universes,
   Daniel Dennett thinks, all the possible distributions of values over
   the cosmological constants would have been tried out (p. 179); as it
   happens, we find ourselves, naturally enough, in one of those universes
   where the constants are such as to allow the development of intelligent
   life. But then the probability of theism, given the whole array of
   worlds, isn't particularly high.

   In the same way, then, a theist might agree that it is unlikely, given
   just what we know about our world, that there is such a person as God.
   But perhaps God has created countless worlds, in fact, all the worlds
   (all the universes) in which there is a substantial overall balance of
   good over evil. In some of these worlds there is no suffering and evil;
   in some a good deal; as it happens, we find ourselves in one of the
   worlds where there is a good deal. But the probability of theism, given
   the whole ensemble of worlds, isn't particularly low. [576]

   Still further, suppose theism were improbable with respect to the rest
   of what I believe; alternatively, suppose the rest of what I believe
   offered evidence against theism and none for it. What would follow from
   that? Again, not much. There are many true beliefs I hold (and hold in
   complete rationality) such that they are unlikely given the rest of
   what I believe. I am playing poker; it is improbable on the rest of
   what I know or believe that I have just drawn to an inside straight; it
   doesn't follow that there is even the slightest irrationality in my
   belief that I have just drawn to an inside straight. The reason, of
   course, is that this belief doesn't depend, for its warrant, on its
   being appropriately probable on the rest of what I believe; it has a
   quite different source of warrant, namely, perception. Similarly for
   theism: everything really turns, here, on the question whether, as I
   have been arguing, theism has or may have some source of
   warrant--perception of God, or the sensus divinitatis, or faith and the
   internal instigation of the Holy Spirit (see above, chapters 8 and
   9)--distinct from its probability on other propositions I believe.

   The important questions with respect to these atheological evidential
   arguments, therefore, are of the following sort: precisely what are
   they supposed to prove? That theism is false? Or that it is irrational
   for any thoughtful person apprised of the facts of evil to accept it?
   Or that the facts of evil and those probabilistic considerations
   together constitute a defeater for it? Or for at least some reflective
   theists, even if not for all? Or that the facts of suffering and evil
   make it more rational to reject belief in God than to accept it? Or
   what? One of the main problems here is to make out the proposed bearing
   of the atheological arguments from evil: precisely what are they
   supposed to accomplish? We'll have to bear this question in mind as we
   look at some of these arguments. Twenty-five years ago, there were no
   developed atheological evidential arguments from evil; that is
   understandable because (apparently) nearly all atheologians were of the
   opinion that the existence of God is flatly inconsistent with that of
   evil. Since then, however, there have been several attempts to state
   and develop evidential arguments from evil. Some of these efforts are
   ingenious and indeed revealing; I shall argue, however, that they are
   no more successful than the older argument for inconsistency. Indeed,
   what is most surprising, here, is the weakness of these arguments. I
   shall then go on to suggest that there is a wholly different (and more
   promising) way in which the atheologian could claim that the facts of
   evil constitute a defeater for theistic belief. Promising as it is,
   however, this claim, in my opinion, also fails.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. Evidential Atheological Arguments

   The last twenty-five years or so have seen the development of several
   different versions of the evidential argument from evil. In this
   section I examine a couple of the best.
     __________________________________________________________________

    A. Rowe's Arguments

   I turn first to an argument William Rowe has been proposing and
   developing for the past twenty years. [577] Consider some particularly
   horrifying cases of evil or suffering: a five-year-old girl's rape and
   murder (E[1]) or a fawn's lingering and painful death in a forest fire
   (E[2]). Rowe's argument goes as follows:

   P: No good we know of is such that we know that it justifies an
   omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being [a perfect being, for
   short] in permitting E[1] and E[2]; [578]

   Therefore, probably

   Q: No good at all justifies a perfect being in permitting E[1] and
   E[2];

   Therefore probably

   not-G: There is no perfect being.

   Here we are thinking of goods and evils as states of affairs. A state
   of affairs can be actual or nonactual; only an actual good, says Rowe,
   could justify a perfect being in permitting E[1] and E[2] (or, indeed,
   any other evil). So the idea behind P is that we do not know of any
   good that is actual and is such that we know that it suffices to
   justify a perfect being in permitting E[1] and E[2].

   There are several problems with this argument. At the simplest level,
   however, the main problem, once the others are straightened out or
   ignored, is with the inference from P to Q. I look inside my tent: I
   don't see a St. Bernard; it is then probable that there is no St.
   Bernard in my tent. That is because if there were one there, I would
   very likely have seen it; it's not easy for a St. Bernard to avoid
   detection in a small tent. Again, I look inside my tent: I don't see
   any noseeums (very small midges with a bite out of all proportion to
   their size); this time it is not particularly probable that there are
   no noseeums in my tent--at least it isn't any more probable than before
   I looked. The reason, of course, is that even if there were noseeums
   there, I wouldn't see 'em; they're too small to see. And now the
   question is whether God's reasons, if any, for permitting such evils as
   E[1] and E[2] are more like St. Bernards or more like noseeums. Suppose
   the fact is God has a reason for permitting a particular evil like E[1]
   or E[2], and suppose we try to figure out what that reason might be: is
   it likely that we would come up with the right answer? Is it even
   likely that we would wind up with plausible candidates for God's
   reason? A series of important recent papers by Stephen Wykstra, William
   Alston, and Peter van Inwagen argue (among other things) that it is
   not. [579] The main reason is the epistemic distance between us and
   God: given that God does have a reason for permitting these evils, why
   think we would be the first to know? Given that he is omniscient and
   given our very substantial epistemic limitations, it isn't at all
   surprising that his reasons for some of what he does or permits
   completely escape us. But then from the fact that no goods we know of
   are such that we know that they justify God in (serve as his reasons
   for) permitting E[1] or E[2], it simply doesn't follow that it is
   probable, with respect to what we know, that there aren't any such
   goods, or that God has no reason for permitting those evils. The
   arguments in these papers seem to me to be conclusive; I shall not
   repeat them here.

   More recently (and partly under the pressure of some of the works
   mentioned in footnote 10), Rowe has himself come to view this argument
   with a jaundiced eye: "I now think this argument is, at best, a weak
   argument." [580] He therefore sets this argument aside in favor of one
   whose prospects he thinks are brighter: "I propose to abandon this
   argument altogether and give what I believe is a better argument for
   thinking that P makes Q more likely than not" (p. 267). After giving
   that argument, Rowe goes on to say that "we can simplify the argument
   considerably by bypassing Q altogether and proceeding directly from P
   to -G" (p. 270). This new argument goes as follows. First, we must note
   that Rowe intends P in such a way that it is entailed by not-G; P is
   equivalent to

   P' There is no perfect being and known good such that the latter
   justifies the former in permitting E[1] and E[2].

   Rowe then assumes that P(G/k) and P(P/G&k) both equal .5 (where k is
   our background information--what all or most of us know or believe.) It
   then follows by the probability calculus that P(G/P&k) is considerably
   less than P(G/k); hence P disconfirms G. The argument thus simplified
   is Rowe's new evidential argument from evil. I regret to say, however,
   that this new argument is, if anything, weaker than the old. That is
   because an analysis of purely formal features of the argument shows
   that it is counterbalanced by other arguments of the same structure and
   strength for a conclusion inconsistent with Rowe's conclusion (and
   hence for the denial of Rowe's conclusion). [581] In essence, the
   problem is twofold.

   First, Rowe's argument really depends on the fact (as already noted)
   that the conclusion he proposes to support, i.e.,

   not-G There is no perfect being

   entails P, the premise of his argument. Now the probability calculus
   tells us that if a proposition A entails a proposition B, then B
   confirms A in the sense that the probability of A on B conjoined with
   our background information k will exceed that of A on k simpliciter
   (unless either A or B has an absolute probability of 1). Thus any
   contingent consequence C of not-G will confirm not-G with respect to
   any body of background information k (k, of course, cannot include or
   entail C).

   But then by the same token, any contingent consequence of G will
   confirm G with respect to any body of background information k. This
   means that Rowe's argument will be counterbalanced by other
   arguments--for example, one that takes as its premise any of the
   following propositions:

   P* Neither E[1] nor E[2] is such that we know that no good justifies a
   perfect being in permitting it.

   P** No evil we know of is such that we know that no perfect being is
   justified by some good in permitting it.

   P*** No evil we know of is such that we know that no perfect being
   would permit it.

   Presumably there will be as many arguments of this sort for G as there
   are arguments of Rowe's sort against G.

   The second problem is like unto the first. Rowe's argument is really an
   "argument from degenerate evidence"--an argument in which you take as
   your new evidence, not the new proposition you learn, but a weaker
   consequence of it. We can see this as follows. Rowe's premise P is
   equivalent to

   P' Either not-G or no good we know of is such that we know that it
   justifies E[1] and E[2],

   where a good g justifies an evil e iff if there were a perfect being b,
   and g and e were actual, then b would be justified by g in permitting
   e. [582] (For example, perhaps a certain kind of moral growth on my
   part requires a certain amount of suffering; and perhaps we can see
   that a perfect being would be justified by that moral growth in
   permitting the suffering in question.) Now what we learn by reflecting
   on E[1] and E[2] (and other evils) and their relation to a perfect
   being is really

   -J No good we know of is such that we know that it justifies E[1] and
   E[2].

   Clearly enough, -J entails and is stronger than P', the premise of
   Rowe's argument. And the problem with arguments of this sort is that,
   once again, there will be other arguments of the same structure and
   strength for an incompatible conclusion. For example, suppose I win the
   Indiana lottery (W). The probability of W with respect to k is very
   low, say one in a million. Now suppose I take as my new evidence not W,
   but

   W or -G.

   By an argument just like Rowe's, [583] we can show that the probability
   of -G on this premise together with the relevant background information
   is very high indeed--something like .999999. Of course there is a
   similar argument for G; here the premise will be

   W or G.

   Clearly, neither of these arguments makes any real advance, and that is
   because they counterbalance each other.

   Rowe's argument from P to -G displays the same structure as this
   lottery argument. He proposes to argue for -G; our "new evidence" is
   really -J; but to get his premise P he weakens this new evidence by
   adding the conclusion of his argument, -G, as a disjunct, so that P is
   or is equivalent to the proposition -J or -G. That makes this an
   argument from degenerate evidence. To construct the counterbalancing
   argument we simply weaken -J by adding as a disjunct G, the proposition
   that there is a perfect being, rather than -G; this counterbalancing
   argument will be for the denial of Rowe's conclusion and will be as
   strong as his. Arguments from degenerate evidence, clearly enough, do
   not serve to advance the discussion.

   [578] Rowe actually states P as "No good we know of justifies an
   omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being in permitting E[1] and
   E[2]"; neither the theist nor the neutral bystander, however, can be
   expected to accept this premise because it could be that some good we
   know of does justify a perfect being in permitting E[1] and E[2], even
   though we don't know that it does. Indeed, Rowe countenances
   conjunctive goods such as G, the conjunction of all the goods there
   are. But G (one supposes) is a good state of affairs; and if theism is
   true, G justifies a perfect being in permitting E[1] and E[2].
   Alternatively, the theist might think that the unthinkably great good
   of incarnation and atonement--a good that we know of--justifies E[1]
   and E[2]. This could happen as follows: God selects for actualization
   one of the best worlds; but all the best worlds include incarnation and
   atonement (see below, p. 489), and hence also a great deal of evil--if
   not specifically E[1] and E[2], then others just as bad. The most the
   atheologian can sensibly claim, therefore (if he is hoping for
   agreement from theist and neutral bystander) is that no good we know of
   is such that we know that it justifies a perfect being in permitting
   E[1] and E[2]. If Rowe insists on his premise as originally stated,
   then, it seems to me, the theist should respond that there is no reason
   to think it true and good reason to think it false.

    B. Draper's Argument

   Paul Draper presents an argument of quite a different sort. [584] He
   asks us to consider the pattern of pain and pleasure in the world: the
   amount and distribution of each and the sorts of conditions under which
   each is found. Draper then claims two things: first, this pattern of
   pain and pleasure is much less probable on theism than on a certain
   other hypothesis h inconsistent with theism; and second, this fact
   poses a serious problem for theistic belief. A way in which Draper's
   argument is superior to the Rowe variety is that it doesn't require
   that we be in a position to judge, with respect to any kinds of evils,
   the likelihood that an omniscient, omnipotent, and wholly good being
   would permit them. Nevertheless, he says, "Our knowledge about pain and
   pleasure creates an epistemic problem for theists" (p. 12). Why so,
   exactly?

      1. Draper's Argument Initially Stated

   The problem is not that some proposition about pain and pleasure can be
   shown to be both true and logically inconsistent with theism. Rather,
   the problem is evidential. A statement reporting the observations and
   testimony upon which our knowledge about pain and pleasure is based
   bears a certain significant negative evidential relation to theism. And
   because of this, we have a prima facie good epistemic reason to reject
   theism--that is, a reason that is sufficient for rejecting theism
   unless overridden by other reasons for not rejecting theism. (p. 12)

   What is that statement, and what is the significant negative evidential
   relation it bears to theism? As for the statement:

   Now let "O" stand for a statement reporting both the observations one
   has made of humans and animals experiencing pain or pleasure and the
   testimony one has encountered concerning the observations others have
   made of sentient beings experiencing pain and pleasure. By "pain" I
   mean physical or mental suffering of any sort. (pp. 13-14)

   So O is the statement that bears a "significant negative evidential
   relation to theism." Note that O is person relative: each of us will
   have her own O, and my O may differ from yours. My O, we might say,
   sets out the facts about the magnitude, variety, distribution,
   duration, and the like (for short, the disposition') of pleasure and
   pain as I know them; yours does the same for you.

   But what is this significant negative evidential relation in which O
   stands to theism? Here Draper bows in the direction of David Hume: most
   contemporary philosophers of religion (unlike Hume) "fail to recognize
   that one cannot determine what facts about evil theism needs to explain
   or how well it needs to explain them without considering alternatives
   to theism" (p. 13). The important question is "whether or not any
   serious hypothesis that is logically inconsistent with theism explains
   some significant set of facts about evil or about good and evil much
   better than theism does" (p. 13). And the answer to this important
   question, says Draper, is that indeed there is such a serious
   hypothesis, one that is both inconsistent with theism and explains some
   significant facts about good and evil much better than theism does.
   This is the "hypothesis of indifference" (HI, for short):

   HI: Neither the nature nor the condition of sentient beings on earth is
   the result of benevolent or malevolent actions performed by non-human
   persons. (p. 13) [585]

   HI, of course, is inconsistent with theism (taking the latter to entail
   that the world has been created by a person who is wholly good as well
   as omnipotent and omniscient). Draper's claim is that:

   C: HI explains the facts O reports much better than theism does. (p.
   14)

   He claims furthermore that if one could show that there is a serious
   hypothesis that is incompatible with theism and explains O much better
   than theism does, then "one would have a prima facie good reason to
   believe that this alternative hypothesis is more probable than theism
   and hence that theism is probably false." [586] What is it for a
   proposition to explain' something like the facts that O reports?

   I will reformulate C as the claim that the facts O reports are much
   more surprising on theism than they are on HI, or, more precisely, that
   the antecedent probability of O is much greater on the assumption that
   HI is true than on the assumption that theism is true. (p. 14)

   I take it the more precise formulation is the operative one here; we
   aren't really talking about explanation [587] but just about the
   antecedent probabilities of O on theism and HI. Accordingly, we must
   ask what this antecedent probability' is. "By the antecedent'
   probability of O," says Draper, "I mean O's probability, independent of
   (rather than prior to) the observations and testimony it reports" (p.
   14). So the antecedent probability of O is the probability of O on
   something like the rest of what I know. [588]

   Finally, the probability in question is epistemic probability, not (for
   example) logical, statistical, or physical probability. And what is
   epistemic probability?

   The concept of epistemic probability is an ordinary concept of
   probability for which no adequate philosophical analysis has, in my
   opinion, been proposed. As a first approximation, however, perhaps the
   following analysis will do:

   Relative to K, p is epistemically more probable than q, where K is an
   epistemic situation and p and q are propositions, just in case any
   fully rational person in K would have a higher degree of belief in p
   than in q. (p. 27, footnote 2)

   As Draper says, epistemic probability is an ordinary concept that is
   difficult to analyze or explain; suppose we provisionally accept his
   proposed first approximation. [589] (I take it there is an implicit
   restriction to human persons; how things might go with other rational
   creatures is not our present concern.) What does K include? What goes
   into an epistemic situation? We shall have to return to this question
   later; for now, let's say initially that K, for a given person S, would
   include at least some of the other propositions S believes, as well as
   the experiences S is undergoing and perhaps has undergone; it would
   also include what S remembers, possibly a specification of S's
   epistemic environment, and no doubt more besides.

   Now we see the general shape of the argument: the first premise is C,
   the claim that the antecedent epistemic probability of O given HI is
   much greater than the antecedent probability of O given theism. And
   second, if C is true, says Draper, then "we have a prima facie good
   epistemic reason to reject theism--that is, a reason that is sufficient
   for rejecting theism unless overridden by other reasons for not
   rejecting theism" (p. 12). Here he is apparently relying on a general
   principle, perhaps something like

   (1) For any propositions P and Q and person S, if S believes P and Q
   and there is a serious hypothesis R that is incompatible with P and
   such that the antecedent epistemic probability of Q with respect to R
   for S is much greater than the antecedent epistemic probability of Q
   with respect to P for S, then S has a prima facie good epistemic reason
   to reject P.

   Draper's claim is that the antecedent epistemic probability of O on HI
   is much greater than on theism, and because HI is a serious hypothesis
   and is inconsistent with theism, we have a prima facie good reason for
   rejecting theism:

   Now suppose I succeed in showing that C is true (relative to our own
   and my reader's epistemic situations.) Then the truth of C is (for us)
   a prima facie good (epistemic) reason to believe that theism is less
   probable than HI. Thus, since the denial of theism is obviously
   entailed by HI and so is at least as probable as HI, the truth of C is
   a prima facie good reason to believe that theism is less probable than
   not. And since it is epistemically irrational to believe both that
   theism is true and that it is less probable than not, the truth of C is
   also a prima facie good reason to reject (i.e., to cease or refrain
   from believing) theism. (p. 14)

   The claim, then, is that the truth of C gives me a "prima facie good
   reason to believe that theism is less probable than not"--that is, that
   its probability is less than .5. Less probable than not with respect to
   what? The answer must be K. The idea is that the truth of C gives me a
   prima facie good reason for thinking that theism is improbable with
   respect to my noetic situation; hence, unless I can find some reasons
   for theism, the rational thing to do is to give it up. [590] We could
   put this by saying that, according to Draper, my knowledge of the truth
   of C gives me a defeater for theism, unless I can find some reasons for
   it; alternatively, it gives me a potential defeater for theism, a
   potential defeater that will be actual unless I can find those reasons
   for theism.

      2. On Being Evidentially Challenged

   This is a subtle challenge and a fascinating new entry into the lists;
   Draper deploys it with power and sophistication. Nevertheless I think
   the argument utterly fails to show that traditional Christian theism is
   threatened by a defeater or epistemologically threatened in some other
   way. Suppose we take a closer look. Now Draper's argument really has
   two premises, C and (1). I have argued elsewhere [591] that in fact C
   is false: it is not the case that the amount, duration, and
   distribution of pain and pleasure, as I understand it, are more
   probable on HI than on theism. Here I want to focus on the other
   premise, the claim that if, in fact, O is much more likely on a serious
   alternative hypothesis like HI than on theism, then the theist has a
   prima facie reason to reject theism. Why think a thing like that?
   Suppose (contrary to fact, as I see it) C were true: what kind and how
   much of a challenge to theistic belief would this be? How widespread is
   this alleged evidential disability? Before we can answer this question,
   however, we must ask another: what, exactly, is a serious alternative
   hypothesis? Draper's answer: "Specifically, one hypothesis is a
   serious' alternative to another only if (i) it is not ad hoc--the facts
   to be explained are not arbitrarily built into it--and (ii) it is at
   least as plausible initially as the other hypothesis." [592] Condition
   (i) requires no present comment; what about condition (ii)? How are we
   to understand plausibility' here? I think Draper means to abstract from
   specific epistemic situations: we are to think of the plausibility of a
   hypothesis as depending not on considerations such as the specific
   evidence (propositional and nonpropositional) I may have for or against
   it, but on more general considerations such as its scope and
   specificity, and perhaps how it fits in with what is generally known (a
   hypothesis entailing that the world is flat wouldn't be plausible).
   Thus, for example, he defends the plausibility of HI as follows:

   And it [HI] is at least as plausible initially as G [i.e., theism].
   After all, G is a very specific supernaturalist hypothesis with strong
   ontological commitments. If, on the other hand, we take the
   Indifference Hypothesis to be the hypothesis that the first causes of
   the universe, if there are any, are neither benevolent nor malevolent,
   then the Indifference Hypothesis is consistent with naturalism as well
   as with many supernaturalist hypotheses and its ontological commitments
   are much weaker than G's. [593]

   So what counts for plausibility are these general facts about relative
   scope and strength. Still further, if I had to consider the specific
   evidence I have (propositional or otherwise) for HI to evaluate its
   plausibility, I would have to take any reasons I have for theism as
   evidence against HI; HI might then be very implausible for me. So
   plausibility must abstract from such specific evidence.

   Suppose we say that a proposition P is evidentially challenged for S if
   it satisfies the antecedent of (1): P is evidentially challenged for a
   person S if and only if S believes P and there are propositions Q and R
   such that S believes Q, R is a serious hypothesis incompatible with P,
   and Q is much more probable with respect to R than with respect to P.
   What (1) claims, therefore, is that if a proposition P is evidentially
   challenged for S, then S has a prima facie good epistemic reason for
   rejecting P--for being agnostic with respect to it or believing its
   denial. Is this really true? Is being evidentially challenged a serious
   handicap?

   Well, how widespread is it? How many of my beliefs are evidentially
   challenged, for me? More, perhaps, than we might initially think. For
   example, here are three more propositions related, for me, as are
   theism, O and HI:

   (2) George is a non-Catholic academic,

   (3) George is a professor at Notre Dame,

   and

   (4) George is a Catholic academic.

   First, I believe both (2) and (3). Second, (3) is vastly more likely on
   (4) (relative to K) than it is on (2). (After all, the proportion of
   Catholic academics who are professors at Notre Dame is many times
   greater than that of non-Catholic academics who are professors there.)
   Further, (4) is incompatible with (2). Still further, (4) is a serious
   hypothesis: it is not ad hoc, and it is as plausible as (2). (True, I
   have a lot of evidence for (2)--the fact, e.g., that George is an elder
   in the Christian Reformed Church, which is non-Catholic, the fact that
   George has always claimed to be a Protestant, and so on--but as we saw
   above, this specific evidence isn't relevant to the plausibility of
   (4).) So (2) is evidentially challenged for me. Does this fact give me
   a good reason to reject (1)? (Should I reconsider: George is a
   professor at Notre Dame, after all, and that is much more likely on (4)
   than on (2); so maybe he's really a Catholic?) Not clearly.

   A similar trio of propositions:

   (2*) I am in my study,

   (3*) I am within four feet of a dog,

   and

   (4*) I am at the dog pound.

   Again, I believe (2*) and (3*); (4*) is a serious (in Draper's sense)
   alternative to (2*), and (3*) is much more likely on (4*) than it is on
   (2*) (usually there aren't any dogs in my study); therefore (2*) is
   evidentially challenged for me. So, incidentally, is (3*) itself:

   (3*) I am within four feet of a dog,

   (5) I hear no doggie sounds such as barking, growling, panting, or
   jingling of tags,

   and

   (6) I am not within earshot of any dogs.

   Again, (6) is a serious alternative hypothesis to (3*), and (5) is much
   more likely with respect to (6) than it is with respect to (3*). (3*),
   therefore, is evidentially challenged for me. A couple of more
   examples: my friend has a cat named Maynard; I believe that Maynard is
   a cat and also (as my friend reports) that Maynard likes cooked green
   beans; the latter, however, is much more likely on the serious (in
   Draper's sense) alternative hypothesis that Maynard is a Frisian, or
   possibly a Frenchman; so the belief that Maynard is a cat is
   evidentially challenged for me. I believe (naturally enough) that you
   are a human being; you and I are on a walk in the woods, however, so I
   also believe that you are in a forest; of course that proposition is
   vastly more likely on the serious alternative hypothesis that you are a
   tree; so the belief that you are a human being is evidentially
   challenged for me. (As far as that goes, so is the belief that I am a
   human being.)

   I think you get the picture. It seems likely that most of what we
   believe--at any rate for propositions that are contingent in the
   broadly logical sense--is also evidentially challenged. I don't know
   how to give a proof of this claim (it probably isn't worth spending a
   whole lot of time trying to find a proof); but it certainly seems
   likely to be the case. And this suggests that a challenge of this sort
   is not very significant by itself or in the general case. If most of
   the propositions I believe face an evidential challenge, then I don't
   learn much of interest about theism by learning that it, too, faces
   such a challenge.

   Under what conditions (if any) would a challenge of this sort be
   significant? What sorts of beliefs are such that their being subject to
   an evidential challenge gives us serious reason to doubt them? Here we
   think first of scientific hypotheses. I propose a hypothesis H* to
   explain the behavior of gases: you point out that certain data are more
   probable with respect to another hypothesis H' incompatible with mine;
   that certainly seems to be a strong prima facie reason to doubt my
   hypothesis. Of course the data must be relevant data, the sort of data
   H* is in the business of explaining. Suppose Sam presently feels a mild
   pain in his left knee. That is much less probable with respect to H*
   than with respect to the hypothesis H': Overcome by astonishment at
   learning that H* is false, Sam fell and injured his knee; still, that
   is nothing whatever against H*. For the typical scientific hypothesis
   H, there will be a body of relevant data (past and future as well as
   present) such that the success of H depends on how well it explains
   that data; and many scientific hypotheses (at least on the most usual
   stories) get all or nearly all of their warrant from the fact that they
   account for the relevant data. [594] A proposition of that sort is
   seriously threatened by a relevant evidential challenge. If I discover
   that a belief of this sort is subject to an evidential challenge, then
   I do have substantial evidence against it and a strong prima facie
   reason to give it up.

   As I have argued throughout this book, however, it is an enormous
   assumption to think that belief in God or, more broadly, the larger set
   of Christian (or Jewish or Muslim) beliefs of which belief in God is a
   part, is in this respect like a scientific hypothesis. Not only is this
   assumption enormous: it is also false. The warrant for these beliefs,
   if they have warrant, does not derive from the fact (if it is a fact)
   that they properly explain some body of data. For most believers,
   theistic belief is part of a larger whole (a Christian or Muslim or
   Jewish whole); it is accepted as part of that larger whole and is not
   ordinarily accepted because it is an explanation of anything; hence its
   rationality or warrant, if it has some, does not depend on its nicely
   explaining some body of data. [595]

   Still, does this fact, crucially important as it is, deliver theism
   from Draper's evidential challenge? Is it only scientific hypotheses
   for which (relevant) evidential challenges are serious? No. Suppose you
   are under the impression that your friend Paul has been vacationing on
   Cape Cod for the last couple of weeks (you have a rather weak memory
   that this is where he said he was going), but the postcards you get
   from him were mailed from Grand Teton National Park; he doesn't say in
   the postcards where he is, but he does note the remarkably dry air, as
   well as the great differences between day and night temperatures. Then
   I think your belief that he is vacationing at Cape Cod is seriously
   challenged (a relevant alternative hypothesis being that he is
   vacationing in the Tetons). And this is true even though the warrant
   for your belief that he was vacationing on the Cape didn't arise as a
   result of its properly explaining data of one kind or another. So it
   isn't just scientific hypotheses that can be called into question by
   virtue of facing a relevant evidential challenge.

   Suppose we look a bit deeper here. That I am in my study (and not at
   the dog pound), that Maynard is a cat, that you are a human
   being--these are all subject to an evidential challenge; of course that
   doesn't suggest for a moment that there is something irrational or
   problematic in these beliefs, or that they are improbable with respect
   to our epistemic situations. Why not? Because each of these
   propositions has a good deal of warrant for me, warrant that is
   independent of its probabilistic relationships to the beliefs involved
   in the evidential challenges. In cases like this, being evidentially
   challenged comes to very little. And it isn't even necessary that the
   belief in question have a high degree of warrant. I believe rather
   infirmly (I have a relatively weak memory belief here) that the
   population of greater New York City is more than 17 million; I also
   believe that the area of greater New York City is 1,384 square miles;
   that proposition is many times more likely with respect to the serious
   alternative hypothesis that the population of New York City is less
   than 10 million. My belief that the population of New York City is more
   than 17 million is therefore subject to an evidential challenge; that
   fact doesn't provide me with a prima facie defeater for it, even though
   it doesn't have a high degree of warrant. Perhaps most of what I
   believe faces an evidential challenge, but most of what I believe (so
   one thinks) also has warrant of one kind or another; and when it does,
   an evidential challenge doesn't amount to much. With respect to most of
   what I believe, being evidentially challenged does not threaten to
   serve as a defeater for the proposition in question, and neither does
   my knowing, if I do, that it is evidentially challenged. Neither the
   challenge nor the knowledge, in the case of the propositions mentioned,
   puts me in a condition where, if I continue to believe the challenged
   proposition, I am irrational or in some other way out of line,
   epistemically speaking. And that is because the propositions in
   question get warrant from such sources as perception, memory, sympathy,
   testimony, a priori intuition, and the like; they do not depend, for
   their warrant, on their relation to such propositions as those
   furnishing the evidential challenge.

   Well then, how does it stand with theism? According to Draper,
   "Establishing the truth of H [that theistic belief faces an evidential
   challenge] would be insignificant if the typical theist could
   rationally continue to believe that God exists after learning that H is
   true." [596] What I propose to argue here is that the typical theist
   can rationally continue to believe that God exists after learning that
   theism faces an evidential challenge. Suppose I accept traditional
   Christian belief, including, of course, theistic belief. Now suppose I
   come to believe that in fact theistic belief is subject to an
   evidential challenge. I don't as a matter of fact believe that the
   pattern of pain and pleasure in the world does provide such a
   challenge--at any rate I don't think Draper's argument for this
   conclusion is successful--but suppose I come to believe that there is
   an evidential challenge of this or some other kind for Christian or
   theistic belief. Would that give me a defeater for my theistic belief?
   Would it make it irrational for me to continue believing?

   Not if that belief has any significant degree of warrant for me.
   Suppose Christian and theistic belief has a good deal of warrant for me
   by way of faith and the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit (IIHS)
   (see above pp. 249ff.); then the fact that theism is evidentially
   challenged doesn't give me a defeater and doesn't bring it about that
   my theistic belief is irrational. Compare the case of Maynard and my
   belief that he is a cat. You point out that this belief suffers from an
   evidential challenge: that he likes cooked green beans is much less
   likely on his being a cat than on his being a Frisian. I agree, but am
   undeterred, continuing in full rationality to believe that he is indeed
   a cat. This belief is rational for me in these circumstances because it
   has warrant for me quite independent of its relationship to the
   proposition that Maynard likes cooked green beans. There is of course
   no cognitive malfunction involved in my continuing to hold a belief
   with significant warrant from such sources as memory, perception, IIHS,
   and the like, even when I learn that the belief is subject to an
   evidential challenge. Our cognitive design plan permits, indeed,
   requires maintaining such a belief in the face of such a "challenge."
   And clearly the same goes for my theistic belief, if, in fact, it has
   warrant in the way proposed in chapter 8.

   And this is true even if I don't myself believe that theistic belief
   has warrant for me. Perhaps I have never thought much about
   epistemology, have at best a hazy idea as to what warrant is, and have
   never considered such questions as whether a proposition's being
   evidentially challenged gives me a reason for rejecting it. You point
   out that my belief that Maynard is a cat is evidentially challenged; I
   continue (in my epistemological innocence) to believe as firmly as
   before that Maynard is a cat; neither the rationality nor the warrant
   of that belief is diminished. Again, the same goes for theistic belief,
   if it has significant warrant for me. You point out that theism is
   evidentially challenged for me: I agree that that is so and continue to
   believe as firmly as before; if Christian belief and hence theism do
   have significant warrant for me, my continuing so to believe is wholly
   rational and remains warranted. It is perfectly rational, internally,
   because it still seems obviously true to me; it is perfectly rational,
   externally, because the belief in question is held under the conditions
   of warrant. If it had sufficient warrant for knowledge before you made
   your point about its being evidentially challenged, it still has
   sufficient warrant.

   So if theistic belief has significant warrant for me, then (in the
   typical case and provided I do not believe that it lacks warrant) my
   coming to believe that it faces an evidential challenge does not
   provide me with a defeater for it. Here we see a special case of a
   pattern we have seen before. I argued in chapters 6 and 8 that if
   theistic and Christian belief is true, then very likely it has warrant.
   A consequence is that if Christian belief is true, then very likely (in
   the typical case) an evidential challenge to theism is an insignificant
   challenge.

   But even if theism has little or no warrant, it could still be (and in
   the typical case would still be) that an evidential challenge doesn't
   provide a real challenge or a prima facie defeater. Analogy: perhaps I
   am once more told by my friend that she has a pet named Maynard who is
   a cat but nonetheless loves cooked green beans; having never met this
   Maynard, I believe on the basis of my friend's testimony that Maynard
   is a cat. As it turns out, my friend is indulging (unbeknownst to me)
   her penchant for telling whimsical (and false) stories. Then my belief
   that Maynard is a cat has little by way of warrant: the epistemic
   minienvironment (see above, pp. 158ff.) isn't right, being polluted by
   my friend's thus lying to me, so that the environmental condition for
   warrant is not met. Still, my belief that Maynard is a cat is (all else
   being equal) entirely rational (even if not warranted), both internally
   and externally; and that holds even though I am quite aware that it is
   evidentially challenged. The same can be true for theistic belief.
   Perhaps I mistakenly but rationally believe that it has warrant; I
   rationally believe that some of the theistic arguments, for example,
   are very strong, or I believe, mistakenly, in some story like the one
   told in chapters 6 and 8, according to which theistic belief does
   indeed have warrant. Under those conditions, my theistic belief does
   not, in fact, have warrant; nevertheless, my learning that it is
   subject to an evidential challenge does not compromise its rationality
   and does not give me a defeater for it.

   So when could a belief's being evidentially challenged (more exactly,
   my knowledge that it is evidentially challenged) actually offer me a
   defeater for a belief and make it irrational for me to continue to hold
   it? I can see two sorts of cases in which learning that theism is
   subject to an evidential challenge could be a defeater for it. First,
   suppose I am a theist, am rational in accepting this belief, but hold
   it with little firmness and furthermore think my reasons for it are
   absolutely minimal--barely sufficient for holding the belief
   rationally. Then if I learn that theism is subject to an evidential
   challenge, perhaps I have a defeater for it. I say perhaps' advisedly;
   the situation isn't really clear.

   The second sort of situation is clearer. Consider a belief B I accept
   because I think it the best explanation of a certain range of data D; B
   has no warrant apart from its properly explaining D, and I am aware of
   this fact. Finding that B is subject to an evidential challenge, one
   thinks, gives me a defeater for it--provided that the belief that is
   more probable with respect to the alternative hypothesis is one that B
   is supposed to explain. I believe the butler did it: my only reason for
   so believing is that this hypothesis best explains all the facts and
   circumstances of the crime. Now I come to see that the hypothesis that
   Lady Fauntleroy did the deed better explains some of those facts and
   circumstances. [597] Then my belief that the butler did it faces a
   relevant evidential challenge, a challenge which is prima facie a
   defeater for that belief. (Of course it doesn't matter if some
   alternative hypothesis better explains the fact that Beijing is a large
   city.) So suppose I accept theism as a hypothesis; I accept it because
   I think it the best explanation of some range of phenomena including
   the origin of the universe, the reality and objectivity of right and
   wrong, and also the distribution of pain and pleasure. Suppose,
   furthermore, I rightly believe that I have no other sort of reason for
   theistic belief--no promptings from the IIHS, or from the sensus
   divinitatis, or from the testimony of others. I believe that I have no
   other source and am correct in that belief. Now suppose I come to think
   that the Indifference Hypothesis, or naturalism, or something else does
   a better job of explaining the magnitude, duration, and distribution of
   pain and pleasure: then my theistic belief would be subject to an
   evidential challenge, a challenge that is prima facie a defeater for
   theistic belief and a reason for giving it up. (Even then, however, I
   might conclude that theism did a better job of explaining some other
   relevant phenomena.)

   So there are some situations in which an evidential challenge--not just
   any old evidential challenge, but a relevant one--does furnish a
   defeater: cases where someone believes that the warrant enjoyed by his
   theistic belief is minimal, and cases where he believes that the
   warrant theism has for him depends just on its explaining a certain
   range of phenomena. Most theists, however, are not in either of these
   conditions. Are there other conditions in which theists often find
   themselves, conditions in which coming to see that theism faces an
   evidential challenge really does provide a defeater or a prima facie
   defeater for theistic belief? I doubt very much that the typical theist
   is in any such condition. I therefore think Draper's challenge, subtle
   and sophisticated as it is, fails; in his own words, "the typical
   theist could rationally continue to believe that God exists after
   learning that H [that theism is evidentially challenged] is true."

   that does not contain or entail O. This still isn't quite right: the
   noetic structure in question also can't contain or entail some

   noetic structure that contains no propositions about the distribution
   of pain and pleasure and is otherwise as similar as possible to mine.

   to conclude only that other evidence held equal . . . it is highly
   probable that theism is false." What is it to hold other evidence
   equal? Here's a suggestion: it would be to consider the probability of
   theism with respect to an evidential situation that was as similar as
   possible to mine, given that it contained no evidence for or against
   theistic belief, or given that the evidence it contained for theistic
   belief was precisely balanced by the evidence it contained against
   theistic belief.

   that it properly accounts for those data, but from the fact that I have
   been told and believe that it does (in such away as to satisfy the
   conditions for warrant). But if those conditions are indeed satisfied,
   then there must be someone at the other end of the testimonial chain
   for whom these beliefs have warrant in some way other than by
   testimony. See WPF, chapter 4.

   [595] See my "Is Theism Really a Miracle?" and see above, pp. 330ff. I

   get more warrant by nicely explaining something else one believes.

  II. Nonargumentative Defeaters? [598]

   These new arguments by Rowe and Draper are subtle and sophisticated;
   many deep and interesting topics come up in considering them. Upon
   close examination, however, they fail, and fail resoundingly. They fail
   to provide a defeater for theistic belief and, indeed, give the person
   on the fence little if any reason to prefer atheism to theism. They are
   not much of an improvement over the older "if I can't see any reason
   God might have for permitting that evil E, then probably he doesn't
   have any" kind of argument. If the facts of evil really do provide a
   substantial challenge to Christian or theistic belief, it must be by a
   wholly different route; the probabilistic relationships to which Rowe
   and Draper point do not carry sufficient epistemic clout. And indeed
   the fact is most defeaters do not proceed by way of the subject's
   becoming aware of probabilistic relationships. I have always thought
   your name was Sam: you tell me that Sam is only your nickname and that
   your name is really Ahab; I then give up the belief that your name is
   Sam. But I don't do so because I think that your name's being Sam is
   unlikely, given that you say it is Ahab, or that it is more probable
   that you would say your name is Ahab on the hypothesis that it is Ahab
   than on the hypothesis that it is Sam. The defeat doesn't seem to go
   via probabilistic argumentation. I see what I take to be a patch of
   snow on a distant crag; as I approach a bit closer, however, the patch
   apparently moves; I no longer believe it is a patch of snow--perhaps
   it's a mountain goat? Again, I don't engage in probabilistic reasoning.
   I thought your zip code was 49506; then I get a letter from you with a
   return address that includes zip code 49508; I no longer believe that
   it is 49506, but not because of probabilistic reasoning. In most actual
   cases of defeat, probabilistic reasoning apparently doesn't enter in.

   And perhaps something similar holds with respect to evil. There is no
   cogent argument for the conclusion that the existence of evil is
   incompatible with the existence of God; there is also no serious
   evidential or probabilistic argument from evil; fair enough. It doesn't
   follow that suffering and evil do not constitute a serious obstacle to
   Christian belief or theistic belief, and it doesn't follow that they do
   not constitute a defeater for it. I have argued throughout that belief
   in God can be properly basic; rational belief in God does not depend on
   one's having or there being good arguments for the existence of God.
   Should something analogous be said for the facts of evil, thought of as
   a potential defeater for theistic belief? Perhaps the defeating power
   of these facts in no way depends on the existence of a good
   antitheistic argument (deductive, inductive, abductive, probabilistic,
   whatever) from the facts of evil.

   Clearly enough, suffering and evil do constitute some kind of problem
   for at least some believers in God; the Old Testament (in particular
   Job and Psalms) is full of examples. Indeed, there is the agonized cry
   uttered by Jesus Christ himself: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
   me?"--a cry in which he is echoing the words of Psalm 22. In the book
   of Job, a searching and powerful exploration of the facts of evil and
   human responses to them, Job thinks God is unfair to him; he is
   incensed, and challenges God to explain and justify himself. Countless
   others, in the grip of their own cruel suffering or the suffering of
   someone close to them, have found themselves angry with God; one can
   become resentful, mistrusting, antagonistic, hostile. Still, these
   situations don't typically produce a defeater for theistic belief. It
   isn't as if Jesus, or the psalmist, or Job is at all inclined to give
   up theistic belief. The problem is of a different order; it is a
   spiritual or pastoral problem rather than a defeater for theistic
   belief. Perhaps God permits my father, or my daughter, or my friend, or
   me to suffer in the most appalling way. I may then find myself thinking
   as follows: "No doubt he has all those dandy divine qualities and no
   doubt he has a fine reason for permitting this abomination--after all,
   I am no match for him with respect to coming up with reasons, reasons
   that are utterly beyond me--but what he permits is appalling, and I
   hate it!" I may want to tell him off face to face: "You may be
   wonderful, and magnificent, and omniscient and omnipotent (and even
   wholly good) and all that exalted stuff, but I utterly detest what you
   are doing!" A problem of this kind is not really an evidential problem
   at all, and it isn't a defeater for theism.

   Still, perhaps that's not the only realistic reaction here: perhaps I
   could react in this way, but aren't there other reactions in which I
   would have a defeater? Couldn't suffering and evil, under some
   circumstances, at any rate, actually serve as a defeater for belief in
   God? Think of some of the horrifying examples of evil our sad world
   displays. Dostoevski's classic depiction is fictional, but no less
   convincing and no less disturbing:

   "A Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow," Ivan went on, seeming not to hear
   his brother's words, "told me about the crimes committed by Turks and
   Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general rising
   of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and children,
   they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them so till
   morning, and in the morning they hang them--all sorts of things you
   can't imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a
   great injustice and insult to the beasts: a beast can never be so cruel
   as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's
   all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even
   if he were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing
   children, too; cutting the unborn child from the mother's womb, and
   tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their
   bayonets before their mother's eyes. Doing it before the mother's eyes
   was what gave zest to the amusement." [599]

   The list of atrocities human beings commit against others is horrifying
   and hideous; it is also so long, so repetitious, that it is finally
   wearying. Occasionally, though, new depths are reached:

   A young Muslim mother in Bosnia was repeatedly raped in front of her
   husband and father, with her baby screaming on the floor beside her.
   When her tormentors seemed finally tired of her, she begged permission
   to nurse the child. In response, one of the rapists swiftly decapitated
   the baby and threw the head in the mother's lap. [600]

   These things are absolutely horrifying; it is painful even to consider
   them, to bring them squarely before the mind. To introduce them into
   cool philosophical discussion like this is distressing and can seem
   inappropriate, even callous. And now the question: wouldn't a rational
   person think, in the face of this kind of appalling evil, that there
   just couldn't be an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good person
   superintending our world? Perhaps he can't give a demonstration that no
   perfect person could permit these things; perhaps there isn't a good
   probabilistic or evidential atheological argument either: but so what?
   Isn't it just apparent, just evident that a being living up to God's
   reputation couldn't permit things like that? Don't I have a defeater
   here, even if there is no good antitheistic argument from evil? Perhaps
   I don't in fact give up belief in God in the face of the facts of evil:
   might that not be because I simply can't bear the thought of living in
   a Godless universe? Because of some psychological mechanism not aimed
   at the truth, perhaps the sort of wish-fulfillment Freud suggests? If
   so, then suffering and evil (or rather, my apprehension of it) would or
   could be a defeater, [601] for me, for Christian belief, even though it
   doesn't eventuate in my giving up such belief.

   Something like this, I think, is the best version of the atheological
   case from evil. The claim is essentially that one who is properly
   sensitive and properly aware of the sheer horror of the evil displayed
   in our somber and unhappy world will simply see that no being of the
   sort God is alleged to be could possibly permit it. This is a sort of
   inverse sensus divinitatis: perhaps there is no good antitheistic
   argument from evil; but no argument is needed. An appeal of this sort
   will proceed, not by rehearsing arguments, but by putting the
   interlocutor in the sort of situation in which the full horror of the
   world's suffering and evil stands out clearly in all its loathsomeness.
   Indeed, from the atheological point of view, giving an argument is
   counterproductive here: it permits the believer in God to turn his
   attention away, to avert his eyes from the abomination of suffering, to
   take refuge in antiseptic discussions of possible worlds, probability
   functions, and other arcana. It diverts attention from the situations
   that in fact constitute a defeater for belief in God.

   Suppose we look into this claim. Recall first that a defeater for a
   belief is relative to a noetic structure; whether my new belief B is a
   defeater for an old belief B* depends upon what else I believe and what
   my experience is like. I believe that tree is a maple; you tell me it's
   really an elm; that will defeat my belief that it's a maple if I think
   you know what you are talking about and aim to tell the truth, but not
   if I think you are even less arboreally informed than I, or that there
   is only a fifty-fifty chance that you are telling what you take to be
   the truth. Coming to see the full horror of the evil the world displays
   might be a defeater for theistic belief with respect to some noetic
   structure and not with respect to others.

   What I want to argue first is that if classical Christianity is true,
   then the perception of evil is not a defeater for belief in God with
   respect to fully rational noetic structures--any noetic structure with
   no cognitive dysfunction, one in which all cognitive faculties and
   processes are functioning properly. From the point of view of classical
   Christianity (at any rate according to the model of chapters 6 and 8),
   this includes also the proper function of the sensus divinitatis.
   Someone in whom this process was functioning properly would have an
   intimate, detailed, vivid, and explicit knowledge of God; she would
   have an intense awareness of his presence, glory, goodness, power,
   perfection, wonderful attractiveness, and sweetness; and she would be
   as convinced of God's existence as of her own. She might therefore be
   perplexed by the existence of this evil in God's world--for God, she
   knows, hates evil with a holy and burning passion--but the idea that
   perhaps there just wasn't any such person as God would no doubt not so
   much as cross her mind. Confronted with evil and suffering, such a
   person might ask herself why God permits it; the facts of evil may be a
   spur to inquiry as well as to action. If she finds no answer, she will
   no doubt conclude that God has a reason that is beyond her ken; she
   won't be in the least inclined to doubt that there is such a person as
   God. For someone fully rational, therefore, the existence of evil
   doesn't so much as begin to constitute a defeater for belief in God.

   In an earlier piece of work I explained epistemic conditional
   probability (roughly, and ignoring complications and qualifications) as
   follows:

   The conditional epistemic probability of A on B, then, initially and to
   a first approximation, is the degree to which a rational person, a
   person whose faculties are functioning properly, would accept A given
   that she was certain of B, knew that she accepted B, reflectively
   considered A in the light of B, and had no other source of warrant or
   positive epistemic status for A or for its denial. [602]

   Then (no doubt because of youth, inexperience, and epistemic innocence)
   I went on to say that perhaps the existence of God was in this sense
   epistemically improbable on the existence of certain sorts of evil (p.
   576).

   But first, that account of epistemic probability doesn't have this
   result--more exactly, it doesn't clearly apply in this case, or any
   case where a belief has positive epistemic status or warrant for a
   person S just by virtue of S's being rational in the sense in question.
   [603] On the extended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model, the sensus
   divinitatis is among our cognitive faculties or processes; if it is
   functioning properly in S, then the belief that there is such a person
   as God will automatically have warrant for S. Applied to the existence
   of God taken as A and that of any sort of evil as B, the definition
   will not yield the consequence that the former is improbable on the
   latter; that is because the condition expressed by the last clause in
   the definition, "and had no other source of warrant or positive
   epistemic status for A or for its denial," will not be satisfied by
   belief in the existence of God, if the believer's cognitive faculties
   are functioning properly.

   Further: consider a person S in whom the sensus divinitatis does not,
   in fact, function properly; S has only a sort of weak and pro forma
   residual belief in God, left over from the religion of his childhood.
   Add that S suffers just from that cognitive malfunction (and no other).
   Now suppose S becomes seriously aware of the facts of evil and thinks
   about them in connection with the existence of God: perhaps, given
   these conditions, S will give up belief in God, or come to think it
   improbable with respect to his evidence. Would it follow that the facts
   of evil are in some sense negative evidence with respect to the
   existence of God, evidence that is counterbalanced and outweighed in a
   fully rational noetic structure by the positive evidence provided by a
   properly functioning sensus divinitatis? No. For perhaps various
   modules of the cognitive establishment are designed to work together.
   If so, the deliverances of one module m that isn't itself subject to
   dysfunction might still have no epistemic standing, given the failure
   of another module m*. m's functioning in this way--that is, the way it
   functions when there is malfunction of m* but no malfunction in m,
   given the malfunction of m*--might not be part of the design plan at
   all. When the electric current is fluctuating because of a problem in
   the wiring, the air raid siren emits a weak and pathetic squeak; it
   doesn't follow that the vibrating disk that produces the sound is
   designed to produce that squeak under those conditions. True, it is
   designed in such a way that in fact it will produce that squeak then;
   but its doing so is not part of the design plan. Its functioning in
   this way under those conditions will of course be part of its maxiplan
   (WPF, pp. 22ff.). It does not follow that its behaving in this way is
   part of its design plan; that behavior might be, instead, an unintended
   by-product rather than part of the design plan itself. And the same
   goes for the sensus divinitatis and the other processes actually
   involved in the production or suppression of theistic belief. Perhaps
   the sensus divinitatis and the sensus probabilitatis' are designed to
   work together as a unit; if so, the deliverances of one in the presence
   of the malfunction of the other need not enjoy any degree of
   rationality or warrant at all. Hence the sort of situation envisaged
   doesn't show that the facts of evil are any kind of evidence against
   the existence of God.

   On the A/C model, therefore, the facts of evil do not constitute any
   sort of defeater for theistic belief for a fully rational person, one
   all of whose cognitive faculties are functioning properly. Nevertheless
   (so the wily atheologian will claim), that fact is at best of dubious
   relevance with respect to the question whether Christian believers in
   God--the ones there actually are--have a defeater for theism in the
   world's ills. For according to Christian doctrine itself, none of us
   human beings enjoys this pristine condition of complete rationality.
   The sensus divinitatis has been heavily damaged by sin; for most of us
   most of the time the presence of God is not evident. For many of us
   (much of the time, anyway) both God's existence and his goodness are a
   bit shadowy and evanescent, nowhere nearly as evident as the existence
   of other people or the trees in the backyard. Relative to a fully
   rational noetic structure (one of an unfallen human being, say),
   knowledge of the facts of evil may constitute no defeater for theism;
   relative to the sorts of noetic structures we human beings actually
   have, however (so the claim goes), they do. Given the noetic results of
   sin (see chapter 7), the typical believer in God does have a defeater
   in the facts of evil.

   To pursue this line, however, would be to neglect still another feature
   of Christian belief: that the damage to the sensus divinitatis is in
   principle and increasingly repaired in the process of faith (see
   chapter 8) and regeneration. The person of faith may be once more such
   that, at least on some occasions, the presence of God is completely
   evident to her. In addition, she knows of the divine love revealed in
   the incarnation, the unthinkable splendor of the suffering and death of
   Jesus Christ, himself the divine and unique son of God, on our behalf.
   Of course this knowledge does not provide an answer to the question,
   Why does God permit evil? It is nonetheless of crucial importance here.
   [604] I read of one more massive atrocity and am perhaps shaken. But
   then I think of the inconceivably great love displayed in Christ's
   suffering and death, his willingness to empty himself and take on the
   nature of a servant, his willingness to suffer and die so that we
   sinful human beings can achieve redemption; and my faith may be
   restored. I still can't imagine why God permits this suffering, or why
   he permits people to torture and kill each other, or why he permits
   gigantic and horrifying social experiments such as Nazism and
   communism, or why he permits a Holocaust; nevertheless I see that he is
   willing to share in our suffering, to undergo enormous suffering
   himself, and to undergo it for our sakes. Confronted with a
   particularly loathsome example of evil, therefore, I may find myself
   inclined to question God, perhaps even to be angry and resentful: "Why
   should I or my family suffer to promote his (no doubt exalted) ends,
   when I don't have even a glimmer of an idea as to how my suffering
   contributes to some good?" But then I think of the divine willingness
   to endure greater suffering on my behalf and am comforted or, at any
   rate, quieted. And here is a respect in which Christian theism has a
   resource for dealing with evil that is not available to other forms of
   theism. [605] Note that probabilities have little to do with the
   matter. Such a person doesn't reason thus: it's not very likely that an
   omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good person would permit such
   atrocities--but it's more likely that such a being who was himself
   willing to undergo suffering on our behalf would permit them. The
   comfort involved here doesn't go by way of probabilistic reasoning.

   There is much to be said about the Christian meaning of suffering,
   [606] and much of it provides further epistemic resources for dealing
   with evil. Perhaps our suffering is deeply connected with the
   possibility of salvation for human beings; [607] perhaps we share in
   Christ's suffering in such a way that our suffering too is salvific,
   and perhaps even essential to the plan of salvation. [608] Someone who
   suffers may then look forward to receiving the divine gratitude for
   taking part in this project of salvation, [609] and to enjoying forever
   the love and approval of God; she may then concur with Paul: "We are
   fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we
   may also be glorified with him." [610] She may thus reflect that human
   suffering is in a way an occasion of gratitude. There is another way in
   which it is perhaps an occasion for gratitude. It is plausible to think
   that the best possible worlds God could have actualized contain the
   unthinkably great good of divine incarnation and redemption--but then,
   of course, also sin and suffering. God chooses one of these worlds to
   be actual--and in it, humankind suffers. Still, in this world there is
   also the marvelous opportunity for redemption and for eternal
   fellowship with God, an inconceivably great good that vastly outweighs
   the suffering we are called upon to endure. [611] Still further, in
   being offered eternal fellowship with God, we human beings are invited
   to join the charmed circle of the trinity itself; and perhaps that
   invitation can be issued only to creatures who have fallen, suffered,
   and been redeemed. [612] If so, the condition of humankind is vastly
   better than it would have been, had there been no sin and no suffering.
   O Felix Culpa, indeed!

   Accordingly, those who have faith (those in whom the process of
   regeneration has taken or is taking place) will also be such that the
   presence and goodness of God is to some degree evident to them; so for
   them the belief that there is such a person as God will have
   considerable warrant. They too, then, like someone in whom the sensus
   divinitatis had never been damaged, will feel little or no inclination
   to atheism or agnosticism when confronted with cases of horrifying
   evil. They may be perplexed; they may be shocked; they may be spurred
   both to action and to inquiry by the presence of appalling evil in
   God's world; but ceasing to believe will not be an option. If the
   salient suffering is their own, they may concur with the author of
   Psalm 119:75-76: "I know, O Lord, that your laws are righteous, and in
   faithfulness you have afflicted me. May your unfailing love be my
   comfort, according to your promise to your servant."

   They may also enjoy a blessed contentment. Consider, for example, this
   letter from Guido de Bres to his wife, written shortly before he was
   hanged:

   Your grief and anguish, troubling me in the midst of my joy and
   gladness, are the cause of my writing you this present letter. I most
   earnestly pray you not to be grieved beyond measure. . . . If the Lord
   had wished us to live together longer, He could easily have caused it
   to be so. . . . Let His good will be done, then, and let that suffice
   for all reason. . . . I pray you, my dear and faithful companion, to be
   glad with me, and to thank the good God for what He is doing, for He
   does nothing but what is altogether right and good. . . .

   I am shut up in the strongest and wretchedest of dungeons, so dark and
   gloomy that it goes by the name of the Black Hole. I can get but little
   air, and that of the foulest. I have on my hands and feet heavy irons
   which are a constant torture, galling the flesh even to my poor bones.
   But, notwithstanding all, my God fails not to make good His promise,
   and to comfort my heart, and to give me a most blessed content. [613]

   De Bres suffered greatly; yet he enjoyed a most blessed content. The
   furthest thing from his mind, no doubt, was the thought that maybe
   there wasn't any such person as God, that maybe he had been deceived
   all along. And this continuing to believe, given the model of chapter
   8, betrays no irrationality at all: it isn't as if he had a defeater
   for theistic belief in his suffering, but somehow suppressed it and
   (perhaps by way of wishful thinking) continued to believe anyway. No,
   his belief was instead a result of the proper function of the cognitive
   processes--a rejuvenated sensus divinitatis, the internal instigation
   of the Holy Spirit--that produce belief in God.

   Of course most of us are not in the spiritual condition of Guido de
   Bres. Not nearly all of us enjoy that comfort and content in the face
   of suffering. As Calvin points out (Institutes, III, ii, 15, p. 560),
   most of us sometimes have difficulty thinking that God is, indeed,
   benevolent toward us; and even the great masters of the spiritual life
   sometimes find themselves in spiritual darkness. [614] Christians must
   concede that their epistemic and spiritual situation differs widely
   from person to person, and within a given person from time to time.
   Aren't there any conditions at all, then, in which the facts of evil
   constitute a defeater for Christian belief?

   Well, I should think the right answer is "Probably not." Consider a
   person in whom the sensus divinitatis doesn't work at all well, a
   person who believes in God in a thoughtless and merely formal way, a
   person for whom the belief has no real vivacity or liveliness--perhaps
   such a person, on coming to a deep appreciation of the facts of evil,
   will ordinarily give up theistic belief. As I argued above, however
   (pp. 485ff.), that doesn't show that this person has a defeater for
   theistic belief. She has such a defeater only if it is part of our
   cognitive design plan to give up theistic belief in those
   circumstances; and we have no reason to think that it is. The design
   plan includes the proper function of the sensus divinitatis; how things
   actually go when that process does not function properly could be part
   of the design plan; more likely, though, it is an unintended by-product
   rather than a part of the design plan.

   Nevertheless, let's suppose, just for purposes of argument, that as a
   matter of fact such a person really does have a defeater for theistic
   belief. What it is important to see, here, is that if she does have a
   defeater, it is only because of a failure of rationality somewhere in
   her noetic structure (perhaps there is dysfunction with respect to the
   sensus divinitatis). And now suppose we return to our original
   question: does a person S who believes that there is such a person as
   God have a defeater in the facts of evil? We can now see that there is
   no reason to think so. The very fact that S continues in theistic
   belief is evidence that the sensus divinitatis is functioning properly
   to at least some degree in her, and in such a way that knowledge of the
   facts of evil does not constitute a defeater. It is perhaps possible
   (if failure to believe in these circumstances is part of the design
   plan) that she has a defeater; but there is no reason to think so. I
   conclude, therefore, that in all likelihood believers in God do not
   have defeaters for theistic belief in knowledge of the facts of evil.

   Of course all this is from the perspective of Christian theism. If
   Christian theism is true, then the existence of the sin and evil and
   suffering we see does not, in the typical case, constitute a defeater
   for belief in God. In particular, it doesn't constitute a defeater for
   Quinn's "intellectually sophisticated adult in our culture" (above, p.
   358), at least if she has given a little thought to the epistemology of
   the matter. Now someone who doesn't accept Christian theism may be
   unmoved by this fact; he may concede that from the standpoint of
   Christian theism, suffering and evil do not constitute a defeater for
   Christian belief; but (so he says) Christian theism is false. Hence
   this fact--that if it were true, evil would not constitute a defeater
   for Christian belief--cuts no ice with respect to his claim that, as a
   matter of fact, evil does constitute such a defeater. But if he is
   thinking of an internal defeater for theistic belief, then he is
   mistaken; knowledge of the facts of evil does not constitute an
   internal defeater, at least for those believers for whom it seems very
   clear that there is such a person as God and that, indeed, the whole
   Christian story is true. For such a person, this will seem clear even
   after he is fully aware of the evils the world contains and has thought
   hard about them. Therefore there is nothing internally irrational in
   his believing these things; it is not that he somehow fails to believe
   what seems to him clearly true or somehow mismanages epistemic matters
   downstream from experience. So if there is irrationality here, it must
   be external; it must be that this inclination to believe, this doxastic
   evidence, is itself a product of cognitive dysfunction, or else of
   cognitive processes not directed at truth. The Christian or theistic
   believer, naturally enough, won't agree: she will see her belief as the
   product of cognitive faculties functioning properly, functioning in the
   way God intended them to (and aimed at producing true beliefs).

   What we see here is another instance of a general pattern: once more it
   appears that questions about the rationality of belief in God (and in
   the whole Christian story) aren't merely epistemological. What a
   rational person will do when confronted with suffering and evil depends
   on what the cognitive design plan for human beings is; but from a
   filled-out Christian perspective, that design plan will be such that
   someone who (like Mother Teresa, e.g.) continues to accept Christian
   belief in the face of the world's suffering and evil displays no
   irrationality whatever. Indeed, it is the person who gives up belief in
   God under these circumstances who displays cognitive dysfunction; for
   such a person, the sensus divinitatis must be at least partly
   disordered. The atheologian can properly claim that evil constitutes a
   defeater for Christian belief, therefore, only if he already assumes
   that Christian belief is false. But then a Christian believer can't
   sensibly be expected to concede that she does have a defeater for
   Christian belief--at least until the atheologian produces a good reason
   or two for supposing Christian belief is false. Because she is a
   Christian believer, she will think, naturally enough, that her
   Christian belief is true, in which case the facts of evil do not defeat
   it.

   This chapter has been devoted to the question whether knowledge of the
   facts of evil constitutes a defeater for Christian belief. Of course
   there are many related projects lurking in the neighborhood. One of
   particular interest is that of employing the resources of the Christian
   faith in thinking about sin and evil--not in order to defend the
   epistemic status of Christian belief but as part of a larger project of
   Christian scholarship, of discerning the ways in which Christian belief
   illuminates many of the important areas of human concern. This is an
   extremely important task that hasn't received nearly the attention it
   deserves from Christian philosophers. [615] Here is one issue that
   arises in this area. According to Christian belief, God is wholly good,
   but also perfectly loving, loves each of his creatures with a perfect
   love. If so, could it be that he would permit a person S to suffer for
   the good of someone else (or, more abstractly, permit S to suffer
   because S's suffering is an element in the best world God can
   actualize)? If he is perfectly loving, wouldn't he permit S to suffer
   only in the interests of securing an outweighing good for S herself?
   This is a fascinating and complex issue; I don't have the space to deal
   with it properly. It is clear, however, that we need some distinctions.
   First, God (assuming that he is perfectly loving) could certainly
   permit someone to suffer for the good of someone else if, as in
   Christ's case, this suffering is voluntarily assumed. Suppose,
   therefore, my suffering is not voluntarily assumed: I am not able, for
   one reason or another, to make the decision whether to accept suffering
   (just as someone in a coma might not be able to make an important
   decision affecting her life). Suppose also God knew that if I were able
   to make that decision, I would accept the suffering: then too, so far
   as I can see, his being perfectly good wouldn't at all preclude his
   permitting me to suffer for the benefit of others. Alternatively,
   suppose I am able to make the decision and in fact would not accept the
   suffering; God knows that this unwillingness on my part would be due
   only to ignorance: if I knew the relevant facts, then I would accept
   the suffering. In that case too God's perfect goodness would not
   preclude his permitting me to suffer; and this would be true even if I
   were myself innocent of wrongdoing. Indeed, suppose what God knows is
   that if I knew enough and also had the right affections, then I would
   accept the suffering: in that case too, as far as I can see, his being
   perfectly loving would not preclude his allowing me to suffer.

   There is another distinction that must be made. Perhaps God's reason
   for permitting me to suffer is not that by undergoing this suffering I
   can thus achieve a greater good (the good of enjoying his gratitude,
   for example: see footnote 609) but because he can thus achieve a better
   world overall. Nevertheless, perhaps it is also true that he would not
   permit me to suffer for that end, an end outside my own good, unless he
   could also bring good for me out of the evil. Then his reason for
   permitting me to suffer would not be that this suffering contributes to
   my own improvement; nevertheless, he would not permit me to suffer
   unless the suffering could somehow be turned to my own good. A
   constraint on God's reasons (induced, perhaps, by his being perfectly
   loving) is one thing; a constraint on the conditions under which he
   would permit involuntary and innocent suffering is another. To return
   to an earlier example (above, p. 489), perhaps God sees that the best
   worlds he can actualize are ones that include the unthinkably great
   good of divine incarnation and atonement. Suppose he therefore
   actualizes a world a in which human beings fall into sin and evil,
   salvation from which is accomplished by incarnation and atonement. And
   suppose still further that the final condition of human beings, in a,
   is better than it is in the worlds in which there is no fall into sin
   but also no incarnation and redemption. Then God's actualizing a
   involves suffering for many human beings; his reason for permitting
   that suffering is not that thereby the suffering individuals will be
   benefited (his reason is that he wishes to actualize a very good world,
   one with the great good of incarnation, atonement, and redemption).
   Nevertheless his perfect goodness perhaps mandates that he actualize a
   world in which those who suffer are benefited in such a way that their
   condition is better than it is in those worlds in which they do not
   suffer.

   The book of Job gives splendid expression to some of the themes of this
   chapter. [616] As the story opens, Satan challenges God: his servant
   Job, he says, is a toady, a sycophantic timeserver who will turn on God
   and curse him to his face if things don't go his way. God disagrees,
   and then permits Satan to afflict Job, whose friends Eliphaz the
   Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite come to comfort
   and console him. After seven days and nights of silence (one pictures
   them hunkered down around a campfire), they tell him repeatedly and at
   great length that the righteous always prosper and the wicked always
   come to grief:

   Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the
   upright ever destroyed? As I have observed, those who plow evil and
   those who sow trouble reap it. (4:7-8)

   All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all
   the years stored up for him. Terrifying sounds fill his ear; when all
   seems well, marauders attack him. He despairs of escaping the darkness;
   he is marked for the sword. He wanders about--food for vultures. . . .
   Distress and anguish fill him with terror. . . . (15:20-24)

   So Job must be wicked indeed to warrant such great suffering:

   Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against
   you? Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless? . . . you
   stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked. You gave no water
   to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry, though you were a
   powerful man, owning land, an honored man, living on it. And you sent
   widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless. That
   is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you, why
   it is so dark you cannot see and why a flood of water covers you.
   (22:4-11)

   Job must repent and mend his ways:

   But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty, if you are
   pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and
   restore you to your rightful place. (8:5-6)

   Job is understandably nettled:

   Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you! But I have
   a mind as well as you. . . . (12:1-3)

   Miserable comforters are you all! Will your long-winded speeches never
   end? (16:2-3)

   He knows that the rain falls on the just and on the unjust, that the
   wicked often prosper:

   Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power? They
   see their children established around them, their offspring before
   their eyes. Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is
   not upon them. Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do
   not miscarry. They send forth their children as a flock; their little
   ones dance about. . . . They spend their years in prosperity and go
   down to the grave in peace. (21:7-13)

   Job also knows he has done nothing unusually heinous or wicked: "my
   hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure" (16:17). No
   doubt "no one does good, no, not one"; but Job is described in the
   prologue as "blameless and upright"; he knows that he isn't being
   singled out because he is so much more wicked than the rest of humanity
   (in particular, he is no greater sinner than Eliphaz, Bildad, or
   Zophar). So he begins to accuse God of treating him unfairly in
   permitting him to suffer in this way:

   then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me. (19:6)

   As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice. . . . (27:2)

   He doesn't fear to speak his mind to the Lord. Indeed, a certain
   suggestion of sarcasm sometimes creeps in: "Does it please you to
   oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the
   schemes of the wicked?" (10:3), as well as a certain
   self-righteousness: "So these three men stopped answering Job, because
   he was righteous in his own eyes" (32:1), and even a touch of defiance:
   "I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny
   my integrity. I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it .
   . . " (27:5-6). He believes that he is innocent of all wrongdoing and
   wants to go to court with God to get this thing straightened out:

   Oh that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense [after a
   lengthy recital of his virtues]--let the Almighty answer me; let my
   accuser put his indictment in writing. Surely I would wear it on my
   shoulder, I would put it on like a crown." (31:35-36)

   (Again, that note of sarcasm.) But when he ruefully recalls that God
   would be prosecuting attorney, judge, jury, and executioner, he isn't
   sanguine about the outcome:

   If I say, "I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and
   smile," I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold
   me innocent. (9:27-28)

   There are at least two ways we can understand Job here. In the first
   way, Job's problem is really intellectual; he can't see any reason at
   all why God should allow him to be afflicted as he is; he is inclined
   to conclude, unthinkingly, that probably God doesn't have a good
   reason. The point here is that the reason for Job's sufferings is
   something entirely beyond his knowledge or awareness; but then the fact
   that he can't see what sort of reason God might have for permitting his
   suffering doesn't even tend to suggest that God has no reason. And when
   God replies to Job, he doesn't tell him what his reason is for
   permitting these sufferings (perhaps Job couldn't so much as grasp or
   comprehend it). Instead, he attacks the implicit inference from Job's
   not being able to see what God's reason is to the notion that probably
   he has none; and he does this by pointing out how vast is the gulf
   between Job's knowledge and God's:

   Then the Lord answered Job out of the tempest: Who is this whose
   ignorant words darken counsel? Brace yourself and stand up like a man;
   I will ask questions and you shall answer. Where were you when I laid
   the earth's foundations? Tell me, if you know and understand! Who
   settled its dimensions? Surely you should know! Who stretched his
   measuring-line over it? On what do its supporting pillars rest? Who set
   its corner-stone in place, when the morning stars sang together and all
   the sons of God shouted for joy? . . . . Have you descended to the
   springs of the sea or walked in the unfathomable deep? Have the gates
   of death been revealed to you? Have you ever seen the door-keepers of
   the place of darkness? Have you comprehended the vast expanse of the
   world? Come, tell me all this, if you know! Which is the way to the
   home of light and where does darkness dwell? And can you then take each
   to its appointed bound and escort it on its homeward path? Doubtless
   you know all this; for you were born already, so long is the span of
   your life! (38:1-7, 16-21)

   Job complains that God apparently has no good reason for permitting the
   evil that befalls him. He suspects that God doesn't have a good reason
   because he, Job, can't imagine what that reason might be. In reply, God
   does not tell him what the reason is; instead, he attacks Job's
   unthinking assumption that if he, Job, can't imagine what reason God
   might have, then probably God doesn't have a reason at all. And God
   attacks this assumption by pointing out how limited Job's knowledge is
   along these lines. [617] No doubt he can't see what God's reason might
   be, but nothing of interest follows from this: in particular it doesn't
   follow that probably God doesn't have a reason. "All right, Job, if
   you're so smart, if you know so much, tell me about it! Tell me how the
   universe was created; tell me about the sons of God who shouted with
   joy upon its creation! No doubt you were there!" And Job sees the
   point: "I have spoken of great things which I have not understood,
   things too wonderful for me to know" (42:3).

   There is quite another way to understand Job--a way that can be
   combined with the first. Taken this second way, the idea is not that
   Job suspects or is inclined to think probably God doesn't have a reason
   for allowing his afflictions. It is rather that Job just becomes angry
   with God, hates and abhors what God is doing (or not doing), and is
   expressing his displeasure--and all of this quite independent of
   whether or not he thinks God has a reason. "Sure, maybe God has a
   reason--being God, he naturally would, wouldn't he? But I can't see the
   slightest suggestion as to what his reason may be; and why do I have to
   suffer so that he can attain these no doubt dandy ends of his--without
   so much as being consulted? without so much as a by-your-leave? I hate
   it! And I'm angry with him! These reasons' of his, whatever they are,
   are wholly inscrutable; and why should I suffer for these things beyond
   my ken? I don't give a fig for those reasons, and I detest what he is
   doing!" Here there isn't the suggestion that God maybe doesn't have
   reasons and is perhaps even unjust; this thought doesn't really enter,
   or at least isn't center stage. There is, instead, mistrust of God,
   wariness of him and his alleged magnificent ends, hatred of what this
   does to Job and requires of him, a hint or more than a hint of
   rebellion. And then when God comes to Job in the whirlwind, it is not
   to convince him that God really does have reasons (although it may, in
   fact, do this); it is instead to still the tempest in his soul, to
   quiet him, to restore his trust for God. The Lord gives Job a glimpse
   of his greatness, his beauty, his splendid goodness; the doubts and
   turmoil disappear and are replaced, once more, by love and trust, a
   state of mind expressed in all its Christian completeness by the
   apostle Paul:

   No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who
   loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither
   angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
   neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
   able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord. [618]

   It is time, and past time, to bring this book and this trilogy to a
   close. In Warrant: The Current Debate and Warrant and Proper Function,
   what I argued, essentially, is that the only viable answer to the
   question What is knowledge?' lies in the neighborhood of proper
   function: a belief has warrant if and only if it is produced by
   cognitive faculties functioning properly in a congenial epistemic
   environment according to a design plan successfully aimed at the
   production of true belief. (This is the basic idea; there is a good bit
   of fine-tuning required, including some in chapter 6 of the present
   book.)

   In this, the final member of the trilogy, I argued first in part I
   (chapters 1 and 2) that there really is such a thing as Christian
   belief and that (contra Kaufman, Hick, and Kant under one
   interpretation) we can, in fact, talk and think about God. In part II,
   the next three chapters, I distinguished de jure from de facto
   objections to Christian belief; the former are to the effect that such
   belief is intellectually or rationally questionable, even if true.
   Although de jure objections have been very common ever since the
   Enlightenment, it isn't easy to tell what the objections are supposed
   to be. I argued that no viable de jure objection lies in the
   neighborhood either of justification or of internal rationality. The
   only initially promising candidate for a viable de jure objection to
   Christian belief, I said, can be approached by way of Freud's claim
   that Christian belief does not have warrant, or at any rate warrant
   sufficient for knowledge. Freud, however, simply presupposes that
   theistic and hence Christian belief is false; therefore this alleged de
   jure objection fails to be independent of the truth of Christian
   belief. If Christian belief were false, perhaps Freud would be right;
   but the de jure objection was supposed to be independent of its truth
   or falsehood; hence this is not a successful de jure objection. I
   argued further that the same fate will befall any alleged de jure
   objection formulated in terms of warrant. That is because if Christian
   belief is true, it very likely does have warrant; hence any objection
   to its having warrant will have to be an objection to its being true;
   but in that case the alleged de jure objection either becomes or
   presupposes a de facto objection. Accordingly, a common agnostic
   attitude--I have no idea whether Christian belief is true, but I do
   know that it is irrational (or unjustified, or . . .) cannot be
   defended.

   In part III, chapter 6, I presented the Aquinas/Calvin model of how it
   is that belief in God can have warrant, and even warrant sufficient for
   knowledge. In the next chapter, I considered the noetic effects of sin,
   and the way in which the existence of sin throws a monkey wrench into
   the A/C model. In chapters 8 and 9, I extended the A/C model in such a
   way as to deal both with sin and with the full panoply of Christian
   belief: trinity, incarnation, atonement, resurrection. Chapter 10 dealt
   with objections to this model. Finally, in part IV, I turned to
   potential or actual defeaters for Christian belief--possible reasons to
   give it up or hold it less firmly. There were projection theories
   (chapter 11), contemporary historical biblical criticism (chapter 12),
   postmodernism and pluralism (chapter 13), and the age-old problem of
   evil (chapter 14). None of these, I argued, presents a serious
   challenge to the warrant Christian belief can enjoy if the model, and
   indeed Christian belief, is, in fact, true.

   But is it true? This is the really important question. And here we pass
   beyond the competence of philosophy, whose main competence, in this
   area, is to clear away certain objections, impedances, and obstacles to
   Christian belief. Speaking for myself and of course not in the name of
   philosophy, I can say only that it does, indeed, seem to me to be true,
   and to be the maximally important truth.

   [603] Here I am deeply indebted to Richard Otte.

   [604] As Albert Camus (hardly an unambiguous defender of Christian
   belief) clearly recognized. Christ, says Camus, is the solution to the
   problems of evil and death: His solution consisted, first, in
   experiencing them. The god-man suffers too, with patience. Evil and
   death can no longer be entirely imputed to him since he suffers and
   dies. The night on Golgotha is so important in the history of man only
   because, in its shadows, the divinity, ostensibly abandoning its
   traditional privileges, lived through to the end, despair included, the
   agony of death. Thus is explained the Lama sabachthani and the
   frightful doubt of Christ in agony. (Essais [Paris: Gallimard, 1965],
   p. 444. Quoted in Bruce Ward, "Prometheus or Cain? Albert Camus's
   Account of the Western Quest for Justice," Faith and Philosophy [April
   1991], p. 213; this passage is translated by Ward)

   [605] Another such resource has to do with the fact that from the point
   of view of Christian trinitarian doctrine, personal relationships such
   as love are to be found at the deepest levels of reality; see above,
   pp. 320ff.

   [606] Some of which is said in Salvifici Doloris, Apostolic Letter of
   John Paul II (Boston: Pauline Books and Media), pp. 30ff., a profound
   meditation on suffering and a powerful effort to discern its meaning
   from a Christian perspective.

   [607] Salvifici Doloris, pp. 30ff.

   [608] As is suggested by Paul's enigmatic remark: "Now I rejoice in
   what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still
   lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions" (Colossians 1:24).

   [609] "According to Julian of Norwich, before the elect have a chance
   to thank God for all He has done for them, God will say, Thank you for
   all your suffering, the suffering of your youth'?" (Marilyn Adams,
   "Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God," Proceedings of the
   Aristotelian Society, supplementary vol. 63 (1989), reprinted with
   emendations in The Problem of Evil, ed. Marilyn Adams and Robert Adams
   (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 219. The passage Adams
   cites is from Revelations of Divine Love, chapter 14).

   [610] Romans 8:17. Compare 2 Corinthians 4:17: "For this slight
   momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory
   beyond all comparison."

   [611] Paul continues in Romans 8:18: "For I consider that the
   sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory
   that is to be revealed in us."

   [612] Thus Abraham Kuyper: "The angels of God have no knowledge of sin,
   hence also they have no knowledge of forgiveness, hence again they have
   no knowledge of that tender love that is formed from forgiveness. Nor
   have they that richer knowledge of God which springs from this tenderer
   affection. They stand as strangers in the face of it, and therefore
   says the Apostle that, with respect to this mystery, the angels are, as
   it were, jealously desirous to look into it'?" (To Be near unto God, p.
   307).

   [613] Quoted in Cornelius Plantinga Jr., A Place to Stand (Grand
   Rapids: Board of Publications of the Christian Reformed Church, 1981),
   p. 35. De Bres (1522-67) was the author of the Belgic Confession.

   [614] Thus Teresa of Liseaux: I get tired of this darkness all around
   me. . . . It is worse torment than ever; the darkness itself seems to
   borrow, from the sinners who live in it, the gift of speech. I hear its
   mocking accents: "It's all a dream, this talk of a heavenly country
   bathed in light, scented with delicious perfumes, and of a God who made
   it all, who is to be your possession in eternity! . . . Death will make
   nonsense of your hopes; it will only mean a night darker than before,
   the night of mere non-existence." . . . And all of the time it isn't
   just a veil, it's a great wall which reaches up to the sky and blots
   out the stars.

   [615] For interesting and seminal work in this area, I should like to
   recommend Salvifici Doloris (see fn. 606), Marilyn Adams's "Horrendous
   Evils and the Goodness of God" (see fn. 609), Diogenes Allen's The
   Traces of God in a Frequently Hostile World (Cowley Publications,
   1980), and Eleonore Stump's "The Mirror of Evil" (see fn. 600).

   [616] For profoundly insightful comment on the main themes of Job, see
   Eleonore Stump's "Second-Person Accounts and the Problem of Evil," Stob
   Lecture at Calvin College, January 1999 (Grand Rapids: Calvin College,
   1999).

   [617] Thus inviting Job to consider the possibility that God's reasons
   for permitting evil are more like noseeums than St. Bernards; see
   above, p. 466.

   [618] Romans 8:16-19.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [570] It is worth noting that many different problems, questions, and
   topics fall under the rubric of the problem of evil. There are, for
   example, the problems of preventing suffering and evil, those of
   alleviating it (knowing how to comfort and help those who suffer from
   it), those of maintaining the right attitude toward those who suffer,
   the pastoral or spiritual problem I mentioned above, and more; and, of
   course, a proper response to one of these problems might be totally
   inappropriate as a response to another.

   [571] Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, ed. Richard Popkin
   (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 1980), p. 63. Hume puts the argument
   in the mouth of Philo, widely thought to represent Hume's own views.

   [572] "Evil and Omnipotence," Mind (1955). The article has been widely
   reprinted. For difficulties with Mackie's argument, see my God,
   Freedom, and Evil (New York: Harper and Row, 1974; and Grand Rapids: W.
   B. Eerdmans, 1977), pp. 12ff. In Mackie's posthumous The Miracle of
   Theism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), he wavers between his
   earlier claim that the existence of God is straightforwardly
   inconsistent with that of evil, and the claim that the existence of
   evil is powerful but logically inconclusive evidence against the
   existence of God. See pp. 150-75, and see my "Is Theism Really a
   Miracle?" Faith and Philosophy (April 1986). The claim that the
   believer in God (the God of theism) is committed to a contradiction
   goes back to some of the French encyclopedists, F. H. Bradley, J.
   McTaggart, and J. S. Mill. More recently (in addition to Mackie), see,
   for example, H. J. McCloskey, "God and Evil," Philosophical Quarterly
   10 (1960), p. 97; and Henry David Aiken, "God and Evil," Ethics 48
   (1957-58), p. 79.

   [573] For argument for this conclusion, see my God, Freedom, and Evil,
   pp. 7ff. For a fuller and more accurate account, see my The Nature of
   Necessity (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974), chapter 9; and Alvin
   Plantinga (Profiles series), ed. James Tomberlin and Peter van Inwagen
   (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1985), pp. 36-55. Many fascinating problems and
   questions have emerged from the discussion of the free will defense
   over the last twenty-five years. In particular, there are arguments
   against the existence of (true and nontrivial) counterfactuals of
   freedom by Robert Adams ("Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil,"
   American Philosophical Quarterly [1977]) and by William Hasker ("A
   Refutation of Middle Knowledge," NoÃ»s [December 1986]). One
   particularly interesting strand here is the "grounding and founding"
   objection (according to which counterfactuals of freedom with false
   antecedents couldn't be true because they are incapable of being
   properly grounded or founded). This objection goes all the way back to
   the Jesuit-Dominican controversy in the sixteenth century, a dispute
   whose increasing rancor finally induced the pope to forbid the
   disputants to vilify one another in public (although he apparently
   didn't object to vilification among consenting adults in the privacy of
   their own quarters). The grounding and founding objection has been
   dealt with in magisterial fashion in my colleague Thomas Flint's Divine
   Providence: The Molinist Account (Ithaca: Cornell University Press,
   1998). Another issue of great interest is the question of "selective
   freedom" (David Lewis's term) (See G. Stanley Kane, "The Free-Will
   Defense Defended," New Scholasticism 50, no. 4 [1976], and David Lewis,
   "Evil for Freedom's Sake?" Philosophical Papers [November 1993]):
   couldn't God have let go forward those creaturely free choices he
   foresaw would be right, and cut off those he foresaw would be wrong?
   This question is connected with another fascinating issue, that of
   backtracking counterfactuals (see David Lewis, "Counterfactual
   Dependence and Time's Arrow," NoÃ»s 13, no. 4 [November 1979], p. 455).
   It is extremely tempting to go into these issues here, but doing so
   would take us from epistemology deep into metaphysics (some would say
   abstruse and arcane metaphysics, but of course they would be mistaken);
   self-restraint must be the order of the day.
