The Right Keynote for the New Year

   (No. 2289)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 1, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
   Praise the LORD." Psalm 115:18.

   IT has been truly said that if the members of our churches were in a
   right condition of heart, the work of the pastor towards them would be
   no more difficult than that of a commanding officer to his troops. A
   general, or a captain has never to study eloquence--he has simply to
   give the word of command tersely and plainly--and himself to lead the
   way. So, if our hearts were right in the sight of God, we would not
   need illustrations to win attention or arguments to urge us on--we
   would only need to know what is the special duty of the hour and,
   helped by the Divine Spirit--we would, with alacrity, seek to perform
   it.

   Well, now, let us hope that this is our condition tonight! God grant
   that it may be! Certainly it ought to be our condition in reference to
   the duty which is taught us in the text. I shall but, as it were, give
   the word of command in my Master's name--and I trust that the Holy
   Spirit will be working in all our spirits, causing each one of us to
   say, "Ready, yes, ready, to bless the Lord from this time forth and
   forevermore. Praise the Lord."

   You noticed, while we were reading the Psalm, that it contained a piece
   of cutting sarcasm upon the gods of the heathen which are unable to do
   anything for their worshippers. Albeit that they have the outward
   semblance of the organs of life and sense, yet in those organs there is
   neither life nor power. Their mouths cannot speak; their eyes cannot
   see; their ears cannot hear; their noses cannot smell; their hands
   cannot handle; their feet cannot walk. But our God is declared to be
   the living God who is in the heavens and who has done whatever He has
   pleased. Well, that being so, a living God should be worshipped by a
   living people in a living manner!

   This is one of the rules of Christian worship which we should never
   forget. Let us come before the Lord, not as mere bodies, fancying that
   it is enough to put in an appearance in the place where prayer is known
   to be made, but let us bring our living selves, our souls, our hearts,
   into God's worship--and whether it is in prayer, or in praise, or in
   the proclamation of His Truths, or in the listening to the Gospel
   message--let us do it with all our life! Let the praise be full of
   life! Let the prayer be full of life! Let the ministration of the Truth
   of God be the lively oracle of the living God! And let the ear, the
   heart's ear, be all alive while we listen to the Gospel!

   There is nothing more that is acceptable to God in the mere routine of
   Christian worship than there is in the turning of the windmills of the
   Tartars, when they put their prayers upon the mill and they revolve
   with the blowing of the wind! If true life is absent from our service,
   though we speak with the tongues of men and of angels, though we have
   the richest music, though we have everything that heart can devise to
   create a charm, yet it profits us nothing, and brings no Glory to God.
   "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living," is a text which
   may be applied to dead services as well as to dead men. May the Lord,
   in mercy, send to some religious services a resurrection! May He be
   pleased to put a living heart and soul into them, for if there are not
   these, He will not accept a dead sacrifice at men's hands! A living God
   must be worshipped in a living way by a living people!

   In the context we see, also, that as it is true with the heathen's
   idols, that, "they that make them are like unto them, so is everyone
   that trusts in them," so ought it to be with us in reference to our
   God. A living God should have a living people and a blessing God should
   have a blessing people. He has blessed us with unspeakable favors. He
   is always blessing us! It is not possible for us to compute the amount
   of blessing which He is constantly bestowing upon us. Therefore, "Bless
   the Lord, O my Soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name."
   If He exalts you with His favor, take care that you exalt Him with your
   praise. If He enriches you with His blessings, bring your blessings and
   offer them at His

   feet, as the wise men brought their gold and frankincense and myrrh and
   laid them as tribute at the feet of the newborn King. Bless a blessing
   God! What can be more congruous? As the echo answers to the voice, so
   let our blessing of God answer to the blessing we have received from
   God, even as Paul puts it, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
   heavenly places in Christ: according as He has chosen us in Him before
   the foundation of the world."

   This, then, is the work that is to occupy us tonight, and the work in
   which we shall continue, I trust, from this time forth and forevermore.
   Living unto the living God, time and eternity will be spent in blessing
   the blessing God.

   Notice, in the text, which is clearly intended to excite us to praise,
   first, a mournful memory, suggested by the word "but." Secondly, a
   happy resolution--"we will bless the Lord." Thirdly, an appropriate
   commencement--"from this time forth." And then, fourthly, an
   everlasting continuance--"and forevermore. Praise the Lord."

   I. First, then, there is in the text the trace of A MOURNFUL MEMORY.
   Read the preceding verse, without which we do not get the sense of this
   one to the fullest. "The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go
   down into silence. But we will bless the Lord from this time forth."

   The mournful memory is that of those who, at one time praised the Lord
   with us, and exulted in His holy name during the past year, some have
   been numbered with the dead. There are gaps in our ranks, my Brothers
   and Sisters, which death has made during the past year. Some have been
   taken from us whom we could ill spare, as we thought, but they were,
   nevertheless, needed up above. He who bought them had a better right to
   them than we had and His prayers prevailed over ours, as they always
   should. We said, "Father, we will that they whom You have given us be
   with us where we are." But Jesus prayed, "Father, I will that they,
   also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am." And they have
   gone. He had the best right to them and we can only say, "It is the
   Lord: let Him do what seems good to Him." But, as far as this world is
   concerned, they who have been taken from us do not praise the Lord,
   save that, being dead, they speak by the recollection of their holy
   lives. And their memory is sweet, like incense that has been burned,
   and leaves a perfume behind. Save for this, "The dead praise not the
   Lord, neither any that go down into silence."

   I know that in Heaven they are praising Him! They have been added to
   the orchestra above and have helped to make it complete. Fresh
   songsters are there before the everlasting Throne of God, but here they
   cannot swell our praises. Their bodies sleep beneath the green sward in
   the silence of the tomb. As I look round the different parts of the
   Tabernacle-- my eyes being better able to distinguish the gaps than
   some of yours are because I rather know something of all, and each of
   you knows but a part of this great congregation--as I look around, I
   notice where sat one whose eyes were full of glances of delight
   whenever the name of Jesus was mentioned. I have heard him speak in his
   Master's praise most sweetly and yet tearfully, but I shall never hear
   him here again. I looked into his tomb but a few days ago. He has gone
   down into silence so far as his body is concerned.

   There was another dear worker who was always here, I might say that he
   was always everywhere where there was anything to be done for Christ!
   And we went to his grave, also, and we laid him in the silent tomb.
   During the year I suppose some 70 or 80 of our number have gone over to
   the majority--I mean, 70 or 80 of those who were actually members of
   the Church, besides those who, I trust, loved the Lord, although they
   had not confessed His name in Baptism and united with His people in
   Church fellowship. They have gone over to the great host above--and
   there are so many the fewer here. Well, what doe this say to us? I will
   not imitate Dr. Watts, and say--

   "Hark, from the tombs a doleful sound!" I think we hear too many
   doleful sounds from the tombs. But I hear a lively, earnest sound, and
   it says, "Brothers and Sisters, keep up the song of praise unto the
   Lord! Do not let the music falter. Our voices are gone from among you--
   sing, therefore, each of you, the more sweetly and loudly to make up
   for our absence from the earthly choir."

   Now that so many saints have gone Home, there are so many the fewer on
   earth to praise the Lord. O you who have recently come into the Church,
   you who have been baptized for the dead to fill up the gaps in our
   ranks, be earnest, with your loud hosannas, to bless and magnify the
   name of the Lord! Brethren, let us take a blessed revenge on Death, and
   if he takes from our numbers, let us, as God helps us, increase the
   real efficiency of the Church by each of us endeavoring to become
   double what we formerly were in the service of our Master! O Death, you
   have struck down a songster who used to sing at my side, but my voice
   shall be louder than before! I will make music for us both and there
   shall yet come another to fill his place! And so there shall be three
   songs instead of two--and God shall be a gainer on earth and a gainer

   in Heaven by the loss which death seemed to cause to Christ's Church!
   They are going, one after another, my Brothers and Sisters. They are
   gathering homeward one by one. The most useful, the most mighty in
   prayer, the most holy, the very pillars and strength of the Church are
   going and, as a Brother said the other day, "When so many good ones are
   going, what can we do better than pack up and go with them?" As each
   one goes, we feel almost inclined to say what the disciples said
   concerning Lazarus, "If he sleeps, he shall do well." And to add, with
   Thomas, "Let us also go, that we may die with Him."

   But I am of another mind and I say, "No, if there are so many going,
   let us ask to be allowed to stay, for this great fight has to be fought
   out somehow and, if some of the troops have fought the good fight, and
   exchanged the sword and shield for the palm branch and the harp, let us
   who are left pray with all our might unto the Lord God of Hosts to
   strengthen us in this day of battle, that we may not go till we have
   finished our part of the fight and have been the means of calling
   others to prolong the blessed struggle by which victory shall be given
   to the name of Christ."

   By the thought, then, of the many dead who cannot any longer praise God
   among us, let us be stimulated to bless the Lord from this time forth
   and forevermore!

   There comes up in my mind, however, another reflection, that, as others
   are gone, we, ourselves, shall also go soon. "The dead praise not the
   Lord, neither any that go down into silence." O Brothers, if we are
   called to preach, it is only for a little while! We have not an
   indefinite period in which to be wise to win souls. Our work must be
   done soon or it will never be done! O teachers, you must win your
   children for Christ soon, for you are not to live a thousand years to
   go on seeking the little ones! They must be brought to Jesus soon or
   they will not be brought by you, for you will have passed away! O all
   you Christian people who love your Lord, be busy in those sacred works
   which can only be performed on earth, for angels cannot clothe the
   naked or feed the hungry! No angel can be a Dorcas to make garments for
   the poor. These things are for this life--these modes of praising God
   are only for time--there are others for eternity. These are for this
   life and to these we have to attend as long as we are here.

   To keep the Church of God on earth, the Church militant, in good
   marching order, and good working condition, and so to glorify God here
   is what we must do now, and do it soon, for, "the night comes when no
   man can work." I wish we all felt more that we are dying men. The sound
   of the chariot wheels of eternity should make us quicken our pace. If
   you could often look through the heavenly telescope and see the
   Judgment Seat, the Great White Throne in the heavens, and the assembled
   multitude, and yourself rendering up your books of account to the last
   great Examiner, some of you would live far differently than you do! God
   help us to do so and, by the recollection of this, "but," though it
   comes over us like a cloud, tonight, let us be quickened into the
   immediate and joyous work of blessing and magnifying the Most

   High!

   II. Let us now go to our second point which is this--A HAPPY
   RESOLUTION. "The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down
   into silence. But we will bless the Lord."

   "We will bless the Lord," for it seems to us to be the very thing for
   which we were created. This is the flower of our being! We are never
   happier, surely, never more developing what God has put into us by His
   Grace, than when we are praising and blessing Him.

   We will bless the Lord by our songs. They shall be more frequent than
   they have been. Brothers and Sisters, do you sing as much as you might?
   Do you sing at work and do you sing in the household, and do you sing
   on your beds? I have known some who have managed to live always
   singing. It was my joy to know an old man, a very old man, who was
   famous in the village where he lived because, as he walked the streets,
   he was always humming a little bit of a hymn. He was a grand old
   Methodist of the grand old days--and he had always some glorious hymn
   that he would go along tooting as he went about the streets! And he
   sang himself to bed and sang himself to sleep, and, I was going to say,
   sang himself awake--he was scarcely awake before he began to sing
   again. It was all singing with him!

   Now, you know how the worldlings sing. You cannot be quiet in your
   beds, at night, because of the noise they make in the streets. Let us
   be as ready with the songs of Zion as they are with the songs of
   Gomorrah! Let us magnify the Lord with our songs far oftener than we
   have done.

   Then, let us magnify the Lord in our daily talk and conversation while
   we speak about Him. Never speak badly of His name. Some of you do.
   There is sometimes a grumbling at His Providences. There is a fretting
   at the trials He sends. There is a complaining about all sorts of
   things. But you who love Him, begin, from this night, to bless Him by
   speaking

   well of His name. Bless Him for everything! Bless Him for the bitters;
   bless Him for the cold; bless Him for poverty and sickness. "That is a
   hard thing to do," you say. Yes, but it is a sweet thing to do--it will
   be as comforting to yourself as it will be glorifying to God!

   Begin to praise Him in the tone of your spirit. May God the blessed
   Comforter help you to do it by a calm, equable frame of mind, by a
   Divine placidity of temper, by a complete subjection of the will to Him
   so that you shall not feel it to be subjection, but find it to be your
   delight that the Lord should do with you whatever pleases Him! It is
   bliss to praise God so that our very thoughts praise Him, not by
   effort, but as flowers pour out their perfume, so that our inmost soul
   praises Him, just as the birds sing, not as if it were a task, but
   because it cannot help it! Was it not made to sing? And so it sits on
   the bare bough, before the spring has yet developed the green leaf and
   opening bud, and it sings even amid the frost and snow--and wakes us up
   in the spring morning with its hymn of praise to its Creator. "Its," I
   said, but I mean a thousand of them--winged choristers praising and
   blessing God, not because they are told that they ought to do so-- but
   because it is their intense delight to pour out their music! Oh, that
   we were little birds, made always to sing God's praise! Oh, that we
   were drops of dew, forever sparkling in the light of God's love!

   I like to look at the lilies, sometimes, and think how they worship
   God. They never study a sermon, or compose a hymn, or weave a rhyme, or
   even think--but they serve God by standing still and showing themselves
   and breathing out their sweet perfume to the winds! Oh, to be full of
   God, till, at last, you bless Him even by existing! Till life becomes a
   Psalm and even breathing becomes a hymn of praise unto the Most High in
   whom we live, and move, and have our being! Blessed be His name! We
   will bless the Lord from this time forth, in some such way as that, as
   He shall help us!

   For, dear Brothers and Sisters, we may well bless the Lord because we
   are alive. That, "but," suggests that since others have gone, we should
   bless Him that we live. I do not know whether I would not as soon have
   been in Heaven as here, but, still, to abide in the flesh for a while
   may be more necessary for some and, therefore, I am glad to be alive.
   And some of you with your children about you, with many dependent upon
   you, should thank God that while you are needed here you are spared
   here--and you should thank Him who has kept you. You might have been
   killed in some accident. You might have been struck down, as many have
   been this year, by contagious disease. You might have been in such
   pain, tonight, that death would have seemed a relief to you. Bless the
   Lord that it is not so. Bless Him that you live. O God, our Creator and
   Preserver, we will, from this time forth, bless You that we are alive!

   Then bless God because of spiritual life, for there is something in
   that calling for devout gratitude, for to live, and yet not to be alive
   spiritually, is to be a walking corpse, an animated dunghill, a Lazarus
   who by this time stinks, and yet is not in his grave! It is a horrible
   thing to be going about in this world with eyes that do not see God,
   and with ears that never hear His voice when He is speaking everywhere,
   and with a heart that never responds to His Divine love. Better not to
   be, than to be and yet not know the greatest and best of Beings. Let us
   bless God that He has quickened us into spiritual life, for it was not
   so with some of you a long while ago.

   No, it is but a few months since some of you were made alive. And this
   new year may remind you of some former new years, and of how they were
   spent, and into what condition you brought yourselves! O Lord, our
   state of spiritual death does not bear thinking of, except we wet the
   page of memory with many tears! Blessed be Your name, You have
   delivered us from the bondage of corruption and brought us into newness
   of life! Therefore will we bless You from this time forth and
   forevermore!

   And let us bless the Lord because, according to the Psalm, we have been
   blessed of Him. Read, again, the 12th verse, "The Lord has been mindful
   of us: He will bless us." Now, it is not only according to the Psalm,
   but it is also a matter of fact. "The Lord has been mindful of us." I
   do not know your histories, dear Friends, as you know them, but I would
   like you to pull out your pocketbooks and your diaries, and just look
   down them. How many times has the Lord been mindful of you during the
   past year? I could tell of many interpositions of His Divine love on my
   behalf, but I will not do so at this time. I will bless His name in
   secret for His loving kindness towards His unworthy servant.

   A good old woman used to hear people speak about their Ebenezers, or
   stones of help, in remembrance of God's mercy, but she said that when
   she looked back on hers, she thought she was looking back on a wall.
   They were set so closely together that they seemed to make a wall on
   the right hand and on the left of all her pathway. Well, that is just
   like mine. I am such a debtor to Divine Mercy that if I could but pay
   half a farthing in the pound, I should need to give fifty million times
   more than I am, or ever hope to be worth! Oh, what I owe Him!

   Rutherford speaks somewhere of his soul going right down in the stream
   of God's love, not floating in it, but sinking, foundering, going down
   till mighty love went over the masthead of his soul. And such do I feel
   that our gratitude ought to be. The ocean of God's love rises above us
   so as altogether to swallow us up. The Lord has done such great things
   for us that if we do not bless Him, the very stones we walk on in the
   streets might cry out against us, and every beam in the wall might
   groan in the night to think that it sheltered such an ungrateful
   sleeper! Oh, the mercy, the forgiving mercy, the abounding mercy, the
   ceaseless mercy of the living God! What tongue can ever tell it? Surely
   the poet did not strain metaphors too much, or use hyperboles, or push
   them too far, when he said--

   "But, oh, eternity's too short

   To utter half Your praise!"

   Again, we ought to praise the Lord, according to the Psalm, because He
   will bless us. You must have noticed that the Psalmist expressed that
   idea several times in different forms--"He has been mindful of us: He
   will bless us." This is a very sweet duty to which I would exhort you,
   to bless the Lord in the prospect of what He is going to do. Come, let
   us weave songs out of tomorrows! We will not boast of them, but we will
   bless God for them. Let us praise Him for all the love and kindness
   that is going to be with us through all the year that is just
   beginning! Troubles will come, but the Lord will deliver the godly out
   of them all! Tribulation will be our portion, but in Christ we shall
   have peace! Perhaps we shall go Home this year--if we are to do so, let
   it not cause us even so much as one single fear, but let us put that
   into the song and bless the Lord for gates of pearl and harps of
   gold--so soon to be the heritage of His unworthy children!

   III. Now I must be brief on the other points, but I want to delay a
   minute or two on the third head, which is AN APPROPRIATE
   COMMENCEMENT--"From this time forth."

   When is the time to begin to praise God? Now, Brothers and Sisters,
   now--"From this time forth." You see, it was just then that the heathen
   were saying, "Where is their God?" When God is blasphemed by others,
   then let His people praise Him! Whenever you hear anything said against
   God, any note of blasphemy or skepticism, then say, "We will bless the
   Lord from this time forth." Always feel as if you were called upon to
   make some recompense to the blessed name for the dishonor which the
   adversary has done to it. I think there will be less swearing in the
   world if we always do that, for the devil will tell his children to
   leave off when he finds that every time they curse, we bless God all
   the more. Whenever you hear that a bad book has come out--whenever you
   hear that some scientific man has been saying something that will
   mislead the unwary, say, "We will bless the Lord from this time forth.
   We will have a new song because of that. We will make some kind of
   amends to God's great name because of all the calumny that is cast upon
   it."

   So let us do it whenever we have a sense of mercy. He has been mindful
   of us, therefore, from this time forth, we will praise His name. Do you
   feel as if He had done great things for you, of which you are glad? Is
   your heart leaping, tonight because of some special mercy? Then let
   this be your sweet resolve, "We will bless the Lord from this time
   forth."

   I think that we ought to praise the Lord from the first moment in which
   we know our sins are forgiven, the first moment in which we have peace
   with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and then from every period of
   spiritual enjoyment. You who are about to be baptized may well say, "We
   will bless the Lord from this time forth, from the time when we come
   forward to confess our faith in Jesus, when we put on Christ by public
   profession of allegiance to Him." From every season of coming to the
   Communion Table, from every hallowed night of wrestling prayer, from
   every time you climb the Mountain of Transfiguration and behold your
   Master's Glory, yes, and from every Gethsemane's night, when you strive
   almost in vain to watch with Him one hour--even then, say, "From this
   time forth we will bless Him."

   I am sure that I may claim that the beginning of another year is a good
   time to begin blessing the Lord. For the mercies of another year, the
   forgiveness of another year, the provision, the instruction, the
   guidance, the supplies of another year, for the mercies of the year on
   which we enter with good heart of hope, for all our fears which have
   been averted, for all our hopes which have been fulfilled, for all that
   we have learned, for all that we have experienced, let us carry out
   this happy resolution that, from this time forth, we will bless the
   Lord!

   Oh, how I wish that I could put this resolution into the hearts of some
   people whom I know! I hope they are Christians, but, you know, they
   were born on a bleak day and they always speak with lips of frost. You
   are never many minutes with them but you hear grievous complaining.
   Dear Brother, how would it do for you to say, "From this time forth I
   will bless the Lord"? We know some who, like myself, are depressed by
   this horrible wintry weather. We get to feel all

   our bones aching and we are very apt, when we are full of rheumatism,
   to begin to talk about it. Come, my Sister. Come, my Brother, let us
   have done with that theme, and say, "From this time forth we will bless
   the Lord!"

   I know the style of talk that is very frequent--"Never was there such a
   dull time for trade. Business is worse than I ever knew it. Everything
   is going to the bad. There are wars and rumors of wars, and the world
   is coming to an end, and I do not know what is not going to happen."
   Well, Brother, if you like that strain, you must keep on at it, but as
   for me, and you, too--I really think that it would be better if we were
   both to say--"From this time forth we will bless the Lord." We have
   strummed away long enough on that sackbut--let us begin to play on the
   psaltery and the harp of a solemn sound! We have too long been
   singing--

   "Lord, what a wretched land is this,

   That yields us no supply!

   No cheering fruits, no wholesome trees,

   Nor streams of living joy.

   But pricking thorns through all the ground,

   And mortal poisons grow;

   And all the rivers that are found

   With dangerous waters flow." Let us go on to the next verse and sing--

   "Yet the dear path to Your abode

   Lies through this horrid land.

   Lord, we would keep the heavenly road,

   And run at Your command!"

   Let us begin to sing of the path, and the Guide, and the Home to which
   we are going! We are a day's march nearer Home, a year's march nearer
   Home, so from this time forth let us bless the Lord!

   IV. And then comes, lastly, AN EVERLASTING CONTINUANCE--"We will bless
   the Lord from this time forth

   and forevermore'"

   I was born in a county where there were many old-fashioned people and I
   am old-fashioned, myself. Whenever I read my Bible and find that it
   says, "everlasting," or, "forevermore," I believe that it means what it
   says. Of course, I have lived in a world in which I am informed that it
   does not mean anything of the kind--that it means a very short period--
   or a period longer or shorter according as circumstances may happen! I
   am afraid I shall never learn this new lingo. I have no intention of
   trying to learn it, either, so I am sure that I never shall be able to
   understand things the wrong way upwards, as the wise men now do.
   "Everlasting" will be everlasting with me forever and ever, I can tell
   you, and it will find me, at any rate, a believer in eternity as being
   that which never has an end! I believe that those who think differently
   will have to come round to the opinion that I have found in the Word of
   God. At any rate, if we are to agree, they will have to do so, for I
   shall never come round to their view.

   Now, then, the expression, "We will bless the Lord from this time forth
   and forevermore," means that our praise shall have no end to it,
   "Forevermore," means eternity, I believe, and I pray God that we may
   make it to mean eternity in our praise "from this time forth and
   forevermore." Falling from Grace shall not come in to make us cease
   praising and blessing the Lord! We began to praise Him, not in the
   strength of nature, but in the strength of Grace--and that strength
   will not exhaust itself, for it will be renewed day by day--so that we
   shall be able to bless the Lord forevermore.

   Death itself shall not stop us from blessing God! No, it shall but
   increase the choir and sweeten the harmony! We shall love the Lord more
   and praise Him better when death shall have divested us of these
   tongues which now are impediments to the highest praise--and shall have
   given us the power to speak without lips and tongues in a nobler
   language before the Throne of God--

   "My God, I'll praise You while I live, And praise You when I die, And
   praise You when I rise again, And to eternity."

   Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, if we are in the right state of
   heart, there is not a time when we could leave of blessing the Lord.
   When shall we cease to bless Him? When He leaves off blessing us? That
   will never be! When we leave off being in debt to Him? That can never
   be! When He ceases to be worthy of blessing? That cannot be! Or when
   the life

   of Divine Grace within us ceases to recognize His blessedness? That,
   also, cannot be, for it shall be in us "a well of water springing up
   into everlasting life." Leave off praising Him? O Brothers, Sisters,
   never, never, never, not even for the time in which a clock might tick
   once! Go on praising Him if He shall take you up to the bed of
   sickness--if every limb shall be a mass of pain, if every nerve shall
   be a highway for a crowd of pains to travel on--yet still go on
   blessing and praising and magnifying Him, for this is His due! When we
   have praised Him best and most, we have not given Him what He deserves!
   Let us fill this House of Prayer with our praise and thanksgiving
   tonight! The Romanist sets his incense on fire and fills the whole
   place with its smoke. Oh, let there go up to God from our grateful
   hearts a cloud of the smoke of praise unto His blessed name! Blessed be
   the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, from this time forth and
   forever-more!

   If any man cannot join in that praise, let him remember that he is not
   fit to live, nor fit to die--for to die without praising God and to
   rise again--would be to remain in a state in which he could not
   possibly enter Heaven, since the one occupation of Heaven is magnifying
   and blessing and praising the Lord forever and forever! Let such an one
   seek the Lord, now! Let him trust in the Lord Jesus Christ! Then he
   shall be saved and he will be able to join us in saying, "We will bless
   the Lord from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. PSALM115.

   Verses 1-3. Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto Your name give
   Glory, for Your mercy, and for Your Truth's sake. Why should the
   heathen say, Where is now their God? But our God is in the heavens: He
   has done whatever He has pleased. It was very natural that the heathen
   should say, "Where is their God? because they had no outward emblem, no
   visible image, no tangible token--whereas the heathen had their many
   gods, such as they were, made of wood and stone, so that they asked,
   "Where is their God?" I think that when that question is suggested, it
   is a good sign, for it proves the purity of the faith which has
   cleansed itself from outward symbolism. May men often have to ask of
   us, "Where is their

   God?"

   But I fear that the people of Israel were brought into so low a state,
   at times, that this question was also asked in scorn and derision,
   "Where is now their God?" "He was with them when they came out of
   Egypt. He was with them when they captured Canaan. He has been with
   them in many a terrible battle, turning to flight the armies of the
   aliens, but where is now their God?" It is a cutting question under
   such circumstances. It was so with the Psalmist when be said, "As with
   a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto
   me, Where is your God?" "But our God is in the heavens where their gods
   never were. He has done whatever He has pleased." The gods of the
   heathen have done nothing--they cannot do anything.

   4-7. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They
   have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: they
   have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: they
   have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not:
   neither speak they through their throat. It is a grim piece of sarcasm
   which the Psalmist here aims at the idol gods. I do not know,
   sometimes, whether this is not all that superstition deserves of us--to
   be utterly laughed at and put to scorn. The spirit of Elijah is not
   altogether the most Christ-like, and yet even the Christian may well
   say to the priests of Baal, in derision and contempt, "Cry aloud, for
   he is a god." What do they deserve who so degrade themselves as to
   worship things which their own hands have made--things which can be
   seen with the eyes and touched with the hand? Yet, even in this country
   we have thousands who call themselves Christians, who prostrate
   themselves before idols made in different forms and shapes--yes and say
   to a piece of bread that the baker made, "This is our god." Well says
   the Psalmist--

   8. They that make them are like unto them; so is everyone that trusts
   in them. They are as doltish and as stupid, as blind and as deaf, and
   as ridiculous as the gods that they make, for no man was ever better
   than the god he worshipped!

   9-11. O Israel, trust you in the LORD: He is their help and their
   shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: He is their help and their
   shield. You that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: He is their help and
   their shield. There is real help in the living Jehovah, real protection
   in Him.

   12. The LORD has been mindful of us: He will bless us. There is a New
   Year's motto for you. It will go back through the old year, and forward
   into the new one--"The Lord has been mindful of us: He will bless us."
   See how mindful He has been of us all through the past year in a
   thousand ways! Long before we have known our needs, He has supplied
   them. He has delivered us from dangers of which we never knew and led
   us into mercies of which we never dreamed!

   12, 13. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of
   Aaron. He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
   Great blessings for small people, and not small blessings for those
   whom He makes great in Israel.

   14, 15. The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
   children. You are blessed of the LORD which made Heaven and earth. This
   is the Creator's blessing, therefore a real one. Many of you have had
   the new creation worked in you--you shall live to see new heavens and a
   new earth!

   16. The Heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S: but the earth has He
   given to the children of men. And they seem as if they meant to keep
   it, too. The sad thing is that they get the earth into their hearts and
   so they miss the blessing which the Lord intended them to receive from
   His gift of it.

   17. The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
   silence. As far as this world is concerned, no note is heard from the
   grave.

   18. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
   Praise the LORD. So let us do tonight. Let us have an extra Psalm of
   praise to the Lord who has brought us safely through another year!

God's Unspeakable Gift

   (No. 2290)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 8, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift." 2 Corinthians 9:15.

   IF you will read, at home, the chapter from which our text is taken,
   you will find that Paul was stirring up the Corinthians to an act of
   liberality. He had boasted of what they would do, but he had just a
   little fear that they might fall behind and not quite come up to what
   he had promised on their behalf. He stirred them up to liberal giving,
   telling them that they who sowed liberally, should reap liberally, and
   they who sowed sparingly would reap sparingly. Once upon that theme of
   giving, the Apostle could not help speaking of another gift. He saw a
   track just off the main road and he felt that it led him straight away
   to his God and to his Savior. And so, while the ink was yet flowing in
   his pen, he began to write about it as though he would say, "I am not
   thinking now, my Brethren, so much of your gifts as I am of another
   gift--not so much of your gifts to the Lord's poor people as of the
   Lord's great Gift to you--His poor people. "Thanks be unto God for His
   unspeakable Gift."

   A person, who was collecting for some good objective, called upon a
   friend one day and, as he needed him to be very generous, pleaded hard
   with him. After a while, he seemed to quit the subject altogether, and
   he said, "I knew your father." "Did you?" "Yes, and I called upon him
   about a certain business, just as I do upon you, and your father did
   not need any prompting. He said, 'State the case,' and as soon as the
   case was stated, he pulled out his purse and gave me ten times as much
   as I had expected to obtain from him." You see, our friend was not
   exactly pleading with the son when he told that story, and yet I do not
   know how he could have pleaded better, for reverence for his father's
   name and the desire not to seem to fall off from his father's standard,
   were the very best arguments that could have been used with him!

   So I admire the wisdom of Paul. When he would bring these Corinthians
   up to a high standard of liberality towards their poor Brethren in
   Judea, he says, as though it were only by the way, "Thanks be unto God,
   your Father and my Father, for His unspeakable Gift. Whatever you give,
   I can speak about, but what He gave surpasses all powers of speech!
   Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift."

   Now, this text, tonight, gives me three things to speak of. The first
   is, that Christ is a Gift. And, secondly, that as a Gift, Christ is
   unspeakable. And, thirdly, that as a Gift unspeakable, Christ calls
   forth praise to God from us.

   I. First, then, CHRIST IS A GIFT.

   How often you hear people speak about Christ and His salvation as
   though they were the reward of merit--as though we did something by
   which to win his Divine favor! If they do not teach that salvation
   comes through our own merits, yet, according to them, it is the effect
   of our feelings and our experiences. Somehow or other, according to
   this common notion, we must get fit to receive God's Gift and thus,
   what comes to us is more our due than an alms of heavenly charity! I
   hesitate not to say that this teaching flies in the teeth of the entire
   Word of God. Everywhere in the Scriptures the great word is not merit,
   but GRACE--not deserving, but receiving freely of the great mercy of
   our God!

   Our Lord Jesus must be a Gift to us if we are ever to possess Him. He
   could only come to us sons of men by way of a gift. Consider the
   dignity of His Person for a minute and then ask how it is conceivable
   that we could have deserved that such a Person as He should come here
   and live and die, that we might be saved! I can conceive of a man
   meriting this or that honor among his fellow men, but when I think of
   the Prince of Life, the Lord of Glory equal with the Father, King of
   Kings and Lord of Lords, very God of very God--and when I see Him
   giving Himself up to die for men, my very blood boils at the thought
   that we could ever have deserved that Sacrifice! One is indignant that
   human pride should dare to go the length of even imagining that a life
   of perfection could have deserved to be rewarded by the Gift of Christ!

   No, my Brothers and Sisters, if we had kept God's Law without a flaw.
   If there had been no omission of duty, no commission of sin and we
   could have taken the compound merits of a perfect world and laid them
   at the feet of God, they could not have deserved that Christ should
   become Man--that Christ should live in poverty--that Christ should die
   in shame for man! There would have been no need of Christ's death if
   man had not sinned. But had there been a supposable need, Christ's
   Sacrifice could not have been deserved even if we had remained
   innocent, like our first parents in the Garden of Eden before the Fall!
   I am sure that none of you could, for a minute, tolerate the thought
   that any human merit could deserve the Incarnation of God upon this
   earth, the coming of the Divine Son in our nature into this world and
   His shameful death upon the Cross of Calvary.

   But next, this will be very evident from the nature of the work for
   which Christ was given. It is clear from the Scriptures that He was
   given for the undeserving. He came into the world to save sinners. He
   took upon Himself, not our righteousness, for there was none for Him to
   take, but, as we read just now, "the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity
   of us all." The prominent and paramount idea of Christ in the Scripture
   is that of a Priest offering sacrifice--but the Priest is for men who
   need atonement for their sins--the expiation, the sacrifice, the
   sin-offering, is for guilty men. How could Christ die on the Cross for
   deserving men? The idea is absurd! No bruises were required for those
   who needed not to be healed. There needed to be no chastisement of
   peace for those who deserved well of God. The very work of Christ in
   dying, "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God,"
   implies that we were at a distance from God. It also implies our
   injustice and, consequently, our total inability to deserve such a Gift
   at God's hand. No, no--a Savior is for sinners--a dying Savior must be
   for those who deserved to die! Christ does not come, therefore, to us
   as deserving Him, but He is God's unspeakable Gift!

   And let us think of the splendor of His Grace, the lavish wealth of
   blessing which comes to us through Him. Know you not that as many of
   you as have believed in Christ are made to live with an everlasting
   life? There pulses in you, tonight, the life of eternity, the life of
   Heaven! You have begun to live the life that shall last forever and
   ever. Know you not that you have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit,
   adopted into the family of God? You are the children of the Most High.
   "Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we
   should be called the sons of God." Did you deserve this? Could you
   deserve this? Is it possible? Being adopted into the heavenly family,
   you have been justified-- made just in the sight of God! And now you
   know that you are loved with an everlasting love, that you are
   predestinated to glorify God here, by being conformed to the image of
   His Son. And now you know that you are ordained by Divine decree to sit
   upon a throne which He has prepared for you, and to reign with Him
   forever and ever. Did you deserve this? Can it be conceived that
   anything you have ever done could have been rewarded with such
   extraordinary gifts as these?

   A boy runs an errand for me, and I give him two pence, or, if I am
   generous, I give him sixpence. But if I were to give him a thousand
   pounds, he would not believe that it was a payment for his service--he
   would not think that possible! He would feel that the reward was far
   above anything that he had earned, that his service was quite unworthy
   of so great a gift--and he would conclude that if that great sum of
   money was really his, I must have given it to him out of pure
   generosity. He would never dream that he had earned it, even supposing
   that he had done his errand with all the diligence in the world! And no
   child of God, however much he has served his Lord, ever thinks that he
   deserves to be a child of God, that he deserves to be an heir of
   Heaven, that he deserves to be a priest and a king, to live forever at
   God's right hand in untold blessedness! Oh, no, all this must be a
   gift--we could not have earned such a blessing as this!

   You know that there are two things to make a gift--there cannot be a
   gift without, first of all, one to give it, and then another to receive
   it. Have you received Christ? It is essential, to make Him a Gift to
   you, that you should accept Him. It is little enough that you should
   take into your empty hands the priceless treasure that God bestows. It
   is little enough that, like an empty cup, you should stand under the
   flowing spring and let the crystal stream flow in. But it is necessary
   in order to complete the Gift! I will not ask you to thank God for His
   unspeakable Gift unless, God having given, you also have received! You
   may receive Christ, oh, so freely! If salvation were to be bought--if
   it were to be earned--woe would be unto you! But being a Gift, nothing
   is more free! The poorest man in the world may accept a gift. A
   trembling hand may receive a gift. He that is a thief and a robber,
   yes, a murderer, doomed to die, may accept a gift, if it comes not of
   merit, or by way of reward, but entirely of the generosity of the
   bestower. Oh, what a glorious thing it is that you and I and all of us
   may receive God's unspeakable Gift!

   Once received and accepted, Christ is ours. If a man has made a gift to
   me, I would not say anything that would hurt his feelings, but it is
   not his any more. If he has given it to me, it is mine. A person once
   handed over to me a house that was to belong to a certain part of the
   work that I had to conduct, and if I had taken possession of that house
   when it was given to me, it would have been mine. But I did not. The
   person died and though I held the deeds and writings, yet the gift was
   invalid by the law of mortmain. Had I taken possession when the house
   was handed to me, it would have been mine, but as the case stood, it
   was not mine. I must, if I had taken possession, have said to the
   person giving the house, "You must get out of it, or you must pay me
   rent, however nominal it may be, to acknowledge that this is really
   mine, and that you have given it over to me." But I could not have
   asked such a thing as that, or even dreamed of doing so and, therefore,
   the gift was void, and the house was not mine for the Lord's cause.

   Now, dear Friend, if you accept the Gift that God gives, remember that
   it will be yours--Christ will be yours, eternal life will be yours! You
   will have the title deeds of your inheritance! You will stand possessed
   of it. But do not put that off till death, I pray you. No--take
   possession, now, of that Christ whom God gives over to you to be His
   Gift to you, and your possession forever!

   And I will say one more thing. When once you receive this Gift, you
   will never lose it, "for the gifts and calling of God are without
   repentance," which means that God never regrets that He has given this
   unspeakable Gift. He will never say, "You must let Me have that back."
   If God has given you Christ, and you have accepted Him, He is yours
   forever! And this is the glory of this Divine Gift! A possession that I
   may lose is a very poor possession, after all. A suit at law may be
   brought against me and I may lose what I thought was mine. I would not
   like to have such a possession as that! I could not go to sleep at
   night through fear that I should lose it. But if God has given me
   Christ and I have taken Christ, He is mine! Death, nor Hell, nor
   anything else, shall ever be able to separate the soul from Christ, or
   Christ from the soul that has accepted Him. It was well spoken, "Christ
   and a crust, yes. Christ and no crust would be better than all the
   world without Him." Oh, give me Christ, and let me die, sooner than let
   me live without Christ, for that cannot be truly called life which is
   without Him who is "the Way, the Truth, and the Life."

   I know that some of you have been straining after doing something or
   being something in order to obtain God's unspeakable Gift. Will you
   have it? Will you have it for nothing? Do not insult God by bringing
   your poor wretched merits as the purchase-money for His free Gift of
   Christ! Come just as you are and freely take what He freely gives--and
   Christ is yours forever!

   I was surprised, the other day, when I found that a poor soul in deep
   despair had obtained comfort from a sermon of mine, not upon the
   universal redemption of men, nor upon the free offer of salvation, but
   the man had laid hold of the sharp angular points of a sermon upon the
   Everlasting Covenant and upon the Doctrine of Election. When I heard of
   it, I saw how God can give a soul comfort simply by the exhibition of
   His Sovereign Grace. "It is not of him that wills, nor of him that
   runs, but of God that shows mercy." O Soul, if you will have Christ as
   a Gift, you may have Him tonight! You need not go home, first. You need
   not wait a moment. But if you will not have Him as a Gift, you will
   never have Him, for in no other way can Christ ever belong to you and
   me, except as God's Gift which we, by His Grace, are led freely to
   accept!

   Thus much, and perhaps too much, considering our time, on the first
   point, that Christ is a Gift, the free Gift of God's Grace.

   II. Now, in the second place, let us consider the fact that, AS A GIFT,
   CHRIST IS UNSPEAKABLE. "Thanks be

   unto God for His unspeakable Gift," said the Apostle Paul--and so say
   we. "Why," asks one, "do you speak about Him, then?" Well, principally
   because He is unspeakable. By this time, after nearly 1900 years, if
   the theme we have to preach about were speakable, we should have
   exhausted it--but as it is unspeakable, a sea without a shore, an ocean
   without a bottom--we will keep on preaching for another 1900 years, if
   the Lord does not come--and we shall never get to the end of this
   theme, I am quite sure!

   I heard of a minister who explained to one of his hearers what a
   trouble it was for him to get a sermon. "Oh," he said, "it takes me
   days, and makes my head ache, and I do not know what to do." "Sir," his
   friend replied, "if it is like that, I should think you must be near
   the bottom of the tub." And I should think so, too. But when we come to
   speak about Christ, we have an unspeakable subject! Here is a well
   springing up that overflows and we can speak forever upon this
   unspeakable theme!

   How is it unspeakable? First, he who spoke best of Christ declared that
   He was unspeakable. Do you know anybody who spoke better of Christ than
   Paul did, Inspired as he was? What majestic sentences! What wonderful
   paragraphs you come across in Paul's writing, where he piles up his
   words, mountain upon mountain, in order to glorify Christ! If anybody
   could have spoken Christ out from Alpha to Omega, and told all about
   Him, Paul was the man! And though he did not give up the blessed task,
   but lived and died at it, he declared that God's Gift was unspeakable,
   and I am sure it is so.

   Next, he who needs a Savior most, will tell you that Christ is God's
   unspeakable Gift. You know that man. He sits down in the deep distress
   of his soul, with his hand to his heavy head, but he cannot lay his
   hand on his heavy heart. It would break his arm to try to hold that up!
   Laden with guilt and full of fears, he says, "There is no salvation for
   me but by Christ. Oh, that I could get Christ! Oh, that I could get
   Christ! It would be an unspeakable blessing if I could but believe in
   Christ." I know one who talked like this to his mother, the other
   night. "Why, John," she said, "you look very miserable! You look as if
   you had the whole world hanging on you." "Mother," he replied, "I could
   better bear the whole world with Christ than live without Him." When a
   man thus feels his need of Christ, he knows that Christ is God's
   unspeakable Gift!

   When you receive Christ, you will find that he who enjoys Him most
   feels Him to be an unspeakable Gift. When we do not enjoy Christ much,
   we can talk like parrots about His charms, but when we get our souls
   full of Christ, generally we cannot talk at all about Him! The man who
   feels that Christ is his, that he is saved, and that Christ has filled
   him full of heavenly treasures and made him to possess all things--such
   a man as that--when he begins to try to talk about Christ, gets choked
   up. The tears are in his eyes. "Oh," he says, "let me go home, let me
   get alone and sit down, and quietly think this subject out, for it is
   altogether unspeakable." He who thinks that he could tell all that he
   knows about Christ may also conclude that he does not know much, for he
   who knows most of Him feels that He is God's unspeakable Gift.

   And, Beloved, he who has used Christ most and used Him longest will
   tell you this. At first, Christ is everything to the new-born soul in
   one direction. By-and-by, He is everything in another direction and, in
   the end, Christ is everything in every direction! Tell me, my
   gray-headed Friend, what do you think of Christ? If you have known Him
   50 years, at what is Christ best, Man? "Best?" you ask, "He is best at
   everything!" And so, indeed, He is. And to what use do you put Christ,
   my Brother, in the midst of the battle of life? Do you find Christ good
   as a helmet, breastplate, shoes, or belt? "Oh," you say, "He is good as
   a full armor. All I need, I find in Christ, yes, more than all." It
   would be impossible to tell all the uses to which Christ is put. You
   who have used Him most and longest will say, "He is unspeakably
   precious to us, for He has been good to us in sickness and in health,
   in poverty and in wealth, in joy and in depression. He is equally good
   everywhere! Oh, that we might still go on to know more of Him, for as
   God's great Gift to us He is unspeakable!"

   Again, the preacher who has preached Him most fully knows that Christ
   is unspeakable. Ah, dear Friends! I do not suppose that you can
   understand the feeling that comes over me at times. I have sometimes
   had glorious liberty in preach-ing--I have felt like Naphtali, a hind
   let loose--and I have talked away of my Master to my own joy, and I
   think to yours, too. And then, when I have been on my way home, I have
   begun asking myself, "Now, how did you preach, after all?" And it has
   seemed to me a poor, miserable affair. I have said so little in honor
   of my Master compared with what I ought to have said, that I have felt
   half inclined to come back here and begin again--only the thought has
   often struck me--"You will do it worse if you go back, so that you had
   better leave it alone as it is."

   I know a man, an eminent painter, and a person sat for him 13 times for
   his portrait--and the artist could not catch the sitter's expression. I
   saw him throw his brush right into the middle of the painting and he
   said, "I give it up! I cannot do it." That is how we sometimes feel
   with regard to our Master. Who can paint Him as He ought to be painted?
   We give it up! Go, Sir, and look at the sun, and then come back and
   paint the sun upon your canvas! And then go and look at Christ, and
   express Him by your speech. Nature, all nature together--

   "To make His beauties known, Must mingle colors not her own." He who
   preaches Christ most fully knows that He is unspeakable! You did well
   to sing just now the verse that I often repeat to myself concerning my
   own preaching--

   "Vexed, I try and try again, Still my efforts all are vain! Living
   tongues are dumb at best, We must die to speak of Christ."

   I have come so far and reached my last point. I wish that we had more
   time for such a glorious theme.

   III. Now, thirdly, AS A GIFT UNSPEAKABLE, CHRIST CALLS FORTH PRAISE TO
   GOD FROM US. "Thanks

   be unto God for His unspeakable Gift."

   The Gift of Christ makes us view God with thankfulness. Never fall into
   the mistake that is often made by ignorant persons when they suppose
   that our Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to make God loving. No,
   no, no! Jesus Christ came into the world because God was loving and, in
   love to us, gave His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us--

   "'Twas not to make Jehovah's love

   Towards the sinner flame,

   That Jesus, from His throne above,

   A suffering Mian became.

   'Twas not the death which He endured,

   Nor all the pangs He bore,

   That God's eternal love procured,

   For God was Love before,"

   and He so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son. God's
   unspeakable Gift is not the cause of His love, but the fruit of His
   love! Do not say, "Thanks be unto Christ for dying to placate the
   Father." No, no! "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift." God
   gave His Son--and we adore the Giver--and bless His name. Once we
   thought of God with dread, but now that He has given us Jesus, we think
   of Him with thankfulness. We are glad that there is a God. It is no
   question with us whether there is a God or not! If there were no God,
   it were eternal ruin to us! But because there is a God, there is Heaven
   for us--no, our God is our Heaven, blessed be His name! Thus, we think
   of God with thankfulness.

   And notice, next, that we ought to express that thankfulness. The
   Apostle says, "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift." But, Paul,
   what brought you to that topic? You were talking to these Corinthians
   about giving, not grudgingly, as of necessity, and so on. What brought
   you to the subject of God's unspeakable Gift? Paul answers, "It is
   impossible to say what brought me to this topic, for I am always at it.
   Whatever I am talking about, whatever business I have on hand, I am
   always thanking God for His unspeakable Gift." The Apostle broke out
   into that burst of praise because he could not help it! His soul was
   swelling with intense gratitude and he was obliged to cry out, "Thanks
   be unto God for His unspeakable Gift."

   Dear Friends, praising God is never out of season and never out of
   place. You know that some of us who profess to be Christians are the
   most orderly and proper people in all the world--that is to say, we
   never intrude our religion upon other people. We can see a man for 20
   years and yet never say a word to him about Christ. We do not have
   those dreadful people crying out, "Hallelujah," in the service, do we?
   We are so dreadfully proper! Besides that, we are dreadfully cold as
   well. Perhaps we should speak about Christ very imprudently and do some
   very rash things if we loved Him better, but we love Him so little that
   we become wonderfully prudent and wonderfully proper--and we and the
   world jog on together as if there were no difference between us! If a
   man does roll out an oath, now and then, we are very sorry, but we
   never rebuke him. Of course not! Ah, well, I wish that we could be at
   least as rash as one old man who was employed at a wharf unloading. He
   was weakly and sickly, and so they gave him less pay than others
   received, and he was quite content. But there was a stevedore who, one
   morning, swore at him, and the old man bowed his head and said nothing.
   The blasphemer swore, again, and the old man bowed his head again. At
   last the swearer said, "You old fool, what are you bowing to me for?"
   The good man replied, "I was not bowing to you, but you named the name
   of God, and I thought that I would pay Him reverence even if you did
   not." Well done, old man! Well done, old man! May every Christian here
   find some way of thanking God for His unspeakable Gift! The more the
   world curses, the more let us bless! We are to express our thanks as
   well as to feel grateful.

   Our expression of thankfulness for God's unspeakable Gift would make
   ourselves all the surer that Christ is ours. A man who has received a
   gift and never looks at it, and never thanks the giver, will come, by
   degrees, to forget that he has it, or to forget the giver, and to
   forget how he came by it. Cultivate a grateful spirit when you think of
   what a Gift you have in Christ! Praise the Lord for Christ! Then you
   will need to praise Him, again, and when you have praised Him again,
   you will need to praise Him yet again--and the more you praise Him--the
   more sure you will be that He is really yours! Suppose that a man has a
   garden and that he knows it is his? He is quite sure it is his. And
   suppose that for 20 years he has always gathered all the fruit of the
   garden and lived upon it. Then nobody can question his right--he has

   the right of possession, the right of enjoyment. He received his garden
   as a gift and for the last 20 years he has thanked the giver of it. I
   am sure that his title is clear enough. Oh, how some of you would clear
   your titles if you praised God more! Your very praising and blessing
   Him would be a re-examination of your title deeds--and your confidence
   would grow to full assurance. You would not only know that you had
   received God's unspeakable Gift, but you would also know why you had
   received it!

   Lastly, we are to wish for the spread of such thankfulness. If we are
   in the right frame of mind, we shall not only, ourselves, say, "Thanks
   be unto God for His unspeakable Gift," but we shall mean what Paul
   meant--let everybody else who has received this unspeakable Gift praise
   God for it! Brothers, let us thank God! Sisters, let us praise the
   Lord! I remember being at a Primitive Methodist meeting where they sang
   a hymn beginning--

   "Come, soldiers, can't you rise and tell

   The wonders of Immanuel?

   Yes, bless the Lord, we can rise and tell,

   The wonders of Immanuel." There was a very lively chorus to the hymn
   and those Methodists did sing it, too! It ran like this--

   "All glory to the Lamb of God,

   Who purchased us with atoning blood!

   We soon shallpass over Jordan's flood,

   And join the saved in Glory!"

   I learned a lesson in praise, the other morning. I think it was a
   little after five o'clock, when I was just waking, I heard a blackbird
   come and chirp a note or two close by my window. After a minute or two,
   a thrush also began to sing, And when the two together became fairly
   awake, they were not satisfied until they had aroused all the
   chaffinches, and goldfinches, and sparrows! So they chirped away and
   sang on until they awoke every bird near my house! What an oratorio of
   praise the bird musicians gave forth! They never had to look to their
   paper to see whether they kept to the score, but each one did keep to
   the score, and they rose higher and higher and higher in their exultant
   songs to the God of day who had chased the night away and given them
   light, once more, in the morning!

   Now I am the blackbird that would start the praise tonight. There are
   birds of all sorts here, of different colors, and varying plumages, and
   able to sing all manner of notes. Let us join together to give the Lord
   an evening song as those birds gave Him a morning song--and let this be
   the keynote--"Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift!" Before I
   dismiss those who are not going to remain for the Communion, let us all
   sing--

   "Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,

   Praise Him, all creatures here below!

   Praise Him above, you heavenly host,

   Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. ISAIAH53.

   Mr. Moody was once asked whether his creed was in print. In his own
   prompt way, he replied, "Yes, Sir. You will find it in the 53rd Chapter
   of Isaiah." A condensed Bible is in this chapter. You have the whole
   Gospel here.

   Verse 1. Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
   LORD revealed? Nobody ever does believe either Prophets or preachers
   except through the work of God's Spirit and Grace. The Lord's arm must
   be revealed, or else His Truth proclaimed by His servants will never be
   accepted. All the Prophets speak in these words of Isaiah, as if they
   all stood together, and lifted up this wail, "Who has believed our
   report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"

   2. For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out
   of a dry ground: He has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see
   Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him. This is Israel's
   King, the long-promised Messiah! Yet when He comes to Bethlehem, see
   what "a tender plant" He is! Look at the house of David, almost
   extinct, and see what "a root out of a dry ground" is--

   "The stem of Jesse's rod."

   When Jesus comes before the sons of men, dressed in the garb of a
   peasant, a poor Man, a sorrowful Man, a Man who had not where to lay
   His head, notice how men say, by their actions, if not in words, "There
   is no beauty that we should desire Him."

   3. He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief: and we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was
   despised, and we esteemed Him not. We rightly sing--

   "Rejected and despised of men,

   Behold a Man of woe!

   And grief His close companion still

   Through all His life below!

   We held Him as condemned of Hea ven, An outcast from His God,

   While for our sins He groaned, He bled, Beneath His Fathers rod."

   His own people, yes, His own chosen ones, turned away from Him! And you
   and I did so till God's Grace changed our hearts and opened our eyes!
   But why was He "despised and rejected of men; a Man of Sorrows, and
   acquainted with grief"? Why was the Prince of Israel such a suffering
   Man? He had no sin for which to be chastened. There was no evil in His
   Nature that needed to be fetched out with the rod of correction. Oh,
   no! The answer is very different--

   4, 5. Surely He has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
   did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was
   wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are
   healed. What a joyous note there is in that sorrowful line, "With His
   stripes we are healed"! Glory be to God, we are healed of our
   soul-sickness, cured of the disease of sin by this strange surgery, not
   by stripes upon ourselves, but by stripes upon our Lord!

   6. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, everyone, to his
   own way; and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. The
   general sin of the race, the special sin of the individual--all
   gathered, heap upon heap, mountain upon mountain--and laid by God on
   Christ! We sometimes sing--

   "I lay my sins on Jesus, The spotless Lamb of God. He bears them all
   and frees us From the accursed load. I bring my guilt to Jesus, To wash
   my crimson stains White in His blood most precious, Till not a spot
   remains,"

   and I will find no fault with that hymn. But the real laying of sin
   upon Jesus was effected by God, Himself--"The Lord has laid on Him the
   iniquity of us all."

   7. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth:
   He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
   shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth. He never pleaded for
   Himself. At the earthly judgment seat, He said not a word for Himself,
   so that even Pilate "marveled greatly." Oh, the eloquence of that
   silence! Truly it was golden! Omnipotence restrained Omnipotence!
   Christ held Himself in as with bit and bridle. "As a sheep before her
   shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth."

   8. 9. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare
   His generation? for He was cut off out of the land of the living: for
   the transgression of My people was He stricken. And He made His grave
   with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; because He had done no
   violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth. Therefore He was allowed
   to be buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea. He was no felon,
   whose body must be cast out to the kites and jackals, but "He made His
   grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; because He had
   done no violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth."

   10. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief:
   when You shall make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His
   seed, He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall
   prosper in His hand. Wicked men slew our Lord, and their crime was the
   blackest in the world's history, but, unconsciously, they were carrying
   out "the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God." "It pleased the
   Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief." Christ died

   for others, but He lives, again, and through Him a godly seed shall
   live forever and ever--"When You shall make His soul an offering for
   sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure
   of the Lord shall prosper in His hand." He is made to prosper because
   He died.

   11. He shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.
   His death pangs were birth pangs--"the travail of His soul." He sees
   the multitude that shall be born through His death, and He is content.

   11. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many. Dear
   Hearer, will He justify you? Do you know Him? If you know Him so as to
   trust Him, He has justified you--you are a justified man tonight!
   "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
   Jesus Christ." "By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify
   many."

   11. For He shall bear their iniquities. They kick against this doctrine
   nowadays. They cannot bear it, yet it is the very marrow of the
   Gospel--Christ bearing sin that was not His own, that we might be
   covered with a righteousness which is not our own, but comes from Him!
   Paul, by the Spirit, put this great Truth of God thus, "For He has made
   Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him."

   12. Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall
   divide the spoil with the strong; because He has poured out His soul
   unto death: and He was numbered with the transgressors; and He bore the
   sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. Thanks be
   unto God for this great Sacrifice!

"Dare To Be a Daniel"

   (No. 2291)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 15, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with
   the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank."
   Daniel 1:8.

   VERY much of our future life will depend upon our earliest days. I like
   a remark of Mr. Ruskin's that I remember to have read, though I cannot
   quote it verbatim. He says, "People often say, 'We excuse the
   thoughtlessness of youth,'" but he says, "No, it never ought to be
   excused. I had far rather hear of thoughtless old age, when a man has
   done his work-- but what excuse can be found for a thoughtless youth?
   The time for thought is at the beginning of life and there is no period
   which so much demands, or so much necessitates, thoughtfulness as our
   early days." I would that all young men would think so. They say that
   they must sow their "wild oats." No, no, my dear young Friend, think
   before you sow such seed as that, and remember what the reaping will
   be. See whether there is not better corn to be found than wild oats and
   try to sow that. Then think how you will sow it and when you will sow
   it, for, if you do not think about the sowing--

   "What will the harvest be?"

   If there is any time when the farmer should think, it is surely in the
   early stages of the plowing and the sowing. If he does not think, then,
   it will be of small use for him to think afterwards.

   Daniel was a young man, and he did think. It was his glory that he so
   thought that he came to a purpose, and he purposed, not with a kind of
   superficial, "I will," but he, "purposed in his heart," and gave his
   whole self to a certain definite purpose which he deliberately formed.
   He was a young man--he was also a captive--and that rendered it the
   more remarkable that he should come to such a decision. He had been
   stolen away from his father's house and carried into a foreign land.
   And you know what men say, "When you are in Rome, you must do as Rome
   does." But here was a young man in Babylon who would not do what
   Babylon did--a youth in a king's court who would not eat what the king
   ate, or drink what the king drank--a captive whose very name had been
   changed in order to make him forget his country and his God, for the
   change in name, as I told you in the reading, was meant to be
   significant of a change in religion.

   But though they might change Daniel's name, they could not change his
   nature, nor would he give up anything that he believed to be right.
   Captive as he was, he had a right royal soul, and he was as free in
   Babylon as he had been at Jerusalem. And he determined to keep himself
   so, for he, "purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself
   with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank."
   Oh, that we had a multitude of young men who knew how to put their feet
   down! We have a great number, now, who are watching to see where to put
   their foot down, and they will try to put it down, not where it is most
   solid ground, but where it is most turfy, and easy, and soft to the
   feet! May God give us back the old grit that used to be in
   old-fashioned Christians, to whom custom was nothing, but God's Word
   was everything--to whom it mattered not whether it brought loss or
   gain--but they did the right and followed the right, cost what it
   might!

   Now, it was because Daniel, while yet a youth, a captive, a student,
   was so decided in what he did, that his later life became so bright. He
   would never have been called, "a man greatly beloved," if he had not
   been made, by Grace, a youth greatly decided. Neither would he have
   advanced to the reign of Cyrus, as we read just now, if he had not
   stood firm in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. You shall read the evening
   of life in the morning of life, and you shall decide what your evening
   is to be by what your morning is! God help you, who are beginning life,
   for, if God begins with you and you begin with God, your life will be
   one of happy usefulness which will have a truly blessed end!

   I am going to talk just now, not so much about Daniel, as about the
   whole subject of a spirit of decision in such a time as this. Our first
   head will be that there are temptations to be resisted by us, as there
   were by Daniel. Secondly, there are right methods of resisting
   temptation. And, thirdly, there are certain points which will have to
   be proved by experience while we are in this process of fighting
   against temptation.

   I. THERE ARE TEMPTATIONS TO BE RESISTED. There never was a man yet who
   had faith and who had not

   trials. Wherever there is faith in God, it will be tested at some time
   or other--it must be so. It cannot be that the house shall be built,
   even on the Rock, without the rains descending, the floods coming and
   the winds beating upon that house. Though it shall not fall, yet it
   shall be tried by a force that would make it fall were it not Divinely
   sustained.

   Now, first, look at Daniel's temptations. In his case, the temptation
   was very specious. He was told to eat the portion of food that, every
   day, came from the king's table. Could he need any better? And he was
   commanded to drink the measure of wine, generally the best in the
   world, that was sent from the king's table. He might have fared like a
   prince! Could he have any objection to that? He had no objection except
   this--that it would defile him. Do you understand what he meant by
   that? There were certain foods used by the Babylonians, such as the
   flesh of swine, the flesh of the hare and of certain fish, that were
   unclean, and when these came from the king's table, if Daniel ate them,
   he would be breaking the Law of Moses as given in the Book of
   Leviticus, and thus he would be defiled. Remember that the food which
   was allowed to Israel was to be killed in a certain way. The blood must
   be effectually drained from the flesh, for he that ate the blood
   defiled himself thereby.

   Now, the Babylonians did not kill their beasts in that way and the
   eating of flesh which had not been killed according to the Law would
   have defiled Daniel. You know how careful the Jews are to this day with
   regard to the butchering of the food they eat. More than that, usually
   such a king as Nebuchadnezzar, before he ate food, dedicated it to his
   god. Bel-Merodach was greatly venerated by Nebuchadnezzar as god, so
   that a libation of wine was poured out to Merodach, and a certain
   portion of food was put aside, so that, in fact, it was offered to
   idols--and Daniel felt that he would be defiled if he ate of meat which
   might be unclean, and which was certain to be offered to idols--it
   would be breaking the Law of God--so Daniel would not eat it.

   But the temptation to do so must have been very strong, for somebody
   would say, "Why, what difference can it make what you eat, or what you
   drink?" Under the Christian dispensation, it might be another matter,
   but under the Jewish dispensation, it made a great deal of difference
   whether a man ate or drank certain things. Others would say, "Why is
   Daniel so particular? There have been other Jews here who have
   unhesitatingly eaten the king's meat. We read of king Jehoiakim, that
   he had a portion from the king's table every day, and he does not seem
   to have made any objection! Why does this young fellow put his back up
   so and make himself so odd, and so different from everybody else? There
   is no use in being so strict and sticking out about little things." So
   the temptation came to Daniel with great speciousness.

   Then, the temptation seemed the road to honor. To consent to eat of the
   king's meat and to drink of the king's wine, seemed to be the way to
   get on in Babylon. They would say to Daniel, "Surely, if you begin by
   objecting to what the monarch sends you from his table, you will never
   get on at court. People with a conscience should not go to court." I do
   not say that, today, but I do think that they ought not to be members
   of Parliament! It must be amazingly difficult for a man with a
   conscience to go in and out there! But for Daniel to begin with a
   conscience like this, so particularly tender that it was offended by a
   glass of the king's wine, or a morsel of the king's meat, why, any good
   old fatherly man would have said, "My boy, you will never get on--your
   religion will always stand in your way. I am sure you will never come
   to be much." That would have been a great mistake, however, for Daniel
   became a great ruler and he prospered in the world through that very
   conscientiousness which it was thought would spoil all his prospects!

   Somebody would whisper in Daniel's ear, "It is the law of the land. The
   king, who is supreme, has ordered that you should eat this portion and
   drink this measure of wine each day." Yes, but whatever the law may be,
   and whatever custom may be, the servants of God serve a higher King and
   they have but one rule and one custom! "We ought to obey God rather
   than man." They are ready to be the most obedient subjects up to a
   certain point, but when the Law of God comes in, then are they dogged
   to a degree of obstinacy. They can burn, but they cannot turn--they can
   die, but they cannot deny the Law of the Lord, their God!

   In Daniel's case, if he had done what it was proposed to him to do, it
   would have been giving up the separated life. He felt that if he
   constantly fed upon the luxurious food of the king, he would be
   reckoned to be a Chaldean like the king,

   and so, to keep up his separation as belonging to the chosen seed, of
   whom Balaam prophesied, "The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
   reckoned among the nations," Daniel would not eat of the royal fare
   which was provided for him. Had he done so, he would have melted into a
   Chaldean and given up being an Israelite, to whom belonged the
   promises. This is the temptation of the present day. Profess to be a
   Christian, but float along the common current of the world! Take the
   name of a Christian and go to your place of worship, and go through
   your ceremonies--but do not bring your religion into your business! Act
   as other people do! This is the temptation of the time--as the majority
   of men think, so think you--and as the majority of men say, so say you!
   And as the majority of Christian professors talk, so talk you! This is
   the Satanic temptation which is wrecking our churches and doing, I know
   not how much mischief to men of God! But Daniel, though tempted
   strongly to do like that, would not yield. He "purposed in his heart
   that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat,
   nor with the wine which he drank."

   Now, in our own case, what are the particular temptations to which we,
   as believing men and believing women, are exposed?

   I cannot go into the question of individuals, but I can imagine someone
   here, tonight, who is in a position where he is asked to do what it is
   not right for him to do. But he says, "I shall be fired if I refuse to
   do it! I know others do it and I must do it." My dear young fellow,
   allow me to put before you, Daniel, who purposed in his heart that he
   would not eat the king's meat. I talked, the other day, with a
   gentleman who was the trustee for one of the wealthiest men in England,
   and who now is trustee of the money that the same gentleman has left to
   all his children. Those children have grown up and have come to years
   of maturity, but they still make him the trustee, paying him for
   looking after all their money, which is an immense amount. I was asking
   him how it was that he gained the confidence of the family so that they
   put him in such a position where all that they have is under his care
   and discretion.

   He said that he remembered, when he was but a boy, the head of the
   establishment said to him one day, "Say that I am out," and he replied,
   "Please, Sir, I could not say that, for it would not be true." Of
   course the master was very angry and told him that he must not bring
   his scruples there, or he would never get on in life--but he never
   asked him to tell a lie again--and when somebody was needed to act as
   confidential clerk, that young fellow was selected and, knowing him to
   be one who would be faithful and true, his master took the opportunity
   to promote him! And he put implicit confidence in him from that hour.
   Sometimes you will find that to be out and out for the right will be
   the making of you. I would not urge integrity upon you from such a
   motive, but, since the devil will tell you that it will be the ruin of
   you, I will urge you to stand fast to the right, to speak the truth at
   all times, to be straightforward, for you will find that honesty is the
   best policy. Any man who speaks the truth will find it the best thing
   in the long run! To lie, to stray from the truth, to stall, to try to
   hold with the hare and run with the hounds involves you in a world of
   difficulty and trouble! Be straight as Daniel was. The Lord help you to
   be so!

   But now it comes to Christian people in another way. Some would tempt
   us to assist the cause of God by amusements. Christian people are asked
   to go to places, well, very doubtful places, to say the least, and
   sometimes this evil is introduced into religion, till, as one of our
   friends said most truly in prayer, tonight, they have brought the
   theater into the house of God! They have really done so and brought
   back chaos and old night, primeval darkness. Oh, that God would speak,
   again, and say, "Let there be light," and chase these things of
   darkness away once and for all! I charge every Christian here to make
   his resolve that, if others do these things, as for Daniel, he has
   purposed in his heart that he will not defile himself with the king's
   meat, or with the wine which the king drank!

   So today, again, there is the temptation of love for intellectual
   novelty. Instead of the old, old Gospel, and the old, old Book, for
   which God be thanked forever, we are to place science, which is
   generally conjecture, in the place of Revelation--and the thoughts of
   men are to cover and bury the sublime thoughts of God. I see ministers
   and churches deluded and led astray by these temptations. As for me, if
   no one else will say it, I purpose in my heart not to defile myself
   with this portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.
   We need still to have old-fashioned Believers who will sing the verse
   we sang just now--

   "Should all the forms that men devise Assault my faith with treacherous
   art, I'd call them vanity and lies, And bind the Gospel to my heart,"
   God send us many Daniels of that sort!

   And, besides this, we have, nowadays, the temptation to general laxity.
   People do, even Christian people do, what Christian people should not
   do. And they excuse themselves by quoting the example of other
   Christians, or by saying, "We are not so precise as our fathers were."
   Has God changed? Is there not a text that says, "The Lord your God is a
   jealous God"? Does He permit His people to sin and take pleasure in it?
   And are we to forget that precept, "Be you holy, for I am holy"? Is
   there to be no separation from the world? And is it no longer true
   that, "If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in
   him"? Is there no such text as this, "Come out from among them, and be
   you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I
   will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and you shall be My
   sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty"? I pray you, Brothers and
   Sisters, now, if never before, tie everything up as tightly as you can!
   The storm is now so heavy that you need to go with close-reefed sails.
   Oh, for a Daniel's declaration that you will not defile yourself with
   the portion of the king's meat, or with the wine which he drank!

   I could continue long at this point, but I have given you the general
   principle which you can work out for yourselves. Christians have meat
   to eat of which the world knows not. We have our re-creation--that is
   the way to pronounce recreation--re-creation. We go to our Creator and
   He makes us anew. We have our nights of holy mirth. We have our days of
   delight. There is a King, a portion of whose meat we rejoice to eat,
   and of whose wine we delight to drink. But as to questionable things,
   things of the world, and all that tends towards departure from the
   living God, we say that, by His Grace, we determine not to defile
   ourselves with them!

   II. Now I come to the second point. THERE ARE RIGHT METHODS OF
   RESISTING TEMPTATION.

   And the first is that the heart must be set. "Daniel purposed in his
   heart." He looked the matter up and down and he settled it in his
   heart. Before he asked Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego anything about
   it, he had made up his own mind. Oh, for a made-up mind! Oh, for the
   man who knows how to look at his compass and to steer his vessel where
   he ought to go! God grant you Divine Grace, young man, to nail your
   colors to the mast and to be determined that you will keep to the right
   course, come fair wind or come foul! Daniel had settled it in his
   heart. The Grace of God is a great heart-settler. Where it comes, men
   become firm and positive, for the Lord teaches them to profit.

   The next thing is that the life must be willing. Daniel was helped in
   carrying out his resolution by his own personal character. God had
   brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the
   eunuchs. Whenever a man is brought into favor and tender love, and is a
   good man, there is something about him that has commended itself. There
   is a something about him that is lovable, or he would not have been
   loved. It is of no use for a man to say, "I have made up my mind upon
   certain things," and to keep doggedly fighting over those matters,
   while, at the same time, the whole of his life is unkind, ungenerous
   and unlovable. Yes, by all manner of means be a martyr if you like, but
   do not martyr everybody else, for it is very possible to get so much
   grit in you that you become all grit. There are some who have carried
   firmness into obstinacy and determination into bigotry, which is a
   thing to be shunned. Yield everything that may be yielded! Give up mere
   personal whims and oddities, but as for the things of God, stand as
   firm as a rock about them. God had brought Daniel into favor and tender
   love with the prince who was set over him, but there was in Daniel, by
   God's Grace, a generosity and frankness and nobleness of character
   which even the mighty Chaldean admired. Oh, for a grand character to
   support one's religious determination!

   Then observe that the protest must be courteously borne. While Daniel
   was very decided, he was very courteous in his protests. He went to the
   prince and he told him his scruples. He requested that he might not be
   obliged to defile himself. There are many ways of doing the same thing
   and some people always select the very ugliest way of doing everything.
   Let us ask for wisdom and discretion in doing that which is right.
   Firmness of purpose should be adorned with gentleness of manner in
   carrying it out. It was so with young Daniel.

   Next to that, self-denial must be sought. I do not think that Daniel
   had any objection to eat flesh, or to drink wine, for he evidently did
   both, according to other portions of this Book, but his objection was,
   for religious reasons, against the king's meat and the king's wine, so
   he said, "To make it clear that nothing that enters my lips has ever
   been dedicated to idols, let me have nothing to eat but
   vegetables--lentils, beans, peas and such like things--and for drink,
   let me have that of which kings do not often take much, let me have
   nothing but water, in order to make quite sure that I have no libation
   that has been offered to idols."

   So Daniel and his three companions denied themselves luxuries, which,
   perhaps, they enjoyed as much as anybody else, so as by no means to
   defile themselves with anything which had been associated with the
   Babylonian idols. If you

   will be out and out for God, you must expect self-denial and you will
   have to habituate yourself to it. Be ready for a bad name; be willing
   to be called a bigot; be prepared for loss of friendships; be prepared
   for anything so long as you can stand fast by Him who bought you with
   His precious blood. He that should run the gauntlet of earth and Hell
   for a thousand years, and yet hold fast his integrity, would be a
   gainer by all that he lost--he would gain an increase of eternal joy by
   all he suffered. Therefore, I charge you, seek for the Daniel spirit.

   And then the test must be boldly put. Daniel showed his faith when he
   said to Melzar, "Feed me and my three companions on this common fare;
   give us nothing else. We do not ask you to leave us to our plan for
   twelve months; try us for a short time. I do not say a day or two; but
   take as many days as you like. Put us to the test and if, at the end of
   the appointed time, we are not all the better for our plain fare, then
   we will consider further, but, for the present, will you try us?" I
   think that a Christian man should be willing to be tried. He should be
   pleased to let his religion be put to the test. "There," he says,
   "hammer away if you like." Do you need to be carried to Heaven on a
   feather bed? Do you need to always be protected from everybody's sneer
   and frown--and to go to Heaven as if you were riding in the procession
   on Lord Mayor's day? Well, if so, you are very much mistaken if you
   think you are going to have it so! God give you courage, more and more
   of it, through faith in Himself! May you be willing to put your
   religion to every proper test, the test of life, and the test of death,
   too!

   III. Now, in closing, I want to show you that THERE ARE CERTAIN POINTS
   WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE

   PROVED BY EXPERIENCE. I speak, now, to you Christian people who hold
   fast by the old doctrines of the Gospel, who mean to hold fast by the
   old ways and will not be led astray by modern temptations. Now what
   have you to prove?

   Well, I think that you have to prove that the old faith gives you a
   bright and cheerful spirit. Really, I cannot help laughing, sometimes,
   when I see myself as some other people see me. One gentleman describes
   me as having "settled down into an ever-deepening gloom." It is a
   curious thing that I was not aware of this at all! You who know me and
   with whom I mix--have you noticed this "ever-deepening gloom" falling
   upon me? Do I preach like a man who has lost all the joy of life and
   all his comfort? I think not! If there is a happier man beneath the
   skies than I am, I will not change places with him, for I am perfectly
   satisfied to take things as they come to me--and I am glad that he has
   more to rejoice in than I have! Yet I am sure I do not know what he has
   that I have not. I have God in Heaven, I have God on earth! My heart is
   filled with an intense satisfaction in the firm conviction that what I
   believe is true and that what I preach to you is true! I am ready to
   stand before the Judgment Seat to give an account of what I have
   preached! That which I have asked you to believe, I myself believe, and
   if I am lost with faith in Christ, and you are lost, well, we will both
   be lost and go down in the same ship, for I have not a little private
   boat on the davits, ready to be let down, that I may got away by
   myself! I shall stick to the old ship and be the last man to leave
   it--and I shall not leave it--neither will the ship go down, but it
   will carry us all safely to the desired haven!

   Well, dear Friends, if you hold by this truth, do not let that ever
   make you gloomy! Men talk of "Gloomy Calvinism!" Have you never read
   about that "awful gloomy Calvinism"? Think of Calvin, a man who
   suffered from somewhere about 83 separate diseases--the most pained and
   tortured of all men as to his body--yet look at his life and read his
   Commentaries and his other books, and see the deep and wondrous calm
   that filled his mighty soul! There was nothing gloomy about his
   Calvinism--it was all bright and light and cheering to him. They do not
   know us, or they would not attack us as they do! Perhaps they would,
   though, for the enemies of the Truth of God are always ready to lie in
   their throats.

   Another point that we shall have to prove, dear Friends, is that the
   old faith promotes holiness of life. There are some who say, "Those
   people cry down good works." Do we? If you bring them as a price to
   purchase salvation, we do cry them down. "All our righteousnesses are
   as filthy rags" and, as somebody says, "The rags have the best of it,
   for they are worth more than our righteousnesses." We do say that, but,
   though we cry down good works as a ground of confidence, we wish to
   abound in them more and more to the glory of God! Go to some people and
   hear them talk about good works and go to other people and see them
   done! We wish for you and for ourselves, that we may be so holy in our
   lives and so gracious in our conversation that even our adversaries
   shall be compelled to say, "Whatever their doctrines may be, their
   lives are right." We have to prove that we are fatter and fairer than
   those who eat the king's meat! God help us to prove that we are more
   truthful and more godly than those who have not like precious faith!

   The next thing, dear Friends, is that we must prove that the old faith
   produces much love of our fellow men. You know that, nowadays, the
   watchword is, "the enthusiasm of humanity." It is a curious thing that
   those churches that have such a wonderful "enthusiasm of humanity"
   speak of us as if we were always talking of God and forgetting men.
   Well, well, which of these new-fangled churches has an orphanage? It is
   very fine to talk about Christian socialism and what you are going to
   do for the poor--but what have you done? Much of it is just chatter,
   chatter and nothing else! But the godly, who feel that God is All, are,
   after all, those who care most for men. And those who believe most
   firmly that the unbelieving sinner will be lost are the men who are
   most anxious to have him saved! Those who believe that there is no
   salvation but by the precious blood are determined that Christ shall
   see of the travail of His soul. Those who believe that salvation is all
   of Grace, from first to last, are moved to preach it with heart and
   soul wherever they have the opportunity. And, when God makes up His
   last account, it shall be found, I trust, that the best lovers of men
   have been those who were first of all the best lovers of God! By your
   help, by your kindness, by your benevolence, prove it, so that when
   they come to look at you who have eaten nothing but vegetables and who
   have drunk water, they may find that, after all, you appear fairer and
   fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king's
   meat and drank his wine. Let our labor for the conversion of souls be
   incessant! Let us abound and superabound in it!

   And then, dear Friends, let us prove that the old faith enables us to
   hare great patience in trial. He who believes the Doctrines of Grace is
   the man who can suffer! He who falls back on Predestination and the
   Sovereignty of God is the man to bear burdens that would crush another!
   And when we come to die, who will die best? Will it be the man who is
   trusting in his own righteousness, or trusting in constantly changing
   philosophy that alters like a chameleon, according to the light that
   falls on it? Who will die best? You, with all this flimsy stuff, or he
   who, believing in his God, and in his Bible, falls back upon the blood
   and righteousness of Jesus Christ?

   Finally, Brothers and Sisters, what is needed is that we who hold the
   old faith should be in a better state of spiritual health. May every
   Grace be developed! May every faculty be consecrated! May your whole
   lives be spent in walking with God and may you be such men and women
   that, if we need evidences of the truth of our holy religion, we may
   bring you forward and say, "See what Grace has made them! A belief in
   the Doctrines of Grace has fashioned them as they are, and they,
   themselves, are the proof of what they believe."

   May God bless to many here the words which I have spoken so feebly--and
   may many a young man--

   "Dare to be a Daniel! Dare to stand alone! Dare to have a purpose firm!
   Dare to make it known!"

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. DANIEL 1.

   Verse 1. In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
   Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. Sin
   always brings its punishment. King Jehoiakim did evil in the sight of
   the Lord, so God used Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to be the rod in
   His hand to scourge His sinful people and their wicked king.

   2. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into his hand. It was
   not merely that Nebuchadnezzar was strong enough to overcome the Jews,
   but God handed over His people into Nebuchadnezzar's hand. The enemy
   cannot touch the Church of God without Divine permission.

   2. With part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
   the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels
   into the treasure house of his god. See how holy things, once used for
   the noblest purposes, become of no further service when the Spirit of
   God is gone from the Church. You know that when the Philistines
   captured the Ark of God, and put it in the temple of Dagon, the
   fish-god fell down broken before the Ark. Nothing of this kind happened
   in Babylon. The holy vessels were put into the heathen temple and no
   miraculous result followed, for God cares nothing for golden vessels in
   and of themselves. When sin has polluted His people, their precious
   things are nothing to Him. They may go where men please to carry them.
   All their value lies in God accepting the service rendered through
   them. So,

   Brothers, you may keep up your attendance at the Lord's Supper, and
   your preaching, and your gathering for worship--but they will all be
   nothing without the Spirit of God!

   Look how the Lord's Supper is turned into the sacrifice of the "mass,"
   and how Baptism is represented as the channel or medium of
   regeneration, when once the Spirit of God has gone from the
   Divinely-appointed ordinances! Besides these holy vessels,
   Nebuchadnezzar took the best of the people of the land and carried them
   away captive. He singled out the rich and the noble--those who had
   education and other attainments--while he left the poorest of the land
   behind. Sometimes those who are the most exalted will have the most
   suffering.

   3. 4. And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that
   he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's
   seed, and of the princes; children--youths--

   4. In whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all
   wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such
   as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they
   might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
   Nebuchadnezzar was, in many respects, an enlightened ruler. He looked
   upon this as one of the best things that he could do for his court and
   vast empire, that he should pick out the best of the young men of every
   nation, who should bring their national knowledge with them, and then,
   being sprightly in body and nimble in mind, should be trained to become
   counselors, or advisers of the court, or be prepared to fill important
   offices as they became vacant.

   5. And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat,
   and of the wine which he drank. Treating them exceedingly well,
   thinking, perhaps, that the very food they ate might help to tone their
   minds for the work to which he had called them. He wished to make them
   into true Chaldeans, so he ordained that they must eat of the meat he
   ate and drink of the wine he drank.

   5. So nourishing them three years. Putting them to college, as it were,
   for three years--

   5, 6. That at the end thereof they might stand before the king. Now
   among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
   and Azariah. You know these men's names, you will recognize them when
   you hear them in their altered form.

   7. Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names. This was to
   Chaldeanize them, to take away from them everything Jewish.

   7. For he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah,
   of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
   Now these young men's Jewish names had, each one of them, the name of
   God worked into their texture. I need not stay to bring it out, but
   there is a signification about each name connecting it with God. You
   hear in two of them the sound of El, which is a name of God, and in the
   other two, the termination Iah, which brings out the name Jehovah. The
   new names that were given to them appear to have been connected with
   idols--at all events, it was so with Belteshazzar and Abednego, or
   Abednebo. The intent was to make Babylonians of them.

   8. But Daniel purposed in his heart.--I always like to come across a,
   "but," when there is any scheme of this kind. When the plan is to
   seduce men from right, then it is a happy thing to have a but, but,
   but, "But Daniel purposed in his heart," determined, settled, fixed it.

   8. That he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's
   meat, nor with the wine which he drank. Daniel here mentions only
   himself, but the three others were one with him in the resolve and the
   request. He was the leader. Sometimes there would be no Shadrach,
   Meshach and Abednego, if there was not a Daniel. The other three might
   never have had the strength of mind if it had not been for the Daniel
   who dared to stand alone. But having such a brave leader, they dared to
   stand with him. We often owe much to spiritually-minded men who are
   able to help others to take a right course.

   8, 9. Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might
   not defile himself. Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender
   love with the prince of the eunuchs. It was like the case of Joseph and
   Potiphar. Daniel's gentle disposition, his loving ways, his open and
   frank spirit had won upon the prince of the eunuchs, so that he not
   only regarded him with favor, but even had a tender love for him. God
   has the hearts of all men under His control and He may give His people
   favor where they least expect it.

   10. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the
   king, who has appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see
   your faces worse looking than the children which are of your sort? Then
   shall you make me en-

   danger my head to the king. What a reign of terror there is in a
   despotic country where kings can do as they will! For the smallest
   offense, a man's head may be in danger!

   11, 12. Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
   set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, Prove your servants, I
   beseech you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and
   water to drink. I like it that the Holy Spirit uses their old names
   whenever it is proper that they should be used. May we never lose our
   old names! I mean, our new names, for they have grown old with some of
   us now! May we always be known as the servants of God and not as
   Chaldeans! The prince of the eunuchs gave Daniel a kind of hint, that,
   if the officer under him chose to take the responsibility of altering
   the food and drink, he might do so, and the prince would not interfere
   with the experiment. So Daniel turns to Melzar and says to him, "Prove
   your servants for a suitable time. Let us have vegetables to eat, and
   water to drink." He put his request in an extreme light in order to be
   quite sure that nothing brought to him would come from the king's
   table.

   13. Then let our countenances be looked upon before you, and the
   countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat:
   and as you see, deal with your servants. "If we do fall off and grow
   thin, and look pale and ill through this coarse food, as you think it,
   well then, alter it. But if, on the other hand, we should be as well as
   those who have eaten the king's meat, and drunk the king's wine, then
   let us keep to our vegetables and water."

   14. So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. A
   round number, standing for a sufficient period to afford a fair test.

   15. And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer--and
   fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
   king's meat. I doubt not that the satisfaction of heart which they had
   in keeping themselves undefiled tended to give them a good digestion
   and thus they were more likely to be well than were the others.

   16. 17. Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
   that they should drink; and gave them vegetables. As for these four
   children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom.
   God can help us in our study. We may pray as much over what we have to
   learn as over what we have to do. I believe that, often, a difficult
   problem can be best solved by prayer. All true knowledge and skill in
   all learning and wisdom are the gifts of God.

   17-19. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. Now at
   the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in,
   then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
   And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like
   Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the
   king. They were made to be his attendants, his advisers--these very men
   who had been so absurd as not to eat the food from the royal table--so
   obstinate as to consider that they would defile themselves if they did!
   It is these absurd and obstinate people who cannot be bent, but must be
   straight--the upright men who shall stand before kings--for God is with
   them.

   20. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
   enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians
   and astrologers that were in all his realm. They communed with God and
   that was better than being magicians or stargazers! Men of God are ten
   times better than all that lot put together!

   21. And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. Those
   two words summarize the whole of Daniel's history--"Daniel continued."
   May God give to each of us here Divine Grace to continue as Daniel did!

Abraham, A Pattern To Believers

   (No. 2292)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 22, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "By faith he (Abraham) sojourned in the land of promise, as in a
   strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
   heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which has
   foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God." Hebrews 11:9,10.

   ABRAHAM'S life, taken literally, is full of instruction, but we shall
   be wise to take the spirit of it and endeavor to make it our own. We
   cannot live just as Abraham did, but we can carry out the great
   principles which lay at the root of Abraham's life and, if the Holy
   Spirit will work in us a like degree of faith to that of the holy
   Patriarch, we may glorify God by our lives, even as he did.

   The first point in which we must follow him is that our life must be a
   life of faith. We cannot be children of believing Abraham unless we
   live by believing. If you follow your senses, you go by what you see.
   Now, by what this poor flesh would teach you to desire, you will know
   nothing of the life of Abraham. He was a man who saw what eyes can
   never see. He heard what ears can never hear and he was moved, guided,
   actuated by motives which men of the world can never feel. He was a
   great man, a very prince among men--first, chief and father of all
   believing men--but he owed the preeminence of his character to the
   greatness of his faith. We must have his faith and we must live by it,
   as he lived by it-- and then God will be able to make something of even
   such poor, feeble creatures as we are.

   Let me remind you of what we read in the sixth verse, "Without faith it
   is impossible to please Him: for he that comes to God must believe that
   He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him." If
   we would be like "faithful Abraham," we must begin by being Believers.

   Abraham is, in three things, a pattern to us who believe, and those
   three things will be the divisions of our subject tonight. He is a
   pattern to us, first, in the mode of his living--"He sojourned in the
   land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tents." Secondly,
   Abraham is a pattern to Believers in the company he kept--"With Isaac
   and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise." And, thirdly,
   Abraham is a pattern to Believers in the home he looked for--"For he
   looked for a city which has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is
   God."

   I. First, dear Friends, it should be our anxious desire to imitate
   Abraham spiritually IN THE MODE OF HIS LIVING. How did he live?

   Well, first, he lived as a man cut off from old associations. He had
   dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, on "the other side of the flood," as the
   Scripture says, and he was called to leave his family, his estate, his
   country--and go to a land which he had never seen, and which God
   promised, ultimately, to give to his family to be an inheritance
   forever. Abraham was not disobedient. He left his country and he
   journeyed to the land pointed out to him. Now, dear Friends, we are
   not, as a rule, to leave our friends and kindred. We would be very
   ungenerous and ungrateful if we did. There may, however, be occasions
   when even that may have to be done, but we are really to leave our old
   associations, our unspiritual, sinful, worldly associations and to come
   right out. You who are born of Christian parents and live in godly
   families, do not know much about this coming out, for you are
   singularly shielded. But there are some here who, if they become
   Christians, will get "the cold shoulder" from everybody in the house. A
   man's foes will, in their case, be they of his own household. They will
   have to quit their present business. They will have to cut the
   connection between them and many ungodly men and women. They will have
   to come right out from the old kith and kin of their ungodliness and
   each one of them will have to say--

   "I am on the Lord's side--

   My old companions, fare you well, I cannot go with you to Hell."

   Now, Abraham did this and he never went back again, as some do who run
   away from their old master for a little while, and then go back to his
   cruel service to their own destruction.

   I suppose Abraham was called out from the place where he dwelt, to live
   a separated life, because his kinsfolk and acquaintances were
   idolaters. The Lord said to Israel, through Joshua, "Your fathers dwelt
   on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of
   Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods." Abraham
   must, therefore, be taken away from that connection, that he might
   serve the living and true God. "No," you say, "but when he went to
   Palestine, he was among idolaters." Yes, but it is one thing to walk up
   and down among idolaters, and quite another thing to be in the same
   family with them! Abraham was safe enough from idolatry when he moved
   about among the Canaanites and saw their obscene worship. But he was
   not safe from it in a decent, respectable household like that of his
   father, where the teraphim were slyly adored, and the worship of false
   gods was carried on without the disgusting abominations that were
   common in Canaan.

   I think that more people are lost through half-way Christians than
   through profligates. Men seldom become drunkards through drunkards.
   They become drunkards through--well, we will say no more about
   that--you know what I mean. And I do not think that men often learn to
   grow up dishonest by the example of great thieves, but it comes through
   imitating people who are thought to be honest, and yet can pilfer. Ah,
   Friends, it is a good thing to get a man right out from the world, even
   from the best side of it, for the best part of the world is bad enough
   and complete separation from it, with a deep abyss between it and
   ourselves, is really necessary for our spiritual health.

   Now, the next thing about Abraham was that while he lived away from his
   country, he lived in the land of promise. That was an odd thing, was it
   not, that he should be a stranger in the land of promise? God had given
   it to him and to his seed by a Covenant of Salt, and yet he possessed
   not a foot of it except what he bought from the sons of Heth for a
   bury-ing-place. That is all he had. So, today, in this world, perhaps
   all that some of you will ever have is about six feet of earth for a
   burying-place, and yet it is all yours, it is all yours. You are living
   in the land of promise. "The meek shall inherit the earth." They that
   fear the Lord are the true possessors of the world and the day shall
   come when even this poor world, itself, brought into subjection to the
   Christ of God, shall be ours! Indeed, it is ours already and much more
   than the world is also ours, as the Apostle says, "Things present, or
   things to come, all are yours." Abraham was in the land of promise and
   yet he was a stranger in it.

   In this point you must be like he. Regard everything about you as yours
   and yet consider that you have not anything in actual possession except
   that little plot in the cemetery where sleeps one well-beloved and
   where you, too, shall sleep, unless the Lord shall come. The point to
   be remembered is that we are to be strangers in this world! We are not
   to be mistaken for citizens of this world--we ought to be known to be
   strangers in it. Abraham never blushed to say, even to the lordly sons
   of Heth, "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you." He did not want
   them to think that he was a Canaanite. I do not know what he would have
   done if they had fallen into that idea. Christian people, if you were
   what you should be, men would know that you did not belong to this
   ungodly race! You have been redeemed from among men. You have been
   endowed with a new life to which they are strangers--and it ought to be
   apparent in your daily walk and conversation that you seek another
   country. This world is not your country and never can be!

   Why was Abraham made to be a stranger in that country? I think it was
   that he might be tried and that in the trial Graces might be developed
   which could never have come out otherwise. And you are to be a stranger
   in the midst of your own friends, that your patience may be tried, that
   your faith may be exercised, and that your holy longings for the better
   country may often break out.

   Was he not put there, also, that, being absent from Home, he might
   learn to look for it by faith? You are not to be in Heaven just yet. It
   is not the time for you to be there. You are to be absent from Heaven
   that you may long for it, that you may go there with a better appetite!
   I think a boy who goes to school loves home the better when he comes
   back for his holidays. Oh, what a Heaven will Heaven be to some of
   God's people who spend the most of their time on a hard bed, made
   harder by their lying long upon it, and who have none of the comforts
   of this life and, perhaps, not too much of the comforts of the life to
   come! One hour with our God will make up for everything we suffer here!
   But our suffering will go a long way towards making Heaven more truly
   Heaven when once we get there.

   Abraham was placed in Canaan as a stranger, in this sense, that he had
   nothing to do with many of the cares that vexed the sons of Heth. Nor
   have you as a Christian anything to do with the cares that vex the
   worldling. You ought to have no care to get rich. You are a stranger
   here--why do you want to heap up the furniture when you are soon going
   away? You ought not to know the worldings' fret and worry. They are at
   home and they may well fret. That house is decaying, this furniture is
   going out of repair--but what is that to you? It is none of yours! You
   are only a traveler stopping at the inn and if the place should fall
   down tomorrow, you will be away. You are on your journey Home--you are
   not a fixture, as these men are--you take but little concern in the
   things that they are most worried about. If I go to Mentone, I do not
   trouble about French politics. I know who is the President of the
   Republic, but I do not know the name of the great men who sit on his
   right and on his left hand, and I do not want to know! If I hear
   anything about politics, I like to know what is being done in my own
   dear homeland.

   So, you Christians, your citizenship is in Heaven. As to these things
   which are down below, you take an interest in them so far as they
   concern the Kingdom of God and the good of your fellow men, but you are
   no partisan. Why should you be? You are a stranger and a foreigner--and
   so you keep aloof from party strifes and from those cares and other
   things of which the men of the world think so much.

   I think, also, that Abraham was sent to Canaan as a stranger to be a
   witness for God. These people were soon to be destroyed, but their
   iniquity was not yet full, so they had another chance in the living of
   a man of God, a Prophet of God, among them. You, my Christian friend,
   are a stranger here, and you are living here for the good of those
   around you. It may be that you may snatch some brand from the burning.
   Be content to stay if such is the case.

   Abraham lived there to show the people what God could do for those who
   trusted in Him. He was a mere gypsy in the land, moving about with his
   tent, and yet he came to be the richest man among them! Abraham was
   very greatly blessed in flocks and in herds, for God took care of
   him--and I think He did it to say to these Canaanites, "You see, with
   all your fret, and all your worry, God's servant, Abraham, gets on
   better than you do." So, when the king of Sodom offers Abraham wealth,
   he grandly says, "I will not take from a thread even to a shoelace, and
   I will not take anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have
   made Abraham rich." Yet the man was prospered and by his prosperity he
   taught men this lesson--that he who trusts in God is no fool. He who
   trusts in God shall find, even in this life, as far as he is able to
   bear it, and God thinks fit, that the Lord "is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek Him."

   Still, Abraham was, to all intents and purposes, a foreigner in the
   land that belonged to him, even as you are strangers in a world that
   belongs to you. And as your Lord came unto His own, and His own
   received Him not. And as God, Himself, is a stranger in the world He
   made, even as David said to the Lord, "I am a stranger with You, and a
   sojourner, as all my fathers were."

   To make this point still more clear as to Abraham's mode of living, I
   want you to notice that Abraham lived in tents. He never erected a
   house, he built no booths--he simply had his tent--he pitched it, or
   shifted it as he moved from place to place. Why was this? What did it
   mean? Not that you should go in a tent, but that you should feel that
   everything you have, all round about you, all your possessions, are but
   frail things and are apt to change. I know that you begin to look upon
   that little property as a very sure thing--be not deceived, the only
   sure thing is your God! You are beginning to look upon your worldly
   income as pretty certain and you rest upon it. The only thing you may
   rest upon is the faithful promises of your God! So you think your wife
   will live? Ah, me, I do not wish to grieve you, but if I could
   prophesy, I would not tell you how soon she may be taken. You look upon
   your children as young immortals--but they are not. You will have to
   bury them, or they will have to bury you. All things here pass away.

   I cannot tell you the strange joy I felt after the earthquake at
   Mentone. I had been to see many of the houses that had been shaken down
   and the two churches that were greatly injured, and I was full of the
   earthquake. I had quite realized its terrors and its power, and when I
   went up the stairs of my hotel, I thought, "Well, at any moment this
   may all come down with a run. When I go to bed, it may all slip away."
   And I felt a great delight in thinking that I actually realized, not in
   a dream, but as a matter of fact, the shakiness of this poor earthquaky
   world and how everything in it is without foundation, but is just a
   mere tent which might come down at any moment--a gust of wind might
   blow it over! When we are most comfortable in it, we may hear a voice
   saying, "Up and away! Pack up your tent and journey somewhere else."

   Sit loose by this world, I pray you! Let not your roots strike into
   this accursed soil. Live here as those who are soon to live there--and
   tarry here as men who only tarry till the trumpet sounds, "Boot and
   saddle! Up and away, for this is not your rest." When we live so, we
   shall live as Abraham did, and as God would have us live.

   II. Now, very briefly, in the next place, we must imitate Abraham IN
   THE COMPANY HE KEPT--"Dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs
   with him of the same promise."

   What a fortunate, no, what a gracious circumstance it was that Abraham
   could find the best company in his own neighborhood! There are some men
   I know that are fine company out of doors, wonderful company, I have
   heard say, in the bar-parlor, or at a banquet, but they are no company
   to anybody at home. Short, gruff, sharp barks like a wolf--this is all
   their family can get out of them. When they are once inside the house,
   they are not at home. When they are outside, and far away, then they
   are quite at home.

   But here is Abraham, who lives in a tent, and has the happiness of
   finding his best company in his own family. I suppose that he lived
   with Isaac about 75 years. If you calculate, you will find that that is
   about the time. Did he live with Jacob? Yes, he must have lived at the
   same time as Jacob for about 15 years. He saw his dear son Isaac
   married, and twin children born, and he marked their life long enough
   to see that Jacob was of that kind that would make a plain man dwelling
   in tents--and Abraham found the sweetest company with his own dear
   family. May the Lord in mercy convert all our children, and their
   wives, and their children--and may we have a church in a house, as
   Abraham had a church in a tent! Happy are men who can find their best
   company at home!

   But that is not the point I want to mention. Abraham dwelt in tents
   with those like-minded with himself. We know a man by his company--and
   a man is blessed or cursed by his company. Abraham dwelt in tents with
   Isaac and Jacob-- men of the same spirit as himself, quite different
   men, but men saved by the same Grace, men who worshipped the same God,
   men who lived for the same end, men who were actuated by the same
   principles, men who were co-heirs with him of the promised land! This
   is the company I keep. These are the dearest friends I know. If you
   need a merry evening, child of God, get together half-a-dozen who are
   like yourself--God's children! If you need an evening that you can look
   back upon with delight, gather such a company together! Never mind how
   poor the Believers are--perhaps the poorer they are the better it will
   be, for they will talk more freely with God, often, than some of what
   we call the better class--the worse class, I have often had to call
   them. Children of God, who really have to look to Him for daily bread,
   are often more full of faith than any other class of society. People of
   God who know the rough and tumble of the world, those who have stood
   its hard usage, those who mix from day to day with ungodly men who
   scoff at them--these are the men who come to God in real earnest! They
   do not play at religion--they live it! Never mind their station or rank
   in life. If they are in good favor with God, let them be in good favor
   with you and make your choicest companions among the people of

   God.

   I have seen some, who call themselves children of God, turn up their
   noses at God's best people because they did not put their H's in the
   right places, or they spoiled the Queen's English. Bless the dear
   souls! If their hearts are right with God, what matters it about the
   faultiness of their speech? Ah, how often have our souls been carried
   up to Heaven by prayers that violated all the proprieties! And how
   often have I been made to feel as dull as death by a prayer that was
   wonderfully beautiful in its wording--cold moonlight, no sunshine--a
   pretty picture, but no life in it! Give us the life of God and let us
   get into our tent with Isaac and with Jacob, and there let us find
   Isaac's God, and Jacob's God, and we shall do well!

   Dear young Friends, who have lately come to Christ, mind that you keep
   company with God's people. I do not want you to have a lot of
   acquaintances to talk to, but have one or two. Perhaps two may be
   better than one, but one is good enough--one godly Christian to whom
   you can go and tell your troubles--one older than yourself who has been
   a little farther on the road than you have been. Talk with such saints,
   as Jacob probably talked with father Isaac, and Isaac with father
   Abraham, while they lived together in the same encampment and dwelt in
   tents.

   III. Now, lastly, I wish to say something that may lead your hearts
   away from this poor, dead, dull world. Let us imitate Abraham IN THE
   HOME HE LOOKED FOR--"for he looked for a city which has foundations,
   whose Builder and Maker is God."

   Note, first, that all saints live with an eye beyond time. You know,
   the horse and the cow are quite satisfied as long as there is something
   in the rack or the manger--they make no provision for future months.
   Young men, when they begin

   life, often spend in waste all they get and make no provision for old
   age. We do not commend you for your wisdom if you have done so, but we
   beg you not only to think of all that may be needed while you are here,
   but to think also of the hereafter. Can we live through this transient
   span of time and never remember that we have to live forever? Can we
   spend all our time upon time and have no view to eternity? FOOLS,
   FOOLS, FOOLS, written in capital letters, are they who can use this
   life and never regard it as the hinge upon which must swing the great
   door of their eternal state! Children of God have an eye to the world
   to come. They do not live "like dumb, driven cattle," but they think of
   the changeless state into which death, or Christ's coming, may speedily
   plunge them--and they live with an eye to that state.

   Saints have good reason to live thus. They have not much here, as a
   rule. "If in this life, only, we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
   most miserable."--

   "Alas, for us, if you were all, And nothing beyond, O earth!"

   Alas, for the believer in God, if all he had could be had here! Surely,
   we are to be greatly pitied as having missed the grandest end if this
   world contains our all! But it does not contain our all--Christians
   have a hope beyond the grave! What an awful thing it must be to
   everyone here who must die, but who has no idea, yet, of what will
   become of him, or, if down deep in his conscience there is an idea of
   what it will be--it is, "a certain fearful looking for of judgment and
   fiery indignation!" How can you go home happy? How many die in the
   streets! How many die in their sleep! I pray you, be not so unconcerned
   as to be upon the brink of eternal ruin and yet never to think of it!
   God give you to look beyond the grave and make sure work for eternity!

   We are told, here, that Abraham expected a city. That is an Inspired
   description of Heaven. On earth Abraham had no city. Lot went away to
   Sodom to seek a city and that city was burned with fire and brimstone,
   and Lot barely escaped with his life. Abraham kept to his tents--he
   knew nothing about city life, but, "he looked for a city."

   Why is Heaven called a city? Because it is a place of fellowship where
   men meet one another! You know, away in the country, there is sometimes
   a lonely cottage where they only see a man pass once in six weeks. They
   never even see the postman--they must go to get their letters. Heaven
   is not like such lonely places. We look upon Heaven, not as a spot
   where there will be half-a-dozen people of our own views and
   sentiments, but as a great city where there will be a wide fellowship
   among a multitude that no man can number!

   It will be a city for security, within walls that never can be
   attacked, and with streets where there shall never be known an
   adversary. Heaven is a city because it is a place of splendor!
   Countries glorify themselves by the greatness of their cities. There is
   no city like the New Jerusalem!

   It is a place of store. Cities have great wealth and great
   accumulations of useful things which are not found in villages and
   hamlets. In Heaven there is everything that a heart can desire--fruits
   new and old laid up by the great Lord for His well-beloved. Heaven is a
   place of freedom and, therefore, it is called a city. Men get "the
   freedom of the city," here, and they are as proud of it as they well
   can be. But, oh, to be liverymen of Glory, freemen of the company of
   the perfect, citizens of the New Jerusalem! This is what we look for.
   We are looking for a city. We think all this so-called city of London
   to be but a dissolving view. We count this great country of England to
   be but like a pack of cards which will soon be knocked over. We reckon
   the whole world to be but a dream! There is a city, and we are looking
   for it!

   The text said that Abraham "looked for a city which has foundations."
   Saints look for something abiding. Abraham used to pull up the tent
   pins and his men would take down the big tent pole and roll up the
   canvas, and they were soon away, always moving about that country with
   their flocks and herds. The tents had no foundations, but Abraham was
   looking for a city that had foundations. There is nothing on earth that
   really has a foundation. Even those buildings that seem most firm will
   be dissolved and burned up in the last general fire. They are all "such
   stuff as dreams are made of," and will be gone before long. But we look
   for a city that has foundations. Eternal love, eternal faithfulness,
   infinite power, endless bliss, immortal glory make the foundations of
   the city to which we are now wending our way, where all is peace and
   joy and nothing can ever disturb it! When I think of some of our dear
   friends who are already there, who have gone from this city to the city
   that has foundations, could I wish them back again? Could you wish them
   back to all the sorrow and grief of this poor trying life, back to the
   tent which has been dissolved, now that they have gained "the building
   of God, the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens"? No,
   Beloved, stay where you are! We are hoping soon to join you. We can
   hear the sound of the coming chariot and we shall soon be with you
   where Jesus is!

   This was Abraham's way of living, counting everything around him to be
   no more fixed and settled than an Arab's tent, and looking for a city
   which has foundations.

   That city was to have a Builder and a Maker, as all cities have.
   Hundreds and thousands of names would have to be mentioned to describe
   this city of London and to say who the builders and makers of it were.
   You need not be anxious to know them, for they are not good for much,
   most of them. The builders and makers of the streets that we go through
   had better be forgotten and, I think, their houses, too. But there is a
   city that is all built by one Builder, it is the City of God. There
   will be nothing there that is trumpery or temporary--everything there
   is the best of the best, most suitable for the inhabitants and most
   glorious to behold! The very streets are paved with gold, exceedingly
   rich and rare. The best builders of earth cannot be compared to the
   great Builder above, the eternal Architect, the everlasting Chief Mason
   who has built those many mansions where His saints shall dwell forever!

   I cannot tell you anything about Heaven. If I could come back for a
   while after going there, I would like to come and tell you, but that
   must not be. You must read this Book and study it. Above all, you must
   get Heaven into your own heart, for you will never have your heart in
   Heaven till you have Heaven in your heart. You must have Heaven in you
   before you will be in Heaven--and you can learn about Heaven by the
   experimental knowledge of the Word of God, by living near to the Lord,
   and by an experience of His deep love and His eternal faithfulness.
   Thus, there is a city which has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is
   God.

   Are you going there? Why, there are some of you who have everything
   that you own here. You are like the man, when the ship was sinking, who
   had all his property round his waist in pieces of gold--which sank him
   to the bottom of the sea! Everything that you have is here and it is
   sinking you down to Hell! As for us who have believed in Christ, we
   have only a trifle of spending money just to pay the toll-gates on the
   road--our treasury is up there, on the other side of the river, in the
   land of the hereafter, on the hilltops of Glory with the
   Ever-Blessed--where we hope to soon be!

   Saints look for their Home at the end of their pilgrimage. When a man
   goes on a long journey, he likes to have thoughts of his home. How
   often have I told you how quickly my horses go home! They seem to know
   when their heads are turned homewards--and away they go. They pull up
   even the highest of Norwood's hills with all their might because they
   are going home! They do not go so fast when they are coming here and I
   do not blame them. They know where there is a good feed for them and a
   place to lie down--and even a horse goes best with his head towards
   home. Come, Beloved, our heads are towards Home, as many of us as
   believe in Jesus! We do not need to be lashed as we go up the
   everlasting hills! We will pull against the collar with all our might
   to get Home as soon as we can!

   Oh, but I wish you were all going with us! I wish you were all going
   the way that leads to the city that has foundations. Trust Christ!
   Trust Christ! He is the Way! Come out from the world. Lead the
   separated life. Live upon an unseen God and as surely as there is a God
   in Heaven, you shall be in Heaven in His good time, for He will never
   leave one Believer outside in the cold! God bless you, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. HEBREWS 11:1-21.

   This is the triumphal arch of faith. Here we find the names of many of
   the heroes of faith and a brief record of some of the battles in which
   they fought and conquered. May you and I possess "like precious faith"
   as that of which we have here the story! We cannot enter Heaven without
   it! We cannot fight our way through the world without it.

   Verse 1. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for. It gets a grip
   of what it hopes for and holds it in its hand.

   1. The evidence of things not seen. We see by faith. We see by faith
   what cannot be seen by our eyes. We grasp by faith what cannot be
   grasped with our hands. A strange mystery is the simple act of faith.

   2. For by it the elders obtained a good report. All the godly of the
   olden time had a good report of God and of holy men as the result of
   their faith.

   3. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word
   of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
   appear. They were not evolved out of something else that existed
   before--evolution is a rank lie against Revelation! The worlds were not
   made, not one of them was made, out of something pre-existent, but they
   were framed by the Word of God, and the things which are seen were not
   made of things which are seen.

   4. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.
   He was a better man than Cain and his offering was a better offering
   than Cain's was. But at bottom here was the difference between the two
   brothers--Abel had faith and Cain had none. It was "by faith" that Abel
   offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain presented.

   4. By which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying
   of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks. What wondrous faith
   this is! Here is a dead man speaking! Here is a man who is slain by his
   brother, yet the one who is killed receives the approbation of God!

   5. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death. Faith
   has conquered death, itself, or else avoided it. There is scarcely
   anything which faith cannot do, for faith ranks itself on the side of
   the Omnipotent God, and becomes all but Omnipotent. "By faith Enoch was
   translated that he should not see death."

   5. 6. And was not found, because God had translated him: for before his
   translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. But without
   faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that comes to God must
   believe that He is. He cannot come to a God who, to his own mind, is
   non-existent! He must believe that He is.

   6. And that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. You must
   believe that God hears prayer. You must believe that He will punish the
   guilty and that He will reward the righteous. Without this sure faith
   you cannot come to

   Him.

   7. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
   with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house. You see, faith
   and fear can live in the same heart--and they can work together to
   build the same ark. Faith and fear are very sweet companions when the
   fear is filial fear, a holy dread of disobeying God. When we are moved
   with that fear, our faith becomes practical.

   7,8. By the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
   righteousness which is by faith. By faith Abraham, when he was called
   to go out into a place which he should after receive for an
   inheritance, obeyed. He did not hesitate to leave his family, to leave
   his property, to leave his country--he obeyed--"when he was called to
   go out into a place which be should after receive for an inheritance."

   8. And he went out, not knowing where he went. Faith puts her hand into
   God's hand and follows where He leads, with sweet contentment, knowing
   that if she cannot see, God can, and He will not lead us wrong. Do you
   not remember that hymn that our Brother Chamberlain sings so sweetly?--

   "So on I go--not knowing, I would not if I might.

   I'd rather walk in the dark with God, than go alone in the light.

   I'd rather walk by faith with Him, than go alone by sight.

   Where He may lead, I'll follow, My trust in Him repose.

   And every hour in perfect peace I'll sing, 'He knows! He knows!'" 9,10.
   By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country,
   dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the
   same promise: for he looked for a city which has foundations, whose
   Builder and Maker is God. There have been many here in this House of
   Prayer who have looked for this city and they have gone to it. Others
   of us sit waiting here till our Lord's dear hand shall beckon us and
   His voice shall say, "Come up higher." We are looking for the city!
   Keep looking, Beloved, there is nothing here worth looking for, but
   look for "a city which has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is
   God."

   11. Through faith, also, Sara herself received strength to conceive
   seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she
   judged Him faithful who had promised. And this holy woman is enrolled
   among these saintly ones. Her faith was not all it ought to have been,
   but God saw that it was true faith, and He loved it, and He wrote the
   record of it.

   12. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so
   many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by
   the sea shore innumerable. This is true, literally, of Abraham's seed
   according to the flesh. It is also true in a spiritual sense, for he is
   "the father of all them that believe," and they are a multitude whom no
   man can number.

   13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
   having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
   them. What long arms faith has! The promises are afar off and yet faith
   embraces them tonight! Embrace the promises, dear Friends, and stretch
   out your hands by faith to hands that have gone before--

   "Even now by faith we join our hands With those that went before! And
   greet the blood-sprinkled bands

   On the eternal shore."

   13. And confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
   They not only were strangers and pilgrims, but they confessed it!
   Confessed faith is requisite. Oh, you who, like Nicodemus, come to
   Christ by night, be ashamed that you are ashamed--and come out and
   boldly confess what you are!

   14. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
   country. They were strangers and pilgrims here, and they sought a
   country elsewhere. Every man needs a country and if we have not one
   beneath the stars, we seek it somewhere else.

   15. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence
   they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. Ah,
   but God's people are not mindful of that country from whence they came
   out! They have opportunity to return, but they have no wish to return.
   May God's Grace always keep any of you from turning back, for it is to
   turn back unto Hell! Your faces are heavenward today--keep them so.
   Remember the doom of any that apostatize. It is impossible, "if they
   shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance." "If the salt has
   lost its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good
   for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."
   Lord, keep Your servants! Hold us up and we shall be safe!

   16. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
   therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He has
   prepared for them a city. They are not ashamed to be called God's
   people, and He is not ashamed to be called their God. They are looking
   for a city and He has prepared a city for them. Evidently He and they
   are well agreed. They need a Heaven and He is preparing Heaven for
   them, and preparing them for Heaven!

   17-19. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
   that had received the promises offered up his only-begotten son, of
   whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed be called: accounting
   that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also
   he received him in a figure. This was one of the grandest achievements
   of faith! It was also a figure or type of God's offering up His
   well-beloved Son almost on the same spot!

   20, 21. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
   come. By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
   Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. The staff
   which had helped him so often in his early pilgrimage, the staff on
   which be leaned when he came back from the place of his wrestling,
   halting on his thigh. He leaned on it as he sat upright on his death
   couch and pronounced the parting blessing. So, you see, Abraham, Isaac,
   Jacob, all lived by faith and did their works by faith, and distributed
   blessings to their children by faith. Friend, have you this faith, or
   have you not? If you have it, you are blessed among men, blessed among
   women! If you have it not, what hope is there for you either in this
   life or in eternity?

Simeon's Swan Song

   (No. 2293)

   INTENDED FOR READING, ON LORD'S-DAY, JANUARY 29, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Lord, now Jet You Your servant depart in peace, according to Your
   word: for my eyes have seen Your salvation." Luke 2:29,30.

   IF we are believers in Christ, we shall one day use words like these.
   Perhaps not just at present and yet, possibly, sooner than some of us
   think, we shall gather up our feet in our bed and we shall say with all
   composure, "Lord, now let You Your servant depart in peace, according
   to Your word."

   See what death is to the Believer. It is only a departure! It is a
   departure after a day of service. "Lord, now let You Your servant
   depart. My day's work is done. Let me now go Home." With us who believe
   it will be a departure to a higher service, for we shall still be the
   Lord's servants even when we depart from this present sphere of labor.
   We shall go to do yet higher and more perfect work in the nearer
   Presence of our Master. "His servants shall serve Him; and they shall
   see His face." Death to the Believer is only a departure from one form
   of service to another. And, note, that it is a departing "in peace." We
   are at peace with God. We have--

   "Peace! Perfect peace! In this dark world of sin,

   The blood of Jesus whispers peace within!" As many as have believed in
   Jesus, have entered into rest. "Being justified by faith, we have peace
   with God." We have joy and peace in believing and, as we live in peace,
   we shall also die in peace. We shall remain in peace and we shall
   depart in peace. A deep and holy calm will fill up our dying moments--

   "It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,

   And Jesus call to Heaven's perfect peace!" We shall be able to say,
   perhaps, when we come to die, what a dear friend of mine once said to
   me, when I went in to see him on his dying bed. A part of his
   affliction consisted in total blindness from what they call the
   breaking of the eye-strings. Sitting up, although he could not see me,
   he moved his hand and said--

   "And when you see my eye-strings break,

   How sweet my minutes roll!

   A mortal paleness on my cheek,

   But glory in my soul!"

   So will it be with us--we shall depart in peace. To the Believer, death
   is not a thing to be dreaded--he even asks for it, "Lord, now let You,
   permit You, Your servant to depart in peace. Grant it as a gift,
   vouchsafe it as a favor." Death to the sinner is a curse, but to the
   Believer it is a form of benediction, it is the gate of life. To the
   sinner, it is a chain dragging him down to the unutterable darkness of
   Hell, but to the saint, it is a chariot of fire bearing him aloft to
   the Heaven of light and love!

   Note, also, that Simeon said, "Lord, now let You Your servant depart in
   peace, according to Your word." Did you not notice, in our reading,
   what Luke says about Simeon in the 26th verse? "It was revealed unto
   him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen
   the Lord's Christ." The prophecy had been fulfilled! He had seen the
   Lord's Anointed. There was nothing more for him to desire upon earth,
   so he said, "Lord, now let You Your servant depart in peace, according
   to Your word: for my eyes have seen Your salvation." The reason for
   Simeon's holy calm, the cause of his finding death to be nothing but a
   departure out of this world, lies in this fact, that he could say, "My
   eyes have seen Your salvation." It is of that blessed fact that I am
   going to talk tonight as the Spirit shall help me.

   I do not suppose that everybody here can say, "Lord, now let You Your
   servant depart in peace." Some of you would not depart in peace if
   death came to you as you now are. Dear Friend, if you are not prepared
   for death and judgment, you had better pray, "Lord, let me stay here
   till I have found peace with You; and then let me depart in peace
   whenever

   You will."

   I shall at this time take the innermost sense of the text, dwelling
   upon these words of Simeon, "My eyes have seen Your salvation." There
   were others who had seen the Baby Christ with their natural eyes, but
   Simeon had seen, in the Babe, Christ, the salvation of God, not with
   his outward eyes, but with the inward perceptions of his spirit! I hope
   that many here present can say that they have seen, and do see, in
   Christ, God's salvation, and their salvation given to them of God. If
   so, I am sure that they feel ready to live, or ready to die. But if it
   is not so with any of you--if you cannot say, "My eyes have seen Your
   salvation," you cannot pray, "Lord, let Your servant depart in peace."

   What, then, do these words mean, "My eyes have seen Your salvation"? I
   will try to explain their meaning in my discourse tonight and, when I
   have finished, I think you will see that there are these five things
   included in this utterance of old Simeon. First, here is clear
   perception. Next, perfect satisfaction. Then, happy unbinding. Then,
   dauntless courage. And finally, joyful appropriation.

   I. The first thing for us to notice in Simeon's swan song is CLEAR
   PERCEPTION--"My eyes have seen Your salvation."

   Some people are very hazy in their religion--they "see men as trees
   walking." They see things as we see them in London in a fog. That is to
   say, we do not see them clearly; we cannot see them distinctly; and yet
   we do see them after a fashion. The fault with a great many Christians,
   nowadays, is that they have only just light enough to see things as in
   a mist--they have not discerned clearly the sharply-cut image of the
   Truth of God. But Simeon could say, not, "I think I see the salvation
   of God in Christ. I hope I do. Perhaps I do--he could say, "My eyes
   have seen Your salvation." Oh, happy are you, my dear Friends, tonight,
   if you can distinctly and clearly see in Christ Jesus, the salvation of
   God!

   True, Christ was but a Baby then. And Simeon could easily hold Him in
   his arms, yet his faith could see everlasting salvation, infinite
   salvation within God Incarnate! God has come into our world and has
   taken upon Himself our nature. He that was born at Bethlehem was "very
   God of very God." He that trod the acres of Palestine, as He went about
   doing good, was the same who "was in the beginning with God," without
   whom was not anything made that was made. Christ is God. "The Word was
   with God, and the Word was God," but it is equally true that "The Word
   was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory
   as of the Only-Begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth."--

   "Itis my sweetest comfort, Lord,

   And will forever be,

   To muse upon the gracious truth

   Of Your Humanity.

   Forever God, forever Man,

   My Jesus shall endure.

   And fixed on Him, my hope remains

   Eternally secure."

   Now, this Christ took upon Himself the sins of all His people. "Who His
   own Self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." "The Lord has laid
   on Him the iniquity of us all." And sin, being laid on Christ, it
   remained no more on those from whom He took it! He bore it that they
   might not bear it! He suffered the consequences of their sin that they
   might never suffer those consequences! Jesus made an Atonement to the
   Justice of God--He vindicated and honored the perfect Law of the Most
   High. When I see Christ on the Cross, Christ in the tomb, Christ risen
   from the dead, Christ at the right hand of God, I understand that He
   took away my sin. He died. He was buried. He came forth from the grave,
   having destroyed my sin and put it away--and He has gone into the
   heavens as my Representative, to take possession of the right hand of
   God for me, that I in Him and with Him may sit there forever and ever!

   To me, Christ's Sacrifice is a business transaction as clear and
   straight as mathematics could make it. I care not that men decry what
   they call "the mercantile theory of the Atonement." I hold no "theory"
   of the Atonement! I believe that the Substitution of Christ for His
   people is the Atonement for their sins. And that there is no other
   Atonement--but that all else is theory! This is to me so clear, so
   true, so definite, that I can venture to say with Simeon, when I have
   seen

   Christ, especially Christ crucified, Christ glorified, "My eyes have
   seen Your salvation." Clear perception, then, is the first meaning of
   Simeon's words.

   You young people who have come to believe in Christ, get clear
   perceptions as to how Christ is God's salvation. Do not mix and muddle
   things up, as so many do, but accept Christ as your Substitute, as "the
   Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world." Believe that on
   the Cross He paid your debt, discharged your liability--and bought you
   with a price--so that you are His, and His forever and ever. You will
   never have peace in death--I do not see how you are to have solid rest
   in life--without a sharp, crisp, clearly-cut idea of how Christ is the
   salvation of God! The bulk of people do not see it and they, therefore,
   miss the comfort of it. The comfort of a man, immersed in debt, is
   assured if he has a friend who bears his burden and pays his debt for
   him--then he feels that he is clear of all his former liabilities. I
   declare, before the living God, that I know of no solid comfort for my
   heart, tonight, but this--the chastisement of my peace was upon Him,
   and with His stripes I am healed! May you get a clear perception of
   this great Truth of God, now!

   II. But, next, when Simeon could say, "My eyes have seen Your
   salvation," he had PERFECT SATISFACTION in Christ.

   You observe, he takes Christ up in his arms, and says, "My eyes have
   seen," not, "a part of Your salvation," but "Your salvation." He is not
   looking to anything else for salvation, but only to that Man-Child,
   seeing all that that Man-Child will do, and bear, and
   suffer--recognizing in Him the two Natures, the Divine and the
   Human--and as he clasps Him to his breast, he says, "My eyes have seen
   Your salvation. It is enough, I have here all that I need. Lord, now
   let You Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word: for my
   eyes have seen Your salvation."

   Beloved Friends, have you ever done with Christ what old Simeon did?
   "He took Him up in his arms, and blessed God." All that you need to
   save you, lies in Him! I have known the Lord, now, for some 40 years,
   or thereabouts. When I first came to Him, I came as a sinner, without
   any works of my own which I could trust, or any experience upon which I
   could rely. And I just rested my whole weight upon the finished work of
   Christ. Now, after 40 years of service, and nearly 40 years of
   preaching the Gospel, have I any works of my own to add to what Christ
   has done? I abhor the thought of such a thing! Have I even the weight
   of a pin's head that I dare put into the scale with my Lord's merits?
   Accursed be the idea! More than ever do I sing--

   "Nothing save Jesus would I know,"

   and nowhere would I rest but in Him alone!

   Now, dear Christian Friends, I know you understand this, that Christ is
   an all-sufficient Savior, that He is all your salvation and all your
   desire. And yet, perhaps, you are tempted at times to think that you
   must be this, or you must do that, or you must feel the other, or else
   Christ is of no effect to you. Think not so, but rest wholly and alone
   on Christ! Say, "I rest in Him, whether I am a saint or a sinner;
   whether I have bright frames or dark frames; whether I am useful, or
   whether I am defeated in my service, I have no more to trust in when I
   rejoice in the Light of God's Countenance than I have when I walk in
   darkness, and see no light. Christ is everything to me at all times--a
   winter Christ and a summer Christ--all my Light when I have no other,
   and all my Light when I have every other light."--

   "My hope is built on nothing less

   Than Jesus' blood and righteousness!

   I dare not trust the sweetest frame,

   But wholly lean on Jesus' name!

   On Christ the solid Rock I stand,

   All other ground is sinking sand!" God bring you to this, that you may
   say, "I have seen Christ, my eyes have seen God's salvation. I am
   perfectly satisfied. I need nothing else." Does a man pluck me by the
   sleeve, and say, "I will tell you something worth hearing"? My good
   Fellow, go and tell it to somebody who wants to hear it, for I do not!
   I have heard all the news I need when I have heard of eternal salvation
   by Jesus Christ!

   III. Now, thirdly, notice that there is in Simeon's words, "My eyes
   have seen Your salvation," a kind of HAPPY UNBINDING. The man has been,
   as it were, bound. But He says, "Lord, now let You Your servant depart
   in peace. Every fetter is now broken. I have seen Your salvation, Lord,
   I am not tied to life, nor tied to home, nor tied to comfort, nor tied
   even to Your Temple. Now, Lord, I can go anywhere, departing in peace,
   for my eyes have seen Your salvation."

   Is not that a grand utterance of old Simeon? The most of us are tied in
   one way or another and we find it hard to cut ourselves loose. With
   many of us, the first part of our life is often spent in tying
   ourselves down to this world and, by-and-by, we feel that we are too
   much tied, bound, hampered, hindered--and we cry out, "How shall we get
   free?" The only way to get free is to get Christ! "If the Son shall
   make you free, you shall be free, indeed." If you take Christ in your
   arms and say, with Simeon, "My eyes have seen Your salvation," you can
   then say, "Everyone else and everything else may now go."--

   "Yes, should You take them all away, Yet will I not repine; Before they
   were possessed by me, They were entirely Thine"

   And, as You have given me Christ, You may do what You will with me as
   to other things! Where Christ is not valued, gold becomes an idol.
   Where Christ is not prized, health becomes an idol. Where Christ is not
   loved, learning and fame become idols. Where Christ is not first and
   foremost, even personal beauty may become an idol. But when Christ
   becomes our All in All, because our eyes have seen His salvation, then
   the idols fall! Dagon is broken! We are emancipated and we can say
   concerning all these things, "Yes, whether you come or whether you go,
   you are not lords of the house--you are but comers and goers unto me
   henceforth and forever, for a clear conception that Christ is God's
   salvation and a full grasp of Him as mine, have set my Spirit free from
   every fetter that before held me in captivity."

   IV. I must not pause here, because I want you to notice how being able
   to say, "My eyes have seen Your salvation," gives to a man DAUNTLESS
   COURAGE.

   He who has once seen Christ as God's salvation is not afraid to see
   death. "Now," he says, "I can look death in the face without dread, for
   I have seen God's salvation." He is not afraid of that tremendous
   Judgment Seat which will be set in the clouds of Heaven, for He who
   will sit upon that Judgment Seat is God's salvation to us who believe!
   The man who is "looking unto Jesus" is not afraid of the day when the
   earth will rock and reel, and everything based upon it will shake to
   its destruction. He is not afraid of the star called Wormwood, nor of
   seeing Heaven and earth on a blaze. "My eyes have seen Your salvation,"
   he says, and he bears this glorious vision about with him wherever he
   goes. It is more to him than any earthly charm could be! It is more
   powerful than the most potent charm of the mystic or the magician. Such
   a man is safe! He must be safe--his eyes have seen God's salvation!

   If you would have a courage of the truest kind that needs no stimulus
   of drink, and no excitement of the noise of trumpet and of drum--the
   calm courage that can suffer pain, that can bear rebuke, that can
   endure slander, that can stand alone, that could stand foot to foot
   with the infernal fiend, himself, and yet not be afraid. If you would
   have such courage as that, I say, you must got Christ in your arms, for
   then shall you say with Simeon, "Lord, come what may, I have nothing to
   fear, for my eyes have seen Your salvation."--

   "Fearless of Hell and ghastly death,

   I'd break through every foe!

   The wings of love, and arms of faith,

   Should bear me conqueror through."

   V. I will not detain you much longer, for the time is well near spent,
   but I would say this one more thing, He who lays hold on Christ, makes
   a JOYFUL APPROPRIATION of Him. His sight of Christ, his clear
   apprehension of what Christ is, is accompanied by a personal
   appropriation of Christ to himself.

   This is the matter that puzzles many. I have, during the past week,
   talked with several people who have heard from me concerning the way of
   salvation and the preciousness of Christ. And the question of many of
   these enquirers has been this, "How can we get hold of Christ? We
   believe that all you say about Him is true. Christ is God's salvation,
   but how can we take Him to be ours? You seem to treat Christ as if He
   were yours beyond all question. How can we learn to do the

   same?"

   My answer is, when you once know how the Savior saves, and how He is
   God's salvation, trust Him to save you! That trust grips Him, holds
   Him--and if you can hold Him--He is yours. We have certain rights of
   property extant among us and a man may have to bring his title deeds to
   prove that a house is really his own. But in the Kingdom of Grace, the
   only title deed you need is that you have hold of Christ. May I take
   Him, then, without any right? Yes, taking Christ gives you the right to
   take Him! "To as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become
   the sons of God." There

   is a piece of bread on yonder table. I mean to have it for my own. It
   will be of no use for you to dispute with me about the matter, for I
   shall put it beyond all dispute. How? I shall take that bread in my
   hand. Well, you can wrench it from me. I shall do more than that--I
   shall eat it! I shall digest it--it will become a part of my own being!
   You will not get it away from me, then--and I do not care if you go to
   the law with me to try to get it! Possession is more than nine points
   of the law in such a case as that. Digestion and assimilation will be
   ten points of the law, certainly! Now, it is just so with Christ. Poor
   Soul, take Him; believe Him; trust Him; appropriate Him! Trust Him
   more, and more, and more! The more the devil tries to take Him from
   you, trust Him the more. Plunge yourself deeper and deeper, still, into
   this sea of salvation, and trust Christ still more.

   Perhaps someone says, "But how may I know at first that I have a right
   to trust Christ?" You have a right to trust Christ because you are
   commanded to do it. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved." "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." Make a dash
   for this great blessing! Take Christ, tonight, regardless, for, though
   it should seem like robbery to you to take Him, yet if you once have
   Him, He will never be taken away from you! Make a dash for Christ, I
   say, tonight, and take Him, saying, "I believe Him. I trust Him. I rest
   myself on Him." Heaven and earth shall pass away, but if you trust
   Christ, you shall never be ashamed! There was never a man yet who dared
   trust Christ and yet found that Christ was not equal to his need, or
   that He did not fully supply all his needs.

   Simeon took Christ up in his arms. Somebody might have said, "Old man,
   what have you to do with the new-born King? Old man, you may be just
   and devout, but dare you handle the Incarnate God? Dare you fondle Him
   upon whose shoulders God has laid the key of His Kingdom, whose name is
   called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father,
   The Prince of Peace? Dare you touch Him?" Yes, He dares do it! He takes
   Him up in his arms. He clasps Him to his heart. He rejoices over Him.
   He is ready to die with delight, now that he has found Christ! Come,
   poor troubled ones, come tonight and take Christ into your arms! And
   you, dear saints of God, who have done this long ago, do it again! Take
   Him right up into your arms, as though He were still a Babe. Take Him
   to your heart and say, "He is everything to me--my Love, my Hope, my
   brother--this blessed Incarnate God who loved me and gave Himself for
   me." If you can do this, it shall be well with you now, it shall be
   well with you in death, it shall be well with you throughout eternity!

   Have I among my hearers any who are postponing this all-important
   business, putting it off till a more convenient season? Let me tell
   them something that ought to warn them of the risk they are running.
   Once upon a time the Prince of Darkness said to the evil spirits under
   his command, "I want to see which of you can be my best servant. The
   Gospel is being preached in various places and many persons are hearing
   it. And I am afraid that my kingdom will suffer loss. Unless something
   can be done, I fear that many will desert from under the black flag and
   enlist under the standard of Jesus of Nazareth. I would gladly prevent
   this--which of you will help me? Then up rose one who said, "I will go
   forth and say that the Bible is not true, that Christ is not God, and
   that what is preached is not the Truth of God." But the great Prince of
   the Pit answered him, "You will not serve my turn just now. There are a
   few places where you will be very useful, but the most of those who are
   listening to this Word will laugh at you and drive you back. You smell
   too much of the place where you go on my errands. You cannot do what I
   need now."

   Up stood another of the evil throng and said, "Let me go and I will
   bring forth certain new views of truth and various fresh doctrines, and
   with these I will turn aside the thoughts of men from the old faith."
   But the Prince of the power of the air replied, "You, too, are a good
   servant of mine, and you stand me in good stead at other times, but
   just now you are not the one for the task I propose." Then out spoke
   one who said, "O Prince of Darkness, I think I am your good soldier on
   this occasion. Here am I, send me." "And what will you do?" said
   Beelzebub, "What will you do?" "I will go forth and tell the people
   that the warnings of the preacher are true and the voice of the Gospel
   is the voice of God! I will not awaken and arouse them by any sort of
   opposition, but I will tell them that there is time enough, by-and-by,
   to attend to these things. I will bid them wait a little longer and
   bide their time. I will put this word into the mouth of each one, that
   he may say to the preacher, 'Go your way, for this time. When I have a
   convenient season, I will call for you.'"

   Then the grim master of the Pit smiled and said, "Go your way, my
   faithful servant, you are he that shall carry out my purpose right
   thoroughly, and so shall you foil the preacher--and the Word of God
   that he utters shall fall to the ground." Is there not a message here
   for someone who is listening to my words?

   "My eyes have seen Your salvation." How I wish that I could make some
   here who do not know it, understand how simple is the way of salvation!
   You are a sinner, guilty and condemned! Christ becomes a Man, takes
   your sins, suffers in your place. You accept Him to stand for you. You
   permit Him, by your faith, to be accepted as your Substitute, and His
   pains are put down instead of yours, and you are "accepted in the
   Beloved," and saved in Him. Oh, if you could but do this--and you may
   do it tonight before you leave this place, and I hope you will--if you
   do this, whether you are old or young, there will come to you a heart
   full of benediction for life, and the best of all preparations for
   death! Truly happy shall you be if you can say, "My eyes have seen Your
   salvation."

   I seem as if I did not need to see anything else, after having seen
   Christ as God's salvation! There is a story told of Muslims, who often
   are very fanatical, and do very strange and horrible things in their
   fanaticism. But they have been known to go to Mecca, to see the tomb of
   their prophet, and when they have seen his tomb, they have taken a hot
   steel and have drawn it across their eyes, that they might never see
   anything else--that indeed they might die with the view of the false
   prophet's tomb as their last sight!

   Now, that is not what we do, but still, we would act in the spirit of
   it. "My eyes have seen Your salvation." People say, "See Naples and
   die." They mean that it is so lovely that when you have seen it, there
   is nothing more to see. See Christ, and what else is there to see? Now,
   whether you sail over the blue sea beneath a bluer sky, or dive into
   the deeps of this murky atmosphere--whether you are in a palace or in a
   dungeon, sick or full of bounding health--all these are items of small
   consequence, if your eyes have seen God's salvation, for God has
   blessed you as only God can bless you! Go and live in peace and go and
   die in peace--and praise the name of Him who gave you such a Savior to
   see, and the power to see Him! The Lord bless you, Beloved! Amen and
   amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. LUKE2:21-38.

   Verse 21. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of
   the Child, His name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel
   before He was conceived in the womb. Although the old Law ends with
   Christ, it is very instructive to notice that He came under the Law and
   conformed to all its appointments. Jesus, therefore, had to be
   circumcised. In Him the Law was fulfilled in every point, even to the
   jots and tittles--nothing was omitted. Behold how perfect is the
   righteousness which He worked out for His people!

   22. And when the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses
   were accomplished, they brought Him to Jerusalem, to present Him to the
   Lord. Everything was done that was required by the Jewish Law, you see.
   "When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made
   of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,
   that we might receive the adoption of sons." "Being found in fashion as
   a Man," and a Man under the Jewish Law--Jesus and His parents were
   obedient to all its requirements.

   23, 24. (As it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that
   opened the womb shall be called holy to the Lord); and to offer a
   sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, A
   pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. This proves the poverty of
   our Lord's parents. If they had been able to bring a costlier
   sacrifice, they would have done so. The Law required the offering of a
   lamb for a burnt offering, but there was a gracious provision in the
   case of the poor mother--"If she is not able to bring a lamb, then she
   shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
   offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make
   an atonement for her, and she shall be clean." Even in the case of a
   working woman, the birth of her first-born son required from her a
   sacrifice; but it might be of the smallest kind--"A pair of
   turtledoves, or two young pigeons." Think of your Lord, Himself,
   redeemed by a sacrifice, a pair of doves offered in His place! What a
   wonderful coming down to our condition and position was this!

   25. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;
   and the same man was just and devout. He blended in his character his
   duty to man and his duty to God--"he was just and devout."

   25. Waiting for the consolation of Israel. His devotion was not that of
   a blind devotee. He had eyes of expectation! He was expecting the
   Messiah to come, who is, "the consolation of Israel."

   25, 26. And the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it was revealed unto him
   by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the
   Lord's Christ. That which the Holy Spirit reveals will assuredly come
   to pass, as it did in the experience of old Simeon.

   27. And He came by the Spirit into the Temple. Men who have the Spirit
   will be led by the Spirit. Simeon came into the Temple at the right
   moment. Just when a young man was entering, with his wife and new-born
   Child, "He came by the Spirit into the Temple."

   27, 28. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him
   after the custom of the Law, then took he Him up in his arms. He came
   in, I say, at the right time! Did ever anybody who was not led by the
   Spirit, find Christ? Somebody has come in here tonight and he does not
   know why he has come--he has been led here by the Spirit that he may
   see Jesus, and may have such a sight of Him as shall be his salvation!
   God grant that it may be proved that many an aged Simeon has traveled
   here this Sabbath night, led by the Spirit for this purpose, to find
   the Savior in His own house!

   28, 32. And blessed God, and said, Lord, now let You Your servant
   depart in peace, according to Your word: for my eyes have seen Your
   salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all people; a
   Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of Your people Israel.
   Simeon had studied the ancient prophecies to good purpose and he
   perceived from them that "the Lord's Christ" would be "a Light to
   lighten the Gentiles" as well as "the Glory of" God's ancient people,
   "Israel."

   33. And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were
   spoken of Him. We may be very near to Christ and yet know very little
   about Him. Joseph and the virgin mother did not understand "those
   things which were spoken of Him." One wonders it was so after all that
   had been revealed to them--we marvel that they marveled!

   34. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary, His mother, Behold,
   this Child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel. Do
   you understand that? Whenever Christ comes to a man, there is first a
   fall--and a rising again afterwards. You never knew the Lord aright if
   He did not first give you a fall! He pulls us down from our pride and
   self-sufficiency and then He lifts us up to a position of eternal
   safety! He is "set" for this purpose! This is the great design of
   Christ's coming--"This child is set for the fall and rising again of
   many in Israel."

   34. And for a sign which shall be spoken against. Christ and His Gospel
   will always be spoken against. If you know a gospel which is approved
   by the age and patronized by the learned, that gospel is a lie! You may
   be sure of that. But if it is spoken against, if it is slandered, if it
   is called absurd, unscientific, and I know not what, all that is in its
   favor!

   35. (Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also). This
   favored woman had the greatest smart to go with her great honor. She
   saw the suffering and anguish of her Son and, the nearer you are to
   Christ, the more of sorrow it will cost you, sorrow which you may be
   well content to bear. You know how it is put in that hymn of which many
   of us are very fond--

   "IfI find Him, if I follow,

   What His recompense here? Many a labor, many a sorrow, Many a tear."

   Yet, I say again, you may be well content to bear it all for His sake,
   for you remember what the next verse of the hymn is--

   "If I still hold closely to Him, Whathas He atlast? Sorrow vanquished,
   labor ended, Jordan past."

   35. That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. Christ and His
   Cross are the revealers of the thoughts of men's hearts. Men's hearts
   can conceal their thoughts until Christ's Cross comes near--then the
   old enmity rises up, the heart rebels--and we see what is really in
   men's hearts.

   36, 37. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
   of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an
   husband seven years from her virginity; and she was a widow of about
   fourscore and four years, which departed not from the Temple, but
   served God with fasts and prayers night and day. It would have been a
   pity for Christ to have been received in the Temple only by a man.
   There must be a woman there, too, to join in Simeon's swan song, and to
   unite her testimony with his.

   38. And she coming in that instant.--God knows how to time what we call
   our accidental walks--"She coming in that instant."--

   38. Gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spoke of Him to all them
   that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. So that the song of Simeon was
   sweetened by the voice of Anna--and they both rejoiced in God their
   Savior! And their joy was shared by "all them that looked for
   redemption in Jerusalem." May many of us have a share in that same joy
   as, by faith, we lovingly gaze upon "the Lord's Christ."

The Memory Of Christ's Love

   (No. 2294)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   NOVEMBER 2, 1890.

   "We will remember Your love more than wine: the upright love You." Song
   of Solomon 1:4.

   I Do not think I can preach tonight. I feel so weary, and worn, and
   ill. Still, I can talk to you a little concerning the great love of
   Christ. If I were dying, I think I could speak upon that theme, and oh,
   when we rise again, how we shall talk forever and ever about Christ's
   love! This will be our endless theme throughout the eternal ages, "His
   great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins."

   I have taken for a text the last two sentences in the Song of Solomon,
   the first chapter, and the fourth verse--"We will remember Your love
   more than wine: the upright love You."

   This is a night for remembering Christ's love. The Communion Table is
   spread before us, the sacred feast to which we are about to come is
   meant to recall to our minds our Savior's words, "This do in
   remembrance of Me...This do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance
   of Me." But, while we remember Christ, the central thought in our minds
   shall be that of which Paul wrote, "who loved me, and gave Himself for
   me." We will, above all other things, tonight, remember His love. Have
   any of you been forgetting it? Is it long since you had an hour's real
   enjoyment in meditating upon the love of Christ? Then, Beloved, come
   tonight, and renew your vows! Begin, again, your fellowship, and make
   this firm resolve, "We will remember our Lord; we will remember His
   love tonight!" May the Holy Spirit, who brings everything to
   remembrance whatever Christ has said to us, help us now to remember
   Him! For Him to remember us when He comes to His Kingdom, will be our
   Heaven. For us to remember Him, though He has gone away to His Kingdom,
   shall be a little Heaven to us tonight.

   As I am able, I will talk with you briefly, first, upon the
   preparations for the holy memory mentioned in our text. We shall find
   them in the verse in which the text is embedded--"Draw me, we will run
   after You: the king has brought me into His chambers: we will be glad
   and rejoice in You." When we have considered the preparations for the
   holy memory here referred to, I will speak upon the Divine subject of
   this holy memory--"We will remember Your love more than wine." Then,
   thirdly, we will meditate upon the Divine product of this holy
   memory--"The upright love You, love You because they remember Your
   love."

   I. First, then, dear Friends, as I may be helped by the Holy Spirit, I
   would remind you of THE PREPARATIONS FOR THIS HOLY MEMORY. Here they
   are.

   The first word is, "Draw me." Lord, I would gladly come to You, but
   like Mephibosheth, I am lame in both my feet. I would gladly fly to
   You, but my wings are broken, if, indeed, I ever had any. I cannot come
   to You. I lie inert, and dead, and powerless. So the first preparation
   is, "Draw me." It is a sweet, gracious, efficacious exercise of Divine
   power that I need and entreat. I say not, "Drive me," but, "Lord, draw
   me." I say not, "Throw me there, or force me yonder, but, "Lord, draw
   me. While You draw, I shall have liberty left to run--draw me, we will
   run after You."

   We do not need to be born again--we who are believers in Christ have
   had that miracle worked upon us already. We are not now asking for
   pardon and justification--as believers in Christ, we have these
   priceless gifts already. What we need is the gentle influence of the
   Holy Spirit to attract us nearer to Christ--so each one cries to the
   Lord, "Draw me." We are not dead. We are quickened and made alive. Our
   very pain and anguish, because we are not able to come to Christ as we
   would, prove that we are alive. I commend this prayer to you, "Lord,
   draw me; draw me." It is the work of Christ to draw. "I, if I am lifted
   up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me." It is the work of the
   Father. "No man can come

   to Me," said Christ, "except the Father which has sent Me draw him." It
   is the work of the Spirit of God to draw a soul towards Christ. I pray
   this for myself and, I trust that you will pray with me, "Come, Sacred
   Spirit, and draw us nearer to Christ! Enliven our hopes; incline our
   hearts; awaken our desires and then help us to yield our whole being to
   Your gracious influences!"--

   "If You hare drawn a thousand times, Oh, draw me, Lord, again!"

   That, then, is the first preparation for the holy memory mentioned in
   our text, Divine drawing--"Draw me."

   Notice, next, that this verse says, "Draw me, we will run after You." I
   like the change in the pronouns, as though I should pray tonight,
   "Lord, draw me; I am the most weighted, the heaviest of all Your
   children in this congregation; but draw me, we will run after You. All
   my Brothers and Sisters will run at once if You do draw me. If You draw
   the most burdened one towards Yourself, all the rest will come to You
   at a rapid rate," Do you not feel, my dear Brother or Sister, as if you
   could use this expression? Lord, if You will draw me, all my fellow
   members will be running with me; yet they will not outstrip me in their
   eagerness to reach You, for we will together run after You. Do,
   therefore, draw me, my gracious Lord!

   If we would be fully prepared to remember Christ, we must get into this
   running pace--"Draw me: we will run after You." Be quick, my Soul, be
   quick, about heavenly things! Creep, if you will, about your worldly
   business, but run after your Lord. Oh, that we might everyone attain
   the running pace tonight! Oh, that we might speed along towards our
   Lord with that strong, impetuous desire which will not let us rest till
   we are close to Him! "Draw me, we will run after

   You."

   Divine drawing is the first preparation for the holy memory. And next
   comes speedy running.

   Now, in the further preparation, if you read the verse through, you
   will find that an answer comes to the prayer as soon as it is
   uttered--"The king has brought me into His chambers." "What I asked
   for, I have obtained at once! And I have received more than I asked
   for. I prayed, 'Draw me,' and He has carried me bodily. 'The king has
   brought me into His chambers.' I did but pray that I might come a
   little nearer to my Lord, but He has brought me into His secret places,
   into His withdrawing rooms! He has brought me where He brings His
   bride. He has brought me where He receives His courtiers. The King has
   brought me into His chambers and now I see how truly royal He is. The
   King has done it! The King, not a king, but that King who is King of
   all kings, the most royal of all monarchs--'the Prince of the kings of
   the earth,' even my Lord Jesus, has brought me into His chambers."

   How quickly this was done! I want you to believe, Beloved, that it
   could be done just as quickly in your case. Pray, "Lord, draw me. I
   feel as if I were coming to the Communion Table quite unfit to come."
   Is that what you say? Then pray, "Draw me," and in a moment, before the
   prayer is uttered, you shall find yourself not only drawn, but actually
   brought into the secret place of fellowship! "The king has brought me
   into His chambers." "Before I was aware, my soul made me like the
   chariots of Amminadib." I know, and some of you know, unhappily, what
   it is to feel very cold and lifeless. But I also know, and some of you
   know, what it is to become full of life, full of love, full of joy,
   full of heavenly rapture in a single moment! You who could only creep
   begin to run. You who could only sigh begin to sing! I want it to be so
   with every one of you, dearly Beloved, tonight! And you who think you
   are forgotten, shall be remembered tonight, at any rate. You who have
   almost forgotten what a real, hallowed time of communion means, may
   learn it over again, tonight, as you cry, "Draw me, we will run after
   You: the king has brought me into His chambers."

   Thus we have had three preparations for the holy memory mentioned in
   our text--drawing, running, and bringing.

   There is only one more preparation for remembering Christ and that is
   to feel gladness and joy in Him--"We will be glad and rejoice in You."
   Come, take those ashes from your head, you that are sighing by reason
   of affliction! Come, unbind that sackcloth, and throw it aside, you
   that have lost fellowship with God, and are, consequently, in the dark!
   Christ is yours if you believe in Him. He has given Himself to you and
   He loves you. Rejoice in that blessed fact! Remember who He is and what
   He is--very God of very God, yet perfect Man, God in Human Nature,
   Immanuel, God With Us, glorified now in the highest heavens, though
   once, for our sakes, He sank down into the very depths of death and the
   grave. Bless His dear name! Be glad and rejoice in Him!

   Now, I pray you, let your mouth be filled with laughter, your tongue
   with singing and your heart with holy ecstasy as you think of who your
   Well-Beloved is, how great He is, and what greatness He puts upon you
   by virtue of His union

   with you! We cannot very well remember Christ as we should while we
   carry about with us a heavy heart. Come, sad spirit, be glad in the
   Lord! "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice." If ever a
   human soul had reason to rejoice, it must be the soul that believes in
   Christ! If ever there were any of the sons of Adam who had cause to be
   glad and to clap their hands with holy mirth, it is the men who have
   found Christ to be their salvation and their All in All!

   These, then, are the preparations for the holy memory of which our text
   speaks. If they are well made, you will have no difficulty in
   remembering Christ's love tonight!

   II. So now, in the second place, as I may be strengthened, I would like
   to speak about THE DIVINE SUBJECT OF THIS HOLY MEMORY--"We will
   remember Your love."

   First, we will remember the fact of Christ's love. What a wonderful
   thing it is that the Son of God should love us! I do not wonder so much
   that He should have any love for you--but I am lost in wonder at the
   fact that He has any love for me, even for me! Does not each Believer
   feel that the wonder of wonders must ever be that the Lord Jesus Christ
   loves him? He was in Glory, needing nothing. He was in His Father's
   bosom, enjoying ineffable delight. If He wanted to cast His eyes of
   love on any of His creatures, there were myriads of bright spirits
   before the Throne. But, no, He must look down, down, down, to earth's
   dunghills and find us who were utterly unworthy of His regard!

   Then He might have pitied us, and left us in our lost estate, but it
   could not be so with One who has such a heart as our dear Savior
   has--He must love us! What it is for God to love, God only knows. We
   faintly guess, by the love that burns in our bosom towards the objects
   of our affection, what the love of God must be. The love of God must be
   a mighty passion! I use the word because I know no better--I am
   conscious that it is not the right one, for human language is too
   feeble to describe Divine Love--

   "Stronger His lore than death or Hell Its riches are unsearchable! The
   first-born sons of light Desire in rain its depths to see-- They cannot
   reach the mystery The length, and breadth, and height."

   Oh, the love of Christ! It must always be the wonder of wonders that
   Jesus Christ, the darling of the heavens, should have set the eyes of
   His affection upon men of mortal mold--on sinful men--on me! That, to
   me, is the climax.

   We will remember the fact of Christ's love. But we will remember, also,
   the character of Christ's love. What a love it was! He loved us before
   the foundation of the world! With the telescope of His Prescience, He
   foresaw our existence and He loved us when we had no being! Then He
   struck hands with the great Father and entered into Covenant on our
   behalf, and engaged that He would stand Sponsor for us and redeem us
   from the ruin of our sin. Oh, the love, the love, the everlasting love
   of Christ! He has never left off loving us from the very first. All
   through the ages before the world was, and through the centuries in
   which the world has existed, He has loved His chosen every moment--and
   loved them to the fullest. Can you drink in the sweetness of that
   thought? Oh, I pray you, remember the antiquity and the constancy of
   the love of Christ to His people! "We will remember Your love."

   It was unmerited love which had no reason in us for it to light upon--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem, Or gire the Creator
   delight? 'Twas eren so, Father,'you must always sing, 'Because it
   seemed good in Your sight.'" He loved us because He would love us. It
   was the sovereignty of His love that made Him love those whom He chose
   to love. He loved them freely, without anything in them, or that would
   ever be done by them, to deserve His love. But He loved fully as well
   as freely. He loved intensely, Divinely, immeasurably. You know your
   love to your child--it is but a feeble spark compared to the great sun
   of Christ's love to you! You know your love to your husband--it is a
   tiny rill compared with the ocean of Christ's love to His people!
   Beloved, turn over the wondrous qualities of the love of Christ to you,
   and say, as you sit at the Communion Table tonight, "We will remember
   Your love, for we cannot forget it. We will remember Your love, for the
   joyous theme forces itself upon us. We will remember Your love more
   than wine."

   We will also remember the deeds of Christ's love. It is a grand story.
   I cannot stay to tell it to you tonight. You know how, in the fullness
   of time, the Son of God came out of Glory and alighted on a stall where
   the horned oxen fed. He who

   had made all worlds was hanging at a woman's breast, for He was made
   flesh that He might save us from our sins. "Herein is love!" See Him
   living a laborious life, going about doing good, despised, maligned,
   yet always ready to give still greater Grace and mercy to the unworthy.
   You know His life, the wondrous life of Christ. "Herein is love." At
   last, He gave Himself up in agony even to a bloody sweat. He gave His
   back to the smiters and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair.
   He hid not His face from shame and spitting. And then He gave
   Himself--His hands to the nails, His feet to the Cross and the cruel
   iron, His side to the lance, His body to the tomb, His soul to depart
   to His Father. "Herein is love." I wish I could preach upon this theme
   as it deserves to be proclaimed. Oh, that I knew how to speak of the
   dying love of Christ! The angels desire to look into the mystery of the
   love of Jesus, but even they cannot compass its immeasurable height,
   and depth, and length, and breadth! Will not each of us, who are the
   objects of it, remember His dying

   love?--

   "When to the Cross I turn my eyes, And rest on Calrary

   Lamb of God! My Sacrifice!

   1 must remember Thee! Remember You and all Your pains, And all Your
   lore to me.

   Yes, while a breath, a pulse remains, Will I remember Thee!"

   But Jesus rose from the grave. He rose with the same love. He ascended
   with the same love. He lives with the same love, pleading for us! He
   loves us now and He will come for us in love. Love shall give Him wings
   to fly down to earth again. He will reign here, but not without His
   people. "The Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
   and before His ancients gloriously." He will reign forever in love!
   Evermore, throughout the life to come, and the ages that shall never
   end, Christ will rest in His love! He will rejoice over His people with
   joy! He will joy over them with singing. He will also give them to
   share His Glory and to sit upon His Throne--and to reign with Him
   forever and ever!

   Oh, what a theme is this, the deeds of Christ's love! In trying to talk
   of it, I feel like a poor schoolboy standing here, speaking on a
   subject he loves. Oh, that there were a Milton, or some one of Miltonic
   caliber, to tell out the story of this great love of Christ! Yet,
   perhaps the theme is better with my poor description than it would be
   with the loftiest words of men, because you are more likely to forget
   the description and to remember the love that cannot be described.
   Whereas, had my discourse been filled with lofty and worthy diction,
   you might have forgotten the theme and remembered the speaker.

   I would like you, Brothers and Sisters, tonight, to remember the proofs
   of Christ's love. You were far off, but He sought you and brought you
   back. You were deaf, but He called you and opened your ears to hear His
   loving call. You came trembling and afraid, but He cheered you--and in
   a moment He took your burden from you and set you free! Do you remember
   it?--

   "Do you recall the place, the spot of ground, Where Jesus did you
   meet?"

   I remember, tonight, the place where first I saw the Lord. I know it to
   a yard. Some of you cannot speak as definitely as that, and you need
   not blush because you cannot. Did Jesus come to you? Did He forgive
   your sins? Did He comfort you with His love? Then remember it tonight!
   Never mind about dates and places--just remember His love!

   Since Jesus first came to you, and saved you, many a time you have been
   in trouble and He has comforted you. You have been in labor and He has
   sustained you. You have been in disrepute, but He has honored you.
   Alas, you have proved yourself unworthy of His love, but He has
   forgiven your backslidings. You have wandered from Him, but He has
   restored you. Remember His great love!

   No word of mine will, I fear, help you much, but let your memory begin
   to run over the pages of your diary. Turn over the leaves that record
   your Lord's favor to you. Are there not some pages with great crosses
   upon them, which you made in the day of trouble, and other crosses
   which you made in the hour of your deliverance when Jesus came to your
   relief? Oh, remember His love, remember His love more than wine!

   I will not detain you on this point any longer, although there was much
   more I wanted to say. Only, Brothers and Sisters, if I cannot talk to
   you, do the thing that we are thinking about. Remember Christ and His
   great love. Do now,

   before you partake of the emblems of His broken body and His shed
   blood, get to Him! You may forget everything else if you like, but I
   charge you remember Christ's love! There, fling overboard every other
   recollection, however precious! Let the golden ingots go, but hold fast
   to the true lading of the ship, her real cargo--the love wherewith
   Christ has loved us! Remember that and sit still and enjoy the blessed
   memory.

   Before I come to the last division of my subject, I should like to ask
   whether there are any here who cannot remember Christ's love because
   they never knew it? Is that your case, my dear Friend over yonder? Let
   me remind you of the lepers of whom we have been reading, and then let
   me recall to your minds God's ancient Law concerning the man suffering
   from leprosy. When he was brought for the High Priest to examine him,
   the High Priest looked him up and down, from the crown of his head to
   the sole of his feet, and he said to the leper, "Here is a place still
   on your breast where your flesh is perfectly clean." And the leper
   said, "Yes, I am pleased to see that it is so." But the High Priest
   replied, "You are unclean, you must not go into the House of the Lord,
   or associate with the people." Then there came another, and he searched
   him all over, and said, "Here, upon this part of your leg, there is
   still a sound place." "Yes," said the other, "I have often thought what
   a good sign it was." "You also are unclean," said the High Priest, "Go
   to your separate house, and abide there."

   Then there came one poor man who was white all over, and the High
   Priest said to him, "Have you any clean places?" "No, my lord, not one.
   Examine me and see." And the High Priest looked, and there was not a
   clean spot on him where you could have put a pin's point--the leprosy
   was all over him, he was saturated all through with the deadly virus
   and foul with the loathsome disease. And there he stood and cowered and
   trembled before the High Priest. Then the High Priest said to him,
   "Behold, you are clean! When you have performed the ceremony required
   by the Law of God, you may go home to your house and to the house of
   your God, for you are clean." There was a medical reason, I suppose,
   for this Law--the mischief had thrown itself out, it had come out to
   the shin, the disease was fully developed, and would soon be removed.
   But, whatever may have been the medical reason, such was the Law--and
   if I am addressing anybody here who feels, "There is nothing good about
   me. I am unclean, unclean, unclean, from the crown of my head to the
   sole of my feet, and the lowest place in Hell is my dessert," my
   Friend, the Grace of God has begun to work in you!

   Now that you are emptied, God will begin to fill you! Trust in the
   atoning Sacrifice of His dear Son and you shall have the assurance that
   you are also the subject of His saving Grace--His love shall be shed
   abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit--and you shall join with us in
   remembering that great love wherewith He has loved us!

   III. The last thing upon which I have to speak to you is this, THE
   DIVINE PRODUCT OF THIS HOLY MEMORY--"The upright love You."

   So it seems, then, that if we remember Christ, we shall have a respect
   for His people. His people are the upright and she, who speaks in the
   sacred Canticle, here looks round upon them, and says, "The upright
   love You." "That commends You to me; for if they who are of a chaste
   spirit love You, much more should I." I think, if you feel as I do
   sometimes, you would be glad to be sure that you were even the least in
   God's House. We know the upright love Christ and we love the upright
   because they do so--and we esteem Christ because the better men are,
   the more they think of Him. Is it not so? But sometimes we are afraid
   we are not among the number of the chosen ones. "The upright love You."
   Lord, am I one of the upright? Our hymn puts it, even concerning
   Heaven--

   There you that lore my Sarior sit, There I would gladly hare place,
   Among your thrones, or at your feet, So I might see His face."

   Would we not gladly sit at the feet of the very least of His people if
   we might but love Christ? They love Him! I know how you look about you
   tonight and you say, "There sits Brother So-and-So. He loves Christ.
   There is Mistress So-and-So who is so busy in the service of her Lord.
   She loves Christ. And that dear man (Mr. William Olney), whose death we
   still commemorate by these sad memorials around the pulpit--he loved
   Christ." "Ah, well!" you say, "I wish I loved Him, too, and that I were
   among the upright in character who truly admire Him."

   Seek that blessing, dear Friends, for it is to be had if you seek it
   aright! Seek it, for the love of Christ will make you love the upright
   and foster in you an esteem for them. I do not like to hear Christian
   people speak ill of one another-- and I do not like to hear Christian
   people speak ill of the Church. If Christ loves her and is married to
   her, woe to you if you find fault with my Master's bride! He loves not
   those who love not His chosen! Have a great love for the people of

   God, even the poorest of them! Count them to be the aristocrats of the
   world, the blood-royal of the universe, the men and women who have
   angels to be their servants and who are made kings and priests unto
   God! If you remember Christ, you will remember His people. If you
   remember His love, you will feel a love towards them, God grant that
   you may do so!

   One thing more, and I have done. In remembering Christ's love as the
   upright do, we shall grow upright. I believe that God blesses trouble
   to our sanctification and that He can bless joy to the same end. But I
   am sure of this, that the greatest instrument of sanctification is the
   love of Jesus! One asked what he should think of to make him holy, and
   his friend answered, "Think of death." It is wise to talk with the
   grave, the mattock and the shroud--but the living love of Christ has a
   sanctifying power that even thoughts of death have not! One has said,
   "If you would grow holy, think of the punishment of sin, the pit that
   God has dug for the wicked. It will make you tremble at the thought of
   sin and cause you to flee from it as from an arch-destroyer." This is
   true. But still, if you would grow in Grace fast, and become holy,
   rapidly, this is the best theme for your meditation, "We will remember
   Your love." If you will remember Christ's love, you will be lifted up
   from your crookedness and made straight--and put among the upright who
   love the Lord.

   Come, then, let us join tonight in sweet thoughts of love to Christ!
   The sermon is short, but the subject is long, and you have now an
   opportunity for coming to the Communion Table and thinking out that
   theme which I have started for you, "The love of Christ to me, the love
   of Christ to me." Then follow it up with this, "Oh, my poor love to
   Christ!" Think, dear Friends, if you remember your own love to Christ,
   what a small thing it is to remember! His great love is like the sun in
   the heavens! Your love--well, you have to put on your spectacles before
   you can see it, it is so small a thing! God grant it may grow tonight
   and, at the Communion Table, may you have such a visitation from
   Christ, such delightful fellowship with Him, that you may be able to
   sing, again, the hymn that you were singing when I was obliged to
   retire for a while from the platform--

   "My Jesus, I lore You, I know You are mine,

   For You all the follies of sin I resign.

   My gracious Redeemer, my Sarior, are You,

   If erer I lored You, my Jesus, 'tis now.

   I will lore You in life, I will lore You in death,

   And praise You as long as You lend me breath.

   And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,

   'If erer I lored you, my Jesus, 'tis now.'" May you sing it now and be
   able to sing it when the death-dew lies cold on your brow! The Lord be
   with you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. PSALM 113, AND LUKE 17:11-19.

   We will read, this evening, two passages in the Word of God. The first
   will be Psalm 113.

   Verse 1. Praise you the LORD. Praise, O you servants of the LORD,
   praise the name of the LORD. Three times are you stirred up to this
   duty of praise. Adore the Sacred Trinity with threefold praise! There
   is a trinity in you--let spirit, soul and body praise the Lord. Let the
   past, the present and the future make another threefold chord. And for
   each of these, "Praise you the Lord. Praise, O you servants of the
   Lord, praise the name of the Lord."

   2, 3. Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and
   forevermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
   the LORD'S name is to be praised. "From the rising of the sun until the
   going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised." In hours of
   morning light, when the dew is on the grass and our soul is fall of
   gladness, and in the hours of the setting sun, when the day is weary
   and the night seems coming on, still let the Lord have the praise that
   is His due, for He is always to be praised! There is never an hour in
   which it would be unseemly to praise God. For everything there is a
   season, and a time for every purpose under Heaven--but the praising of
   God is never out of season! All time and all eternity may be dedicated
   to this blessed work.

   4, 5. The LORD is high above all nations, and His Glory above the
   heavens. Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwells on high? The
   loftiness, the majesty, the sublimity of God are attributes that are
   wonderful in themselves, yet they

   minister much joy to those who love the Lord. For, you know, we can
   never make too much of those whom we love. And if we see them exalted,
   then is our soul glad. Would you wish to have a little God? Would you
   wish to have a God who had but little honor, or little power? No, you
   ascribe to Him all conceivable and all inconceivable greatness, and you
   exult as you think what a high and mighty God He is--

   "Who is like unto Jehorah our God, who dwells on high?"

   6. Who humbles Himself to behold the things that are in Heaven, and in
   the earth! It enables us to get some faint idea of the greatness of God
   when we read that He has to humble Himself even to look at the things
   in Heaven, perfect and spotless though they are!. Dr. Watts truly
   sings--

   "The lowest step around Your seat

   Rises too high for Gabriel's feet!

   In rain the tall archangel tries

   To reach Your height with wondering eyes." All the faculties of all the
   angels cannot comprehend the Infinite! When the Lord looks down to us,
   how much He must humble Himself! If He humbles Himself to see the
   things in Heaven which are clear and pure, what humility is required
   that He may look upon the things on the earth!

   7, 8. He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of
   the dunghill that He may set him with princes, even with the, princes
   of His people. Have you never noticed that in all these joyous songs to
   God, there is almost always one of these notes--that God abases the
   proud and exalts the humble? This was the basis of Hannah's song. And
   it was the pith and marrow of Mary's Magnificat--"He has put down the
   mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree." This
   wonderful turning of things upside down. This withering of the green
   tree and making the dry tree to flourish. This killing that which lives
   and quickening that which is dead. This emptying of the full, and
   filling of the empty. This casting down the mighty from their thrones
   and lifting the poor out of the dust! This is always one of the highest
   reasons for exulting joy. What a Truth of God there is for you and for
   me tonight, if we feel ourselves to be spiritually so poor that the
   dunghill is no offense to us because we feel ourselves to be even more
   offensive than the filthy things that are cast away by men! What a
   mercy it is that the Lord "lifts the needy out of the dunghill that He
   may set Him with princes, even with the princes of His people"!

   9. He makes the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother
   of children. Praise you the LORD. Does your soul feel barren? May the
   Lord grant unto it an abundant fruitfulness! Looking back upon the past
   year, perhaps you have had many barren times, or times that you have
   thought to be barren. If you are a minister of the Gospel, I should not
   wonder if those have been your most fruitful seasons. When you have
   been most empty, God has been pleased to feed the people through you. O
   dear Brothers and Sisters, those very times of spiritual experience
   which are most humiliating and most painful are often the most
   soul-enriching to us--and they also bring the greatest glory to God!
   Now we will read a New Testament story in order that we may see how
   some men did not praise the Lord as they should have done. You will
   find the narrative in the 17th Chapter of the Gospel according to Luke,
   at the 11th verse.

   Luke 17:11. And it came to pass, as He went to Jerusalem, that He
   passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. There is but One of
   whom we will think tonight--our Divine Lord who was on His way to
   Jerusalem. Passing along the frontiers of Samaria and Galilee, He had
   the Jews on one side of Him and the Samaritans on the other. He took a
   middle course, as if to show how He was going up to the New Jerusalem
   loaded with blessings for the Jews on one side, and Gentiles on the
   other.

   12. And as He entered into a certain village, there met Him ten men
   that were lepers. Oh, the abundance of human misery that met the
   Savior's eye--"ten men that were lepers"! I was reading only yesterday
   of what happened in Westminster, many years ago. When the king went
   along the highway there were crowds of poor lepers on either side of
   the road--a shocking sight to see in this dear land of ours--and the
   king, in his tender mercy, simply passed a law that the lepers should
   not come near the road again to shock his gracious majesty with their
   misery! That is all he had to do for them. But our glorious King
   treated lepers very differently--"There met Him ten men that were
   lepers."

   12. Which stood afar off. The rule was that they should never come upon
   the public road, or near the highway, lest the disease should be taken
   by others who might come near them.

   13. And they lifted up their voices. Not much of voices were they
   likely to have, for the leprosy dries the throat and the voice is low
   and husky. And when lepers cry, "Unclean, unclean," it is an awfully
   sad sound, but very weak. These ten lepers lifted up their poor voices.

   13. And said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us! They raised a plain cry
   and the whole ten of them had to lift up their voices before they could
   be well heard.

   14. And when He saw them. Even before He heard them, He saw their
   pitiable condition.

   14. He said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. That is all
   Jesus said to the lepers--"Go show yourselves unto the priests." They
   were not to go to the priests till they were clean, for the priests
   could not heal them. It was the healed man who went to the priests to
   get a certificate that he was healed, and so might mingle in society
   again. It was a strange message, then, that the Savior gave to these
   lepers--"Go show yourselves unto the priests." And oh, the faith of
   these men! With only this shell of a promise, as it were, they cracked
   it and found a promise inside it, for they said to themselves, "He
   would not send us to the priests for nothing! He would not mock our
   misery! He must mean to heal us!" And, therefore, away they went. A
   grand faith this! You are to come to Christ before you feel any Grace
   in yourself! You are not to wait until you feel you are healed and then
   come to Him! Come just as you are, without any sense of Grace, or any
   kind of feeling within you that is worth having. Come just as you are!

   14. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. As the
   sinner believes he is saved. As a man begins to go towards the
   Savior--the Savior's Grace meets him.

   15. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed. They all saw that
   they were healed and they all must have felt extremely glad. Oh, the
   happiness of feeling the hot blood cooled and full health taking the
   place of languor and disease!

   15. Turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God. This was a sure
   sign that he was healed, that he had his voice back--the disease had so
   thoroughly gone that the sound, which seemed to hide away in his husky
   throat, now came out clear and loud--like the stroke of a bell!

   16. And fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. When I
   read these words just now, I thought, that is where I would like to be
   and that is what I would like to do, all my life, to fall down--

   "At His feet, giring Him thanks."

   16. And He was a Samaritan. Ah, me! Nine of the seed of Israel were
   ungrateful--and only one poor outcast Gentile was grateful to the Lord
   for the miracle of healing that had been worked!

   17-19. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where
   are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God,
   save this stranger. And He said unto him, Arise, go your way: your
   faith, has made you whole. May the Lord Jesus thus speak to many a
   poor, leprous sinner here tonight! "Arise, go your way: your faith has
   made you whole."

God's People--or Not God's People

   (No. 2295)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say
   to them which were not My people, You are My people; and they shall
   say, You are my God." Hosea 2:23.

   "As He says also in Hosea, I will call them My people, which were not
   My people; and her beloved, which was not beloved." Romans 9:25.

   To my mind, it is very instructive to notice how Paul quotes from the
   Prophets. The Revelation of the mind of God in the Old Testament helps
   us to understand the Gospel revealed in the New Testament. There is no
   authority that is so powerful over the minds of Christian men as that
   of the Word of God. Has God made known any Truth in His Word? Then it
   is invested with Divine authority! Paul, being himself Inspired by the
   Holy Spirit and, therefore, able to write fresh Revelations of the mind
   of God, here brings the authority of God's Word in the olden times to
   back up and support what he says--"As he says also in Hosea."

   Beloved Friend, if you are seeking salvation, or if you need comfort,
   never rest satisfied with the mere word of man. Be not content unless
   you get the Truth from the mouth of God. Say in your spirit, "I will
   not be comforted unless God, Himself, shall comfort me. I want chapter
   and verse for that which I receive as Gospel." Our Lord's reply to
   Satan was, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by
   every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." Give me, then, but a
   Word out of God's mouth, and I can live upon it! But all the words out
   of man's mouth, apart from Divine Inspiration, must be as unsatisfying
   food as if men tried to live on stones.

   Notice, again, how Paul teaches that the very essence of the authority
   of the Scriptures lies in this, that God speaks through His revealed
   Word--"As HE says also in Hosea." It is God speaking in the Bible whom
   we ought to hear. The mere letter of the Word, alone, will kill, but
   when we hear God's voice speaking in it, then it has power which it
   could not possess otherwise. It is a blessed thing to put your ear down
   to the promises of Scripture till you hear God speaking through them to
   your soul. It is truly profitable to read a Gospel Commandment and to
   listen to its voice until God, Himself, speaks it with power to your
   heart. I pray you, do not regard anything that is preached here unless
   it agrees with what is written there in the Bible. If it is only my
   word, throw it away! But if it is God's Truth that I declare to you, if
   God, Himself, speaks it through my lips, you will disregard it at your
   peril.

   I will make only one other observation by way of introduction. Is it
   not wonderful how God's Word is preserved century after century? There
   were seven or 800 years between Hosea and Paul and it is remarkable
   that the promise to the Gentiles should lie asleep all that time, and
   yet should be just as full of life and power when Paul was quoting it
   after all those centuries! God's Word is like the wheat in the hand of
   the mummy, of which you have often heard. It had lain there for
   thousands of years, but men took it out of the hand and sowed it--and
   there sprang up the bearded wheat which has now become so common in our
   land! So you take a Divine promise, spoken hundreds or thousands of
   years ago, and lo, it is fulfilled to you! It becomes as true to you as
   if God had spoken it for the first time this very day and you were the
   person to whom it was addressed. O blessed Word of God, how we ought to
   prize you! We cannot yet tell all that lies hidden between these
   covers, but there is a treasury of Grace concealed here which we ought
   to seek until we find it.

   Having thus introduced our texts as taken from God's Word in the Old
   and New Testaments, and as being God's voice to us, speaking adown the
   centuries with all the freshness and force it would have if it were
   uttered anew tonight, I invite every unconverted person to listen with
   both his ears and his whole heart, to hear if there shall drop some
   living word of cheer and promise that shall make this evening to be his
   birth night! If so, this shall be the time wherein his captivity shall
   be ended, his mouth shall be filled with laughter and his tongue with
   singing--and his spirit shall rejoice in God his Savior!

   I. Now, first, in considering the words in the Epistle to the Romans,
   let us look at THE ORIGINAL STATE OF GOD'S PEOPLE. "I will call them My
   people, which were not My people; and her beloved, which was not
   beloved."

   If we look at the original state of God's people, we shall gaze upon a
   very gloomy picture. Yet this portrait reveals the state in which every
   unconverted man is tonight--the state in which all of us, who are now
   saved, once were! We were not God's people--that is to say, we had not
   God's approval. I speak now of all those whom God has saved. There was
   a time when there was no approval of them! As the Apostle says, "They
   that are in the flesh cannot please God." So was it with those who were
   not God's people--their thoughts were contrary to God's thoughts, their
   ways were such as God could not endure--their speech grated in His
   ears, they followed the devices and imaginations of their own hearts!
   The prince of this world had dominion over them and God's Grace had not
   been displayed upon them. They went astray like lost sheep.

   That is your condition tonight, Sinner--you are the object of Divine
   disapproval. "Not beloved," says the text. "Not beloved." How can you
   be beloved of God? How can the Lord take any delight in a man who takes
   no delight in his God, who tries not even to think of Him--who breaks
   His Law with impunity--and finds pleasure in that which God abhors?
   "Not My people," says the text. That is, they were not the subjects of
   Divine approval.

   Next, such people receive from God no good thing of the highest order.
   "Oh," say some, "but we are receiving all sorts of temporal blessing's
   from God." I know you are and you ought to thank Him for them. But as
   you are not His people, and not beloved, even these good things turn
   out to be evil things to you. Your table becomes a snare and a trap to
   you. Men who receive God's mercies before His Grace has brought them to
   Himself, make idols of the good things He bestows upon them. They
   receive benefits at His hands and use them to provoke Him to anger!
   They take of their wealth and they say, with the rich fool, "Soul, you
   have much goods laid up for many years. Take your ease--eat, drink, and
   be merry!" And so they forget that they must die and they forget their
   God.

   Oftentimes, even health and strength become a snare to men. They will
   plunge into greater sin because they have so much vigor of body. We
   have known some who have been so robust in health that they would not
   think of God, or of Christ, or of their souls, or of eternity! I tell
   you, Sinners, that while you are as you are, God's curse rests upon
   your blessings! There is no good thing out of Christ, for that which
   would be good with Christ becomes evil without Christ! It becomes a
   thing which destroys rather than blesses and which helps men the more
   rapidly to destroy their souls. Oh, what a sad state is yours of whom
   God says, "They are not My people, and they are not beloved"! While
   they are as they are, they cannot receive the highest good from
   God--even the best things that He sends them, they turn into evil.

   Remember, too, you who know not God, that you are in a very miserable
   condition because to you there is no application of the precious blood
   of Christ. Jesus died for sinners, but you pass by His Cross as though
   you had nothing to do with it. Israel in Egypt was saved because God
   saw the blood and passed over the houses of His people. But you are not
   beneath that crimson sign! You have never looked to Christ by faith! No
   blood is on the lintel and on the two side posts of your door. All we
   can say of you, as we look at you, is, "Not beloved! Not beloved." Oh,
   poor Souls, you who have not believed, what does the Scripture say to
   you? Why, that you are "condemned already" because you have not
   believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God! You who have not
   believed in Christ are lying in the Wicked One--and what does that
   expression mean? Why, lying in his bosom, as if you were the darling
   children of the devil! How can there be any sign of the Divine delight
   or complacency towards you while your delight is in Satan and in sin?
   No, you have no interest in the precious blood of Jesus! Ah, me, what
   would I do if this were my case? I would sooner lose my eyes, my
   hearing, my sense of taste! I would sooner lose life, itself, than lose
   an interest in the precious blood of Jesus! Yet some of you live at
   ease though there has been for you no pardon of sin, no washing in the
   blood of sprinkling. You are still guilty before God.

   Again, when these people were called by God, "not My people," and, "not
   beloved," there had been no saving work of the Spirit of God upon them.
   I am addressing some here, tonight, who have never had their hearts
   broken by the Spirit of God. They have never been brought to
   repentance, they have never been led to faith in Christ. Consequently,
   to them the Spirit of God is not a Quickener. To them He is not a
   Comforter. To them He is not an Illuminator. All His Divine

   offices are fulfilled in other people, but not in them. They are
   strangers to that blessed power without which no man can come to God,
   or believe in Christ. Oh, what a sad condition for any to be in--"not
   My people," and, "not beloved"! They have no trace of that life which
   they would have if the Spirit of God had made them to pass from death
   unto life. God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the
   living--and as long as you are dead in sin, He is not your God in this
   special sense--neither does He call you His people.

   Those who are in that sad state have no relief in prayer. They do not
   pray--they cannot pray! Now, when I am in trouble, I need nobody to
   advise me to pray. A trouble no sooner comes to me than I spread it
   before God and I find a sweet relief at once. Oh, if there were no
   Mercy Seat, I should wish that I had never been born! But there are
   some of you who never truly pray. Such prayers as you do offer have no
   heart in them, no life in them and, therefore, God does not hear you,
   and you live on in this world without prayer. Men, how can you exist
   thus? Life must be to you like a burning desert where every particle of
   sand blisters the foot that treads upon it. What can this world be to a
   prayerless man?

   And as you are without prayer, so you are without the promises of God
   to sustain you. The wealth of God's people seldom lies in ready money.
   Their treasure consists mostly in promises to pay--promises which God
   has made to His own people. But for the ungodly there are no blessed
   promises! God will give nothing to you who will not even believe His
   Word! He has made no Covenant with you who will not even trust His Son!
   You remain as He says--it is not my word, but His--"not My people,"
   and, "not beloved," as long as you are without faith in the Lord Jesus
   Christ! Whatever promises He has made to His people, you are without
   power to plead those promises at the Throne of Grace, for they do not
   belong to you.

   In addition to all this, you are now without any fellowship with God,
   or with His Son, Jesus Christ. God made this world, but you never speak
   with the world's Maker. You are guardianed by His Providence and yet
   you have no fellowship with the God who rules over all. Why, the joy of
   life to some of us lies mainly in our fellowship with our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ! He is the very center of the circle in which we
   move. He is the height and glory of our manhood. He is the All in All
   of our existence. We would not wish to live if it were not for Him. He
   is the sun that makes our Heaven bright--all would be dark without
   Him--and yet some of you have no communion with Him, perhaps not even
   any knowledge of Him! Oh, my dear Friend, you have no Christ, no
   Savior, no communion with God, no fellowship with the Most High! What a
   terrible condition is yours!

   Besides this, you have no hope of Heaven. If you were to die as you now
   are, what could be your eternal portion but to be driven from the
   Presence of God, and from the Glory of His power? The Lord Jesus would
   say of you, "I never knew them, I never knew them. They are not My
   people. They are not My beloved." Why, you have never even sought Him!
   You have never cried to Him! You have never forsaken the sin which He
   hates! You have never rested upon the Atonement which He has made! You
   have never trusted in His living power to save! Ah, poor creatures that
   you are, how I pity you!

   "Do not call us poor," you say. "We are rich, we are increased in goods
   and have need of nothing." So much the worse is your poverty because of
   your fancied wealth! It will be an awful thing to go from your
   well-spread table to the place where you will be denied a drop of water
   to cool your burning tongues! It will be a terrible thing if you go
   from the weakness and sickness of the dying bed at once to stand before
   your God--to be driven from the pangs of your last moments into that
   dread position of a culprit, unpardoned--to receive sentence from the
   great Judge of All. "Not My people," and, "not beloved." I cannot bear
   the thought of your doom, and I can say no more on that terrible theme.

   II. But now, in the second place, I have to speak of THE NEW CONDITION
   OF GOD'S PFOPLE. Listen, and as you listen, may God make it to be your
   new condition! There are many in this world to whom my text has been
   proven to be true--"I will call them My people, which were not My
   people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."

   Now see the change which God can make. It is God who makes it! The very
   same people of whom He said, "They are not My people," He now calls His
   people! Yes, and in the very place where He said that they were not His
   people, He says they are the people of the living God. Now, what if
   tonight I have been saying of such and such that they are not God's
   people? But what if, before they leave this place, God should say to
   them, "You are My people"? Oh, what a blessed change would have taken
   place in them! Let me describe it.

   If the Lord shall say to us, tonight, "You are My people, and you are
   My beloved," then we shall know, first, that He thinks upon us, that
   His mind is toward us, that He has a kindly regard for us, that He
   takes delight in us, that His heart

   is set on doing us good! Oh, you who love the Lord and are His
   children, think of this--you have the thoughts of God running towards
   you in streams of ever-abounding tenderness, mercy, goodness and
   faithfulness!

   And, as the Lord thinks of us, He speaks to us. Oh, to think that the
   Lord should speak to those who were once not His people, and speak to
   them so effectually as to make His sweet promises enter into their
   ears, yes, into their hearts! And should become familiar to them, for,
   "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will show
   them His Covenant"! Oh, how sweetly does God commune with His own
   children! How He does open up His very heart to them and make them to
   know Him, even as Jesus manifests Himself unto His chosen as He does
   not unto the world! It is a choice privilege of a child of God to be
   thought of and then to be spoken to by the Lord!

   More than that, God hears us speak. When we are His people, and His
   beloved, then our accents become sweet in His ears. You know that your
   dear children often speak very poorly and badly, and other people do
   not much care to listen to their talk. But to a father's ear the sound
   of his own child's voice is always sweet! You have been away from home
   for some weeks. I know that you are longing to hear the dear prattlers
   once again. Well, like as a father loves the voice of his child, so
   does our heavenly Father love the voices of His beloved whom He calls
   His people--and He has regard to what they say--He hearkens to the
   voice of their cry.

   Then, beloved, He not only hears us, but He grants us our desire. He
   will come to our deliverance in the time of trouble. He will bestow
   upon us all good things--"No good thing will He withhold from them that
   walk uprightly." Oh, the privileges of those who are God's people! The
   theme is too vast for human language to compass!

   One special mark of our new condition is that the Lord forgives our
   sin. Once we were loaded with sin, but now we have not a single sin
   left upon us. The blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleanses us
   from all sin! Paul challenges the whole universe to lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect, for God has justified them. "Who is he that
   condemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who
   is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
   Oh, the heaped-up blessedness of the man whose transgression is
   forgiven, whose sin is covered! And that is true of all whom God calls
   His people, though they once were not His people!

   And then, dear Friends, sin being forgiven, the Lord works all things
   for our good. Whether we are joyous or depressed, if we are the Lord's
   people, all is working for our good! "We know that all things work
   together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
   according to His purpose." Our losses and our crosses, our bereavements
   and our bodily pains, as well as our rapturous joys and our highest
   delights, are all working out the best results for us!

   More than this, when we are in trouble, God pities us, for, like as a
   father pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him."
   Yes, and He sends us relief, too, according to that word of David,
   "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivers him
   out of them all." What is better, still, God dwells in us, as He said,
   "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
   they shall be My people." And the Holy Spirit has come, and taken up
   His abode in these mortal bodies--and He dwells there, our Teacher and
   our Comforter, our Guide and our Friend.

   By-and-by, the Lord Jesus will come, again, and receive us unto
   Himself, that where He is, there we may also be. I wish I had the
   tongues of men and of angels that I might tell you the splendor of the
   position of those who are the Lord's own people, the Lord's own
   beloved! And who were these people once? I come back to my text. They
   were not God's people, and not beloved--"I will call them My people,
   which were not My people; and her beloved, which was not beloved." Now
   then, some of you, whom God cannot now look upon except with anger--why
   should He not look upon you with love, tonight, through Jesus Christ?
   He that believes in Christ Jesus may have the blessed assurance that
   the Lord loves him and that he is one of the Lord's people!

   You may have come in here saying, "I belong to the devil. I am sure I
   do. I feel within my spirit that I am under his cruel sway. Alas! I
   have not a spark of Grace, or a thought of goodness. I am as far off
   from God, holiness and Heaven as I can ever be." Then to you, may God
   say, "I will call them My people, which were not My people; and her
   beloved, which was not beloved"! Oh, the magnificence of this Grace
   that waits not for man, neither tarries for the sons of men, but works
   according to the eternal purposes of God and accomplishes all His
   sovereign will!

   III. This brings me, in the third place--going back to the text in
   Hosea--to notice THE GRAND RESULT OF THIS WONDERFUL CHANGE. "I will say
   to them which were not My people, you are My people; and they shall
   say, You are my God." Here is a dialogue between the Lord and His
   people. God says something to them and they say something to Him.

   Remember that there is no change in God--it is only a change in our
   relation to Him, because those who have become His people were really
   His people, in His everlasting purpose, from before the foundation of
   the world--though they were not actually so as to their own spiritual
   condition. But now, when this change comes to pass in their relations
   to God, see the grand result of it!

   First, the Lord says, "You are My people." Now I pray that the Lord may
   come, tonight, and speak to some who never made mention of His name
   before, some who never knew Him, who never trembled at His Word, never
   hoped in His mercy, never trusted in His Son, never, indeed, meant to
   be His people at all! I trust that the Lord will now say to some of
   them, "You are My people." Oh, what a wonderful experience it is when
   the poor lost sinner finds out that he belongs to God, that he has been
   redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, that God means to save him,
   that He will not let His Son's blood be shed for him in vain! I
   remember the shame and yet the joy that filled my soul when I first
   woke up to the consciousness of what Christ had done for me. I remember
   the confusion of face I felt because I had treated such a Savior so
   badly and yet I also felt intense delight in thinking that He loved me,
   notwithstanding all my sins. This is a text that comforted me-- I pray
   the Lord to send it home to some other heart-- "I have loved you with
   an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you."
   And this one, also, "I have called you by your name; you are Mine." Oh,
   if the Holy Spirit would apply those Words with power to some sinner's
   heart, tonight, what a running after God, what a seeking after Christ
   there would be!

   "I will say to them which were not My people, You are My people." The
   Lord does not always say that to His people with equal force. At first,
   they half hope that it is so. They indistinctly hear His voice saying
   it, but as faith increases, they hear Him say it more distinctly, "You
   are My people." I feel that it is most gracious of God to call those
   His people that were not His people. You see that He gives them a new
   name and that overrides the old one. I think that I hear someone
   saying, "I have found the Savior!" "What? What?" says somebody who
   knows you. "You? Ha! We all know what you were." Perhaps one says, "Ah,
   you know that you have been as bad as any of us!" Possibly in one case
   they might say, "You talk of being God's child? You are a fallen
   woman," or, "You have been a thief," or, "You have been a liar," or,
   "You have been a frequenter of places where God is forgotten, a lover
   of pleasure rather than a lover of God."

   Yes, but, Beloved, if the Lord says, "I have called you by your name;
   you are Mine," you can say to yourself, "They may say what they please
   about me, and I must acknowledge the truth of it all, but this Word of
   the Lord, 'You are Mine,' overrides them all!"

   What a blessed text this is for one who has lost his character, for one
   who has lost all repute! If you come to Christ, and believe in Him,
   here is a text that applies to you! God says, "Since you were precious
   in My sight, you have been honorable, and I have loved you." God can
   make "right honorables" out of those who are, in themselves, most
   dishonorable, and He can give them a name and a place among His people.
   Yet I can imagine God looking upon someone here, tonight, and saying of
   such an one, "How can I put Him among the children? What? Put such a
   sinner among My children?" I can fancy there is somebody here who is so
   extremely sinful that if I were to propose to God's people that he
   should be received among them, they would say, "We would not like to
   receive that man into the Church." Ah, but when our heavenly Father
   welcomes home His prodigal son, He will not have the older brother talk
   like that! He comes out and reasons with him, and says, "It was meet
   that we should make merry, and be glad, for this, your brother, was
   dead, and is alive again, and was lost, and is found."

   Jesus would have us receive the very chief of sinners, the jailbirds,
   the Hellbirds, the men who have gone farthest astray--the men who have
   lost all hope, the most forlorn and self-condemned, the most dejected,
   distressed, devil-haunted men and women out of Hell! These are just the
   people in whom the Grace of God triumphs over all sin! "I will call
   them My people, which were not My people; and her beloved, which was
   not beloved." "And I will say to them, which were not My people, you
   are My people."

   When the Lord says this to any, their sin is put away! My Lord is a
   great Forgiver! My Lord, whom I preach to you tonight, who was once
   nailed to the Cross, is able to save all them to the uttermost that
   come unto God by Him. "He delights in mercy"--it is His right-hand
   attribute, His last-born, His Benjamin! Never does He display His mercy
   more than when, like the mighty sea, His love rolls over the very tops
   of the mountains of iniquity and covers them!

   I close by noticing what the Lord's people say to Him, "They shall say,
   You are my God." That is the right saying for every one of the Lord's
   people, "You are my God." Poor Sinner, may God the Holy Spirit help you
   to begin to say that,

   "You are my God"! Here is a text that should help you to say it, even
   as it helped me in the hour of my conversion, "Look unto Me, and be you
   saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none
   else." Will you look to God, Sinner? Will you say to the Lord, "You are
   my God"? "My God, I have long forgotten You, I have blasphemed You, I
   have rebelled against You, I have desecrated Your Sabbath, I have
   decried Your Gospel, I have ridiculed Your servants! But, behold, I
   look to You, for I have sinned. Have mercy upon me for Your dear Son's
   sake!"

   That is a good beginning, but may you have Grace to advance beyond that
   experience, so that you may come and lay your hands on Christ, the Lamb
   of God, who takes away the sin of the world, saying, "This Savior is my
   Savior. I accept Him as my Substitute, to stand in my place"! When you
   have once rightly uttered this blessed sentence, "You are my God,"
   God's Grace will help you to keep on saying it! There is no getting
   farther than this, "You are my God." That is the end of all good
   things. What more does a man need? What more can a man desire? There is
   not a good thing anywhere out of Christ!

   One of the old Puritans, in the days when nobody much liked going to
   sea, said, "When a man is in a ship and in his own little cabin, if he
   casts his eyes all around, and sees nothing but the wild waste of
   waters, without a sign of land any-where--nothing but angry billows
   tossing the vessel up and down--and if anyone says to Him, 'Will you
   leave your little cabin? Will you leave your little ship?' 'No,' he
   says, 'where else can I go? There is nowhere else to go."' That is just
   how I feel tonight about my Lord! My cabin, my ship, my Christ, my
   faith in Him, gives me rest and peace! I cannot see anywhere else that
   I can go except to destruction and despair--so my soul says over again,
   "You are my God, you are my God. Others may have what they will, but I
   will have my God. They may have what god they like, but You, Triune
   Jehovah, Father, Son and Holy Spirit--You are my God and on You my soul
   does rest, seeking no other confidence."

   Will you say that, tonight, my dear Hearers? I do not know your cases,
   but I know that if I need to get sheep into a fold, a good way is to
   set the gate open as widely as ever I can! And then another good way to
   entice the sheep in is to have rich pasture inside. Well, I have tried
   to set before you the rich, Free Grace of God to the very chief of
   sinners. And I have pointed to the opened Door that is wide enough to
   let the biggest sinner come through! Jesus said, "I am the Door: by Me
   if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and
   find pasture."

   Now, if Noah's ark had a door that was big enough to let an elephant
   through, then it was big enough to let a dog through, or a fox, or a
   cat, or a mouse. You may come if you are the biggest sinner in the
   world, but I do not suppose that you are, for the biggest sinner died
   and went to Heaven long ago. Paul says that he was the biggest sinner,
   the chief of sinners--and I believe that he knew what sized sinner he
   was. If there was room for him to go through the gate of salvation,
   there is room for you! May God's Grace draw you this very night--and
   unto the God of all Grace shall be the praise forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. HOSEA 2:5-23.

   In this chapter God compares Israel to a woman who had been unfaithful
   to her husband in the very worst and most wicked manner.

   Verse 5. For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived
   them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that
   give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my
   drink. She attributed to false gods the gifts which God had given to
   her. This was great ingratitude to God, and a high insult to His holy
   majesty.

   6. Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and make a
   wall, that she shall not find her paths. That is what God does to
   sinners whom He means to save. He will not let them take their own
   course. He gives them thorny trials which hedge up their way. He puts
   an obstacle in their path--perhaps some sickness or poverty. When men
   are desperate in wickedness, God has a way of stopping them. Even in
   their mad career, His mighty Grace comes in and says, "So far shall you
   go, but no further."

   7. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake
   them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Thus sinners go
   after the pleasures of the world and the pleasures run away from them.
   They make one thing their god, and then another, and they put out all
   their strength to attain the object of their ambition, but God thwarts
   them. In Infinite Love, He baffles all their endeavors because He means
   to bring them to Himself!

   7. Then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for
   then was it better with me than now. That is what He brings us
   to--weary of the world, yes, weary of life, itself--we get worn out in
   the ways of evil, and then we say, "I will go to God." What a blessed
   conclusion to come to! However terrible the whip with which He scourges
   us, it does us good. The fierce billow that washes the mariner upon the
   rock of safety is a blessing to him.

   8, 9. For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
   multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. Therefore
   will I return, and take away My corn in the time thereof, and My wine
   in the season thereof, and will recover My wool and My flax given to
   cover her nakedness. God claims the blessings of Providence as His own
   and when He sees His people misuse them, He says, "I will recover them.
   She is giving them to Baal, she is using them for an evil pur-pose--I
   will take them away."

   10, 11. And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
   lovers, and none shall deliver her out of My hand. I will also cause
   all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her
   Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. When God deals with men, He uses
   no half measures! If they have been very happy in the ways of sin and
   He intends to save them from their evil courses, He will take away all
   their joy. They shall henceforth have none of the merriment in which
   they indulged. He will give them better happiness, by-and-by, but for
   the time being it shall be true, "I will cause all her mirth to cease."

   12. And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has
   said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will
   make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. Her
   most precious things shall be destroyed, or, if they are allowed to
   exist, they shall become a cause of fear and trouble. Oh, how often
   have I seen this verified in the experience of men and women whom God
   has saved by His almighty Grace!

   13. And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
   incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her
   jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot Me, says the LORD.
   They burnt no incense at Jerusalem. They refused to offer sacrifice
   there, but they went to this hill and to that, to worship the different
   images of Baal, and said, "These are our gods." Therefore, God says
   that He will make them sick of their idolatry! They shall grow tired of
   thus polluting His holy name and degrading themselves by worshipping
   things made of wood and stone.

   14. Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
   wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. Oh, glorious verse! She
   that went so far astray, God will come and draw her back from the path
   of sin! He will get her alone. He will bring her into a place of grief
   and sorrow, a wilderness--and then He will come near and speak sweet
   words of comfort into her ear. "I will allure her, as the bird catchers
   whistle to the birds and draw them to the net, so will I allure her,
   and bring her into the wilderness, the place of loneliness, the place
   of need, and I will speak to her heart," so the Hebrew has it, for God
   knows how to speak, not only into the ears, but into the heart.

   15. And I will give her her vineyards from there. He will give back
   what He took away. He will seal with loving kindness the real kindness
   which made Him deal roughly with her at first.

   15. And the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing
   there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up
   out of the land of Egypt. Oh, Backslider, God can give you back your
   early joy, your early love, yes, and your early purity! And He can make
   you sing as at the beginning! Therefore, be of good comfort and come to
   your Lord--come even now, with all your sins about you--and He will
   receive you!

   16. And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, that you shall call Me
   Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali. "Baali" means, "My Lord," in the
   sense of domination. But God will not seem to us, anymore, like a
   domineering Governor, as we once thought Him. But we shall call Him,
   "Ishi," "My Husband." There shall be such nearness of love, such
   confidence of hope between the restored soul and her God, that she
   shall call Him no more Baali, but Ishi.

   17. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they
   shall no more be remembered by their name. Oh, the love of God! He does
   not want us to remember our old ways. I do not like to hear people talk
   about their old habits, except they do it very tenderly, with many a
   tear and many a sigh, and tell the story to the praise and glory of
   Divine Grace. God takes the old names out of our lips--we forget them,
   we have done with them, we bury the dead past-- and we live in newness
   of life.

   18. And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of
   the field, and with the fowls of Heaven, and with the creeping things
   of the ground. So that the insects should not devour the crops, the
   foxes should not spoil the vines and the birds should not steal the
   seed! So will God take care of His people! It does seem that, when we
   once get right with

   God, we get right with everything--when we are at peace with Him--then
   neither beast, nor fowl, nor creeping thing can do us harm.

   18. And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the
   earth, and will make them to lie down safely. They had been much
   troubled by war. It had killed their children, destroyed their homes
   and made them poor and wretched. Now God says, "I will break the bow
   and the sword and the battle." How often God gives a heavenly calm to
   us when we are once washed in the blood of Christ and covered with His
   Righteousness! I remember how the storm within my heart was hushed into
   a deep calm as soon as I had seen my Lord and had yielded my heart to
   Him. Oh, you that are in storms tonight, I pray that God may bring you
   to Himself and give you "peace, perfect peace!" And then what more will
   the Lord do?

   19. And I will betroth you unto Me forever. What? This woman that had
   gone so far into evil? Can a man receive such an one back? No, but God
   can! He says there shall be a new betrothal, a new marriage--"I will
   betroth you unto Me forever." Blessed word!

   19, 20. Yes, I will betroth you unto Me in righteousness, and in
   judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth
   you unto Me in faithfulness: and you shall know the LORD. You shall
   know Jehovah! You shall know that there is none like He, passing by
   iniquity, transgression, and sin--and faithful to His people even when
   they are unfaithful to Him! Is there any god like our God? Have you
   ever tasted His Grace? Do you know His pardoning love? Have you ever
   been brought back to Him? Have you been restored to His favor? Then I
   am sure you can say, "There is none like unto Jehovah."

   21, 22. And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, says the
   LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the
   earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall
   hear Jezreel. God would send rain when it was needed. He would be all
   ear to hear on behalf of His people. He would not only hear them, but
   hear the very earth they tilled, and the heavens above their heads, as
   if Nature, itself, began to pray when the child of God learned that
   holy art!

   23. And I will sow her unto Me in the earth. He would make the people
   to be like the seed which He, Himself, would sow, and cause to spring
   up and abide.

   23. And I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy. I would
   like to read that again. Somebody has, perhaps, come in here, tonight,
   who has never obtained mercy. Perhaps you have been seeking it and you
   have not found it. Hear God's promise, and lay hold upon it--"I will
   have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy."

   23. And I will say to them which were not My people, You are My people;
   and they shall say, You are my God. See, it is all in, "shalls," and,
   "wills!" God is speaking! God Omnipotent, Omnipotent over men's hearts.
   He is not saying, "I will if they will," but, "I will, and they shall,"
   for He has the key of free agency--and when He turns it in the lock,
   without violating the free will of man, He makes him willing in the day
   of His power to the praise of His Divine supremacy, for God is God when
   He saves as much as when He reigns! Yes, His reigning Grace is the very
   glory of His Nature, and this we love and adore. Grant us a taste of
   it! Amen.

Saints Guarded From Stumbling

   (No. 2296)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and forever. Amen." Jude 1:24,25.

   THE point and pith of what I may have to say will lie in the alteration
   of this text caused by the revision of the New Testament. The Revised
   Version runs thus, "Now unto Him that is able to guard you from
   stumbling.''" I am not going to speak at any length upon the rest of
   the text, but shall dwell mainly upon this remarkable alteration, which
   certainly gives the meaning of the original better than the rendering
   in the Authorized Version.

   To begin, then, here is a doxology. Jude is writing upon very practical
   subjects, indeed. His short Epistle is of the most practical kind, but
   he cannot finish it without a doxology of praise. Is there any work
   which we should complete without praise to God? Prayer should always
   have praise mingled with it. The preaching of the Gospel, or the
   writing of it. The teaching of the young and every other form of
   Christian service should be combined with the spirit of praise. I think
   that I may say of praise what we read of salt in the Old
   Testament--"salt without prescribing how much." You cannot have too
   much of praise! "With all your offerings you shall offer salt," and,
   "with all your offerings you shall offer praise." It seems delightful
   to me to notice how the Apostle Paul stops almost in the midst of a
   sentence to bow his knees and utter a doxology of praise to his God.
   And here Jude, with burning words denouncing sin, and urging Believers
   to purity, cannot conclude his Epistle without saying, "Now unto Him
   that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless
   before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise
   God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and
   forever. Amen."

   Beloved Friends, we may well continue to praise God, for our God
   continues to give us causes for praise! If we will only think, we shall
   begin to thank! If we will only consider, even, the mercies of the
   present, we shall break out with ascriptions of praise to Him. At this
   very moment, every Believer here has a reason for a doxology. My text
   begins with, "Now," and closes with, "now and forever." The praise of
   God should be given at the present time and it is to be perpetually
   carried on--therefore now is the time for it to be rendered--"both now
   and forever. Amen."

   Consider, then, dear Brother or Sister, you have at this moment a cause
   for ascribing praise to God, and you have this reason for it, at any
   rate, that He is able to guard you from stumbling--His ability is to be
   employed for your good! His power is intended for your keeping! Oh,
   sing unto the Lord a now song, tonight, with heart and soul bless Him
   who is able to guard you from stumbling and to present you faultless
   before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy!

   I. Coming to the text at once, I shall notice, first, THE DANGER TO BE
   DREADED. It is "stumbling." What is

   that?

   Well, first of all, it is a lesser form of falling. A horse may stumble
   and not fall--yet it is a sort of falling. If there is much stumbling,
   it will be a fall! Now, there are faults to which the child of God is
   very liable, which do not amount to actual falling--but they are
   stumblings. Like David, we have to say, "My feet were almost gone; my
   steps had well near slipped." We are not actually down, but it is a
   wonder that we are not. We have not broken our knees, but we were
   within an inch of doing so! A little more and we would have fallen to
   our serious hurt. The text speaks of, "Him that is able to guard you
   from stumbling"--to preserve you from the smallest form of grieving the
   Spirit, or the faintest trace of sin which would not amount to a fall.
   The Lord can keep you from that which is not a fall, but which might
   lead to it. I want to set a high standard before you tonight. Jude does
   not say that you are able to guard yourselves from stumbling,

   for you are not--but the ascription of praise is to Him who is able to
   guard you, even, from stumbling, and to present you, not only pardoned,
   but faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy!

   Stumbling is, next, not only a form of falling, and a matter,
   therefore, to be grieved over, but it is a prelude to falling.
   Oftentimes we first stumble and then, after a while, down we go! If we
   could recover ourselves from the stumble, we should not have to gather
   ourselves up from the fall. Long before the child of God falls into
   public sin and injures his character, those who watch him will have
   perceived his stumbling. He stayed up, just stayed up--but you wondered
   that he did. He kept on, perhaps for months, but as you looked at him,
   you said to yourself, "I am afraid that he will come to something
   worse. I feel sure that he will have a stumble, and another stumble,
   and then another stumble. And he will be down, by-and-by." Oh, that a
   child of God could notice his own stumblings! Then he would soon be
   delivered from them! But it is too often with us, to change the
   metaphor, as Hosea says, "Gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet
   he knows it not." He is getting feeble, he is becoming prematurely old,
   but he has not seen the change in the color of his hair! He has not
   looked in the glass of the Word lately, so he is unconscious that he is
   declining. If Satan cannot conquer Mansoul by storming it, he sometimes
   triumphs by sapping and mining, gradually undermining the walls and
   getting a secret entrance in that way. May the Lord make us very
   watchful--that we may not be ignorant of Satan's devices--and may our
   Savior guard us, even, from stumbling--for then we shall be kept from
   falling!

   I think that I can put this matter pretty plainly. You must have known,
   you must have read of, or you must have seen some people whom you
   believe to be true and real Christians. And in their lives there is
   nothing glaringly wrong, nothing that is so offensive that they can be
   excluded from the Church, or for which their Christian friends would
   condemn them as hypocrites. Yet, somehow, their lives are, to say the
   least, questionable, doubtful. There is good in them, but that good is
   blotted. We trust that there is in them a true desire to be right, but
   there are so many sad failures in their lives that they seem to stumble
   to Heaven rather than to run there! Now, our desire is that our life
   may not be of that kind and, therefore, we would lay hold upon this
   text and plead it before the Throne of God, "Lord, You are able to
   guard us from stumbling, be pleased to do so, to the praise of the
   glory of Your Grace!"

   You will see that stumbling is itself a form of evil, if you think of
   another phase of it. There were some who stumbled at the doctrine of
   Christ in His own day. He had a number of followers who kept with Him
   up to a certain point. But when the Savior said, "Except you eat the
   flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you have no life in you,"
   they went back and walked no more with Him. They could not understand
   what He meant and they murmured, saying, "How can this Man give us His
   flesh to eat?" So, being staggered and stumbled at the depth of this
   great mystery, they turned aside and walked no more with Him.

   Beloved, we need God so to uphold us and guard us that, whatever the
   teaching of His Holy Word may be, we shall receive it without a doubt.
   I know that there are some Christian people who stumble at one
   doctrine, especially if they hear somebody denounce it. And there are
   others who are staggered at another doctrine because they have met some
   very wise man who knows better than the Word of God and says that it
   cannot be true! In these days there is very great liability to this
   kind of stumbling, especially among Christians who do not read their
   Bibles much--and, I am sorry to say, that there are plenty of such
   Christians! They read magazines, or perhaps works of fiction, rather
   than the sure Word of God! And they are thus easily caught in the snare
   of the fowler.

   Many professing Christians do not know what God's Word really teaches,
   so they are not established in the faith. They do not know, even, the
   elements of the doctrines of Christ--they have not examined the
   immutable foundations of the faith--and they are staggered. And truly,
   the mysteries of the Kingdom of God are so deep, and the teachings of
   Christ are so contrary to the reasonings of flesh and blood, that we
   need not wonder if some are stumbled! Let us cry to Him who is able to
   guard us from stumbling that, with steady step, we may press on in the
   way of life and never be ashamed of the Truth of God, lest the Truth of
   God should be ashamed of us! Let us believe what the Bible says,
   however difficult the believing may be, because God has said it! This
   should always stand for us as the grand master argument-- not the
   reasonableness of the doctrine, not because it commends itself to our
   judgement--but the fact that God has said it! That ends all debate.
   Christ is able to guard from stumbling as to doctrine.

   Many others are stumbled at the Cross. Strange to say, the Cross of
   Christ has always been the stumbling stone to the ungodly and to mere
   professors. What? The Cross of Christ an occasion of stumbling? Why, it
   is the very center of Apostolic teaching--"We preach Christ Crucified."
   Nowadays, there are two great points of attack--the one is the Inspira-

   tion of Scripture--and the other is the Substitutionary work of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. The enemies of the Cross will not have a crucified
   Savior! They stumble at that which is the very foundation of our faith!
   The Lord will keep us from stumbling at Christ's Cross, I am quite
   sure. It is the rock of our refuge, the pillar of our hope!

   The Cross that Christ carried involves one for us to carry. No sooner
   does a Christian man become a Believer and confesses Christ in Baptism,
   than he is sure to meet with some who straightway revile him. He has to
   take up his cross. A working man among skeptical companions, a young
   girl in a book-folding warehouse, a wife who has an ungodly husband--as
   soon as they come out boldly on the side of Christ, straightway they
   have a cross to carry--and this causes a great many to stumble.
   Persecution and ridicule are too much for them--by-and-by they are
   offended--that is, they stumble at the Cross. They would have Christ,
   but not any shame for Christ's sake! They are like Mr. Pliable, who set
   out to go to the Celestial City, but when he tumbled into the Slough of
   Despond with Christian, he said that if he could only get out on the
   side nearest to his own house, Christian might have the Celestial City
   all to himself, for he could not go through a slough to get there! How
   many there are of this kind--fearful ones--cowardly ones! But there is
   a God who is able to guard us from stumbling and I trust that He will
   do so. May we never be stumbled by anything that happens to us for
   Christ's sake! May we take joyfully the spoiling of our goods, if need
   be--yes, and suffer death itself if it should ever come to that--sooner
   than turn aside from bearing the Cross after the crucified Christ!

   And this stumbling sometimes happens not only at the doctrine of Christ
   and at His Cross, but at the precepts He has given. If we are to be
   Christ's, we must obey Him. "You call Me Master and Lord: and you say
   well; for so I am." But one will stagger at one command of Christ and
   another at another! Though Christ bids us love one another, there are
   some who can do anything but love. They can give their bodies to be
   burned, but they have no charity. When Christ bids us walk in integrity
   before all mankind, there are some who can do many good things, but
   they like little sly practices in trade--and they stumble at Christ
   because of those evil ways. You know there are many ways in which
   people try to be as little Christians as they can be, so as just to get
   into Heaven. Miserable wretches, they want to save their souls and yet,
   after all, to follow the ways of the world! So they stumble at the
   precepts of the Holy Christ. They cannot put up with commands like His
   which lay the axe at the root of the tree. If you are kept by Him who
   is able to guard you from stumbling, you will love every way of Christ,
   and every Word of Christ, and your prayer will be, "Teach me Your
   statutes," and your heart will willingly obey every precept of the
   Lord!

   Once more, there are some who are staggered by the experience of
   Believers. I speak, now, especially to young beginners. You have begun
   to be believers in Christ and you have been very, very happy. I am very
   glad that you are. Long may your happiness continue! But there is
   another who has been, perhaps, in the way of the Lord for a few months,
   and suddenly a depression of spirit has come over him and he says to
   himself, "Oh, dear me, is this the way of God's people?" I remember
   that within a week after I had found joy and peace in believing, I
   began to feel the uprisings of inbred sin and I cried out, "O wretched
   man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" I did
   not know that such a sigh and cry could never come out of an
   unbelieving heart--that there must be a new heart and a right spirit
   within the man to whom sin is a burden and who loathes it. I did not
   know that, then, and I wondered whether I could be a child of God at
   all! Oh, there are strange experiences for those who are on the road to
   Heaven! You remember how John Newton sings--

   "I asked the Lord that I might grow

   In faith, and love, and every Grace

   Might more of His salvation know,

   And seek more earnestly His face.

   I hoped that in some favored hour

   At once He'd answer my request,

   And by His love's constraining power,

   Subdue my sins, and give me rest.

   Instead of this He made me feel

   The hidden evils of my heart,

   And let the angry powers of Hell

   Assault my soul in every part."

   The good man began to discover more and more his own sinfulness and he
   said, "Lord, is this the way to holiness?" and he was stumbled for a
   moment.

   O Beloved, it is only the Grace of God that can make us feel that
   whatever experiences we have within us, our faith looks to a living
   Christ who never changes--and we rest in His finished work! Whether we
   are up or whether we are down, whether we sing or whether we sigh, we
   look beyond our changing moods unto Him who loved us and gave Himself
   for us! Yet many have been stumbled by their own inner experiences, not
   understanding them. There is only One who can guard us from such
   stumblings.

   So, then, dear Friends, to close this description of stumbling, if we
   are guarded from stumbling we shall certainly be kept from falling.
   This is an inclusive blessing. It includes preservation from falling
   into outward sin and, especially all final falling, all fatal falling!
   Christ is able to guard us from stumbling--much more is He able to
   preserve us from falling away, from utterly departing from the faith.
   But we would do that if it were not for His guardian care. There is
   nothing that the worst of men have done which the best of men could not
   do if they were left by the Grace of God! Do not think so much of
   yourself as to imagine yourself incapable of even the greatest crime.
   That very thought proves that you are capable of committing any crime.
   I think that it is Mr. Cecil who says, "I thought myself humble, one
   day, when I said that I did wonder that I should have sinned as I had
   done in such a way. Whereas," he said, "if I had been truly humble, I
   should not have wondered that I sinned like that! I should have
   wondered at the Grace of God that kept me from even greater sin! And I
   should have understood that my natural tendencies all went towards
   evil--and that the marvel was that they did not master me and lead me
   farther into evil than I had gone."

   Oh, Beloved, we must be kept by God, Himself, or else stumbling,
   falling--foully and fatally falling--will be our lot! From that,
   however, the Lord will preserve us who are truly His. So much, then,
   upon the danger to be dreaded.

   II. Now, I must be somewhat more brief on the second point, THE
   PRIVILEGE TO BE ENJOYED--"Now unto Him that is able to guard you from
   stumbling."

   Well, beloved Friends, it is a great privilege to be guarded from
   stumbling, for it is a privilege that we greatly need. I was thinking
   of the many things that make us in danger of stumbling. There is,
   first, our weakness. It is the weak horse, you know, that stumbles and
   falls. It is out of condition, out of health--and down it goes. And we
   are weak, very weak. Then, consider the many roads that we have to
   travel. Here is a man who is a preacher, a husband, a father, a master.
   Some of you are tradesmen, or workmen and, beside your daily
   occupation, you have all your domestic relationships. Now, what you
   need is to be guarded all round from stumbling. We have heard of one
   who was all right at home, but he was very vulnerable outside his
   house. I have heard of another who was an excellent man in the Church,
   but if you had asked his wife about him, she would not have liked to
   describe him. A man may be a very good man at a Prayer Meeting, but he
   may be a very poor hand when you get him at his work. I have known some
   move very slowly, indeed, at that time--nobody would have liked to pay
   them by the day. Now, it is an evil thing when a Christian is bad
   anywhere, but it is a grand thing--and only God can enable us to attain
   to it--when we do not stumble in any one of the ways which we have to
   go, but are always kept walking uprightly.

   And then, you know, it is the pace that makes some people stumble. See
   the pace we have to go at now. When I think of our dear old fathers in
   the country, I almost envy their quiet lives--not up too early, and
   seldom going to bed very late--not much to do, leading very steady sort
   of lives. They traveled by broad-wheeled wagons, and we fly over the
   ground by express trains--and need to go twice as quickly as we
   can--and all the while we have so much to do.

   And, then, it is not only the pace, dear Friends, but it is the loads
   that some of you have to carry. Oh, the weights that are piled upon
   some of God's people in their business! Only God can keep an overloaded
   heart from stumbling and the ways are very rough just now. You hardly
   meet anybody in trade who does not say, "Ah, we have a rough bit of
   ground to travel over now--stones in plenty, and no steam roller!" But
   there is One who is able to keep you from falling.

   Perhaps there are some of you who have not to travel over a rough bit
   of road. Your path is very smooth, you have all that heart can wish for
   and every comfort that you could desire. You need to be guarded from
   stumbling, for you are on a very slippery road. If there has been a
   thaw and then a frost comes on at night, the road may be very pretty to
   look at, but it is very bad for a horse's feet, and so prosperity is a
   very slippery way for God's people. The Lord must keep them from
   falling or they will go down with a crash.

   Then there is the length of the road as well as the other things I have
   mentioned. If we had to serve God only for a short time, one might
   easily do it, but we may have to go on for 50 years, 60 years, 70
   years, 80 years. I think, some-

   times, that if martyr days were to come, and they would burn me
   quickly, I could endure it. But it would be a terrible trial to be
   roasted on a slow fire! Yet our lives are often so prolonged and filled
   with trial and temptation, that it is like being roasted alive by a
   slow fire. The road is long and the pace has become very trying, so we
   may easily stumble. But the text gives us good cheer, for it tells us
   of Him that is able to guard us from stumbling.

   It is not only necessary for us to be kept, but it is very gracious on
   Christ's part to keep us. Beloved, what if you should have this text
   fulfilled in you, so that, through a long and trying life, you should
   so live that when your enemies wanted to find fault with you, they
   would not know where to begin? Live so that if they look you up and
   down, they will have to say of you as they said of Daniel, "We shall
   not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against
   him concerning the Law of his God." Oh, if you should go down to the
   grave faultless--not that we can, any of us, be in ourselves faultless
   in the sight of God--but if you live such blameless lives that no one
   shall be able to say evil of you, but shall be compelled to confess
   that in you the life of Christ has been reflected in your measure, what
   a privilege it will be! And this is the privilege set before you in the
   text--that you shall not be stumbled.

   What distress you will be saved from if you are guarded from stumbling!
   A stumbling Christian has to be a sorrowing Christian. When a child of
   God stumbles, and knows it, he very soon takes to weeping and humbling
   himself in the Presence of his God. But if you are kept by the Grace of
   God, you will be saved from many a bitter pang, and helped to go from
   joy to joy and Grace to Grace.

   What a blessing such a person is to other people in the Church of God!
   Without saying anything against our fellow Christians, we know where
   our respect and confidence usually go. When we have seen Brothers and
   Sisters who have been upheld and sustained in trial and temptation, and
   have not stumbled, we take delight in them! Those of us who are younger
   and weaker, go and hide, as it were, under the shadow of their wings.

   And what a blessing such people are to the world! Those are the true
   saints who help to spread the Gospel of Christ! A holy life is a
   missionary enterprise. An unstumbling life is an incentive to others to
   run along the heavenly road, trusting in the Divine Power to guard
   them, also, from stumbling!

   Best of all that I have to say is this, that this privilege is
   attainable--"Unto Him that is able to guard you from stumbling." "Oh!"
   says one, "if I just get to Heaven, it will satisfy me." Will it? I
   pray you, do not talk so. Just to get in, like a tempest-tossed boat,
   water-logged, or like a wreck just towed into the harbor--well, it is a
   great mercy to get to Heaven anyway--but that is a poor way of getting
   in! Better would it be to steam into the harbor with a fall cargo and
   plenty of passengers on board, and all the flags flying to the honor of
   the Great King and Pilot who has guarded you through the storm, that,
   "so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
   everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."

   May it be so with you! Oh, that we may not have to send off the tugs
   and tow you into the harbor, but that, instead thereof, you may come in
   with a fleet of little ships behind you, able to say, "Here am I, and
   the children that You have given me"! This is a privilege worth having,
   but it cannot be attained except through Him who is able to guard you
   from stumbling.

   III. Now I will lead you on, in the third place, with great brevity, to
   remember THE POWER WHICH BESTOWS THIS PRIVILEGE.

   To be guarded from stumbling throughout a long life, is not of
   ourselves. It is not to be found in our own experience--not even in the
   means of Grace alone. That same power that made the heavens and the
   earth, and keeps the earth and heavens in their places, is needed to
   make a Christian, and to keep him standing before the sons of men.

   "Unto Him that is able to guard you from stumbling." God has this
   power. He has power over all circumstances. He can so arrange the
   trials of your life that you shall never be tempted beyond what you are
   able to bear. He has power, also, over Satan, so that, when he desires
   to sift you as wheat, the Lord can keep him back. God will not allow
   him to overcome you.

   Best of all, God has power over our hearts. He can keep us alive with
   holy zeal. He can keep us so believing, so loving, so hoping, so
   watching, so fully obedient that we shall not stumble at His Word, or
   stumble at anything else.

   Jude speaks of "the only wise God," so that, God's power is joined with
   wisdom. He knows your weakness and He can guard you against it. He
   knows your tempters and He can thrust them aside, or help you to
   overcome them. It is the wise

   God, as well as the strong God, who is able to guard you from
   stumbling. He knows where the stumbling stones are and where your
   weakness is--and He can and He will bring you safely through.

   Yet once more, the One who guards us from stumbling is our Savior as
   well as the only wise God. It is His business to save you. It is His
   office to save you--and save you He will! Commit yourself tonight to
   His guardian care, and walk with him. That is a high favor, that you
   may not only be kept from falling, but even be guarded from stumbling,
   to the praise and glory of His Grace.

   I have been very brief where I should have liked to enlarge.

   IV. I finish with this point, THE GLORY WHICH IS DUE TO CHRIST FOR THIS
   PRIVILEGE. If we are guarded from stumbling, we may take no credit to
   ourselves, but we must lay the crown at the feet of Him to whom the
   power belongs.

   If He has kept us from stumbling until now, let us praise Him for the
   past! Oh, what a mercy to have had this keeping year after year!
   Notwithstanding many imperfections and follies, which we have had to
   confess, yet we have been kept from any grievous stumbling that would
   have dishonored the holy name of Christ! Bless God, tonight, that you
   have been kept from stumbling, today. I do not know where you have
   been, but I have no doubt you have been where you might have slipped if
   you had been left by the Spirit of God! You have been in the shop. You
   have been in the home. You have been in the street. You have been on
   the Exchange. You have been among ungodly men. Yes, and even among
   Christian men, you can soon commit yourself and trip up. If you have
   been kept, today, do not say, "How good I am!" No, no, no! Say, "Now
   unto Him who has guarded me from stumbling, be glory and majesty,
   dominion and power, both now and forever."

   Now, will you begin to praise Him for the future as well? You have not
   experienced it, yet, but remember that verse which we often sing--

   "And a new song is in my mouth, To long-loved music set! Glory to You
   for all the Grace I have not tasted yet."

   Begin to thank the Lord that He will keep you from falling in the
   future! Bless Him that He will present you faultless before the
   Presence of His Glory with exceeding joy.

   And the next time that danger comes to you, praise Him that He can
   guard you from stumbling. Tomorrow morning, perhaps, you have a
   difficult task before you. You are looking forward, in the course of
   the week, to something that will be very trying. Well, praise God now,
   that He is able to guard you from stumbling! But oh, what a song we
   will give Him when we are once over the river! When we climb the
   celestial hills, when we enter Heaven and find ourselves among the
   white-robed, blood-washed throng, I wonder which of us will praise Him
   most? Well, let us not wait till then, but let us begin here--let us
   rehearse the music of the spheres now! Let us say, "Now unto Him that
   is able to guard us from stumbling, be glory and majesty, dominion and
   power, both now and forever."

   This sermon does not belong to all of you, I am sorry to say. I wish
   that it did, but remember, dear Hearer, that He who can keep the saint
   from stumbling can bring the sinner into the right way! The same Grace
   that can preserve the child of God from falling into sin can bring you
   out of sin! And as we have to look wholly to Christ, certainly you must
   do so. May the Lord lead you to look, tonight, out of yourself, your
   feelings and your works and trust to the Lord Jesus, who died, but
   lives again, and lives to save guilty men!

   Whoever believes in Him has everlasting life and He will bring them
   into His way! And He will keep them from stumbling and present them
   among the rest of His blood-washed, to praise His name forever. The
   Lord bless this meditation for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. PSALM91.

   Verse 1.--He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall
   abide under the shadow of the Almighty. It is not every man who dwells
   there, no, not even every Christian. There are some who come to God's
   House, but the man mentioned here dwells with the God of the House!
   There are some who worship in the outer court of the Temple, but, "he

   that dwells in the secret place of the Most High" lives in the Holy of
   Holies--he draws near to the Mercy Seat and stays there! He walks in
   the Light, as God is in the light. He is not one who is sometimes on
   and sometimes off, a stranger or a guest, but like a child at home he
   dwells in the secret place of the Most High. Oh, labor to get to that
   blessed position! You who know the Lord, pray that you may attain to
   this high condition of dwelling in the inner shrine, always near God,
   always overshadowed by those cherubic wings which indicate the Presence
   of God. If this is your position, you "shall abide under the shadow of
   the Almighty." You are not safe in the outer courts. You are not
   protected from all danger anywhere but within the veil. Let us come
   boldly there and, when we once enter, let us dwell there.

   2. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in
   Him will I trust. This is a daring utterance, as if the Psalmist would
   claim for himself the choicest privileges of any child of God. When you
   hear a glorious doctrine preached, it may be very sweet to others, but
   the honey lies in the particular application of it to yourself. You
   must, like the bee, go down into the bell of the flower, yourself, and
   fetch out its nectar. "I will say of the Lord, He is my"--then come
   three "mys", as if the Psalmist could grasp the Triune Jehovah--"my
   refuge, my fortress, my God: in Him will I trust." What a grand word
   that is, "My God"! Can any language be loftier? Can any thought be more
   profound? Can any comfort be surer?

   3. Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler. If you
   dwell near to God, you will not be deceived by Satan. In the Light of
   the Lord you will see light and you will discover the limed twigs and
   the nets and the traps that are set to catch you--"He shall deliver you
   from the snare of the fowler."

   3. And from the noisome pestilence. The pestilence is something that
   you cannot see. It comes creeping in and fills the air with death
   before you perceive its approach. But, "He shall deliver you from the
   noisome pestilence." There is a pestilence of dangerous and accursed
   error abroad at this time--but if we dwell in the secret place of the
   Most High, it cannot affect us--we shall be beyond its power! "Surely,"
   oh, blessed word! there is no doubt about this great Truth of God,
   "Surely, He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the
   noisome pestilence."

   4. He shall cover you with His feathers. The Psalmist uses a wonderful
   metaphor when he ascribes "feathers" to God and compares Him to a hen,
   or some mother bird, under whose wings her young find shelter. Yet the
   condescension of God is such that He allows us to speak of Him
   thus--"He shall cover you with His feathers."

   4. And under His wings shall you trust. God is to His people a strong
   defense and a tender defense. "His wings" and "His feathers" suggest
   both power and softness. God hides not His people in a casing of
   iron--their shelter is stronger than iron--yet it is soft as the downy
   wings of a bird for ease and comfort. As the little chicks bury their
   tiny heads in the feathers of the hen and seem happy, and warm, and
   comfortable under their mother's wings, so shall it be with you if you
   dwell with your God--"He shall cover you with His feathers, and under
   His wings shall you trust."

   4. His Truth shall be your shield and buckler. Twice is he armed who
   has God's Truth to be his shield and buckler.

   5. You shall not be afraid for the terror by night. Nervous as you are,
   and naturally timid, when you dwell near to God, your fears shall all
   go to sleep. That is a wonderful promise--"You shall not be afraid." If
   it had said, "You shall have no cause for fear," it would have been a
   very comforting word, but this is even more cheering! "You shall not be
   afraid for the terror by night."

   5. Nor for the arrow that flies by day. Both night and day you shall be
   safe. Your God will not leave you in the glare of the sun, nor will He
   forsake you when the dampness of night dews would put you in peril. We,
   dear Friends, may have secret enemies, who shoot at us, but we shall
   not be afraid of the arrow! There may be unseen influences that would
   ruin us, or cause us dishonor, or distress--but when we dwell with God,
   we shall not be afraid of them.

   6, 7. Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the
   destruction that wastes at noonday. A thousand shall fall at your side,
   and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you.
   When God takes His people to dwell in nearness to Himself and they have
   faith in this promise, I make no doubt that, literally, in the time of
   actual pestilence, they will be preserved! It is not every professing
   Christian, nor every Believer who attains this height of experience,
   but only such as believe the promise and fulfill the heavenly condition
   of dwelling in the secret place of the Most High. How could cholera or
   fever get into the secret place of the Most High? How could any arrows,
   how could any pestilence, ever be able to reach that secure abode of
   God? If you dwell there, you are invincible, invulnerable, infinitely
   secure!

   8-10. Only with your eyes shall you behold and see the reward of the
   wicked. Because you have made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
   Most High, your habitation; there shall no evil befall you. "There
   shall no evil befall you." It may

   have the appearance of evil, but it shall turn out to your good. There
   shall be but the appearance of evil, not the reality of it--"There
   shall no evil befall you."

   10, 11. Neither shall any plague come near your dwelling. For He shall
   give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. You
   remember how the devil misapplied this text to Christ. He was quite
   right in the application, but he was quite wrong in the quotation, for
   he left out the words, "in all your ways." God will help us in our ways
   if we keep in His ways. When we meet with trouble and Providence, we
   ought to enquire whether we are in God's way. That famous old Puritan,
   holy Mr. Dodd, having to cross a river, had to change from one boat
   into another and, being little used to the water, he fell in, and, when
   he was pulled out, in his simplicity and wisdom, he said, "I hope that
   I am in my way." That was the only question that seemed to trouble him.
   If I am in my way, then God will keep me. We ought to ask ourselves,
   "Now, am I in God's way? Am I really moving, today, and acting, today,
   as Divine Providence leads me, and as duty calls me?" He who travels on
   the king's business, by daylight, along the king's highway, may be sure
   of the king's protection. "He shall give His angels charge over you, to
   keep you in all your ways." Come here, Gabriel, Michael, and all the
   rest of you," says the great King of Kings to the angels around His
   Throne. And when they come at His call, He says, "Take care of My
   child. Watch over him, today. He will be in peril--suffer no evil to
   come near him."

   12. They shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot
   against a stone. What royal protection we have, a guard of angels, who
   count it their delight and their honor to wait upon the seed-royal of
   the universe, for such are all the saints of God!

   13. You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
   dragon shall you trample under feet. Strength and mastery may be
   united--"The young lion and the dragon"--but the child of God shall
   overcome them. Talk of St. George and the dragon! We ought to think
   more of the saint and the dragon! It is he that dwells in the secret
   place of the Most High, who, by God's help, treads upon the lion and
   adder and of whom it is written, "The young lion and the dragon shall
   you trample under feet."

   14. Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him.
   Does God take notice of our poor love? Oh, yes, He values the love of
   His people, for He knows where it came from--it is a part of His own
   love--the creation of His Grace!

   14. I will set him on high, because he has known My name. Does God
   value such feeble and imperfect knowledge of His name as we possess?
   Yes, and He rewards that knowledge--"I will set him on high."

   15. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him. Notice, that it is,
   "He shall," and, "I will." The mighty Grace of God "shall" make us
   pray, and the Almighty God of Grace "will" answer our prayer--"He shall
   call upon Me, and I will answer him." How I love these glorious shalls
   and wills!

   15. I will be with him in trouble. "Whatever that trouble is, I will be
   with him in it. If he is dishonored, if he is in poverty, if he is in
   sickness, if that sickness should drive his best friend away from his
   bed, still, 'I will be with him in trouble.'"

   15. I will deliver him, and honor him. God puts honor upon us, poor
   dishonorable worms that we are! One old Divine calls a man, "a worm six
   feet long," and it is rather a flattering description of him, don't you
   think? But God says, "I will deliver him, and honor him."

   16. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him My salvation. He
   will live as long as he wants to live. Even if he should have but few
   years, yet he shall have a long life, for life is to be measured by the
   life that is in it, not by the length along which it drags. Still,
   God's children live to a far longer age than any other people in the
   world. They are, on the whole, a long-lived race. They who fear God are
   delivered from the vices which would deprive them of the vigor of
   life-- and the joy and contentment they have in God help them to live
   longer than others. I have often noticed how long God's people live.
   Some of them are speedily taken Home--still, this text is, as a rule,
   literally fulfilled, "With long life will I satisfy him, and show him
   My salvation." He shall see God's salvation even here! And when he
   dies, and wakes up in the likeness of his Lord, he will see it to the
   fullest. May that be the portion of each of us! Amen.

Sealed and Open Evidences

   (No. 2297)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; Take these deeds, this
   deed of the purchase, which is sealed, and this deed which is open; and
   put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days." Jeremiah
   32:14.

   THE discourse of this evening is suggested by the transaction of
   Jeremiah with his uncle's son in the purchase of a field at Anathoth
   which he conducted in a business-like and legal way. I will begin with
   just a few remarks upon the transaction itself.

   Jeremiah was called to forego the comforts of the present for the
   blessings of the future. He was a poor man and he was shut up in
   prison. A little money must have been a very great thing to him at such
   a time--even food could not be purchased during the siege except at
   fabulous prices--and his allowance was very small. Yet he paid down 17
   shekels of silver--not a great sum in itself, but very great to him in
   such circumstances--to buy the field which, as I said in the
   exposition, he could not go and see, for he was a prisoner, and which
   he could not have reached even if he had been free, for it was in the
   hand of the Chaldeans and laid desolate by the invading army. He was
   commanded by the Lord to buy a field which, speaking after the manner
   of men, was on the moon! It was what we call, "an estate in Spain,"
   which Jeremiah could not possibly visit, but because he had God's
   orders to buy it, he did buy it and he paid the purchase money right
   cheerfully.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, this is exactly what we have to do--we have
   to pawn the present for the future! We must be satisfied to give up
   anything which Christ may require of us for the sake of that which is
   yet to come. Our inheritance is not on this side of Jordan. Our joy is
   yet to be revealed. I grant you that we have much thrown in, for the
   Lord is a good Paymaster, but on the road to Heaven He gives us only
   our spending money. Our inheritance is in the land of the hereafter, in
   the regions of the blessed--and we must not look for it here--this is
   not our rest! It is worth while to give up a great deal that belongs to
   the present for the eternal inheritance which is yet to be ours. "There
   remains a rest to the people of God." And if ever it should come to
   this, that your present comfort, yes, and your present life, must be
   given up for the sake of the land of promise and the Covenant heritage,
   make no delay. Do not hesitate for a moment, but yield everything up,
   that the greater blessings of the future may be assuredly yours.

   My second remark is that, when a man acts by faith, he ought still to
   act in a clear, business-like way. We who believe in God are no fools.
   Some may think that we are; but they would not find us to be so if they
   had to deal with us in matters requiring judgment and consideration.
   Jeremiah buys the field in the presence of witnesses, weighs the money,
   and has the purchase deed drawn up, and the counterpart of the deed,
   all after a legal manner, just as Abraham did when he bought the field
   of Machpelah from the sons of Heth. That passage in Genesis is an
   ancient legal document, containing just such words as you would find in
   an Oriental purchase deed of the present day. The man of God counts
   things, which to others are dreams, as realities, and he treats them as
   such.

   Faith is sanctified commonsense. It believes in God--is that stupidity?
   It believes in God's promises--is that foolishness? It believes that
   God will keep His Word--is that a folly? If so, we purpose to be more
   foolish, still, but, knowing that it is not folly, but truest wisdom,
   we act in this case as we act in other matters and we make sure as far
   as we can. "Fast bind, fast find," says our proverb and, therefore, we
   exercise in the things of God that discretion and prudence which we use
   in the things of men. Faith is not folly--and the Believer must not, in
   anything, act like a fool!

   Perhaps you might wonder why Jeremiah, whose business it was to
   prophesy, should be set to buy land? There is nothing like division of
   labor. Let the politician attend to politics, let the keeper of a
   theater supply amusement to the people who want it--and let the
   Christian minister keep to his preaching. Yes, but Jeremiah was
   commanded by God to do this because he was really preaching by what he
   did! The preacher must believe in what he preaches and it may be that
   he will be called to do something which will be, to his people, the
   best possible proof that he really does believe it. Jeremiah believes
   that the city, though it was to be destroyed, would afterwards be
   rebuilt and that land would be valuable, trade would be restored and
   agriculture would again flourish. He has said this--he has now to prove
   it. The few shekels that he has, he must invest in a bit of land which
   is worth nothing, today, but may be worth a good deal, if not to
   himself, yet to his heirs. He must buy the field to prove his
   sincerity!

   Oh, Beloved, if we are called to preach, we must believe what we
   preach, or else we had better give it up! "I believed, therefore have I
   spoken," is a text which should be written over every minister's study
   door, and over his pulpit, too. What have we to say if we have a doubt
   about it? How can we move others if we have no fulcrum for our lever,
   if we are not, ourselves, sure and certain? If there is no element of
   dogmatism in our message because of our confidence concerning what we
   have to deliver, in God's name, let us go to bed and hold our tongues
   until we believe it! The monk that shook the world owed his power,
   under God, to the fact that the world could not shake him! Martin
   Luther believed with an unshakable faith and, therefore, he had power
   over others. God called Jeremiah to effect the purchase of this little
   estate to prove to the people that he believed what he preached!

   And now, leaving Jeremiah, I am going to make a parable, not to bring
   out what the text teaches, but to use it parable-wise. When he bought
   this piece of land, it was transferred to him by two documents. The
   first was a purchase deed, drawn up and signed by witnesses and then
   sealed up, not to be opened, anymore, unless required to settle a
   dispute. That was his real purchase or title deed. Then there was a
   counterpart of this transfer made and signed by witnesses. This was not
   rolled up and it was not sealed--but it was left open so that Jeremiah
   might refer to it and that, when desired, the open deed might be read
   and examined by others. It is not at all a bad custom and one which we,
   to a large extent, follow, that there should be two deeds of transfer,
   the one to be kept and laid up by itself, only to be opened in case of
   litigation, or absolute necessity--the other being the certified
   copy--the open deed or evidence for daily use if anybody wished to
   examine it and see how the property had been transferred.

   Now, with regard to our redemption, our inheritance which Christ has
   bought for us at an immense price, we, too, have two sets of deeds or
   evidences. The one is sealed up from all eyes but our own. In part,
   too, I might say that it is sealed up from our own eyes. The other, the
   counterpart of that, equally valid, is open to ourselves and open to
   others. So I shall talk, first, about the sealed evidences of our
   faith. And, secondly, about the open evidences of our faith. And, then,
   thirdly, about the use of these two sets of evidences. May the Holy
   Spirit make us wise to speak things to edification and to heart
   searching, as He, alone, can!

   I. First, then, I want you to think a little OF THE SEALED EVIDENCES OF
   OUR FAITH, the evidences which are sealed, at least in a measure, from
   our fellow men.

   And, first, I would say, among the sealed evidences is this--the Word
   of the Lord has come to us with power. If anyone asked himself, "Have I
   a right to the Covenant of Grace and to the 'all things' which are ours
   if we are in that Covenant? Have I a right to the purchased possession?
   Have I a right to the Lord Jesus Christ and all that comes to Believers
   in Him?" In part, the answer must be, "Has the Word of the Lord come to
   you with power, not as the word of man, but as it is in truth, the Word
   of God?" Some of my hearers will not understand what I am now saying. I
   noticed, in one of the daily papers, this remark about a sermon I
   preached a few Sunday mornings ago, "Mr. Spurgeon will admit that it
   needed an education to understand him." Yes, I do admit it. And I admit
   another thing, namely, that very many newspaper writers have not that
   education and that, therefore, they cannot understand what we preach.

   It is with our preaching of such things as it was with Dr. Hawker, when
   preaching at Plymouth. One of his members brought down from London a
   great scientist and he thought that the learned man would like to hear
   Dr. Hawker, the eminent preacher of the Gospel. The next morning, this
   member said to the doctor, "I brought So-and-So to hear you yesterday."
   "Did you?" "Yes. And what do you think he said, Dr. Hawker? He said
   that he did not understand a sentence of what you were talking about."
   "Did he?" said Dr. Hawker, "Well, there were lots of old women in the
   aisles who understood it all." They had been taught of God and the
   other person had not!

   Now, only he who has felt it will know what I mean by this
   expression--the Word of God has come with power to our soul! There is a
   mystic influence, a Divine unction which really goes with the Word of
   God, in many cases, so that it enters the heart, sheds a radiance upon
   the understanding, pours a flood of delightful peace and joy upon the
   soul--and affects the whole mental and spiritual being in a way which
   nothing else does! You cannot explain this to others! Do you know it
   yourself? If so, that will be to you the sealed evidence or deed that
   the eternal heritage is yours! The Lord has given you the spiritual
   perception of these things. You had no such faculty when He gave it to
   you, but He took you from being carnal, in which state you could not
   understand spiritual things, and he made you spiritual! And now His
   spiritual Truth has come with the demonstration of the Spirit to your
   heart and you now know, by a witness which you cannot communicate to
   anybody but yourself, that these things are so and that you have a part
   in them!

   The next one of these sealed evidences is this--if, indeed, this
   heavenly heritage is ours--we have a living faith in the Lord Jesus
   Christ. "As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
   sons of God, even to them that believe on His name." Unless fearfully
   deceived, some of us can say, tonight, that we are resting wholly upon
   Christ. We depend upon the blood of Christ for cleansing, the
   righteousness of Christ for clothing, the death of Christ to be the
   death of sin, and the life of Christ to be our life unto God! All that
   we have we derive from Him. As for myself, I have not a shadow of a
   shade of the ghost of a hope apart from the Person and work of the Lord
   Jesus Christ--and I know that many of you can say the same.

   Well now, the possession of that confidence, that child-like trust,
   that real faith, is an evidence to you that the heritage is yours.
   "Without faith, it is impossible to please God," but he that believes
   that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. He that accepts Christ and His
   great Sacrifice to be the one ground of his trust--and does this with
   all his heart and soul--has that sealed evidence which others cannot
   read, but which he may read with confidence, for Christ said, "He that
   hears My Word, and believes on Him that sent Me, has everlasting life."
   "He that believes on Him is not condemned." He is a justified man and,
   "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
   Jesus Christ."

   I can give you only just a hint or two upon these evidences. Another
   sealed evidence of our interest in Christ is that we have life in
   Jesus. Of this nobody but yourself can judge--and you must be sure to
   judge very carefully according to the Word of God. It is not the old
   life educated. It is not the old nature improved. It is a distinctly
   new life, so that you have hopes to which you once were strangers. You
   have fears which once never affected you. You have come into a new
   world--you are, indeed, born again! All around you seems new, it is
   with you as with one I spoke to the other day. She said to me, "Sir,
   either I am new, or else all the world is." And I said, "Yes, but the
   world is not new--that remains old." "Oh, but!" she replied, "my
   relation to it, my thoughts about it, my thoughts about everything are
   totally different from what they ever were before."

   You can tell if this change has been worked in you. If a horse could
   suddenly be inspired with mental faculty so as to be able to understand
   astronomy, what a new life it would be for it as it began to study the
   stars! Ah, but yours is a greater change than that! You have risen from
   the lower sphere of mere soulish life into the higher condition of
   spiritual life and now you consort with God, you speak with Christ, you
   have become familiar with heavenly things and are raised up to sit in
   the heavenlies with Christ Jesus! It is a new life altogether with you
   and you feel it beating within your soul. You cannot tell this to
   everybody. If you did, perhaps you would have your testimony received
   with a laugh. To yourself, however, it is a sealed evidence, but a very
   sure one.

   And this leads me to the fourth evidence, which is that we now have
   communion with God in prayer. Worldlings may pray after a sort, that
   is, they can utter a few good words, or repeat a form of prayer. But
   true Believers speak with God as a man speaks with his friend! We tell
   Him our daily troubles. We detail our needs, we express our joys.
   Prayer is, to us, a reality--and God hears it and He answers us--and
   gives us many evidences of His love in the answers to our prayers. Some
   of these we can tell to the praise of His Glory, but there are 10 times
   as many which we would not tell for all the world, for they are like
   love passages between two enamored souls--they are too precious to be
   whispered to other ears! It would be casting pearls before swine if the
   spiritual man, who dwells with God, were to tell all that he asks of
   God, and all the Lord's answers to his prayers! But, oh, believe me,
   you cannot enjoy real fellowship with God in prayer and come out of the
   closet with Luther's, "Vici! Vici!" "I have conquered! I have
   conquered!" on your lips, and live to enjoy the fruits of your victory
   in wrestling with God in secret--and then have any doubt whether you
   have a right and title to the eternal heritage! That is a sealed
   evidence, but it is a sure one. You cannot but look back upon it with
   extreme satis-

   faction. The prophet Micah said, "My God will hear me," and if you can
   truly, from your soul, say the same, you have a blessed evidence that
   you are an heir of Heaven!

   But, next, I rank very highly among the sealed evidences of our
   inheritance the fact that we have the fear of God before our eyes. Fear
   looks like one of the minor Graces, but it is a very leading one in the
   spiritual life. That holy awe of God, that consciousness of His
   majestic Presence, that dread of doing anything contrary to His will,
   that tender, loving, filial fear which love does not cast out, but
   rather nourishes and cherishes--he that has this holy fear is a child
   of God! They sometimes speak in indictments against criminals of their
   "not having the fear of God before their eyes," and, mark you, if a man
   has not the fear of God before his eyes, you need not wonder at
   anything that he does. Take away the fear of God from a nation and to
   what lengths of evil will it not go? Remember the great and terrible
   Revolution in France, when, at the end of the last century, she had
   cast off all fear of God? When a nation comes to that point, rebellion
   against authority is the least thing to be looked for. The horrors of
   the guillotine and the constant flow of blood will be sure to come--
   but in the child of God there is a holy, filial fear, which keeps him
   from doing things that others do. Remember how Ne-hemiah says, "So did
   not I, because of the fear of God"? A Christian is not held back from a
   certain course by a dread of punishment, but by that loving dread of
   offending so good and so gracious a God as he has.

   Now, if you feel, tonight, that you can honestly say that you walk in
   the fear of God all the day long--that is a sealed evidence--and it is
   a very sure proof that the inheritance of the saints really belongs to
   you.

   Another evidence is this--we have secret supports in the time of
   trouble. Here one could expatiate at great length if time would permit.
   "Underneath are the everlasting arms." You are sustained when enduring
   awful pain, comforted under deep depression of spirit, strengthened for
   the work for which, in yourself, alone, you are quite unequal, borne
   upward with holy joy in the midst of cruel slander! Surely that is
   enough evidence for you!

   Besides, the Lord gives to His people secret delights and we sing, "He
   brought me to the banqueting house, and His banner over me was love."
   At such times, the Lord gives us secret directions and instructions
   which come to the soul directly from Himself. Do not think me
   fanatical, for it is even as I say. These love tokens come to the soul
   with a demonstration and a power, a delight and a rapture which no
   words can ever express. They cannot be expressed, seeing that, in many
   instances, we hear, in the time of ecstatic joy, words which it is not
   lawful for a man to utter! We wrap these proofs up among the sealed
   evidences of our right to the heavenly inheritance!

   Another sealed evidence is the secret love which the child of God has
   to all others of the children of God. "We know that we have passed from
   death unto life, because we love the brethren." As to the love we have
   to Jesus, "We love Him because He first loved us," and our love to Him
   is one of the evidences of His love to us. We also joy in God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ. "God, my exceeding joy" is a sweet name that
   David gives to the Lord, and then he adds, "I shall yet praise Him who
   is the health of my countenance, and my God." I love to sing it as the
   hymn version puts it--

   "For yet I kno w I shall Him praise, Who graciously to me, The health
   is of my countenance, Yes, my own God is He." If you feel this intense
   love to the Lord and to His people, that is one of your sealed
   evidences.

   But once again, and I should like to enlarge on all these points, but I
   must not, those inward conflicts which you now have, that struggling in
   your soul between right and wrong, the new man seeking to get the
   victory over the old corrupt nature--all these are your sealed
   evidences. So, also, are the victories which God gives you, when He
   treads evil passions beneath the feet of the new-born man-child, who is
   the image of Christ within you, when you conquer yourself, when you
   subdue anger, when you go forth to do, by the strength of God, what
   otherwise your nature would shrink from--all these are blessed
   evidences, signed and sealed, to be rolled up and put away--to be seen
   by no eyes but your own--and the eyes of the Most High. These, then,
   are the sealed evidences of our faith.

   I have been obliged to hurry over this part of my subject because I
   need just a few minutes, now, to dwell upon the open evidences.

   II. Let us consider, secondly, THE OPEN EVIDENCES OF OUR FAITH. There
   is a counterpart, or copy, of the sealed title, or purchase deed. What
   are these open evidences of our faith?

   They are such proofs as others can see--and the first of such evidences
   that we are the children of God must be the open Word of God itself. I
   read the Bible and I say, "Well, if this Book is true, I am a saved
   man! If this is really a Divine

   Revelation, then I am saved!" Beloved, have you that open evidence of
   your salvation? That is the best evidence in the whole world! When
   Peter was writing concerning the Transfiguration of Christ, he added,
   "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that
   you take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place." The Lord
   Jesus said, "God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
   Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." I believe in Him, therefore I shall not perish, but
   have everlasting life. The open volume of the Word of God is our open
   evidence of salvation!

   Next to that, the open evidence of our right to the inheritance is a
   thorough change of life such as other people can see. Is it so with
   you? Has there been a distinct crisis in your being? Have you been
   turned from darkness unto light? Have you been brought from the power
   of Satan unto God? Does your husband know of the change? Does your wife
   see it? Do your father and mother notice it? Does your master perceive
   it, if you are a domestic servant? I think that, in some persons,
   conversion works so marked a change that the people of the neighborhood
   in which they live must see it! Distinctly do I recall, here, a man
   whose voice was uncommonly loud when he prayed at the Prayer Meetings.
   I was only a child, then, but I said to myself, "I have heard that
   man's voice before," and so I had, but I was surprised to hear it in
   prayer, for I had heard him swear on board ship! He was a captain and
   he swore as if he had swallowed a trumpet--and there he was, converted,
   and he was speaking in the same trumpet-tones to the praise of the
   glory of God's Grace! When a man has been a gross offender, there will
   be a conversion which men and angels and devils will be sure to
   see--and this is one of the open evidences that he is a Christian. May
   you all be such Epistles of Christ that you may be known and read of
   all men!

   Another open evidence is separation from the world. A man who is really
   a child of God cannot, after his conversion, consort with his old
   companions. As one said to me this week, "When I was in the shop, they
   began to talk some lewdness and to utter filthy words. And I just took
   up my hat and went away, for I heard this text in my ears, "Come out
   from among them, and be you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the
   unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you,
   and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."
   Separation from the world is one of the open evidences of a child of
   God. You do not come away from them because you dislike the people, but
   because you cannot bear their evil ways. They find pleasure in that
   which is a sorrow to you--that which is food to them is poison to
   you--and you say to yourself, "My Lord would not wish to come and find
   me in this society," so you et away from them.

   The next open evidence is found in union with the people of God, making
   them your companions, taking a delight in them. Depend upon it, we
   shall forever go with those who are our chosen friends here--the people
   who are our companions on earth will be our companions in the world to
   come! Tares will be bound up in bundles with the tares, but the wheat
   will be bound up with the wheat. This, then, is another open evidence
   of your adoption into the family of God-- when you love the people of
   God and seek their company.

   One very clear open evidence is strict honesty, uprightness and
   integrity in business. Do not tell me that you are a child of God if
   you can cheat your follow men! You may tell that to whomever you like,
   but it will not be believed by any man who reads his Bible.
   Straightforward honesty should always be the mark of every professor of
   the religion of Christ! Your word must be your bond, and you must
   sooner fail in business than do the smallest thing that would be
   contrary to the strictest integrity. This will become, to many, an open
   evidence which they can read.

   One very open evidence of a change of heart and of our possession of
   the inheritance, is a readiness to forgive. If you cannot suffer a
   wrong and continue to cherish resentment for it, how dwells the love of
   God in you? How can you ever pray the prayer of the Believer and say,
   "Our Father which are in Heaven," when you have to stammer as you come
   to, "Forgive us our sins; for we also forgive everyone that is indebted
   to us." Cheerful readiness to forgive any injury done to ourselves--to
   overlook any wrongdoing whatever--is one of the open evidences that we
   are the children of God!

   Another open evidence is one which we often get and do not like, that
   is, the opposition of the world. If any man will serve God faithfully,
   he will be sure to have the dogs of Hell at him. If you were to go
   through a village where you had never been, before, the dogs would come
   out and bark at you. But if you belonged to the parish, they would know
   you, and they would not take any notice of you. If you are a stranger
   to the world and a citizen of Heaven, the devil's dogs will howl at
   your heels! They cannot help it, for it is their nature. Thank God,
   Isaac, when Ishmael mocks you, for it is a mark that you are of the
   true seed and that Ishmael is not!

   Another open evidence, and one that is very sweet, is a holy patience
   in time of trouble and especially in the hour of death. Often have
   God's people, when racked with pain, been able to rejoice in God. And
   when heart and flesh have failed them and the death-sweat has been
   standing on their brow, they have been able, even then, if not to sing,
   at least to say, "The Lord is my Shepherd." "Yes, though I walk through
   the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for You are
   with me; Your rod and Your staff they comfort me."

   III. I wish that Time would have paused for a while, tonight, but he
   has not. I must not keep you beyond our usual hour, so I will close
   with just two or three words upon THE USES TO WHICH WE PUT THESE
   EVIDENCES.

   One of them is that they often yield us comfort. There is truth in Dr.
   Watt's hymn--

   "When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies, Ibid farewell
   to every fear, And wipe my weeping eyes." It takes the sting out of
   every trouble when we know that the heavenly inheritance is surely
   ours.

   Then again, these evidences answer the unjust charges of Satan when he
   comes and says, "You are not a child of God." Ah, but we have the
   evidences of our salvation, the sealed evidence and the open evidence,
   and we answer him boldly!

   And above all things, I think that we ought to value these evidences
   because they will be produced in court at the Last Day. That is the
   most solemn thing of all. See how the Lord Jesus, the great Advocate of
   His people, produces the evidence in court--"I was hungry, and you gave
   Me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink," and so on. He produces
   this evidence of a work of Grace in their hearts, and says to them,
   "Come you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
   from the foundation of the world."

   Brothers and Sisters, do you possess these evidences? If you have none,
   do not try to counterfeit them. For God's sake and your own sake, do
   not commit forgery in such a matter as this! If you have not these
   evidences, pray God that you may know that you have not, and go
   straightway to Christ, tonight, as a sinner. You have plenty of
   evidence that you are a sinner and Jesus came into the world to save
   sinners! Put your trust in Him, now, and receive from Him the evidence
   that you are one of His people. If you have bad evidences, worthless
   evidences, counterfeited evidences--fling them away and pray God that
   you may get rid of whatever false comfort you have ever derived from
   them! If God has given you the true evidences, still come to Jesus,
   just as you are, for it will be your continual coming to Christ that
   will be your best standing evidence that you are truly in Him!

   The Lord bring you all to Jesus, tonight, just as you are, whether
   saints or sinners--and then shall you rejoice in Him! The Lord bless
   you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. JEREMIAH 32:6-41.

   Verses 6, 7. And Jeremiah, said, The word of the LORD came unto me,
   saying, Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, shall come
   unto you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for the right
   of redemption is yours to buy it. God gave His servant an intimation of
   what was about to happen so that he might know how to act. It did seem
   a very strange thing to come to a poor Prophet in prison and to ask him
   to buy a piece of land when the Chaldeans were in possession of it--and
   when there seemed to be no hope that he would ever see it! One said, "I
   have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it," but
   Jeremiah could not do this, for he was shut up in prison, and the enemy
   had possession of the field he was to buy! Still, the thing was of the
   Lord, and therefore it was right. And there is many an action which, in
   itself, might seem absurd, but which, nevertheless, is to be performed
   because it is according to the will of God.

   8. So Hanameel, my uncle's son, came to me in the court of the prison
   according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I
   pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for
   the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it
   for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. Should a
   minister be concerned about the buying of land? Yes, if God bids him
   buy it. He is not to be entangled with the affairs of this life, but
   Jeremiah certainly could not be entangled with this field.

   9. And I bought the field of Hanameel, my uncle's son, that was in
   Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
   They always paid by weight to make sure that the amount was correct.

   10, 11. And I signed the deed and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
   weighed him the money in the balances. So I took the purchase deed,
   both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that
   which was open. The transaction was all in proper legal form. We are
   not to be neglectful in business because we are the servants of the
   Lord, but in all things we should act as men of prudence and
   commonsense.

   12-14. And I gave the purchase deed unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the
   son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel, my uncle's son, and in the
   presence of the witnesses that signed the purchase deed, before all the
   Jews that sat in the court of the prison. And I charged Baruch before
   them, saying, Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; take
   these deeds, both this purchase deed, which is sealed, and this deed
   which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last
   many days. They had no iron safes in those days, so their practice was
   to put their documents into earthen vessels and bury them deep in the
   earth, where they reckoned they would be secure.

   15. For thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and
   fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. Therefore,
   as an act of faith in God, the Prophet bought this meadow.

   16. Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch, the son of
   Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying. Jeremiah completes the
   business, puts the securities into safe keeping, and now he prays. It
   is always well to be free from care before you pray. Let nothing remain
   to be done, if it is possible, and then get alone and let your heart be
   free to speak with God. I do not suppose that Jeremiah prayed any the
   less or any the worse because he had attended to this business
   transaction. A man who lives near to God ought to be able to go from
   his counting-house to his closet with a happy heart!

   17-19. Ah Lord GOD! behold, You have made the Heaven and the earth by
   Your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard
   for You: You show loving kindness unto thousands, and recompense the
   iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them:
   the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of Hosts, is His name, great in
   counsel, and mighty in work: for Your eyes are open upon all the ways
   of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and
   according to the fruit of his doings. Whenever you are troubled, think
   much of God! Speak much of Him. This is true adoration. It will be a
   great help to your own spirit. Your own littleness will be forgotten in
   the greatness of your God.

   20-24. You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto
   this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and have made You a name,
   as at this day; and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the
   land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and
   with a stretched out arm, and with great terror; and You have given
   them this land, which You did swear to their fathers to give them, a
   land flowing with milk and honey; and they came in, and possessed it;
   but they obeyed not Your voice, neither walked in Your Law; they have
   done nothing of all that You commanded them to do: therefore You have
   caused all this evil to come upon them. Behold the siege mounds! The
   earthworks thrown up about Jerusalem completely surrounded it and the
   Chaldeans were hard at work breaking down the walls to capture the city
   while the people were dying of famine and disease.

   24, 25. They are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given
   into the hands of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the
   sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what You have
   spoken is come to pass; and, behold, You see it. And You have said unto
   me, O Lord GOD, Buy you the field for money, and take witnesses; for
   the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. Observe, it is hardly
   a prayer that Jeremiah utters--it is just a statement of his
   condition-- and yet that is real prayer. When you do not know what to
   ask God, state your difficulty, for that is the very best thing you can
   do. When you cannot see any way out of the maze, never mind--it is for
   God to show you the clue. There is often much sanctified commonsense in
   laying the difficulty before the Lord, spreading the letter before Him,
   and leaving it there. When you cannot ask for deliverance in this way
   or that, it will be sufficient just to state the case as Jeremiah did.

   26,27. Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, Behold, I
   am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for Me?
   This is a grand question, an unanswerable question!

   28-31. Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into
   the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king
   of Babylon, and he shall take it: and the Chaldeans that fight against
   this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the
   houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and
   poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke Me to anger. For
   the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil
   before Me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only
   provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD. For
   this city has been to Me as a provocation of My anger and of My fury
   from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should
   remove it from before My face. Jerusalem was such a sinful city that it
   must be destroyed. The very roofs

   of the houses had been defiled by the sacrifices offered to idols. If
   these words were true of Jerusalem, surely they are also true in great
   measure of London! It has been a provocation of God's anger, "from the
   day that they built it even unto

   this day."

   32. Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
   children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger, they,
   their kings, their princes, their priests, and their Prophets, and the
   men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They seemed, from the
   very highest to the lowest, determined to provoke the Lord, to show how
   little they cared for the Most High.

   33. And they have turned unto Me the back, and not the face. Like men
   who wished to insult a king in his very court.

   33. Though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they
   have not hearkened to receive instruction. It is a great aggravation of
   an offense against God when He has taught us and yet we "have not
   hearkened to receive instruction."

   34, 35. But they set their abominations in the house, which is called
   by My name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which
   are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
   daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them
   not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this
   abomination, to cause Judah to sin. If God had commanded them to offer
   up their children, they would have stood aghast at such cruelty, but
   they willingly sacrificed them to Molech in opposition to His will.

   36, 37. And now, therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of Israel,
   concerning this city, of which you say, It shall be delivered into the
   hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by
   the pestilence. Behold, I will gather them, out of all countries where
   I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath; and
   I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell
   safely. God is angry, and yet gracious! The rest of the chapter is full
   of tenderness and love. It is enough to make our eyes fill with tears
   as we note how God speaks concerning those who had rebelled against
   Him.

   38. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God: This is,
   indeed, a Covenant of Grace! It is not dealing with men after their
   sins, but according to the inexhaustible bounty of eternal love.

   39, 40. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear
   Me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: And
   I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn
   away from them, to do them good; but I will put My fear in their
   hearts, that they shall not depart from Me. There is, here, a promise
   of double bliss! The Lord will not turn from His people and they shall
   not turn from Him. What more could God do than He, here, promises? It
   looks like a trial of strength between sin and Grace! Sin was like a
   mountain, but the Lord's love was like the flood which prevailed till
   even the mountains were covered!

   41. Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
   them in this land assuredly with My whole heart and with My whole soul.
   See how God puts His whole heart to the work when He is blessing His
   people? When He forgives sin, it is with His whole heart and soul. May
   we, with our whole heart and soul, repent of our sins and then, with
   all our heart and soul, serve the Lord! Amen.

The Christ-Given Rest

   (No. 2298)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 5, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will give you rest." Matthew 11:28.

   I AM afraid that we have not always noticed the fullness of this
   promise. Usually the text is preached from as an invitation to the
   unconverted to come to Christ and, very properly so--"Come unto Me, all
   you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." It is an
   invitation to all of you who are laboring after salvation, or are heavy
   laden with a load of sin, or the burden of your daily cares. You may
   come--you are bid to come to the Lord Jesus--and He has promised that
   He will give you rest. But I must leave you, tonight, so far as my
   sermon is concerned, for my main business will be with those who have
   come to Christ. After having given the invitation to those who are
   outside the Church of Christ, I pass inside, and I want those who are
   within to come into sweet communion with their Lord, tonight, while I
   dwell upon this very gracious promise, "I will give you rest."

   I do not find, in this world, if I promise anything, that anybody ever
   forgets it. You try any of the societies connected with the
   Tabernacle--promise them a guinea and see if they do not wait upon you
   for it! But the curious thing, the wretched thing is that many of our
   Lord's promises are neglected by us. We do not wait upon Him to have
   them fulfilled. After having read the promise, it passes out of our
   thoughts. Do not so, tonight, I pray you. Here is the promise, "I will
   give you rest." Let no man here who has come to Christ be content,
   tonight, unless he gets the rest which the Lord Jesus promises to give.
   Jesus does not play at promising. Do not play with His promises--be as
   ready in receiving as He is willing to be in giving. "I will give you
   rest." This ought to be a very precious word to all Believers. You have
   come to Christ. He promises to give you rest--be sure that you get it.
   Do not rest content until you have that perfect peace which He alone
   can give you, that peace which is here called, "rest."

   This evening I shall not have much time, but I shall, first, exhibit
   this pearl, this pearl of rest. Secondly, I shall point you to the
   hands which give this pearl--"I will give you rest." And, thirdly, I
   shall, for a few minutes, dwell upon the promise which Jesus makes--"I
   will give you rest." It is a positive declaration of our Lord to those
   who come to Him-- "I will give you rest."

   I. First, then, let me EXHIBIT THIS PEARL. Mild and soft is its
   radiance. I call it a pearl because it is so precious, so blessed a
   thing. "I will give you rest."

   Jesus does not say in what part of the mind He will give rest, for He
   will give it in every part of the mind. He does not say in reference to
   what He will give us rest because He will give us rest in reference to
   everything. When a promise is general, you may take it in its widest
   possible meaning. Particulars restrain and restrict, but where there
   are no particulars, then you have unlimited range. "I will give you
   rest"--rest about everything, rest at all times, rest in every part of
   your nature!

   This promise includes rest of the mind, or fixedness of belief. Just
   now there is great restlessness concerning what we are to believe and
   many persons are much tossed about by the contrary winds that blow.
   They believe black, today, and white, tomorrow. Some have fallen into
   such a condition that they believe nothing, unless, indeed, it should
   not happen to be in the Bible--and then they will believe it! But if it
   is in God's Word, then, of course, they feel it necessary to doubt it.
   I suppose there is nobody that is not affected, to some extent, by the
   tornado of doubt which is sweeping over this island and over the whole
   world!

   Now, is there any child of God here who is perturbed in mind? You say
   to yourself, "I used to be a simple-minded Believer, but I have been
   worried, tried and troubled. I think that I shall have to buy some
   books upon Christian evi-

   dences, so as to look into the subject and find out the strongest
   arguments. Or I shall go and talk to some old Christian and hear what
   he can say to strengthen me." Listen, my Brothers and Sisters. Your
   Lord and Master says, "Come unto ME and I will give you rest." There is
   a surer intellectual rest to be found in personal communion with Christ
   than anywhere else! If I get my head on His bosom, none of the
   philosophers can make it ache. When I once put my finger into the print
   of the nails, I am no more faithless, but believing! I believe that
   living in communion with God is the only sure cure for doubt. Trusting
   wholly to Christ Crucified, resting in His precious blood and daily
   seeking to have it applied to the conscience--and then walking in the
   Light as God is in the light, is the surest way to end all those
   undermining processes which seek to destroy the very foundations of our
   hope!

   Come to Jesus tonight! Come to Jesus at the Communion Table and enter
   anew into fellowship with Him, and you will be able to say, "My heart
   is fixed! O God, my heart is fixed! I will sing and give praise." After
   being with Jesus, half the questions that trouble you will be answered
   and the other half will not seem worth the asking. After having been
   with Him, most of your doubts will vanish and the rest will not concern
   you one jot or tittle! You are His beloved, and your heart rests in
   that blessed fact.

   Our Lord next gives rest of the conscience, or a sense ofpardon.
   Conscience is a great source of unrest even to the best of men.
   Conscience makes cowards of us all, even those who are most daring in
   sin. With the child of God, there is no death of conscience. On the
   contrary, he who lives to the Lord has a more tender conscience than he
   ever had before he was saved. A tender conscience is a great
   blessing--never try to get rid of it. A morbid conscience may be a
   torment, but a tender conscience is a benediction--cherish it. Many
   blind persons read with their fingers, but if the fingers grow hard and
   callous, and the poor folks cannot feel the raised letters, it is a sad
   trial for them. We can often read the mind of God by the tender finger
   of conscience. Take care that your conscience never gets seared, I mean
   you Christian people. You need to keep your conscience more tender than
   that of anybody else.

   But suppose the conscience becomes restless, what are we to do with it?
   Brothers and Sisters, there is no purging the conscience from dead
   works except by drawing near to Christ, again! Have any of you
   Christian people slipped with your feet? Have you dishonored the sacred
   name you bear? Be ashamed and be confused. Who among us has not much to
   make him ashamed? But remember that the Christ who invites the erring
   sinner before conversion, invites the erring Believer after conversion.
   Come, all you that labor within your spirits and are heavy laden under
   a sense of your imperfections-- come to Christ, again, tonight! Where
   you once found rest in the atoning Sacrifice, you shall find it again!
   Do not let me go a step further till you have done this. Let us
   practice what I preach as we go along! You with your intellectual
   brilliance, come to my Lord, tonight, and see Him on the tree, and look
   your doubts away! You with the troubled conscience because of your
   unworthy walk, come to the Fountain and be washed anew--and let your
   conscience find rest.

   Supposing those two rests to be enjoyed, there is still a struggle
   going on and, therefore, Christ gives rest of the soul, or confidence
   of victory. The soul, even when it knows its pardon is sure, even when
   it has settled its doctrinal difficulties, is, nevertheless, engaged in
   a struggle against the old nature. Do you find that you have completely
   gained the victory yet? Do you never feel a struggle within your
   spirit? I must confess that I have a daily fighting of my better self
   against the old self, the newborn nature against the old nature which
   will, if it can, still keep its hold upon me. "O wretched man that I
   am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" is my cry as I
   begin the battle. Yet before I end it, I can say, "Thanks be to God,
   which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." If any of
   you are asking, "How shall I ever get the victory? See how I am
   tempted. See how weak I am in certain directions, constitutionally
   weak, and apt to slide! O Sir, shall I ever be perfect? Shall I ever
   master inbred sin?"

   Listen, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." Jesus will give you rest in the sweet confidence
   that you will get the victory! He will bruise Satan under your feet.
   Surely, Beloved, there will come a day when there will be no sin left
   in us. When we shall see the face of our Savior in Glory, we shall be
   like He--all our doubts will be dead, all our sins will be
   forgiven--and all our sinful tendencies will be forever destroyed!--

   "Then shall I see, and hear, and know All I desired or wished below,"

   and then shall I be rid of all that plagues me and that grieves my God.
   Come to Jesus, tonight, wrestling Believer, and have fellowship with
   Him--and you will have rest, even, in the midst of the conflict, for
   you will be sure that you shall ultimately overcome through the blood
   of the Lamb!

   Besides this, Jesus gives rest of the heart, or satisfaction in love.
   Some people appear to have no heart or, rather, their heart is a kind
   of valve made of leather. I have sometimes looked at certain people
   with great wonder when I have seen how little they have ever been
   affected. They never have much joy. They never have much sorrow. They
   seem to have been placed between two millstones and to have had all the
   juice pressed out of them--they appear to have no heart! But commend me
   to a man or woman with a big heart. Some seem to have a most
   affectionate nature--they must love! These are the people who have the
   most sorrow, though, mark you, they also have the most wonderful joy!
   Well, now, it may be that you have loved and you have been deceived, or
   you have loved and the fond object of your affection has been removed
   by death. You are here, tonight, with a sad countenance. You are
   saying, "What shall I do with this heart of mine? Where shall I love
   wisely, truly, without the hazard of another broken heart?"

   Jesus stands, tonight, invisibly in our midst and He says, "Come unto
   Me and I will give you rest." If you will love Him, (and oh, how well
   He deserves your love!), if you will take Him to be your Companion,
   your Friend, your Husband. If you will let Him enter into your heart
   and dwell there--if you will love Him beyond all else, He will give you
   rest and that kind of love which it is allowable to give to the
   creature! You shall be able to give without fear when you have once
   given the heart, itself, to Him who never fails, never disappoints and
   never is untrue. All you who wander with your great loving hearts
   aching for lack of love, come to my Lord and He will give you rest!

   I see you, tonight, like the vine with its tendrils, seeking that by
   which you may climb higher. Come and let your tendrils entwine
   themselves about my Lord and His sweet Words of Grace, and you shall
   get a good hold, and grow and climb even to the skies!--

   "Are you weary? Are you languid? Are you sorely distrest? 'Come to
   Me,'says One, 'and coming, Be at rest.'"

   I will not enlarge upon this point further than to say, as I have
   already told you, that Christ gives rest to the entire being, or peace
   about everything. Are you troubled, dear child of God, tonight? You
   ought not to be troubled about anything. "Ah, Sir! You do not know my
   position." No matter, Friend, that I do not know it--HE who bids you
   come to Him knows it! "But, dear Sir, my affliction is peculiar."
   Listen--"In all their affliction He was afflicted." Yours cannot be
   peculiar, therefore--Jesus must know all about it--and if He knows, it
   is better than my knowing. "But I have such a heavy cross to carry." Is
   it heavier than His? "Ah, Sir, but I have so many trials!" Are there
   more than He can enable you to endure? Come to Him, I pray you!

   Now then, if you can, at least for a few minutes, divest yourselves of
   your cares, your anxieties, your doubts, your fears--there He stands,
   He of the pierced feet and the nailed hands, and the crimson side!
   There He stands in Glory and He bids you come to Him and trust Him! Lay
   your burdens down at His feet. Why should you carry what He will
   readily carry for you? Tell Him all your griefs. Why do you hide them
   from Him? Should He not know your heart if you are married to Him?
   Should there be a secret kept away from Him? I am persuaded that I am
   preaching to you what will be more healing than the balm of Gilead, and
   sweeter than the sweetest music to lull you into a delightful peace if
   you will but listen to this Gospel invitation and come to Jesus, by a
   simple act of faith, and by a great resolve of fellowship, for He says,
   "I will give you rest."

   So much, then, about this pearl, rest.

   II. Now I want you to look, for a minute or two, at THE HANDS WHICH
   GIVE THIS PEARL--"I will give you

   rest." If Jesus Christ will give me anything, I will be glad to have
   it. The least possible gift from Him has a special sanctity about it
   because it comes from His dear hands. Your friend gave you a broken
   sixpence and you have kept it. Your mother gave you, (alas! you have no
   mother now), a little book with her name in it--and you would not sell
   it for its weight in silver. Now, whatever Jesus gives is a keepsake to
   His people. They lay it by and they love it. Listen, then--He says, "/
   will give you rest."

   If He will give me rest, then I know that His giving it guarantees its
   genuineness. I shall have no false peace if Jesus gives it to me. He
   will never give counterfeit coin to His people. If He gives me peace,
   it is peace! "When He gives quietness, who, then, can make trouble?"
   Beloved, do you not see that the fact that Jesus gives it will make
   your peace to be to you, beyond all question, the true peace of God
   which passes all understanding?

   Christ's gift of this rest also proves the value of the gift. Jesus
   does not give us pebbles and straws. If He gives us rest, it is rest
   worth having. Oh, Beloved, did you ever enjoy the rest that Jesus
   gives? Were you ever tossed about with a great trial? Did you ever have
   a heavy load of care? If you have never had such burdens, I have--I
   have lain awake at night wondering whatever I should do in certain
   cases. And at last I have come to the conclusion that I could not do
   anything and that I must leave all with the Lord. Did you ever wake up,
   after a little sleep, when you had cast all your care on Christ and
   left your troubles with Him and found yourself perfectly at rest? I
   have, sometimes, in the midst of great pain, sat up in the night and
   been afraid to go to sleep for fear I should lose the heavenly calm
   that I was enjoying. When I have left everything--and God knows that I
   have more cares to carry than most men--when I have left everything
   with Him and submitted myself absolutely to His sweet will, and had
   full fellowship with Christ, I have wondered what I could fret about if
   I tried! I have said to myself, "There is peace for me in Heaven. There
   is peace for me on earth. There is peace for me in the grave. There is
   peace for me everywhere."

   It was with my heart, as it was with the stormy sea when Jesus said,
   "Peace, be still." "And there was a great calm." This is the kind of
   rest that the Lord Jesus Christ gives--rest of the deepest, truest
   kind--rest which the world cannot give and which the world cannot
   possibly take away. If He gives rest, it is no second-first rest--it is
   first-class--it is beyond measure precious if it comes from His hands.

   Note again, Jesus says, "I will give you rest." If His hands give it,
   this ensures your getting it. Jesus does not say, "I will send you
   rest." It might be lost in the post. He does not say, "I will
   commission an angel to bring you rest." He might miss his way. It is,
   "/ will give you rest." Come to Jesus and you shall have rest out of
   His own hands put into your hands--no, put into your heart. You shall
   certainly get it. There will be no missing it--between the cup and the
   lips there shall be no slip!

   Jesus says, "I will give you rest." This ensures your right to it. When
   a Believer is at peace and rest, if the devil were to meet him, he
   would ask, "Why are you so quiet?" If you did not answer him, he would
   say, "What right have you to be at rest? You are a long way off being
   perfect. Look at the imperfections of yesterday! Why, even in your
   prayers you sinned!" "Ah," says the child of God, "I am not going to
   dispute with you, Satan. But I have a right to rest, for Jesus gave it
   to me. I am sure that He did not steal it and I am certain that He gave
   it to me. My title deeds are clear enough. A free gift through Jesus
   Christ--who can ever dispute that?" Oh, child of God, enjoy what Jesus
   gives, and be not afraid that anyone will take it from you!

   Do you not think that when Jesus says, "I will give you rest," this
   should encourage you to enjoy it? I believe that some Christians are
   afraid of being too happy. Do I not recollect when I first knew the
   Lord? I was as merry as a lark. I felt so glad that my sins were
   forgiven, I said within myself--

   "I am so glad that Jesus loves me." Some good old Christian man shook
   his head. "Ah," he said, "the black ox has not trodden on your toes
   yet." Well, I had not seen the animal, so I went on rejoicing! Then
   another said to me, "Some Christians are many years before they come to
   anything like assurance." That did stagger me a little, and they told
   me about the dragons and the giants that there were on the Pilgrim's
   Road. I have not seen any of them, yet, but those good people tried to
   frighten me with them. Now look, here, Beloved--there is none too much
   joy in the world! Do not you go about killing any whenever you see it!
   Rather try to encourage it, and if you see a young Christian happy in
   believing, and you do not happen to be as cheerful as he is, do not try
   and take his joy from him. Leave the black ox alone! The ugly beast
   will come in due time.

   Warn the young Believer of all the sin against which he should be on
   his guard, but do not hold up before him a gloomy view of the Christian
   life. You, Christian, have a right to perfect peace and if, between
   here and Heaven, you never have a doubt--if between here and the
   Eternal City you never have an anxious care--you have a perfect right
   to that complete serenity! It is, I say, provided for you in the Word
   of God. If you do not have it and enjoy it, that is your own fault, but
   there is ample provision made that we should have Heaven below as well
   as Heaven above! Oh, Christian people, if we lived up to our
   privileges, if we realized the Truth of God of the text, "I will give
   you rest," we would commend the Gospel! We would win converts! We would
   glorify God! We would be vastly more useful ourselves! "I will give you
   rest," is an encouragement to the enjoyment of the rest that Jesus
   gives to those who come unto Him.

   And, once more, if Christ says, "I will give you rest," how it endears
   Him to us! If all my rest is what He gives me, shall I not love Him?
   Oh, if my weary spirit is like Noah's dove, finding no rest for the
   sole of its feet till it comes back to

   Noah, to Christ, and to the ark, shall I not love Him who is my rest?
   Shall I not prove that love by consecrating to Him the life which He
   has made so happy? Shall not every step I take seem to ring out music
   of praise to His name? Shall I not open the gates of the morning with a
   song and draw the curtains of the night with a new note of
   thanksgiving? Truly, God has given us this rest!

   The Romans said of a certain peace that they enjoyed, "a god has given
   it to us." Behold, the Son of God has given us that deep repose which,
   as Believers, we have a right to enjoy and which, I trust, we enjoy
   tonight! If you do not enjoy it, do not let me go any further until you
   get it! Come, child of God, I am not simply going to talk about this
   matter--I want you to practice it! There is the hand, the pierced hand
   which gives you rest--take the rest from it and enjoy it now--and then
   kiss that hand with a fervor of deepest reverence because of this
   priceless gift which it has bestowed upon you!

   III. I close by noticing, in the third place, very briefly, THE PROMISE
   WHICH JESUS MAKES--"I will give you rest." It is a great blessing,
   sometimes, not to be able to read well. You remember how Mrs. Beecher
   Stowe, when she wrote, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," pictured Uncle Tom as
   having to spell all the words over? Now, it is a great blessing if a
   person is obliged to read the Bible like that.
   "I--will--give--you--rest." Every Word of God seems to be emphatic if
   you will just let it speak! All these bells ring out music, but I have
   no time to ring them tonight. Will you please listen to their melodious
   chimes all the week?

   "I--will--give--you--rest." To this promise there is but one condition.
   That we have already fulfilled if we have come to Christ and,
   therefore, there is no condition at all attached to the promise, "Come
   unto Me, and I will give you rest." We have come to Him unless we are
   hypocrites. We who are coming to the Communion Table have first come to
   Christ. We have really, truly, sincerely, looked unto Him, trusted Him,
   come to Him and hidden ourselves in Him. Very well, then, you have
   fulfilled the one and only condition attached to this promise of the
   Lord Jesus--and there stands the unconditional promise which applies to
   you tonight! Let me go over it again, "I--will--give--you--rest."

   This promise is made only to one character--and that character we can
   easily feel to be our own--"All you that labor and are heavy laden."
   You are the children of God, but you still have to labor. The most of
   you have to work hard every day and you have, also, much spiritual
   labor to serve your Lord, and to keep off the adversary. You labor both
   for the meat that perishes, and for that which endures unto eternal
   life. I am afraid that there are none of us who do not, at times, get
   heavy laden, especially when we get away from our Lord. Oh, what a load
   comes on us unless we keep close to Him! Very well, then, if tonight
   you labor and are laden, come along with you, and Christ will give you
   rest! I mean my fidgety Sister over yonder, who is always fretting--you
   love the Lord--and yet you keep fretting! Come, have done with it, for
   He says to you, "I will give you rest." I mean, also, my timid Brother
   over there who is always afraid of something that never happens! Give
   up that nonsense! Come along with you, you weary and heavy laden
   one--Jesus says to you, "I will give you rest."

   I mean that dear Brother, there, who has a darkness over his mind that
   he cannot shake off. Come to Jesus and He will give you rest. I mean
   myself, caring about the Church of God and almost broken-hearted, at
   times, as I see how ill it fares in these evil days. I will come to my
   Lord, tonight, and He will give me rest about that, for, after all, I
   have not to manage His Church and guide His affairs. No, all
   responsibilities and all dreads about the future I lay down at Your
   feet, You great Head of the Church, You great Master of assemblies!

   Next, notice that this promise is most positive and unreserved--"I will
   give you rest." Jesus does not say, "I will give you rest in every
   respect but one." No, "Come unto Me and I will give you rest." And the
   mercy of it is that this promise is as sure as ever! A hundred years
   ago a man went to the Lord Jesus with this promise, "I will give you
   rest," and the Lord Jesus gave him rest. Fifty years ago another man
   went with this promise and he said "Lord, there it is! You said, 'I
   will give you rest,'" and the Lord gave him rest. Now, tonight, take
   that promise for yourselves! It is just as good as if it had never been
   fulfilled! I give my neighbor a check--he goes with it to the bank and
   gets the cash for it. Now suppose the banker returns that check to
   me--and I go with it to the bank and try to cash it again? "No," they
   say, "we have cashed that check once, and that is done with." But you
   may take God's check and go to the Bank of Heaven every day! And every
   hour in the day! And the check is just as good as if it had never been
   cashed before. "I will give you rest." You tried that when you were
   21--try it now that you are seventy! When you were 40, in the day of
   your trouble, you said,

   "Lord, give me rest." Now that you are 80, the promise still stands
   just as good as ever! God's promises are not like a bundle of old
   checks that are done with and sent back to the drawer--they are always
   fresh and always new!

   Many of you are coming to the Communion Table. This rest is set forth
   to you in the ordinance. That Table seems to say to you, "I will give
   you rest." I shall not ask you to come up to the platform and to kneel
   down and take the bread from my hands. I shall ask you to sit as much
   at your ease as ever you can, because, at the Lord's Supper, that is
   the right posture. When Christ broke the bread, the disciples did not
   even sit, but reclined around the table! You miss the very spirit of
   the Supper if you come and kneel. It is a festival of rest--and when
   you come to it, you have nothing to do but to eat and to drink. That is
   the form in which Christ puts fellowship with Himself, "You shall eat
   with Me, and you shall drink with Me"--so that, in the ordinance He
   does, by the outward symbol, say, "I will give you rest."

   This promise will be completely fulfilled at the last. By-and-by,
   by-and-by, Christ will give us eternal rest! There is a Brother to whom
   I have been accustomed to take off my hat every Sabbath as I passed
   along. He was one of a goodly number of regular old friends, all along
   the road, that I could not speak to, but we just bowed and wished each
   other well as we passed. Last Lord's-Day I missed my friend from the
   place where I generally passed him, and I asked about him, and they
   told me that he had gone Home. There have been many who have gone Home
   since I was with you before. Well, then, we, also, may expect to go
   Home, by-and-by, and here is the Master's promise about that matter, "I
   will give you rest." "I will give you rest when the last hour comes.
   When the time of weakness, old age and sickness come, I will give you
   rest." Be not afraid--

   "Death is no more the king of dread, Since our Immanuel rose"

   and all the Lord's people may go up to their beds and rejoice to think
   that there is an end to this life of conflict, and a beginning to the
   life of victory, for Jesus says, "I will give you rest."

   Oh, the perfect repose, the unutterable bliss that will be yours and
   mine before long! I say, "before long," for in this great congregation
   I do not doubt that there are several Brothers and Sisters who will see
   the King in His beauty before many weeks are gone. I could wish that it
   were my lot to go first among you, but if it may not be, well, you
   shall go on a little ahead, my Brothers and my Sisters, and we will
   follow in our turn. "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
   henceforth: Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors;
   and their works do follow them."

   I have done--at least, I mean, I have only begun! I have begun to enjoy
   the text, myself, and I hope you have done the same. I must, however,
   just remind you that, when Jesus says, "I will give you rest," He does
   not mean that He will make you lazy. Lazy people cannot rest--they
   never know what rest means. There must be labor to give us rest. When
   Caesar Malan had 17 days' rest, in which he was charged by the
   physician not to exercise his mind, or do anything, he wrote 53 of the
   best hymns he had ever written and some of the best in the French
   tongue! He said that he could not help it--he wrote the hymns because
   he was resting, and they were a part of his rest.

   God sometimes makes His servants to be like those birds that rest on
   the wing. Stretching their broad pinions and taking a mighty flap, they
   seem to pass mile after mile at every stroke of their wings, resting
   while flying. Thus you may stretch your pinions of progress, and of
   holy aspiration, and rise higher and higher, and yet be still at rest!
   Like the stars that have a deep and profound rest, both by day and
   night, and yet keep their courses and know no fatigue, so you and I,
   blessed of God, shall keep our places and serve our God, and shine on,
   and yet shall rest till we enter into the Rest that remains for the
   people of God!

   I wish that it were possible for me to make every child of God, here,
   quite restful tonight. I know that I shall fail, but there is a blessed
   Spirit who can do it! When you are all quite restful, go home and rest.
   Go home, dear wife, with a restful heart. Perhaps your husband will
   meet you with an angry word. Be so restful that you will not mind it!
   Go home, dear young people, who have to work for your living. Perhaps
   you will sleep, tonight, in a room where there are many who will mock
   you if you kneel down to pray. Get such perfect rest that it will not
   matter to you whether they laugh or not! Take no more notice than you
   do of the grinding of the cab wheels outside this Tabernacle. The Lord
   can give His people such absolute peace that it would not matter to
   them if Heaven and earth should pass away!

   God grant to us that perfect peace! If any of you do not know anything
   about it, I wish that you did--but there it stands in the text, just as
   Christ said it, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden,
   and I will give you rest." God help you to come and take the rest that
   Jesus gives! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. COLOSSIANS 2:6-17.

   Verse 6. As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
   you in Him Do not go away from Him. You have received Him--stay with
   Him. Whatever He was to you at first, let Him be that to you to the
   very last. Do not begin with Christ and then go back to self--let it be
   all Christ from first to last.

   7. Rooted and built up in Him. Growing in Him. Have your very life,
   like a tree, rooted in Christ and, like a temple, built up in Christ.

   7. And established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding
   therein, with thanksgiving. Do not forget what you have been taught! Do
   not reject it--keep to it. He who should learn one system of
   philosophy, and then unlearn it, and begin another, and then unlearn
   that, and begin another, would be more likely to turn out a fool than a
   philosopher! And he who begins to learn the faith in one way, and then
   tries to learn it in another way, and then attempts to learn it in yet
   another way is more likely to be a skeptic than to be a saint.

   8. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
   after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not
   after Christ. Plenty of people would spoil you in this way, by teaching
   you their profound thoughts, their grand inventions, their bright
   ideas. Beware of all of them!

   9. For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
   Everything, then, must be in Christ if all the fullness of the Godhead
   dwells in Him! Why do you need to go anywhere else for wisdom? What can
   you find by going elsewhere? "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the
   Godhead bodily."

   10. And you are complete in Him. You are like vessels filled up to the
   brim. You are like warriors thoroughly furnished, fully armed for the
   fight--"You are complete in Him."

   10, 11. Who is the Head of all principality and power: in whom also you
   are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting
   off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.
   All that the Jew ever had, you have in Christ, only you have the real
   purification of which His rite was but a symbol.

   12. Buried with Him in Baptism, wherein also you are risen with Him
   through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised Him from the
   dead. It is only as you are one with Christ that Baptism will be to you
   what He intended, but, "buried with Him in Baptism," you are dead to
   all besides and all your life lies in Him.

   13. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision, of your
   flesh, has He quickened together with Him. All your life is in Christ.
   You are "quickened together with Him."

   13. Having forgiven you all trespasses. Your pardon is given to you in
   Christ. Oh, how full and how free is that forgiveness that comes to you
   through Christ Jesus!

   14, 15. Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
   which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His
   Cross; and having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show of
   them openly, triumphing over them in it. His Cross was His triumph!
   Then He led captivity captive. What more do you need? Your enemy is
   vanquished, your sins blotted out, your death changed to life, your
   necessities all supplied! Will you not stay at home with Christ? "Why
   do you gad about so much to change your way?" Can you have a better
   lover than your Lord, a dearer husband than the heavenly Bridegroom?
   Oh, love the Lord, you His saints! Cling to Him and make much of Him!
   Let Him be All in All to you!

   16. Let no man, therefore, judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
   respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath. Do not
   let anybody come in and tell you that it is necessary for your
   salvation that you should abstain from this meat or that drink, that
   there is a merit in fasting for 40 days in Lent, or that you cannot be
   saved without observing such and such a holy day. Your salvation is in
   Christ! Keep to that and add nothing to this one Foundation which is
   once and for all laid in Him!

   17. Which are a shadow of things to come. That is all that they are--"a
   shadow of things to come." 17. But the body is of Christ. Christ is the
   real one thing necessary.

   Mind that you have the Substance, for then you can let the shadows go!
   May God bless to us all this brief reading of

   His Word!

Thorns and Thistles

   (No. 2299)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 12, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thorns, also, and thistles shall it bring forth to you." Genesis 3:18.

   THIS was not the penalty which might have been pronounced upon Adam.
   This curse does not fall directly on him-- it glances obliquely and
   falls upon the ground whereon he stands--"Cursed is the ground for your
   sake." It is not from materialism that a curse comes upon the spirit of
   man, but it is from the erring spirit that the curse falls upon the
   material creation. Let us notice this and learn from it the infinite
   mercy of God, in that, while the curse falls upon the serpent
   distinctly, and his head is bruised, yet upon Adam it comes, as I have
   said, obliquely. "Cursed is the ground for your sake." "Thorns, also,
   and thistles shall it bring forth to you." God, in His justice, never
   goes beyond justice even in pronouncing His severest sentence, but
   here, in this life, He tempers His justice with great patience and
   long-suffering, "Not willing that any should perish, but that all
   should come to repentance."

   Another thing is very noticeable, that though the ground was now to
   bear thorns and thistles to Adam, yet he was to be above ground and
   alive to till it. Had the sentence been carried out to the fullest, a
   yawning grave would have opened at his feet and there would have been
   no more of Adam--but he was permitted, still, to live. Now, whenever
   thorns and thistles spring up about your path, do not murmur. "Why does
   a living man complain?" When a felon lies in the dungeon and the
   sentence of death has been passed upon him, if his life is spared, he
   may be quite content to live on bread and water for the rest of his
   days. Thank God that you are not in Hell! Thank God that life is still
   prolonged to you! You are on praying ground and pleading terms with
   God, even though that ground may bring forth thorns and thistles to
   you. "He has not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
   according to our iniquities." We are still spared. And though there are
   thorns and thistles springing up around us, still, that is a light
   punishment compared with what we really deserve to suffer.

   And, then, notice one thing more, how sweetness can be extracted from
   that which is sour. If the ground was to bring forth thorns and
   thistles to Adam, then he was still to live. Not only was he alive, but
   he was still to live on, for the Lord added, "And you shall eat the
   herb of the field." Although the sentence took away from Adam the
   luscious fruits of Paradise, yet it secured him a livelihood. He was to
   live--the ground was to bring forth enough of the herb of the field for
   him to continue to exist. Albeit that henceforth all he ate was to be
   with the sweat of his face, yet he was to have enough to eat, and he
   was to live on. Thorns and thistles might multiply, but there would be
   the herb of the field for him, and he would be spared. The promises of
   God are often veiled by His threats and if faith can only look beneath
   the rough covering of the message, something cheerful and hopeful may
   be found within.

   Brothers and Sisters, you will have trials! Thorns, also, and thistles
   shall the ground bring forth to you, but your bread shall be given you,
   your waters shall be sure! You have been provided for until now,
   notwithstanding many straits and trials, and it shall be so to the end.
   The manna shall not cease till you eat the old corn of Canaan. Till you
   need no more, God will not cease to feed you all your life. So, if the
   text, tonight, shall sound somewhat gloomy, and you expect a very
   thorny and thistly sermon, yet I trust that there will be much to cheer
   and comfort those of you who have found it true in your
   experience--"Thorns, also, and thistles shall it bring forth to you."

   I should like to say to those here who have their portion in this life,
   that it is not much of a portion. Thorns, also, and thistles shall it
   bring forth to you and, if this is all you have, you have a very poor
   pittance to live upon--

   "There is beyond the sky A Heaven of joy and love,"

   but beneath the sky there is no such Heaven! Even for the godly there
   are thorns and thistles, but for you who are not godly, thorns and
   thistles are all that you have! If you have no heritage on the other
   side of Jordan, in the land of the hereafter, in the dwelling place of
   the blessed, it were better for you that you had never been born!
   Notwithstanding all the transient delights that you now possess, they
   will only be as the crackling of thorns under a pot, soon over, and
   nothing but a handful of ashes left in everlasting darkness. Oh, that
   you would learn from this not to set your affection upon things below,
   but to be looking for a better and a brighter land, where the thorn
   never grows, and the thistle never springs up!

   But now let us come to the handling of our text, thorny though it may
   seem to be.

   I. And, first, A GENERAL FACT is here stated. This fact we will
   consider. Ever since that first sin of our first parents, this has been
   generally true of the whole human race, not only of the earth,
   literally, but of everything else round about us, "Thorns, also, and
   thistles shall it bring forth to you."

   It is so with regard to the natural world. This world is full of
   beauty; it is full of light; it yields a thousand pleasures; but still,
   it is full of terror. There is much, indeed, to distress the frail
   mortals who live in this world. Have you ever been to sea in a storm?
   Have you not felt as if Nature were at war with you then? Have you
   never been on the land in some tremendous thunderstorm, when the whole
   earth seemed to shake, and the skies were split with the fiery bolts?
   Ah, then you have felt that this world is not quite a paradise since
   man has become a sinner! The stars of Heaven do not fight for him, but
   they sometimes fight against him. There are many things in this world,
   with its stern laws, that make it a place that has not all the comfort
   that a creature might wish. He is a sinful creature and although he
   does not suffer all the discomfort that he deserves, yet this world is
   changed from what it was when God placed Adam in it to delight himself
   in Paradise!

   As it is in the natural world, so it is in the social world. You go out
   into the wide world of trade and business and I think you find that
   thorns, also, and thistles does it bring forth to you. You do not have
   a week's dealing, a week's work, a week's going to and fro in this
   world without getting a pricking thorn here and there. If we do not all
   have to complain of this experience, I think we who are Christians will
   all admit that the world is not congenial to a believing man or woman.
   The society of the world is not helpful to a holy heart. To have to mix
   in it is rather a task for which we need much Grace, as we cry, "Lead
   us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." You cannot have much
   to do with the men of the world without finding that many of them are
   sharper than a thorn hedge--and you cannot go to and fro in the earth
   without discovering that you are surrounded by those who make thorns
   and thistles to grow up all around you. Be not surprised when this is
   the case, for it is only what your Lord foretold--"If the world hates
   you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the
   world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the
   world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
   hates you."

   It is the same, also, in the religious world. We read, in the Book of
   Hosea, that they turned aside from God and set up altars. And
   afterwards it is said, "The thorns and the thistles shall come up on
   their altars." The worst thorns and thistles that ever wound my heart
   are those that grow in religious circles. To see God's Truth
   dishonored, to have the Glory of Christ's Substitution denied, to hear
   doctrines preached which would be novel if they were not old errors
   newly vamped and brought forth from the oblivion in which they deserved
   to rot--and to see Christian people behave themselves as some of them
   do, having little respect to the name of Him whom they profess to
   serve, and bringing discredit on the Sacred cause for which they ought
   to be willing to die rather than to cast a slur upon it--these are
   thorns and thistles that pierce us to the very heart! You can neither
   live in the Church nor live in the world without finding that this
   present state of life brings forth thorns and thistles to men, yes, to
   Christian men, too! Not only to the first Adam and to his seed, but to
   the second Adam and to His seed, this present state has this as one of
   its certain characteristics, "Thorns, also, and thistles shall it bring
   forth to you."

   I will go a little further, and tread upon delicate ground. I am afraid
   that there are many of you who have felt that, even in the little
   family world in which you move, you are not left without trials. God,
   when he took away Paradise as our home, gave us home to be our
   paradise! And if there is a place where all happiness is to be found,
   it is around the family hearth. "East and west, home is best." "There
   is no place like home." Yet where is there a home without affliction?
   The dear child whom you love, sickens and dies. Perhaps the wife or the
   husband may be taken away to the long home; or poverty comes in; or one
   whom you love dearer than yourself pines daily with constant sickness
   and frequent agony. No,

   we must not expect perfect peace, perfect happiness even in the home
   which is blessed with morning and evening prayer, where God locks up
   the door at night and draws the curtains in the morning--no, not even
   there, my dear Friends, shall we be free from the curse that sin
   brought into this fair world. Still will this word follow us into the
   sacred precincts of our own dwellings, "Thorns, also, and thistles
   shall it bring forth to you."

   And it is so if you get a little closer home, still, to the microcosm
   or little world of your own self. There is no part of man which does
   not yield him its thorns. Many of us have a thorn in the flesh. Is
   there any part of the body which may not, if God so wills it, become
   the subject of disease and, consequently, the source of pain to us? I
   know some whom God dearly loves--I know He loves them, for He favors
   them very highly--who, nevertheless, find that in the body of this
   flesh there are the seeds of corruption. There are the bitter wells of
   Marah by reason of sharp pain of body and, as to the mind, itself, what
   mind is there that is full of faith and most joyful in the Lord which
   is not naturally, still, the subject of grief? There will come times of
   depression, seasons of apprehension, nights when the Light of God's
   Countenance is withdrawn, or when, though we know that we possess the
   love of God, it is not shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit to
   the same extent as in our brighter hours. Yes, and even in the soul,
   itself, by reason of the imperfection of our sanctifica-tion, from the
   fact that we are not so filled by the Spirit, and not so conscious of
   the abiding of the Spirit within us as we yet shall be, thorns, also,
   and thistles are brought forth to us.

   I may be speaking to some who can say, with an emphasis, that they
   oftentimes find great crops of thistles springing up in their hearts.
   And they have to keep the sickle of sacred mortification going to cut
   them down and they try, if possible, to dig them up by the roots. But
   thus it is--you cannot expect a perfect life of happiness in an
   imperfect world like this. No, your Savior carried the Cross, and you
   will have a cross of some kind or other to carry after Him. "Thorns,
   also, and thistles shall it bring forth to you."

   Now, still dwelling on this dreary fact, as we have it foretold in the
   text, let us learn from the text, itself, first, that trials will come
   spontaneously. Nobody is so foolish as to sow thorns and thistles. I
   have often wondered who that great fool must have been, who, being a
   Scotchman, desired to see the old Scotch thistle growing up in New
   Zealand and, therefore, sent a packet of seed out there to poison, with
   his precious thistle, that land where there were none before! I think
   the man who would venture to sow even one seed of a thistle in such a
   world as this, where thistles grow quite plentifully enough, must have
   gone a long way in folly. But if, dear Friend, you never cause trouble
   to others and do nothing that can bring trouble to yourself--and you
   will be a wonderfully wise man if that is the case--still, troubles
   will come of themselves! If you need a herb of the field that you are
   to feed upon, you must sow it. Your wheat and your barley, you must sow
   with care. As to the thorns and thistles, you need not take any trouble
   about sowing them--they will spring up of themselves spontaneously--and
   so will the afflictions and tribulations of this life come to you
   without any effort on your part!

   And, as they come spontaneously, so trials will come unavoidably. I
   care not how careful a man may be with his farm--he will find thorns
   and thistles springing up and needing to be destroyed! He may have
   plowed and harrowed, and done his best to get rid of every thistle in
   autumn before it has seeded, and yet he cannot keep the troublesome
   things out--they will be sure to come. So you may rest assured that
   troubles of heart, and troubles of body, and troubles of mind will come
   to you, watch and guard against them as you may! All the prudence and
   care, yes, and all the prayer and faith that you can summon to your
   help, will not keep you clear of these thorns and thistles. As they are
   spontaneous, so are they unavoidable.

   To many, also, trials are very abundant. "Thorns, also, and
   thistles"--not a thorn and a thistle--but thorns and thistles, and
   plenty of them, shall it bring forth to you. If any of you are vexed
   with trial after trial, I pray you do not think it a strange thing--you
   are not at all alone in such an experience. Many of you, because of
   your troubles, will get alone, and say, "I am the man that has seen
   affliction." Stop! I can find you another man who can equal you, and
   many women who can surpass you in their afflictions! The path of sorrow
   is trodden by thousands of feet--it is hard with traffic--but as it
   leads to the eternal Kingdom when a Believer's foot is upon it--we need
   only rejoice to follow the footsteps of the flock and look upon our
   trials as the tokens that we are where the great Shepherd leads us.
   Thus we sing--

   "Is this, dear Lord, that thorny road

   Which leads us to the mount of God?

   Are these the toils Your people know,

   While in the wilderness below?

   'Tis even so, Your faithful love Does thus Your children's Graces
   prove-- 'Tis thus our pride and self must fall, That Jesus may be All
   in All."

   Thorns and thistles come abundantly--and trials come very variously. It
   is not only one form of trouble, but other forms, also--"Thorns, also,
   and thistles." You may think that it is bad enough to be ill, yourself,
   but to be poor as well, to also have a sick child and to be assailed by
   a slanderous enemy, seems more than you can bear! Ah, well, you are to
   expect these things! If you had only one form of trouble, perhaps you
   would grow used to it and, therefore, it might lose its effect. It is
   the very fact that it wounds that makes it useful to us! Solomon says,
   "By the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better." No
   tribulation for the present is joyous--if it were, it would not be
   tribulation at all! If the rod does not make the child smart, what is
   the use of it? And if our troubles do not make us grieve, why, then,
   they are not troubles, and there is no room for Divine Grace to support
   us under them! We may expect to have trials of every sort and size, for
   they attend the followers of the Lamb as long as they are in the world
   that lies under this curse. "Thorns, also, and thistles shall it bring
   forth to you."

   I think that, without straining the text, I may say that trials will
   come very frequently, for thorns and thistles seem to spring up very
   early in the morning, and very early in the spring, and very late in
   the autumn, and even far into the winter! When is there a time when a
   man in this world, yes, a Christian, too, can be sure that he will be
   perfectly free from trouble?

   And trials come universally. I have seen thorns and thistles on the
   tops of the Surrey Hills, growing by myriads, enough to seed a kingdom
   with them! And if you go down into the valley, into the poor man's
   little plot of ground, you will find thorns and thistles there. They
   grow in the gardens of Windsor Castle as well as in the backyard of
   your lodging house. Thorns, also, and thistles grow anywhere--on
   dunghills or in conservatories! They seem to be universally scattered!
   The downy wings carry the thistle seed everywhere and it springs up in
   most unlikely places. If you think that other people are to be envied
   because of their freedom from trial, it is possible that if you knew
   more about them, you would find that they were to be pitied, and that
   your lot, after all, is much better than theirs!

   Now, I am not going to say any more about this general fact, a fact
   which I suppose most of you know quite as well as I do, that thorns and
   thistles, trials and troubles, abound in this sin-cursed world.

   II. But now, in the second place, THIS FACT HAS TO BE FACED--"Thorns,
   also, and thistles shall it bring forth to you."

   Now know this, you Christian people, especially, know this, and then it
   will prevent disappointments. If you begin your Christian life
   imagining that because you are a Christian, everything is to go
   smoothly with you and that you are henceforth never to have any more
   troubles, you will be bitterly disappointed when the thorns and
   thistles begin to spring up! Expect them! Look forward to them and
   then, when they do come, half of their sting will be gone! You will
   say, "Well, when I took this farm, I knew that thorns and thistles
   would spring up, I calculated upon seeing them. Now that they have come
   up, to be forewarned is, in a great measure, to be forearmed--I shall
   not sit down and weep with bitter disappointment, for what I suffer is
   no more than I expected."

   In the next place, the knowledge of this fact will awaken gratitude. If
   you have not a little lot of thorns and thistles, be thankful that you
   have not. And if you are saying to yourself, "Well, I trust that I am a
   Christian, but really, I have not any very great trouble. I seem to
   sail on a mill pond, everything goes smoothly with me." Thank God for
   it. It should tend to make you grateful if there is no bitter in your
   cup, when you might have expected that there would be. Then drink the
   sweet with gratitude and pour out a portion for the poor--and have
   sympathy with others who are not as favored in this respect as you are!
   This fact should arouse your gratitude.

   In the next place, being forewarned that there will be thorns and
   thistles, should brace up your soul to expect them. The finest men in
   all the world are not to be found in the warm, genial climates, where
   the earth has only to be tickled with a hoe and it laughs with plenty!
   The strongest and the most enterprising spirits have been found at the
   back of the north wind, where there are frosts and ice, and long,
   dreary winters, and men have a hard struggle for a livelihood. They
   become real men under that stern training! Now, if there were no thorns
   and thistles, no struggles and no trials, should we have any brave
   Christians? Should we have any great and noble souls at all? When did
   the Church yield her best men for her Lord's service? It was in the
   persecuting times, when they had to swim through seas of blood to hold
   fast the Truth

   of Christ! These are silken days and we have wretched specimens of
   Christians everywhere--but if the times of persecution were to come,
   once more, with the rough winds blowing, and the whole sea of the world
   tossed in tempest, we should then find brave sailors who would put the
   ship's head to the wind and ride safely over the stormy billows in the
   name of the Eternal God! It is, perhaps, the worst thing that can
   happen to us to be without any kind of trouble. We do not grow in Grace
   very quickly without trial--and we do not, then, develop the Graces of
   the Spirit as we do when God sends the thorns and thistles to grow up
   around us.

   Further, dear Friends, the knowledge that we may expect the thorns and
   the thistles should prevent our clinging to this world. I should not
   always want to stay here, when all that I have as a warranty of this
   farm is this--"Thorns, also, and thistles shall it bring forth to you."
   There is a land--

   "Where everlasting spring abides, And never-withering flowers."

   Oh, let my heart be set upon the world to come! Let me cheer my soul
   with the prospect of being forever with the Lord, where nothing can
   distress or annoy my glorified spirit forever! The Lord does not mean
   Believers to be satisfied with this world. If you are His child,
   however fair your portion here, He means you to be always restless
   until you rest in Him and never to be fully satisfied until you wake up
   in His likeness. Therefore, be thankful for the thorns and thistles
   which keep you from being in love with this world and becoming an
   idolater as so many of your fellow men are.

   Does not the Lord intend, by these trials and troubles, to bring us to
   seek after higher things? Brethren, are there not many men who would
   have been lost if they had not lost their all? I talked with one, the
   other day, who said to me, "I never saw until I lost my eyes." Another
   said to me, as I noticed that he had lost a leg, "Ah, Sir, it was the
   loss of that leg that made me think and brought me to my Savior's
   feet!" Some of you cannot go to Heaven with all your possessions and
   with all your prosperity! It will be necessary to have these things cut
   away. You are like a ship that is going down through overloading and
   you will have to be unloaded that you may float--and blessed is that
   hand of God which unloads you of many an earthly joy, that you may find
   your all in the world to come!

   Affliction is God's black dog that He sends after wandering sheep to
   bring them back to the fold! If that dog is after anyone here, tonight,
   I pray you, fly away to the Shepherd! Do not begin fighting the dog and
   trying to struggle with him, for you will get nothing by that, but run
   away to the Shepherd! One of these days you will be glad for all the
   rough treatment that the black dog gave you in the day of your
   tribulation. Thorns and thistles shall the earth bring forth to you,
   but if these bring you nearer to your God, they are the best crop the
   ground can grow! Remember what we sang just now--

   "God in Israel sows the seeds

   Of affliction, pain, and toil.

   These spring up and choke the weeds

   Which would else overspread the soil!

   Trials make the promise sweet.

   Trials give new life to prayer.

   Trials bring me to His feet,

   Lay me low and keep me there." Once more, these thorns and thistles
   should make us look to Christ to change all things around us. The world
   will always go on bringing forth thorns and thistles until HE
   comes--and when He comes, our Glory and Delight--then, "instead of the
   thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come
   up the myrtle tree." Only His Grace and His own glorious Presence can
   change this visible creation, as it shall be changed when, "the wolf
   and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the
   bullock." We look for that happy transformation, but as for moral
   transformations, they take place every day where Jesus comes! He
   constantly turns thorns and thistles into fir trees and myrtle trees.
   He makes what was our sorrow to become the base of sweet content and
   out of all our griefs we gather gladness, blessed be His name!

   If any of you say that this is a dreary subject, I want you to remember
   how much more dreary it was to Him than it ever can be to you, for when
   He was crowned on earth, the only crown He ever wore was a crown of
   thorns! This curse of the earth was on His head and wounded Him sorely.
   Was He crowned with thorns and do you wonder that they grow up around
   your feet? Rather bless Him that ever He should have consecrated the
   thorns by wearing them for His diadem! Be

   willing to wear the thorn crown, too, and if that is not given you to
   prick your temples, and to make every thought an agony, be satisfied to
   go on treading a thorny path, for your Lord has been that way before.
   The day shall come when all these thorns will make us sing more
   sweetly! The special music of some of the redeemed is due to their
   special trials--

   "The deeper their sorrows, the louder they'll sing."

   The transports of Heaven will reach a height in those who have passed
   through great afflictions which they cannot attain otherwise. "These
   are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their
   robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they
   before the Throne of God and serve Him day and night in His Temple."
   Therefore, be not sorry that the earth shall bring forth thorns and
   thistles to you, for without these you could not come through these
   great tribulations and enter into so great and glorious a rest!

   I have ended sooner, because of the Baptism which is to follow, but I
   would to God that some of you here, who have no portion in the world to
   come, would lay my text to heart. So you have come to London, young
   man, and you attend the theater, and music halls, and so on! Well, they
   will bring forth thorns and thistles to you. That is the kind of ground
   where they grow very large and with very sharp thorns on them. Oh, but
   you, my young Friend, do not go to such places--you are getting on
   nicely in business! Yes, but you have no guarantee that it will always
   be so. Thorns and thistles will it bring forth to you, as well as to
   others. And suppose that you should prosper? Suppose that you should
   make L10,000? Suppose that you should make much more than that? Do you
   not know that with all that there will come great care, and that, after
   all, there is no satisfaction in it, and that when all that makes
   success in life is summed up, apart from laying hold of eternal things,
   it is all nothing but smoke? Thorns and thistles for dying beds are
   often made out of riches. There are more thorns and thistles to the
   rich than to the poor when they come to die, if they have lived an
   ill-spent life.

   Oh, Sirs, if you could have all the world, it would only be a bigger
   plot of thorns and thistles for you without Christ! But if you get Him,
   if Jesus is your portion, then if your trials should be heaped up as
   high as Heaven, you would not mind, for Christ would come and be with
   you in the worst of them--and you would still rejoice and glory in
   tribulation, also--and your tribulation would work in you patience, and
   patience, experience, and that experience would work in you the
   likeness of Christ, and so bring you nearer Heaven!

   It matters not to the Believer what form his life may take when once
   Christ has become his life! And it will not matter much to you who are
   not saved what form your life takes if you continue without the
   Savior--it will be death all the same. And it will land you in eternal
   death!

   Oh, God, grant that we may never settle down upon this thistle plot and
   try to make it to be our heritage, but may we find our portion in the
   Lord Jesus Christ! I wish all of you that blessing, for His name's
   sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. GENESIS3.

   Verse 1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field
   which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yes, has God
   said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden? He began with a
   question. How much of evil begins with questioning! The serpent does
   not dare to state a lie, but he suggests one--"Has God refused you all
   the fruit of these many trees that grow in the garden?"

   2, 3. And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
   the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the
   midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither
   shall you touch it, lest you die. Eve had begun to feel the fascination
   of the Evil One, for she softened down the Word of God. The Lord had
   said concerning the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, "In the day
   that you eat thereof you shall surely die. A little of the spirit of
   doubt had crept into Eve's mind, so she answered, God has said, "You
   shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die."

   4, 5. And the serpent said unto the woman, You shall not surely die:
   for God knows that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
   opened; and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. The serpent
   insinuated that God selfishly kept them back from the tree, lest they
   should grow too wise and become like God, Himself. The Evil One
   suggested ambition to the woman's mind, and imputed wicked designs to
   the ever-blessed and holy God. He did not say any more--the devil is
   too wise to use many words. I am afraid that the servants of God
   sometimes weaken the force of the Truth of God by

   their verbosity, but not so did the serpent when he craftily suggested
   falsehoods to Mother Eve--he said enough to accomplish his evil
   purpose, but no more.

   6. And when the woman saw.--Sin came into the human race by the eyes
   and that is the way that Christ comes in, by the eyes of faith, the
   spiritual eye. "Look unto Me, and be you saved," is the counterpart of
   this Word of God, "When the woman saw."

   6. That the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the
   eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit
   thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he
   did eat. This was a distinct act of rebellion on the part of both of
   them. It may seem a small thing, but it meant a great deal. They had
   cast off their allegiance to God. They had set up on their own account.
   They thought they knew better than God and they imagined they were
   going to be gods, themselves.

   7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
   naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
   All they had gained by their sin was a discovery of their nakedness.
   Poor creatures, how the serpent laughed as his words were fulfilled,
   "your eyes shall be opened"! They were opened, indeed, and Adam and Eve
   did know good and evil! Little could they have dreamed in what a
   terrible sense the serpent's words would come true.

   8. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
   the cool of the day. No doubt, when they had heard the voice of the
   Lord before, they had run to meet Him, as children do to a father when
   he comes home "in the cool of the day." But now, how different is their
   action!

   8. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the Presence of the LORD
   God among the trees of the garden. What fools they were to think that
   they could hide themselves from God! The fig leaves were to hide their
   nakedness and now the trees, themselves, were to hide them from God.

   9-11. And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where are
   you? And he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
   because I was naked; and I hid myself. And He said, Who told you that
   you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you
   that you should not eat? God comes to judge His fallen creature, yet He
   deals kindly with Him. The Lord will have it from Adam's own lips that
   he has offended--He summons no other witness.

   12. And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave
   me of the tree, and I did eat. This is a clear proof of his guilt,
   first, that he throws the blame on her whom he was bound to love and
   shield. And next, that he throws the blame on God, Himself--"The woman
   whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree." Ah, me, what
   mean creatures men are when sin comes in and shame follows at its
   heels!

   13. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that you have
   done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. How
   often we throw the blame of our sin on the devil who certainly has
   enough to bear without the added guilt of our iniquity! What Eve said
   was true, but it was not a sufficient reason for her sin. She should
   not have been beguiled by the serpent.

   14. 15. And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done
   this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
   field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the
   days of your life: and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
   between your seed and her Seed; it shall bruise your head, and you
   shall bruise His heel. Here was the first proclamation of the Gospel!
   Strange to say, while God pronounces a curse upon the enemy of mankind,
   He is uttering a blessing upon the whole of those who belong to Christ,
   for HE is that Seed of the woman, and all that belong to Him are a
   simple-minded, child-like people--children of the woman. Their
   opponents are the seed of the serpent--crafty, cunning, wise, full of
   deceit--and there is enmity between these two seeds. Christ is the Head
   of the one seed, and Satan is the head of the other. And our Lord Jesus
   Christ has had His heel bruised and He suffered in that bruising of His
   heel. But He has broken the head of the dragon. He has crushed the
   power of evil. He has put His potent foot upon the old serpent's head.

   16-18. Unto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and
   your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your
   desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you. And unto
   Adam He said, Because you have hearkened unto the voice of your wife,
   and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall
   not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you
   eat of it all the days of your life; thorns, also, and thistles shall
   it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field. Adam
   had been accustomed to eat of the fruit of the many trees of Paradise.
   Now he must come down and eat "the herb of the field." He is lowered
   from royal dainties to common fare.

   19. In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return unto
   the ground. "You shall get your life out of the ground till you,
   yourself, shall go into the ground."

   19-21. For out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and unto dust
   shall you return. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was
   the mother of all living. Unto Adam, also, and to his wife did the LORD
   God make coats of skins, and clothed them. This was a very significant
   Gospel action. The Lord took away from Adam and Eve the withered fig
   leaves, but put on them the skins of animals, to show, in symbol, that
   we are covered with the Sacrifice of Christ. The giving up of a life
   yielded a better covering than the growth of Nature--and so, today, the
   death of Christ yields us a better covering than we could ever find in
   anything that grew of our poor fallen nature. Blessed be God for thus
   thinking of us when providing raiment for our first parents!

   22. And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of Us, to
   know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
   of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever. That would have been a
   horrible thing, for man to be incapable of death--and so to continue
   forever in a sinful world! It is by passing through death that we come
   out into the realm of perfectness.

   23, 24. Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden,
   to till the ground from whence he was taken. So He drove out the man;
   and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherubims, and a
   flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of
   Life--

   "O, what a Fall was there, my countrymen,

   Then I, and you, and all of us fell down," while sin triumphed over us!
   Yet even the Fall by Adam's sin was not without the promise of a
   gracious recovery through the last Adam, the Lord from Heaven! Well
   does Dr. Watts set forth the contrast between the fall of the angels
   and the Fall of man--

   "Down headlong from their native skies

   The rebel angels fell,

   And thunderbolts of flaming wrath

   Pursued them deep to Hell.

   Down from the top of earthly bliss

   Rebellious man was hurled

   And Jesus stooped beneath the grave

   To reach a sinking world."

   He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took our nature and
   died in our place! May we trust to His death to bring us life and,
   thereby, be saved from the consequences of the Fall!

The Whole Gospel In A Single Verse

   (No. 2300)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 19, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 28, 1889.

   "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief." 1
   Timothy 1:15.

   I SPOKE, yesterday, with a brother minister who had been a pastor in
   America, and I asked him why he was so anxious to go back again where
   the climate had so greatly tried him. He answered, "I love the people
   to whom I preach." "What sort of people are they?" I enquired. "Well,"
   he replied, "they are a people who come together anxious to get good.
   They do not try to find fault with me, but they seek to get all the
   good they can out of the Gospel I preach." "Well," I said, "it is worth
   while crossing the ocean to go to a congregation of that sort of
   people." You know, dear Friends, how it is with some people, as it was
   with one friend to whom I spoke last Tuesday. God had blessed the Word
   to his soul and he was converted, but he had been hearing me some time
   before and I said to him, "How was it, do you think, that during those
   other years that you came here, you did not find the Savior?" "Oh,
   Sir!" he answered, "I am afraid it was because I came to hear you, and
   when I had been here and heard you, I was quite satisfied. But when God
   taught me to come here to look for Christ, and to seek eternal life,
   then I obtained the blessing." Now, will you who are here, tonight,
   especially you who are not saved, try to hear me in that fashion, not
   noticing how I preach, because I do not care much about that,
   myself--and you need to care about it far less--but only to think what
   good can be got out of it? Let each hearer ask himself, "Is there
   anything of saving benefit to my soul in what the preacher will say
   tonight?"

   Now, this text contains the Gospel in brief, and yet I may say that it
   contains the Gospel in full. If you get condensed notes of a sermon or
   a speech, you often miss the very soul and marrow of it, but here you
   get all the condensation possible, as if the great Truths of the Gospel
   were pressed together by a hydraulic ram, and yet there is not a
   particle of it left out. It is one of the "little Bibles," as Luther
   used to call them--the Gospel in a verse. The essence of the whole
   Bible is here-- "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
   acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
   whom I am chief."

   I. Now I am going to be short upon each point and, therefore, I shall
   at once speak upon this first head. Here is OUR NAME, OR A BROAD WORD
   OF DESCRIPTION--"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." One
   of the most important questions that can be asked by any man is this,
   For whom is salvation meant? The answer we have is given by the Holy
   Spirit in the Inspired Word of God--"Christ Jesus came into the world
   to save sinners.''"

   Jesus Christ came to save sinners of all sorts. So long as you can come
   under the general description, "sinners," it matters not what shape
   your sin has taken. All men have, alike, sinned, and yet all have not
   sinned in the same way. They have all wandered the downward road and
   yet each one has gone a different way from all the rest. Christ Jesus
   came into the world to save respectable sinners and disreputable
   sinners! He came into the world to save proud sinners and despairing
   sinners! He came into the world to save drunks, thieves, liars,
   whoremongers, adulterers, murderers and such! Whatever sort of sin
   there is, this Word of God is wonderfully comprehensive and
   sweeping--"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."

   A black lot, a horrible crew, they are, and Hell is their due reward,
   but these are the people Jesus came to save. If there are any people in
   the world who are not sinners, Jesus did not come to save them because
   such people do not want a Savior. If there are any of you who venture
   to say that you have never sinned, well then, you need not listen to
   me, for I have nothing to say to you, nor has this Book of God, except
   to tell you that you are under a grievous error and a great

   delusion! There can be no mercy to a man who has committed no fault.
   Some time ago there was a man incarcerated for life for an offense he
   never committed and, when it was found out that he was not guilty, Her
   Majesty insulted him, I think, by giving him "a free pardon." Why, he
   had never committed the crime for which he had suffered, poor Soul, and
   he had been a year, at least, in confinement as a felon, though he was
   innocent! I think Her Majesty should have begged his pardon and given
   him large compensation. Pardon and mercy are not for innocent
   people--they are for the guilty! And the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore,
   came into the world, not to save the innocent, the righteous and the
   good--but to save sinners!

   Notice, next, that Jesus came to save sinners without any other
   qualification. There is a habit which some have of qualifying the word,
   sinner, as we have it in the hymn--

   "Come, humble sinner, in whose breast," and so on. I think the writer
   of that hymn put it--

   "Come, tremblingsinner, in whose breast A thousand thoughts revolve."

   But when Jesus Christ invites sinners, He does it after this fashion,
   "Come, sinners." "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
   There is no adjective before the noun! There is no sort of
   qualification except that they are sinners.

   Christ Jesus came to save hardened sinners, for He softens the heart.
   He came to save aggravated sinners, for He breaks the iron sinew of the
   neck and subdues the stubborn will. He came to save sinners who have no
   good thing in them. "If you have any merit," said one to another, "if
   you have any good thing about you, it is like a drop of rose water in a
   sea of filth." But, truly, there is not even that one drop of rose
   water in our nature--nor need there be in order that Christ may save
   us! He came to save sinners--that is all Paul says. I dare not limit
   what is left unlimited. I dare not qualify what is left unqualified.
   "Sinners"--that is all the Apostle says. What? If they have no trace of
   goodness, no mark of anything excellent? Yes. "Christ Jesus came into
   the world to save sinners."

   This means, also, that Christ Jesus came to save sinners in their
   pollution. Remember that sin is a very offensive thing. When conscience
   is really awakened to discover the pollution of sin, it is seen to be
   exceedingly sinful, a thing that is truly horrible. We are taught, in
   the Scriptures, even to hate the garments spotted by the flesh--and
   there is such a thing as a righteous indignation against sin. But the
   Lord Jesus Christ has come into the world to save the polluted, to save
   those against whom virtue gives her vote, to save those whom society
   expels! What a wonderful thing "society" is, itself rotten to the core
   very often and yet, if there happens to be a poor woman who has gone
   astray, "society" cries, "Put her out! Drive the wretched creature away
   from us." I have known one such turned out of hotel after hotel. They
   could not bear their righteous selves to come anywhere near to one who
   had in the least degree broken the laws of society!

   But it was not so with Christ. Notwithstanding all His sense of the
   horror of sin--and it is much greater than our sense of it, for His
   mind is sensitive because of its supreme purity--yet, notwithstanding
   that, He came into the world to save sinners! And with sinners He
   mixed, even with publicans and harlots! With sinners He sat at meat.
   With sinners He lived. With sinners He died! He made His grave with the
   wicked. He entered Paradise with a thief! And today, those who sing the
   new song in Heaven confess that they were sinners, for they say, "You
   were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every
   kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation." Yes, notwithstanding the
   pollution of sin, Christ came to save sinners!

   He came, also, to save sinners under the curse. Sin is a cursed thing.
   God has never blessed sin and He never will do so. Though sin may seem
   to flourish, for a time, the blight of the Almighty is upon it--the
   breath of the great Judge of All will wither up everything that grows
   of evil. He cannot bear it--His fire shall burn, even to the lowest
   Hell, against all iniquity! And yet, though you are under the curse,
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save the accursed sinner by taking
   the curse upon Himself, and Himself hanging on the tree of the curse,
   and bearing the curse for us, that we might be saved! Do you feel the
   curse of God in your spirit, tonight? Does it seem to dry up all the
   springs of your life? Then remember, notwithstanding that, "Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners."

   Once more, Christ came to save sinners without strength. Sin brings
   death. Wherever sin reigns, the power to do good dies out. "Can the
   Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you,
   also, do good that are accustomed to do evil." But when you are without
   strength, ah, even without strength to believe on Him--without strength
   to feel your sin, without strength to feel even a desire to be
   better--even then it is true that "Christ Jesus came into the world to

   save sinners." I know He did, for the first good desires are His gift.
   The first prayers are His own breath. The first sigh under the burden
   of sin is His own work. Jesus does it all! He came into the world to
   save us. "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
   for the ungodly," those in whom there could not be any trace of
   goodness--"the un-godly"--those who were without God and without hope
   in the world. It is for such that Jesus Christ came into the world. I
   do not know how to set this gate open wider. I will take it right off
   its hinges and I will pull up post and bar and all and defy the very
   devils of Hell to come and shut this City of Refuge against any soul,
   here, that is a sinner! If you have sinned, behold, the voice of
   Everlasting Love speaks aloud to you, tonight, these words, "This is a
   faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners."

   II. I must not dwell long on any one word in our text, so I pass to
   another. In the second place, here is OUR NEED, OR A WIDE WORD OF
   SALVATION. We poor sinners need saving and, "Christ Jesus came into the
   world to save sinners."

   Jesus came to save. He did not come to condemn us. When God came down
   upon earth, it might have been thought that He must have come to
   condemn, for when He came down to look at the tower of Babel, and saw
   the sin of the world, He scattered the sinners upon the face of all the
   earth. Now, it might be thought that if He came on earth, He would be
   shocked and horrified by a personal investigation of sin and then would
   say, "I will destroy the world." But Jesus said, "The Son of Man is not
   come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." "God sent not His Son
   into the world to condemn the world; but that the world, through Him,
   might be saved." If you get condemnation out of the Gospel, you put the
   condemnation into it yourselves! It is not the Gospel, but your
   rejection of it, that will condemn you. Therefore, I pray God that you
   may never put from you the Word of God and judge yourselves unworthy of
   everlasting life, as they did to whom Paul and Barnabas preached at
   Antioch.

   But, next, Christ did NOT come into the world to help us to save
   ourselves. He came to save us--not to set us on our legs and say, "Now
   you do so much, and I will do the rest." No, He came to save us! From
   top to bottom salvation is all of Grace, and all the gift of God by
   Jesus Christ. He did not come into the world, I say, to make us
   salvable, but to save us--nor to put us in the way of somehow or other
   meriting salvation! He came, Himself, to be the Savior and to save
   sinners. Cannot you see that you, who have been trying to spin a robe
   of righteousness, got all that you did in the day unraveled before
   night? You who have been knitting part of a garment to cover your
   nakedness, put your knitting needles down, and take what Christ has
   finished! Come, you who have been working hard, like prisoners on a
   treadmill, trying to get to Heaven that way, you will never do it! See
   another ladder, like that which Jacob saw of old, that reaches from
   Heaven to earth, and from earth to Heaven, and may God enable you to
   climb to Him that way, but not by a way of your own! Jesus did not come
   to help us to save ourselves.

   And He did not come to save us in part, that we might do the rest. It
   takes a long time to make some men know this. I know numbers of
   Christian people who still have one foot on the rock, and the other
   foot on the sand. There is a certain, or rather, uncertain doctrine
   that always makes people feel unsafe. It is that you must not say that
   you are saved, but that if you hold on your way, and keep on the right
   road, then, perhaps, when you come to die, you may begin to hope that
   you are saved. I would not give two pence for such a Gospel as that! We
   need salvation given to us outright and given to us forever--and this
   is what Christ does give us when we come and trust in Him. "He that
   believes on Him is not condemned." He is saved, then and there, by the
   act of God. "He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until
   the day of Jesus Christ." He did not come to save us in part.

   And the Lord Jesus Christ has not come to make us content to be
   unsaved. I have sometimes heard people talk to the unconverted like
   this, "Now, you must wait. You must wait. You cannot do anything,
   therefore, sit still and wait until something happens to you." That is
   not the Gospel! The Gospel is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   you shall be saved." Read the Bible through and learn what God has
   revealed there. Lay aside your own system and notion. You will not find
   that the Lord Jesus Christ said to the man at Bethesda, "Now, lie at
   the pool till the angel comes and stirs it." That is old Judaism that
   does that! But Jesus said, "Rise, take up your bed, and walk." When
   Jesus speaks to sinners like that, they will rise and take up their
   beds and walk!

   Somebody says, "But you, poor minister that you are, cannot tell men to
   take up their beds and walk--and make them do it." Yes, we can, when
   our Master speaks through us, and when we deliver the Lord's message in
   faith, resting

   on the power of the Holy Spirit! We can still be used by the Lord to
   work miracles. The dry bones are made to hear the voice of the Lord's
   servant when the Holy Spirit goes with the voice and they are quickened
   by Divine power--

   "The Gospel bids the dead revive,

   Sinners obey the voice and live!

   Dry bones are raised, and clothed afresh,

   And hearts of stone are turned to flesh!" Again, I say, Jesus did not
   come to make sinners contented to be lost, or to sit down and wait as
   if salvation did not concern them. No, He came to save sinners.

   Well, what does it mean, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
   sinners? It means that He came to save them from the punishment of
   their sin. Their sin shall not be laid to their charge so that they
   shall be condemned for it. That is one thing. He came, also, to save
   them from the pollution of their sin, so that, though their mind has
   been debased, and their taste degraded, and their conscience deadened
   by sin, He came to take that evil away and give them a tender heart, a
   hatred of sin, a love for holiness and a desire for purity. But Jesus
   came to do more than that. He came to take away our tendencies to sin,
   tendencies which are born in us and grow with us. He came, by His
   Spirit, to eradicate them, to pluck them up by the roots, to put within
   us another principle which shall fight with the old principle of sin
   and overcome it-- till Christ, alone, shall reign, and every thought
   shall be brought into captivity to Him. He came to save His people from
   apostasy. He came into the world to save sinners by keeping them
   faithful to the end so that they shall not go back unto perdition--

   "Yes, I to the end shall endure,

   As sure as the earnest is given.

   More happy, but not more secure,

   The glorified spirits in Heaven." A very important part of the work of
   Grace is this. To start a man right is but little, but to keep that man
   holding on, even to the end--this is a triumph of Almighty Grace, and
   this is what Christ has come to do! Jesus came into the world, not to
   half save you, not to save you in this direction or that, and in this
   light or that, but to save you from your sin, to save you from an angry
   temper, to save you from pride, to save you from strong drink, to save
   you from covetous-ness, to save you from every evil thing--and to
   present you faultless before the Presence of His Glory with exceeding
   joy! This is a grand word, "Christ Jesus came into the word to save
   sinners." Oh, that you might believe it! I pray God that out of this
   congregation, which is wonderfully large for such a night, and yet
   small compared with our usual number on a Thursday evening, there may
   be very many who will say, "Yes, I believe that Jesus came to save
   sinners and I trust Him to save me." You will be saved the moment that
   you do that, for faith is the mark of His salvation, the proof that He
   has saved you!

   III. But now, thirdly, there is a name here. We have had our own name,
   sinners. Now here is HIS NAME, OR A GLORIOUS WORD OF HONOR--"Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners." Christ Jesus! Not an angel,
   not the best of men, but Christ Jesus!

   "Christ" means, as you know, Anointed, that is, God sent Him, anointed
   by His own Spirit, prepared, fitted, qualified and endowed for the work
   of saving. Jesus comes not without an anointing from God! He is not an
   amateur Savior, come on His own account, without any commission or
   authority, but God has anointed Him in order that He may save sinners.
   When He went into the synagogue at Nazareth on the Sabbath, He applied
   to Himself the words of the Prophet Elijah, "The Spirit of the Lord is
   upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor;
   He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the
   captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them
   that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."

   The other part of His name is "Jesus," that is, Savior. He has come,
   therefore, to be the Anointed Savior, commissioned to be a Savior, and
   if He is not a Savior, (I say it with all reverence), He is nothing! He
   came into the world to save and if He does not save, He has missed His
   mark! He laid His heavenly Glories down to take this still higher
   Glory, that He might be the Savior of sinners. The angels sang
   concerning Him, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good
   will toward men." And the angel of the Lord said to Joseph--"You shall
   call His name, Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins."
   Beloved, notice this--the Savior of sinners is not the Virgin
   Mary--saints are not saviors, but, "God so loved the world, that He
   gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
   perish, but have

   everlasting life." Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
   "very God of very God," the Creator of all things, sustaining all
   things by the word of His power. He came into the world, to Bethlehem's
   manger and afterwards to Calvary's Cross, with this as His one
   business--that He might save sinners! Is He not able to save? Is He not
   just the Savior that we need? God and yet Man in one Person! He is able
   to sympathize because He is Man, and He is able to save because He is
   God! Blessed God-Man, Jesus Christ, only You are able to save me!

   I cannot dwell longer on that part of my theme, but I wish that you who
   are seeking salvation would let your thoughts dwell upon it until you
   have truly trusted Him as your Savior.

   IV. The fourth thing in the text is HIS DEED, OR A SURE WORD OF FACT.
   "Christ Jesus came into the world."

   We have not to look to what He will do to save sinners, for He has done
   it!

   He came into the world. He existed long before He came out of Heaven
   into this world. He was in the beginning with God and He came here. You
   and I began our existence here, but He existed from the beginning! In
   the Glory of the Father and in the fullness of time He came into the
   world. He came willingly. It is put so in our text--"Christ Jesus came
   into the world." There is a kind of voluntariness evident in the words.
   He was sent, for He is the Christ, the Messiah, but He came of His own
   free will--

   "Down from the shining seats above, With joyful haste He fled."

   He came into the world. I say, again, the salvation of sinners is not a
   thing to be accomplished in the future. If God had promised it, we
   might trust as Abraham did, when He saw Christ's day afar off and was
   glad, but Jesus has come--He has been here--God Almighty has been here
   in human form, dwelling among men! He came into the world to save
   sinners.

   He came into the world so far that He knew the world's griefs and bore
   them, the world's penalty, the world's shame and reproach, the world's
   sickness and the world's death. He came into the world, into the very
   center and heart of this ungodly world, and there He dwelt, "holy,
   harmless, and undefiled."

   Christ Jesus came into the world and when He came here, it was such a
   wonderful coming that He stayed here. Some 33 years He was here and all
   that while He was still seeking to save sinners. During the last three
   years He went about doing good, always hunting up sinners--and at the
   end of His service for sinners He stretched out His hands and feet, and
   yielded up Himself to die for sinners. He breathed out His very soul
   for sinners. "Who His own Self bore our sins in His own body on the
   tree."

   I do not feel that I have any need to find any words of mine to try to
   garnish this Gospel of the Glory of the Blessed God. It is the greatest
   theme on which a man ever spoke! It needs no oratory to set it forth!
   The story, itself, is marvelous, "the old, old story of Jesus and His
   love." God could not in justice pass over human sin without an
   atonement, but He made the Atonement, Himself! Jesus, who is One with
   the Father, came here and offered Himself as a Sacrifice that He might
   save sinners.

   Now, if He does not save sinners, His coming here is a failure. Do you
   believe, can you imagine, that Christ's coming into the world could be
   a failure? In my very soul I believe that all He meant to accomplish by
   His coming here He will accomplish--that no man shall ever be able to
   point to any failure in this grandest of Divine enterprises! There is
   no failure in Creation--there will be no failure in Providence! And
   when the whole story is ended, there will be no failure in this great
   work of Redemption! "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,"
   and sinners shall be saved. Will you be among them, my dear Hearer? Why
   should you not be among them?

   V. Once more. We have here, in the fifth place, OUR ACCEPTANCE, OR A
   WORD OF PERSONALITY. The

   Apostle says, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of
   whom I am chief." I am not going to dispute with the Apostle and yet,
   if he were here, I should be a little dubious as to his right to the
   title of, "chief of sinners," and I would ask him whether, if he were
   chief, I was not the next. I suppose that there are many here who would
   say, "Paul sinned no more grievously than we did before our
   conversion." I remember, in preaching once, I said that if I ever got
   to Heaven, those lines would be true of me--

   "Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing, While Heaven's resounding
   mansions ring, With shouts of Sovereign Grace."

   When I had done preaching, a lady met me in the aisle and she said,
   "You made one mistake in your sermon." "Oh, dear Heart!" I replied, "I
   daresay I made twenty." She said, "But the one you made was this. You
   said that you would sing the loudest when you got to Heaven--but you
   will not. When I get there, I shall owe more to the Grace of God than
   you will--you have not been such a sinner as I have been." Well, I
   found all the other saints around us were of a mind to contest about
   which should praise God most because of the great things He had done
   for them in saving their souls! Ralph Erskine wrote a hymn about the
   contention among the birds of paradise as to which should praise God
   best, and he describes the different kinds of people in Heaven all
   vying with each other in magnifying the name of the Lord who had
   redeemed them! But that is not my theme just now.

   When we come and appropriate this sinner's Savior, we do it, first, by
   a confession. "Lord, I am a sinner. I know it. I mourn over it. I
   confess to You that I have broken Your righteous Law." Then there
   follows, on that confession, a sense of humiliation. Did Jesus come
   into the world to save me? Then I am a greater sinner than I thought I
   was, first, that I should need the Son of God to save me and, next,
   that I should sin against love so amazing, so surprising, as to rebel
   against One who would come into the world to save me! The more we
   appreciate Christ's saving sinners, the more we depreciate ourselves.
   He who has a great Savior will feel himself to be a great sinner. And
   he who has the best and clearest view of Christ is the man who will
   say, "Of whom--namely, of the saved sinners--I am chief."

   Now, this appropriation of Christ, which began with confession and went
   on to deep self-humiliation, flowers into faith, because, notice, the
   Apostle says, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of
   whom I am chief." Though he says that he is chief of them, yet he
   means, also, "I am one of those He came to save." "Of whom I am chief."
   "Oh, yes, I am one of those he came to save!" Faith enables the soul to
   say that. My dear Friends, I do trust that, by the Grace of God, many
   of you will say that, tonight. "Lord Jesus, I trust in You. Of the
   multitude that You did come to save, who are described as sinners, I am
   one."

   This appropriation of Christ by faith will go on to open confession of
   Him. The Apostle confesses that, while he was the chief of sinners, yet
   Christ died for him, and you will be led to make that confession. I
   hope that you will do it as our friends are going to do it tonight--by
   obedience to Christ's Law in Baptism, as He bids you, "He that believes
   and is baptized, shall be saved."

   One thing I notice about my text which greatly delights me. Paul says,
   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief."
   No, no, Paul, that expression will not do! Why, my dear Man, you are a
   scholar, and yet you have made a mistake in the tense of the verb! It
   is not sum, "I am," but fui, "I was." "No, no," says Paul, "never bring
   your Latin in here. My Greek expression is, 'I am chief.'" "What? After
   being saved, after being forgiven, still are you chief of sinners?"
   "Yes," he says, "it is so." And it is possible for a man to be not a
   whit behind the very chief of the Apostles and yet to feel that, in
   putting his whole life together, he has to take his place among the
   sinners, yes, at the head of them, as the chief of sinners!

   I think I told you that I once tried the plan, which some of our
   Brothers and Sisters try, of praying to God as a saint. Why, I have
   seen some of our Brethren, when they have had a Sunday out, with their
   best go-to-meeting clothes on, talk about their being perfect, and they
   looked exactly like the peacock I saw with his tail spread out,
   strutting along so grandly! Well, I rather liked the look of that fine
   show--there was something very beautiful in it--so I tried it, myself,
   once. I went to God in prayer boasting about my virtues, my
   attainments, my growth in His Grace and my service for Him. I think
   that I have as good a right to do that as anybody else has. I have
   served God with all my might and I have laid everything at His feet.
   But when I tried to pray that way, I knocked at the gate and nobody
   came! I knocked again, but nobody came. There is a little wicket, you
   know, that they open, just to look out to see who is there. So they
   asked, "Who is that knocking?" I answered, "Oh, it is a saint! It is
   one who has grown in Grace until he is perfectly sanctified, one who
   has preached the Gospel for many years."

   They just shut the gate at once--they did not know anything about me in
   that capacity! So I stood there and got nothing. At last,
   broken-hearted and full of grief, I knocked again with all my might,
   and when they asked, "Who is there?" I said, "Here is a poor sinner who
   has often come to Christ in that capacity, and has taken Him to be his
   whole righteousness and salvation, and he has come, again, just as he
   used to come." "Ah!" they said, "it is you, is it? We have known you
   for many years! You are always welcome." I found that I had access to
   my God when I said, "I am the chief of sinners. I am still a sinner."

   Well, now, putting myself in that position where I always must be and
   always hope to be, I would say to any sinner here, whoever yon may be,
   come, Friend, come along with me to the Cross! One says, "But I cannot
   go with you. You have been a minister of the Gospel these 30 years and
   more." My dear Friend, I am still a poor sinner and I have to look to
   Christ every day as I did at the very first. Come along with me! Come
   along with me! It is many, many years since, on a snowy morning, I
   looked to Him and was lightened. I wish that, this snowy night, some
   soul here would look to Him and live!

   I had much more to say, but the time has gone, so I just leave you with
   my text, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." It is a
   blessed proverb, an Apostolic proverbial saying--but it is a true
   saying--"It is a faithful saying." Everybody who has tried it has found
   it true! It is worthy of the acceptation of you all, and it is worthy
   of all the acceptation that any one of you can give to it. You may come
   and trust your soul on it for time and for eternity! You may come with
   all your burden of sin upon your shoulders. You may come with all your
   need of feeling, with all your hardness of heart and just take as your
   Savior this Jesus Christ who came into the world to save sinners! Only
   trust Him and when you have trusted Him, you have done much more than
   you dream. Some people think that there is nothing in faith, but God is
   pleased with it and, "without faith it is impossible to please God." If
   God is pleased with it, there is a great deal more in it than some
   imagine! That faith contains within itself a future life of holiness!
   It is the one acorn out of which countless forests will yet grow!

   Believe! May the Lord help you to believe in Jesus immediately! Ere you
   leave this place, trust Him! Trust Him wholly. He came to save sinners.
   Let Him save you! It is His business--it is not yours. Leave yourself
   in His hands and He will save you, to the praise of the glory of His
   Grace.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. 1 TIMOTHY 1:1-17.

   Verse 1. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
   Savior and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope. Christ is our hope. We
   have not a shadow of a hope apart from Him. I remember, when on the
   Continent, seeing on a cross the words, "Spes unica," the unique, the
   only hope of man--and that is true of the Cross of Christ, and of
   Christ who suffered on it. He is our hope!

   2. Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from
   God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. Notice the Apostle's triple
   salutation, "Grace, mercy, and peace." Whenever Paul writes to a
   Church, he wishes "Grace and peace." But to a minister he wishes,
   "grace, mercy, and peace." Ah, we need mercy more than the average of
   Christians! We have greater responsibilities and, consequently, might
   more readily fall into greater sin--so to a minister Paul's salutation
   is, "Grace, mercy, and peace."

   3, 4. As I besought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
   Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other
   doctrine, neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
   minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so
   do. You see, the Apostle, in his day, had to contend against those who
   ran away from the simplicity of the Gospel into all manner of fables
   and inventions. Such, in our day, are the doctrine of evolution, the
   doctrine of the universal fatherhood of God, the doctrine of
   post-mortem salvation, the doctrine of the final restitution of all
   men, and all sorts of fables and falsehoods which men have invented!

   5-7. Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
   of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: from, which some having
   swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; desiring to be teachers
   of the Law; understanding neither what they say, nor of which they
   affirm. There were some who put the Law of God into its wrong place.
   They made it a way of salvation--which it never was meant to be, and
   never can be. It is a way of conviction! It is an instrument of
   humbling! It shows us the evil of sin, but it never takes sin away.

   8. But we know that the Law is good, if a man uses it lawfully. In its
   own place it has its own uses, and these are most important.

   9-13. Knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but
   for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for
   unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,
   for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
   mankind, for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if
   there is any other

   thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; according to the glorious
   Gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. And I thank
   Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that He counted me
   faithful, putting me into the ministry; who was before a blasphemer.
   Paul must have written this verse with many tears. What a wonder of
   Divine Grace it was that he should be put into the sacred ministry, to
   bear testimony for Christ, when he had been, before, a blasphemer!

   13. And a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy because I did
   it ignorantly in unbelief. He almost thought that if he had done all
   this willfully, he might not have been forgiven, but he felt that,
   here, God spied out the only extenuating circumstance, namely, that he
   was mistaken--"I did it ignorantly, in unbelief."

   14, 15. And the Grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith
   and love which is in Christ Jesus. This is a faithful saying, and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners; of whom I am, chief. He spoke from his heart, from deep
   experience. This, indeed, was, to him, the glorious Gospel of the
   blessed God that had saved him, the very chief of sinners! He could,
   therefore, with confidence commend it to others as worthy of all
   acceptation.

   16. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
   Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which
   should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting. The case of Paul
   is not a singular one--it is the pattern one. If there are any here who
   feel that they have sinned like Saul of Tarsus, they may be forgiven
   like Paul the Apostle! He is a pattern to all who should thereafter
   believe in Christ to life everlasting! Just as we often see things cut
   out in brown paper and sold as patterns, so is the Apostle Paul the
   pattern convert! What God did for him, He can do for thousands of
   others.

   17. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
   be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. Paul could not help this
   outburst of praise! He must put in a doxology. When he remembered his
   own conversion and pardon, and his being entrusted with the ministry of
   the Gospel, he was obliged to put down his pen and lift up his voice in
   grateful thanksgiving to God. So may it be with us as we remember what
   great things the Lord has done for us!

Marah Better Than Elim

   (No. 2301)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MARCH 26, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   4, 1889.

   "So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the
   wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
   found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of
   the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was
   called Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall
   we drink? And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree,
   which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet:
   there He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved
   them, and said, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD
   your God, and will do that which is right in His sight, and will give
   ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of
   these diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I
   am the LORD that heals you." Exodus 15:22-26.

   AFTER I had fallen down at Mentone, and was grievously ill, a Brother
   in Christ called to me and said, "My dear Friend, you have now come to
   Marah." I replied, "Yes, and the waters are bitter." He then said, "But
   Marah is better than Elim, for in Elim the Israelites only drank of the
   water and ate of the fruit of the palm trees, and that was soon over.
   But at Marah we read that God, 'made for them a statute and an
   ordinance,' and that was never over. That statute and ordinance stood
   fast and will stand fast for Israel as long as they are a nation. There
   is much more benefit to be reaped from Marah than from Elim." I thanked
   my friend for that good word. I had found it true before. I have found
   it true since then and you and I, if we are, indeed, the people of God,
   will find it true to the end, that Marah, though it is bitter, is also
   better. And albeit that we do not like it, yet in the end there shall
   be no bitterness in it, but an unutterable sweetness which shall be
   ours through time and eternity!

   We have a long record about Marah, have we not? I have read you four
   verses concerning Marah. How many verses have we about Elim? Only one.
   Does Marah deserve to be talked about four times as much as Elim?
   Perhaps it does. Perhaps there is four times as much fruit to be
   obtained from the bitter waters of Marah than from the 12 springs of
   water, and 70 palm trees at Elim. Who knows? This I know, however, that
   we are very apt to talk more about our bitters than about our
   sweets--and that is a serious fault. It were well if we had fewer
   murmuring words for our sorrows and more songs of thanksgiving for our
   blessings. Yet Holy Writ seems, here, to speak after the manner of men,
   and to let us have the four verses for the trial, and the one verse for
   the delight! Still, as it speaks, also, after the manner of God, I
   gather that Marah is, after all, more noteworthy than Elim and, truly,
   there does come to God's people something better out of their troubles
   than out of their joys.

   Certainly one thing is clear, Israel had no miracle at Elim. Wells and
   palm trees they had, but they had no miracle, there, no miraculous
   change of the bitter into the sweet. And they had no statute, and no
   ordinance, and no promise, and no new Revelation of God, and no new
   name for Jehovah, there. All that belonged to Marah, "for there He made
   them a statute and an ordinance." And there He promised, if they were
   faithful and obedient, that He would put none of the diseases of Egypt
   upon them. And there He revealed Himself as Jehovah Rophi, "the Lord
   that heals you." Oh, yes, there are many virtues and many blessings in
   the bitter waters of Marah! Often have we found it true that, "Sweet
   are the uses of adversity."

   I hope that nobody here thinks that these Israelites experienced a
   small trial. We are not accustomed to traveling in the desert, but
   those who are, tell us that thirst in the wilderness is something awful
   to endure. For all that great host to go three days without water must
   have been a very trying experience. You would not like to try that even
   in this country,

   but what must it be to go three days in the wilderness, beneath a
   burning sky, without a drop of water to drink? Then came the bitter
   disappointment at Marah. Probably the people knew that there were water
   springs ahead, so they hurried up to the place to drink, but when they
   stooped to taste the waters, they found that they were bitter. They
   could not drink of them and there they stood, in their desperation,
   with the long thirst parching their throats, and bitter disappointment
   adding to their agony! And they murmured against Moses, saying, "What
   shall we drink?" I say not this to excuse them, but lest you should
   think that they had only a small trial to bear.

   Remember, also, that this was a new form of trial. They never lacked
   for water in Egypt--there were plenty of rivers and canals there--and
   they could drink as much as they chose. This was an experience to which
   they were quite unaccustomed and I should not wonder if they were
   greatly surprised at it, for they knew that they were the people of
   God. They had just seen the Lord divide the Red Sea and drown their
   enemies--and now He has brought them out of Egypt to let them perish of
   thirst in the wilderness? They fancied that they were going to have one
   long triumphant march right into the Promised Land, or to be always
   dandled upon the lap of Providence, and indulged in every way, like
   spoiled children. They must have stood aghast at finding that, when the
   earth yielded water to slake their thirst, it was such water as they
   could not drink!

   Well, now, this kind of surprise happens to many who have set out on
   the way to Heaven. God has been very gracious to them--their sins are
   washed away and they think that the great joy which they have lately
   experienced will never be taken away from them and will never be even
   diminished. They reckon upon a long day without a cloud. God has
   favored them so much that they cannot imagine that they shall have any
   trial or any bitterness. It is not so, Beloved! A Christian is seldom
   long at ease! No sooner does he start out on pilgrimage to Heaven than
   he meets with difficulty and, as he goes on, he finds out that the way
   to Heaven is not a rolled pathway--it is up hill and down dale--through
   the mire and through the slough, over mountain and through the sea! It
   is by their trials and afflictions that the people of God are proved to
   be His children! They cannot escape the rod, whoever may--yet this
   experience does, at first, come as a very great surprise to them, so I
   want to talk, tonight, to some who have been lately brought to rejoice
   in the Lord's pardoning mercy, but are now staggered because they have
   come to an encampment in the wilderness where their thirsty mouths are
   filled with bitterness.

   I begin my discourse by saying that this experience was a great gain to
   Israel. Marah, with all its trials, was no loss to them. They made a
   decided advance in three things through having to endure this trial.
   They were gainers, first, by examination. Next, by experience. And,
   thirdly, by education.

   I. First, Israel's trial at Marah was a gain to them by EXAMINATION. It
   was to that end that they were brought there, that they might be
   examined by the Lord--"There he proved them."

   Speaking of Israel at Marah, let me say, first, that they were in a new
   position. They were no longer slaves, they were not in Egyptian
   territory. The Red Sea rolled between them and their former lives and
   their former masters. But it is evident from their conduct that they
   were not altogether a new people. They had brought a great deal of evil
   out of Egypt with them. When you heard them sing, you said, "It is
   strange that those poor slaves can sing such a jubilant song. Those
   women, so accustomed to carry heavy burdens of earth, how merrily they
   dance! How joyfully they strike the timbrels! Israel has certainly
   become a new race. What a grand choir they make! What singing is
   theirs! Who would have dreamt that those who cried by reason of their
   taskmasters would ever sing like that?" Yes, but when they were tried
   and tested, it was found that the old stuff was still in them--they
   murmured just as they had often done before when, in the land of Egypt,
   they had blamed Moses because their burdens were increased.

   We, too, have entered quite a new state. Some of you, perhaps, have
   lately become new creatures in Christ Jesus. Between you and your old
   sins there rolls a deep, impassable sea--you will never go back to them
   again. Ah, but do not begin to flatter yourselves that you have left
   behind you all your old selves! There remains, still, even in the
   regenerate, the old lusts of the flesh! They have had their heads
   broken, but they still live! They have been crucified, their hands and
   feet are fastened to the wood, crucified with Christ--but they live for
   all that! And they struggle on the Cross and you must not marvel, if,
   when you are tried and proved, you find that you are like these
   Israelites at Marah.

   Notice, next, that the trial to which Israel was subjected was the
   Lord's own test, which is searching and accurate-- "He proved them." We
   sit down and practice self-examination, which is a very proper thing.
   Beware, I pray you, of a faith that will not stand self-examination! If
   you dare not look into your own heart, it must be because there is
   something

   rotten there. The tradesman who is afraid to inspect his books, or
   examine his stock, is going to the bad, rest assured of that. We are
   bound to examine ourselves very carefully, but, after all, our
   examinations are very superficial, very partial, and we are very apt to
   make a mistake. In the case of Israel, the Lord proved them by that
   thirst in the wilderness and that great agony on finding that the water
   they looked for was undrinkable. "He proved them." The Lord may be
   bringing some of you into deep waters and great trials because He is
   proving you. When the fan is in His hand, then does He thoroughly purge
   His floor. When He sits as a Refiner of silver, believe me, it is no
   child's play to be in the crucible! The Lord took Israel to those
   waters on purpose to prove them. Have you never prayed, "Search me, O
   God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts"? The Lord may
   answer you in a way of which you little dream--He may conduct you to
   some waters of Marah that He may test you and prove you.

   Well, now, under the test, see what happened to Israel. Their faith in
   God evaporated. That question, "What shall we drink?" has not a trace
   of faith in it! I hear it shouted, in different tones, by men, women
   and children--and it all comes to the same thing, "We hoped to quench
   our thirst here, but we cannot drink this water, and now, what shall we
   drink?" As if God could not, having dried up the sea, turn the earth
   into a fountain of water! He that made them a path through the midst of
   the deep waters could make a path for waters to come to them! There was
   no trace of faith in the murmurers at Marah. They seemed full of faith
   at the Red Sea, did they not? Many dancers, but no doubters! Many
   singers, but no unbelievers! Yet the whole company had not more than a
   pennyworth of faith among them. Moses was the only one who truly
   believed God--but as for the faith of the rest of them, it was mere
   gilt--veneer of faith covering a solid mass of unbelief!

   Not only did their faith fail, but their love to God was very feeble.
   Did you not hear them three days ago? Why, you can almost hear the
   strain of their jubilant song, "He is my God and I will prepare Him an
   habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt Him." Oh, how they love
   Jehovah, do they not? They were in the love of their espousals! They
   went after Him into the wilderness. But now the cry is, "What shall we
   drink?" And they murmured against Moses. Theirs was a cupboard love,
   like yours and mine often is. They loved God very much for what they
   got out of Him and if He would not give them water to drink, what cared
   they for Him? If He would divide the Red Sea for them, then He would be
   their God and they would prepare Him a habitation. But if He let them
   suffer the pangs of thirst, there should be no blessings for Him on
   their lips! Ah, me, how like ourselves were these people! When we test
   ourselves, we say, "Lord, You know all things, You know that I love
   You." And I hope that that is correct. But when the Lord proves us, and
   we are very sharply tested, we are apt to say, "Nobody was ever tried
   as we are! Nobody ever had the peculiar difficulties that surround us!"
   And then we begin murmuring. When we are thinking of how much we love
   God, it might be more profitable to consider how very little we really
   love Him, after all.

   And see, Brothers and Sisters, these people were ready to break away
   from their God. They murmured against Moses because Moses was visible
   in their midst--but the real murmuring was against God, Himself! They
   might ask, as long as they liked, "What shall we drink?" but they could
   not get a drop of water by repeating that question a thousand times.
   Would they go back to Egypt? How would they cross the sea? What would
   Pharaoh and the Egyptians think of them if they did go back? Could they
   force their way forward through that terrible wilderness? There they
   stood, entirely dependent upon God, and yet with scarcely a particle of
   faith in Him! And their love all shriveled up--and all that within
   three days! O Israel, it is early days to be falling out with your new
   Husband! They had just been married to the Lord by a new Covenant and
   baptized in the cloud and in the sea--yet within three days they are
   ready to fling it all up and to say, as they did in their
   hearts--"Would to God that we had remained in the land of Egypt!" Oh,
   what poor, faithless, treacherous, deceitful creatures we are! It is
   only Divine Grace that makes us anything worth having. It is a wonder
   of mercy that the Lord puts up with us.

   This, then, was Israel's examination. "Well," you say, "did they gain
   much by that?" Oh, yes! It is always a gain to a man to know the truth
   about himself. A captain must find his longitude and latitude, that he
   may know whereabouts his vessel is upon the sea. And this, I believe,
   is one of the things God would have His people do. The Lord does not
   wish His children to live in a fool's paradise and to fancy that they
   are rich, and increased in goods, and have need of nothing, when they
   are naked, and poor, and blind, and miserable! He sends us our Marahs,
   just to blow away our shams and get rid of our pretences, that we may
   build our house on the Rock, that what is built may be founded on real
   granite and may endure even to the end.

   So much for the examination of the children of Israel at Marah.

   II. But now, beloved Friends, these people gained much by EXPERIENCE.
   Experience cannot be the property of the beginner--he must acquire it.
   Now what did the children of Israel experience?

   First, they learned that the wilderness was the same to them as it was
   to other people. It is well that young converts should know that this
   world is an evil world even to the man who is saved by Divine Grace.
   You are new, but the world is not. You love holiness, but the world
   neither loves you, nor loves holiness. You are in a wilderness--you are
   in the enemy's country--you have not yet come into your rest. If you
   have not learned this fact, yet, you will have to learn it.

   They were to learn, next, that they were wholly dependent upon God.
   When they stood at the brink of the Red Sea, they saw that they were
   so, and that only God could lead them through the sea. But after that,
   they were just as dependent. They could not live longer without water,
   they must perish of thirst unless God supplied them. It is a blessed
   lesson for us to learn that we are entirely dependent upon God for all
   things, but especially for spiritual things. You will not pray unless
   He gives you the Spirit of supplication. You will have no tenderness of
   heart unless He works repentance in you. You will have no more faith
   unless faith is constantly bestowed by God. We are just like these
   gaslights--a candle may depend upon its own resources, but this light
   cannot. Only cut the connection between it and the reservoir of gas
   and, straightway, out it must go. We depend upon God every instant as
   much as we did at first and all our old experience, all that we have
   learned, and known, and taught, will stand us in no stead whatever
   unless we continue perpetually to receive from God. That was the lesson
   Israel had to learn.

   They also learned that God and God, alone, would provide. They might
   have to go very short of supplies at times and they might have a long
   thirst, but the Lord would not let one of them die of thirst. There is
   no record that even the tiniest babe in the camp, or even a sheep or
   goat in that mighty throng, perished for lack of water! God did
   provide. He does not promise that there shall always be a dinner ready
   when the dinner bell rings. You have not such an appetite as you would
   afterwards have if you waited another hour and, sometimes, the Lord may
   keep you waiting for His supplies that you may enjoy them all the
   better when they do come. He never is before His time, but He never is
   behind His time, though He may be behind your time. God will provide.
   That day Israel began to understand that word of their father Abraham
   when He said to Isaac, as you remember, "My son, God will provide." Now
   it began to come home to the children of the tribes that God would
   surely provide--and He did provide for them this great necessary gift
   of water when they were in the wilderness. That is something to learn.
   Some of you people of God, here, have learned that lesson, for you have
   been in great straits and you have been fed by the constant provision
   of God.

   The Israelites were also to learn, in the next place, that God could
   make their bitters into sweets, and He could do that in a very simple
   way. But He could do it--and He could bring good out of evil, and
   satisfy them by that which formerly nauseated them. Have you learned
   that lesson? Some of you people of God, when you get bitter waters,
   want to throw them away. Do not throw a drop of it away, for that is
   the water you have yet to drink. Accept your afflictions! They are a
   part of your education. Accept your afflictions. When Job could say,
   "The Lord gave," it was easy to add, "and blessed be the name of the
   Lord." But he also added, "and the Lord has taken away." That was the
   bitter water, but he drank it, and it was sweet to his taste, and he
   blessed the name of the Lord for the taking as well as for the giving!
   God means to bless some of you by the enemy's curse. Though you do not
   know it, you are to be lifted up by those who are trying to pull you
   down. I noticed some of the papers writing unkindly of our dear friend,
   John McNeill, and saying all manner of hard things of him--and I
   rejoiced in my heart! I hoped that they would go ahead at that work. I
   remember how they did it to me--all the bitterness they could invent,
   in years gone by. Every form and fashion of abuse was heaped upon
   me--and what a wonderful advertisement it was! What a kindness they
   were doing me without intending it! Let them alone and, depend upon it,
   God will make the wrath of man to praise Him and the remainder of that
   wrath He will restrain.

   Next, notice, that God works by His own means. The Lord showed Moses a
   tree and when he cast that tree into the waters, they became sweet. I
   think, if I had been there, I should have suggested that Moses should
   use that rod of his. Did he not divide the Red Sea with it? Why not
   just put his rod into the water and stir it up, and make it sweet? Oh,
   yes, you know, we are always for running to old methods! But God is a
   Sovereign and He will work as He pleases. There was a tree growing
   there, perhaps the wood of it was bitter, certainly it had no efficacy
   for making bitter water sweet, but God bade Moses cast that tree into
   the waters--and as soon as it was done the waters were made sweet!

   Now, you have just to believe that God will help you. You do not know
   how He will do it and, perhaps, He will not help you in the old way. Do
   not despair because Moses does not bring out his rod, for the Lord can
   relieve you without that! That dear friend who has helped you so many
   years is gone. Well, but God is not gone and He is not dependent upon
   that one person, nor upon any other! Therefore leave God as a King to
   do as He pleases, for His pleasure is the wis-est--and let His pleasure
   be your pleasure.

   Israel also learned by experience that God Himself was to be looked to,
   and nobody else. If there were waters beneath their feet, they were of
   no value until God spoke sweetness into them. If Moses, himself, stood
   there, he could do nothing but pray to the Lord. God, Himself, must
   come and, by a miracle, must make the water fit to drink. Brothers and
   Sisters, it is always a gain to us in our experience when we get
   farther and farther away from every dependence but the Lord! You may
   have friends forsaking you and they who used to praise you may now be
   speaking evil of you. And you may come, at last, to feel that you have
   nothing but God to depend upon--then is the time that faith really
   comes into exercise! I could not help laughing when I read the story of
   a good Christian lady who spoke of our friend, Mr. Hudson
   Taylor--"Why," she said, "there is no Society to take care of him! Poor
   man, he has nobody but God to depend upon!" You may well smile. "Nobody
   but God to depend upon"--but that is everybody to depend upon! Oh, if
   we could only be brought to that experience, Marah's waters would,
   indeed, be a heavenly tonic to us! The child of God who has learned
   this Truth of God, experimentally, can say, "My soul is weaned from all
   the nether springs, but she drinks from the upper spring that flows
   from beneath the Throne of God, and she finds every drop to have a
   heavenly sweetness in it."

   Thus Israel gained by experience as well as by examination.

   III. Now comes the third point--Israel gained by EDUCATION. The Lord
   was not going to lead a mob of slaves into Canaan to go and behave like
   slaves there! They had to be tutored. The wilderness was the Oxford and
   Cambridge for God's students. There they went to the University and He
   taught and trained them, and they took their degree before they entered
   into the promised land. There is no University for a Christian like
   that of sorrow and trial.

   Now the Israelites were educated by Marah, first, in self-distrust. How
   could they ever trust themselves, again, when, three days after singing
   that jubilant song, they caught themselves murmuring against Moses? If
   they had been intelligent, as they were not, they would, each one, have
   said to his fellow, "Behold the boastfulness of our evil hearts." What
   a terrible drop it is from "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has
   triumphed gloriously: the horse and His rider has He thrown into the
   sea," to, "What shall we drink?" That is just how you and I come down
   when we are left to ourselves. Thus Israel learned self-distrust.

   Next, they learned, as I have told you before, daily dependence. They
   learned that they must depend upon God even for a drop of water. That
   is the dependence of a Christian. He has nothing and he can do nothing
   without his God. We have no bread, no water, no anything except as God
   shall give it to us. A blessed lesson was this for Israel. They were
   educated well at Marah.

   Next, they learned the power of prayer. Will you kindly fix your eyes
   upon those two verses, 24 and twenty-five? "And the people murmured
   against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried unto the
   Lord." Moses did not answer them. He did not upbraid them. He did not,
   even, begin to argue with them. But he cried unto the Lord and, thus,
   the people learned the power of prayer. They might have gone on
   murmuring until now if they could have lived so long-- and the waters
   of Marah would have been as bitter as ever. But Moses cried unto the
   Lord and that prayer did what all the murmuring could not do! Were half
   the breath we vainly spend in going round to our neighbors, asking
   their sympathy, spent in going directly to God in prayer, we should
   sooner get out of our troubles! "Straightforward makes the best
   runner," and he that runs straight to God in every time of adversity
   shall soon find relief.

   Again, at Marah the Israelites began to learn their separateness from
   Egypt. The Egyptians never drank these bitter waters but the Egyptians
   had foul diseases and terrible plagues. Now, the Lord tell His people
   that He will not put upon them any of the diseases of Egypt. God turned
   the rivers of Egypt into blood, but here He turns the bitter waters
   into fresh streams. His miracles were for Israel and against Egypt--and
   they began to clearly perceive that they had nothing to do with the
   Egyptians. They were a separated people. It is a valuable piece of
   education for a young Christian to find out that he does not belong to
   the world. The tendency is to think that, though you are in the Church,
   you can be in the world, too, and that you belong, in a measure, to
   both. That will never do! The Lord means to fetch His people right out
   of the world--and He will have them out! And if any of you try to be
   like the mouse behind the wainscot and only come

   out and feed in the dark--I mean that you come to Christ for a little
   food when nobody sees you and then go and hide away with the
   world--there will be a black cat after you before long! Some trouble or
   other will happen to you. That game will never please God and never
   profit you. Therefore drop it, I pray you, or else some bitter Marah
   will teach you that you are not of the world.

   Israel had next to learn the position of obedience. Will you kindly
   notice this? God did not say, "Do this and I will bring you out of
   Egypt." No, but after He brought them out, He said, "Hearken to My
   commandments, and keep My statutes." Salvation comes first and then
   obedience! Saved first, brought through the Red Sea with the high hand
   of God's gracious power and, after that, become His obedient people!
   Obedience follows after redemption and deliverance. First the blood of
   sprinkling on the doorposts and after that you shall give ear unto the
   voice of the Lord your God, and diligently hearken to Him.

   Israel also learned the nature of obedience. Obedience does not merely
   do what it knows it should do, but it finds out what it ought to do.
   Oh, you Christian people, do you make a practice of reading God's Word
   to see what He would have you do? I am afraid that there are some who
   make a point of not seeing some of the duties which are not pleasing to
   them. There are some who half shun portions of Scripture because they
   would trouble their consciences. Let it not be so with any of us, but
   let us listen diligently to the voice of the Lord our God. If you are
   saved, the kind of obedience that you are bound to render is that of a
   willing heart, which cries like Saul, "Lord, what will You have me to
   do?"

   Then, Israel learned the promise made to obedience--"If you will
   diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord, your God, and will do that
   which is right in His sight, and will give ear to His commandments and
   keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon you,
   which I have brought upon the Egyptians." For you there shall be no
   plagues. God may try you, yet it will be not in anger, but in His dear
   Covenant love. Everything shall be changed for you. If sickness comes,
   it shall be overruled for your spiritual health. When death comes, it
   shall only introduce you to eternal life. The Lord will be very
   gracious to you. He that forgives our sins also heals all our diseases.
   His name is Jehovah Rophi! What an education it is for us when we feel
   that the God that healed the waters, heals us, and heals everything
   that has to do with us! It changes the aspect of all things about us,
   takes the sting out of the wasp and turns it into a bee. It takes away
   the venom from the serpent and gives us its wisdom, that we may be wise
   as serpents, and harmless as doves! Oh, the wonderful cure-alls of God,
   the heavenly catholicon of the Cross, the universal remedy of a dying
   Savior! May our experience educate us in the knowledge of that gracious
   healing!

   The hour has struck and I must, therefore, cease. Only I must say that
   this is the one lesson of tonight--dear people of God, trust your God.
   Trust your God not only when your mouth is full of honey, but when it
   is full of gall. "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him," for He
   in whom you trust will bless you. But if you are not trusting Him, then
   shall plagues, like those of Egypt, come upon you. Darkness and all
   manner of evils shall waylay you, till, at last, there shall be heard
   in your house a bitter cry, for the Destroying Angel will overtake you,
   and plunge his avenging sword into your guilty hearts. God save you
   from that terrible doom, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. EXODUS 15; JEREMIAH 7:21-26.

   Exodus 15:1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto
   the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for He has
   triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has He thrown into the
   sea. Note, that they were singing, singing a very loud and triumphant
   song, and you would have thought that they would have kept on singing
   for the next 40 years! It was such a triumph, such a deliverance, God's
   arm was made so bare before their eyes that you would have thought that
   their jubilation would have lasted throughout a lifetime, at the least.
   On the contrary, it lasted a very little while. Yet what a song it was
   that they sang! "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." What a
   song of triumph that is which is sung by souls saved from sin, death
   and Hell by the great atoning Sacrifice of Christ! Oh, when we first
   realize that we are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we do,
   indeed, "feel like singing all the time," for our sins are washed away
   and we have a notion that we shall always keep on singing till we join
   in the song of the glorified in Heaven! So it ought to be, but, alas,
   from sad experience we know that it is not so! However, the song of
   Moses and the children of Israel goes on.

   2. The LORD is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation: He
   is my God, and I will prepare Him an habitation; my father's God, and I
   will exalt Him. The heart is prompted by gratitude to think of doing
   something for God. It thinks of preparing Him a habitation, but what
   habitation shall we prepare for Him whom the Heaven of heavens cannot
   contain? All that we can possibly do is too little for the greatness of
   His Grace and His Glory. "You did well that it was in your heart," said
   the Lord to David, though He might not prepare God a habitation. It is
   well that it is in our heart, today, to do some little thing for the
   Glory of God. As an old Puritan says we give for love-tokens a cracked
   sixpence, or a flower that soon fades. It is accepted as a love-token,
   not for its intrinsic value, but as an emblem of what our heart feels
   and would do if it could. Even so it is with the Lord and the service
   His people seek to render to Him. He takes our trifles and makes much
   of them.

   3-5. The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is His name. Pharaoh's chariots
   and His host has He cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are
   drowned in the Red Sea. The depths have covered them: they sank into
   the bottom as a stone. And this is what has happened to all the powers
   that were against us. Our sins, where are they? Has not the Lord cast
   them into the depths of the sea? Yes, blessed be His name forever! We,
   like Israel on the other side of the Red Sea, praise the Lord that we
   have escaped out of the hand of the oppressor and that Pharaoh holds us
   as servants no longer. To the Lord, alone, is due the glory of our
   deliverance.

   6-8. Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: Your right
   hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy. And in the greatness of
   Your excellence, You have overthrown them that rose up against You: You
   sent forth Your wrath, which consumed them as stubble. And with the
   blast of Your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods
   stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of
   the sea. What cannot God do? The liquid becomes solid! Nature, itself,
   changes when the God of Nature puts forth His power. Trust in God and
   He will do wonders for you, also, as He did for His ancient people
   Israel.

   9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
   spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
   hand shall destroy them. How the powers of darkness rage and rave! What
   a flurry they are in! What big words they speak! What cruel designs
   they harbor against God's people. See how still and calm is the Lord
   amid all their raging!

   10. You did blow with Your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as
   lead in the mighty waters. God has only to use His breath to blow upon
   them and away they go, and all their boastings, too! One word from the
   mouth of God can destroy all our doubts and fears. The breath of His
   Spirit can sink all our enemies and make us sing for joy of heart at
   our great deliverance.

   11-13. Who is like unto You, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like You,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? You stretched
   out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them. You in Your mercy have
   led forth the people which You have redeemed: You have guided them in
   Your strength unto Your holy habitation. The song becomes prophetic.
   All joy gets to be prophetic--at least, the joy of earth when once it
   is touched with the live coal from off the heavenly altar. We begin to
   praise God, "for all the Grace we have not tasted yet," as Israel here
   does. They praise the Lord for leading His people through the
   wilderness and bringing them unto His holy habitation, even while they
   are only at the beginning of their journey.

   14. The people--That is, the Canaanites--

   14, 15. Shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
   inhabitants of Palestina. Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the
   mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the
   inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. When they hear of the great
   things that Jehovah has done for His people, they shall feel that the
   day of their doom is come. Who can stand against so mighty a God? Yet
   there are some, in our day, whose hearts are stouter and harder than
   the hearts of the dukes of Edom and the mighty men of Moab. They hear
   of God's judgments upon the wicked and of the terrible doom of the
   ungodly, and yet they dare to defy the Lord and to continue in their
   evil ways!

   16-18. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of Your
   arm they shall be as still as a stone; till Your people pass over, O
   LORD, till the people pass over, which You have purchased. You shall
   bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, in
   the place, O LORD, which You have made for You to dwell in, in the
   Sanctuary, O LORD, which Your hands have established. The LORD shall
   reign forever and ever. How grandly that last note must have pealed

   forth from the hundreds of thousands of male voices! The women must
   also have sung it with the utmost conceivable joy as they struck their
   timbrels and danced before the Lord.

   19-22. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
   horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea
   upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
   the sea. And Miriam the Prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
   in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and
   with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing you to the LORD, for He has
   triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has He thrown into the
   sea. So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into
   the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
   found no water.

   At first, they were afraid of too much water, from the waves of the
   sea. Now they are afraid of too little. Will their songs be over in
   three days? Ah, yes! At the end of the third day they came to some
   springs of water, but they were brackish or bitter.

   23, 24. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters
   of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called
   Marah. And the people murmured--Ah, these singers had sadly changed
   their notes! Where are the timbrels now? "The people murmured"

   24-27. Against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried unto
   the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast into
   the waters, the waters were made sweet: there He made for them a
   statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them, and said, If you
   will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do
   that which is right in His sight, and will give ear to His
   commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these
   diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am
   the LORD that heals you. And they came to Elim. They did not stay long
   at Marah, probably only a few hours.

   27. Where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees
   and they encamped there by the waters. That Elim must have been
   prepared on purpose for Israel. Twelve springs of water--that was the
   number of the tribes. Threescore and ten palm trees--that was the
   number of the elders. I do not wonder that Moses noted these numbers.
   It must have seemed remarkable that, long before they came there, there
   were the wells and there were the palm trees all ready for their
   encampment! It was most significant that these things should have been
   prepared according to the number of the children of Israel, but
   everything else is arranged by the same rule. When the Lord divided the
   people, He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the
   children of Israel. It is by this line that He still builds His Church.
   It is according to His thoughts of His own people that He rules
   everything in His Providence.

   There are a few verses in the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah, at the
   seventh chapter, which we will read concerning this subject.

   Jeremiah 7:21, 22. Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel; Put
   your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. For I spoke
   not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought
   them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or
   sacrifices. You have heard what God said to them when they came out of
   Egypt.

   23-26. But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey My voice, and I
   will be your God, and you shall be My people: and walk you in all the
   ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. But they
   hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and
   in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not
   forward. Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
   Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all My servants the
   Prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: yet they hearkened
   not unto Me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did
   worse than their fathers. God grant that these words may never be a
   truthful description of us! Oh, may we keep the Covenant of our God and
   walk before Him with a holy, reverent fear, and serve Him all our days!
   Amen.

Watching For Christ's Coming

   (No. 2302)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 2, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   7 1889.

   "Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, shall find
   watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make
   them to sit down to eat, and will come forth and serve them. And if he
   shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find
   them so, blessed are those servants." Luke 12:37,38.

   I AM about to speak of the Second Coming of Christ and I felt thankful
   that my dear Brother's prayer, although we had not been in consultation
   with one another upon the matter, was in every way so suitable to the
   subject upon which I am to speak. He led us in prayer to think of our
   coming Lord, so that I trust you are on the margin of the subject, now,
   and that you will not have to make any very great exertion of mind to
   plunge into mid-stream and be carried away with the full current of
   thought concerning the Second Advent of the Savior. It is a very
   appropriate topic when we come to the Lord's Table, for, as that prayer
   reminded us, the Lord's Supper looks backward, and is a memorial of His
   agony. But it also looks forward and is an anticipation of His Glory.
   Paul wrote to the Church at Corinth, "For as often as you eat this
   bread, and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death till He comes." By
   looking forward, in a right state of heart, to that Second Coming of
   Christ which is the joy of His Church, you will also be in a right
   state of heart for coming to the Communion Table. May the Holy Spirit
   make it to be so!

   The posture at the Communion Table, as you know, according to our
   Lord's example, was not that of kneeling, but that of reclining. The
   easiest position which you can assume is the most fitting for the
   Lord's Supper, but remember that the supper was no sooner finished,
   than, "they sang a hymn," and when that hymn was concluded, they went
   out into the Mount of Olives to the agonies of Gethsemane. It often
   seems to me as if now, after finding rest at the Table by feeding upon
   Christ, whose real Presence we have--not after a carnal sort, but after
   a spiritual sort--after that, we sing a hymn, as if we would go out to
   meet our Lord in His Second Coming, not going to the Mount of Olives to
   see Him in a bloody sweat, but to hear that word of the angel, "This
   same Jesus, which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in
   like manner as you have seen Him go into Heaven."

   I do not think we ought to feel at all surprised if we were to go
   always expecting Him, not knowing at what hour the Master of the house
   shall come. The world does not expect Him--it goes on with its eating
   and drinking, its marrying and giving in marriage--but His own family
   should expect Him. When He will return from the wedding, I trust that
   He will not find the door shut against Him, but that we shall be ready
   to open to our Lord immediately when He knocks. That is the object of
   the few words that I shall have to say, tonight, to stir you up, and my
   own heart, also, to be always watching for Christ's Second Coming.

   I. First, THE LORD WILL COME. He that has come once is to come again.
   He will come a second time. The Lord will come.

   He will come again, for He has promised to return. We have His own word
   for it. That is our first reason for expecting Him. Among the last of
   the words which He spoke to His servant John are these, "Surely I come
   quickly." You may read it, "I am coming quickly. I am even now upon the
   road. I am traveling as fast as wisdom allows. I am always coming, and
   coming quickly." Our Lord has promised to come and to come in Person.
   Some try to explain the Second Coming of Christ as though it meant the
   Believer dying. You may, if you like, consider that Christ comes to His
   saints in death. In a certain sense, He does, but that sense will never
   bear out the full meaning of the teaching of the Second Advent with
   which the Scripture is full. No, "the Lord Himself shall descend from
   Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archan-

   gel, and with the trump of God." He who went up to Heaven will come
   down from Heaven and stand, in the latter day, upon the earth. Every
   redeemed soul can say with Job, "Though after my skin worms destroy
   this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for
   myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another." Christ will as
   certainly be here again in Glory as He once was here in shame, for He
   has promised to return.

   Moreover, the great scheme of redemption requires Christ's return. It
   is a part of that scheme that, as He came once with a sin offering, He
   should come a second time without a sin offering, that, as He came once
   to redeem, He should come a second time to claim the inheritance which
   He has so dearly bought. He came once, that His heel might be bruised.
   He comes, again, to break the serpent's head and, with a rod of iron,
   to dash His enemies in pieces, as potters' vessels. He came, once, to
   wear the crown of thorns. He must come, again, to wear the diadem of
   universal dominion. He comes to the marriage supper. He comes to gather
   His saints together. He comes to glorify them with Himself on this same
   earth where once He and they were despised and rejected of men.
   Understand this, that the whole drama of redemption cannot be perfected
   without this last act of the coming of the King!

   The complete history of Paradise Regained requires that the New
   Jerusalem should come down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a bride
   adorned for her husband--and it also requires that the heavenly
   Bridegroom should come riding forth on His white horse, conquering and
   to conquer, King of kings and Lord of lords, amidst the everlasting
   hallelujahs of saints and angels! It must be so. The man of Nazareth
   will come again! None shall spit in His face, then, but every knee
   shall bow before Him. The Crucified shall come, again, and though the
   nail prints will be visible, no nails shall, then, fasten His dear
   hands to the tree. But instead thereof, He shall grasp the scepter of
   universal sovereignty and He shall reign forever and ever. Hallelujah!

   When will He come? Ah, that is the question, the question of questions!
   He will come in His own time. He will come in due time. A brother
   minister, calling upon me, said, as we sat together, "I should like to
   ask you a lot of questions about the future." "Oh, well!" I replied, "I
   cannot answer you, for I daresay I know no more about it than you do."
   "But," he said, "what about the Lord's Second Advent? Will there not be
   the millennium, first?" I said, "I cannot tell whether there will be
   the millennium, first, but this I know, the Scripture has left the
   whole matter, as far as I can see, with an intentional indistinctness,
   that we may be always expecting Christ to come, and that we may be
   watching for His coming at any hour and every hour. I think that the
   millennium will commence after His coming, and not before it. I cannot
   imagine the Kingdom with the King absent. It seems to me to be an
   essential part of the Millennial Glory that the King shall then be
   revealed. At the same time, I am not going to lay down anything
   definite upon that point. He may not come for a thousand years. He may
   come tonight. The teaching of Scripture is, first of all, 'In such an
   hour as you think not, the Son of Man comes.' It is clear that if it
   were revealed that a thousand years must elapse before He would come,
   we might very well go to sleep for that time, for we should have no
   reason to expect that He would come when Scripture told us He would
   not."

   "Well," answered my friend, "but when Christ comes, that will be the
   General Judgment, will it not?" Then I quoted these texts, "The dead in
   Christ shall rise first." "But the rest of the dead lived not, again,
   until the thousand years were finished. This is the first
   resurrection." I said, "There is a resurrection from among the dead to
   which the Apostle Paul labored to attain. We shall all rise, but the
   righteous shall rise a thousand years before the ungodly. There is to
   be that interval of time between the one and the other. Whether that is
   the Millennial Glory, or not, this deponent says not, though he thinks
   it is. But this is the main point, the Lord shall come. We know not
   when we are to expect His coming. We are not to lay down, as absolutely
   fixed, any definite prediction or circumstance that would allow us to
   go to sleep until that prediction was fulfilled, or that circumstance
   was apparent."

   "Will not the Jews be converted to Christ, and restored to their land?"
   enquired my friend. I replied, "Yes, I think so. Surely they shall look
   on Him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, as one
   mourns for his only son. And God shall give them the Kingdom and the
   Glory, for they are His people, whom He has not forever cast away. The
   Jews, who are the natural olive branches, shall yet be grafted into
   their own olive tree, again, and then shall be the fullness of the
   Gentiles." "Will that be before Christ comes, or after?" asked my
   friend. I answered, "I think it will be after He comes, but whether or
   not, I am not going to commit myself to any definite opinion on the
   subject."

   To you, my dear Friends, I say--Read for yourselves, and search for
   yourselves, for still, this stands first, and is the only thing that I
   will insist upon tonight--the Lord will come. He may come now. He may
   come tomorrow. He may

   come in the first watch of the night, or the second watch, or He may
   wait until the morning watch--but the one word that He gives to you all
   is, "Watch! Watch! Watch!" that whenever He shall come, you may be
   ready to open to Him and to say, in the language of the hymn we sang
   just now--

   "Hallelujah!

   Welcome, welcome, Judge Diviner So far I know that we are Scriptural
   and, therefore, perfectly safe in our statements about the Lord's
   Second Advent.

   Brothers and Sisters, I would be earnest on this point, for the notion
   of the delay of Christ's Coming is always harmful, however you arrive
   at it, whether it is by studying prophecy, or in any other way. If you
   come to be of the opinion of the servant mentioned in the 45th verse,
   you are wrong--"If that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his
   coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat
   and drink, and to be drunken; the lord of that servant will come in a
   day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and
   will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
   unbelievers." Do not, therefore, get the idea that the Lord delays His
   Coming and that He will not or cannot come as yet. Far better would it
   be for you to stand on the tiptoe of expectation and to be rather,
   disappointed, to think that He does not come.

   I do not wish you to be shaken in mind so as to act fanatically or
   foolishly, as certain people did in America, when they went out into
   the woods with "ascension dresses" on, so as to go straight up all of a
   sudden! Fall into none of those absurd ideas that have led people to
   leave a chair vacant at the table and to put an empty plate because the
   Lord might come and need it! And try to avoid all other superstitious
   nonsense. To stand star-gazing at the prophecies, with your mouth wide
   open, is just the wrong thing to do! Far better will it be to go on
   working for your Lord, getting yourself and your service ready for His
   appearing, and cheering yourself all the while with this thought,
   "While I am at work, my Master may come. Before I get weary, my Master
   may return. While others are mocking at me, my Master may appear! And
   whether they mock or applaud, is nothing to me. I live before the great
   Taskmaster's eyes, and do my service knowing that He sees me and,
   expecting that, by-and-by, He will reveal Himself to me, and then He
   will reveal me and my right intention to misrepresenting men."

   That is the first point, Brothers and Sisters, the Lord will come.
   Settle that in your minds. He will come in His own time and we are
   always to be looking for His appearing.

   II. Now, secondly, THE LORD BIDS US WATCH FOR HIM. That is the marrow
   of the text--"Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he
   comes, shall find watching."

   Now what is this watching? Not wishing to use my own words, I thought
   that I would call your attention to the context. The first essential
   part of this watching is that we are not to be taken up with present
   things. You remember that the 22nd verse is about not taking thought
   what you shall eat, or what you shall drink--you are not to be absorbed
   in that. You who are Christians are not to live the fleshly, selfish
   life that asks, "What shall I eat and drink? How can I store up my
   goods? How can I get food and raiment, here?" You are something more
   than dumb, driven cattle that must think of hay and water. You have
   immortal spirits! Rise to the dignity of your immortality! Begin to
   think of the Kingdom, the Kingdom so soon to come, the Kingdom which
   your Father has given you and which, therefore, you must certainly
   inherit! Think of the Kingdom which Christ has prepared for you, and
   for which He is making you kings and priests unto God, that you may
   reign with Him forever and ever. Oh, be not earthbound! Do not cast
   your anchor, here, in these troubled waters. Build not your nest on any
   of these trees--they are all marked for the axe and are coming
   down--and your nest will come down, too, if you build it here. Set your
   affection on things above, up yonder--

   "Up where eternal ages roll, Where solid pleasures never die, And
   fruits eternal feast the soul." There project your thoughts and your
   anxieties--and have a care about the world to come. Be not anxious
   about the things that pertain to this life. "Seek you first the Kingdom
   of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto
   you."

   Reading further down, in the 35th verse, you will notice that watching
   implies keeping ourselves in a serviceable condition--"Let your loins
   be girded about." You know how the Orientals wear flowing robes which
   are always getting in their way. They cannot walk without being tripped
   up, so that, if a man has a piece of work on hand, he just tucks in his
   robe under his belt, tightens his belt up tightly, and gets ready for
   his task--as we would say in English, turning the

   Oriental into the Western figure--rolling up your shirtsleeves and
   preparing for work. That is the way to wait for the Lord, ready for
   service, that, when He comes, He may never find you idle.

   I called to see a Sister one morning and when I called, she was
   cleaning the front steps with some whitening, and she said, "Oh, my
   dear Pastor, I am sorry that you should call upon me just now! I would
   not have had you see me like this on any account." I answered, "That is
   how I like to see you, busy at your work. I should not have liked to
   have come in and caught you talking to your neighbor over the back
   palings. That would not have pleased me at all. May your Lord, when He
   comes, find you just so, doing your duty!" You see exactly what is
   meant--you are to be doing your duty--you are to be engaged about those
   vocations to which God has called you. You are to be doing it all out
   of love to Christ and as service for Him. Oh, that we might watch in
   that style, with our loins girded about! Work, and wait, and watch! Can
   you put those three things together? Work, and wait, and watch! This is
   what your Master asks of you.

   And next, He would have us wait with our lights burning. If the Master
   comes home late, let us sit up late for Him. It is not for us to go to
   bed till He comes home. Have the lights all trimmed. Have His chamber
   well lit--have the entrance-hall ready for His approach. When the King
   comes, have your torches flaming, that you may go out to meet the royal
   Bridegroom and escort Him to His home! If we are to watch for the Lord
   as we ought, it must be with lamps burning. Are you making your light
   to shine among men? Do you think that your conduct and character are an
   example that will do your neighbors good and are you trying to teach
   others the way of salvation? Some professors are like dark lanterns, or
   candles under a bushel. May we never be such! May we stand with our
   lamps trimmed and our lights burning and we, ourselves, like unto men
   that wait for their Lord, not walking in darkness, nor concealing our
   light, but letting it shine brightly! That is the way to watch for
   Christ, with your belt tight about you because you are ready for work,
   and your lamp flaming out with brightness because you are anxious to
   illuminate the dark world in which you live.

   To put it very plainly, I think that watching for the Coming of the
   Lord means acting just as you would wish to be acting if He were to
   come. I saw, in the Orphanage schoolroom, that little motto, "What
   would Jesus do?" That is a very splendid motto for our whole life,
   "What would Jesus do in such a case and in such a case?" Do just that.
   Another good motto is, "What would Jesus think of me if He were to
   come?" There are some places into which a Christian could not go, for
   he would not like his Master to find him there. There are some kinds of
   amusements into which a Believer would never enter, for he would be
   ashamed for his Master to come and find him there. There are some
   conditions of angry temper, of pride, petulance, or spiritual sloth in
   which you would not like to be if you felt that the Master was coming.
   Suppose an angel's wing should brush your cheek just as you have spoken
   some unkind word and a voice should say, "Your Master is coming"--you
   would tremble, I am sure, to meet Him in such a condition! Oh, Beloved,
   let us try, every morning, to get up as if that were the morning in
   which Christ would come! And when we go up to bed at night, may we lie
   down with this thought, "Perhaps I shall be awakened by the ringing out
   of the silver trumpets heralding His Coming. Before the sun arises, I
   may be startled from my dreams by the greatest of all cries, 'The Lord
   is come! The Lord is come!'" What a check, what an incentive, what a
   bridle, what a spur such thoughts as these would be to us! Take this
   for the guide of your whole life--act as if Jesus would come during the
   act in which you are engaged--and if you would not wish to be caught in
   that act by the Coming of the Lord, let it not be your act.

   The second verse of our text speaks about the master coming in the
   second watch, or in the third watch. We are to act as those who keep
   the watches of the age for Christ. Among the Romans it was as it is on
   board ship--there were certain watches. A Roman soldier, perhaps, stood
   on guard for three hours, and when he had been on the watch for three
   hours, there came another sentry who took his place, and the first man
   retired and went back to the barracks. And the fresh sentinel stood in
   his place during his allotted time. Brothers and Sisters, we have
   succeeded a long line of watchmen! Since the days of our Lord, when He
   sent out the chosen 12 to stand upon the citadel and tell how the night
   waxed or waned, how have the watchers come and gone! Our God has
   changed the watchers, but He has kept the watch. He still sets watchmen
   on the walls of Zion who cannot hold their peace day or night, but must
   watch for the Coming of their Master, watch against evil times, watch
   against error and watch for the souls of men.

   At this time some of us are called to be specially on the watch and
   dare we sleep? After such a line of lynx-eyed watchmen, who counted not
   their lives dear unto them that they might hold their post, and watch
   against the foe, shall we be cowards and be afraid, or shall we be
   sluggards and go to our beds? By Him that lives, and was dead, and is
   alive forevermore, we pray that we may never be guilty of treason to
   His sacred name and Truth! But may we watch on to the

   last moment when there shall ring out the clarion cry, "Behold, the
   Bridegroom comes! Go you out to meet Him." People of the Tabernacle,
   you are set to watch, tonight, just as they did in the brave days of
   old! Whitefield and Wesley's men were watchers and those before them,
   in the days of Luther and of Calvin, and backward even to the days of
   our Lord! They kept the watches of the night and you must do the same,
   until--

   "Upstarting at the midnight cry,

   'Behold your heavenly Bridegroom near,'" you go forth to welcome your
   returning Lord.

   We are to wait with one objective in view, viz., to open the door to
   Him and to welcome Him--"that when He comes and knocks, they may open
   unto Him immediately." Perhaps you know what it is to go home to a
   loving, tender wife and children who are watching for you. You have
   been on a journey. You have been absent for some little time. You have
   written them letters which they have greatly valued. You have heard
   from them, but all that is nothing like your personal presence! They
   are looking out for you and if, perhaps, the boat should fail you, or
   the train is late--if you arrived at eleven or twelve o'clock at night,
   you would not expect to find the house all shut up and nobody watching
   for you! No, you had told them that you would come and you were quite
   sure that they would watch for you. I feel rebuked, myself, sometimes,
   for not watching for my Master when I know that, at this very time, my
   dogs are sitting against the door, waiting for me--and long before I
   reach home, there they will be and, at the first sound of the carriage
   wheels, they will lift up their voices with delight because their
   master is coming home! Oh, if we loved our Lord as dogs love their
   masters, how we should catch the first sound of His Coming--and be
   waiting, always waiting--and never happy until at last we should see
   Him!

   Pardon me for using a dog as a picture of what you ought to be, but
   when you have attained to a state above that, I will find another
   illustration to explain my meaning.

   III. Now, lastly, THERE IS A REWARD FOR WATCHERS. Their reward is this,
   "Blessed are those servants,

   whom the master, when he comes, shall find watching."

   They have a present blessedness. It is a very blessed thing to be on
   the watch for Christ, it is a blessing to us now. How it detaches you
   from the world! You can be poor without murmuring. You can be rich
   without worldliness. You can be sick without sorrowing. You can be
   healthy without presumption. If you are always waiting for Christ's
   Coming, untold blessings are wrapped up in that glorious hope. "Every
   man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as He is pure."
   Blessednesses are heaped up one upon another in that state of heart in
   which a man is always looking for his Lord.

   But what will be the blessedness when Jesus does come? Well, a part of
   that blessedness will be in future service. You must not think that
   when you have done working here, you Sunday school teachers, and those
   of us who preach and teach, that the Master will say, "I have
   discharged you from My service. Go and sit on a heavenly mountain and
   sing yourselves away forever and ever." Not a bit of it! I am but
   learning how to preach, now--I shall be able to preach, by-and-by. You
   are only learning to teach now--you will be able to teach, by-and-by.
   Yes, to angels and principalities, and powers, you shall make known the
   manifold wisdom of God! I sometimes aspire to the thought of a
   congregation of angels and archangels, who shall sit and wonder as I
   tell what God has done for me--and I shall be to them an everlasting
   monument of the Grace of God to an unworthy wretch, upon whom He looked
   with infinite compassion and saved with a wonderful salvation!

   All those stars, those worlds of light--who knows how many of them are
   inhabited? I believe there are regions beyond our imagination to which
   every child of God shall become an everlasting illumination, a living
   example of the love of God in Christ Jesus! The people in those far
   distant lands could not see Calvary as this world has seen it, but they
   shall hear of it from the redeemed! Remember how the Lord will say,
   "Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over
   a few things, I will make you ruler over many things"? He is to keep on
   doing something, you see. Instead of having some little bit of a
   village to govern, he is to be made ruler over some great province. So
   it is in this passage. Read the 44th verse--"Of a truth I say unto you,
   that he will make him ruler over all that he has." That is, the man who
   has been a faithful and wise steward of God, here, will be called of
   God to more eminent service hereafter. If he serves his Master well,
   when his Master comes, He will promote him to still higher service!

   Do you not know how it used to be in the Spartan army? Here is a man
   who has fought well and been a splendid soldier. He is covered with
   wounds on his breast. The next time that there is a war, they say,
   "Poor fellow, we will reward him! He shall lead the way in the first
   battle! He fought so well before, when he met 100 with a little troop
   behind him-- now he shall meet ten thousand with a larger troop!" "Oh!"
   you say, "that is giving him more work." That is God's way of rewarding
   His people and a blessed thing it is for the industrious servant! His
   rest is in serving God with all his might. This shall be our Heaven,
   not to go there to roost, but to be always on the wing, forever flying
   and forever resting at the same time. "They do His commandments,
   hearkening unto the voice of His word." "His servants shall serve Him:
   and they shall see His face." These two things, blended together, make
   a noble ambition for every Christian!

   May the Lord keep you waiting, working, watching, that when He comes,
   you may have the blessedness of entering upon some larger, higher,
   nobler service than you could accomplish, now, for which you are
   preparing by the lowlier and more arduous service of this world! God
   bless you, Beloved, and if any of you do not know my Lord and,
   therefore, do not look for His appearing, remember that He will come
   whether you look for Him or not. And when He comes, you will have to
   stand at His bar. One of the events that will follow His Coming will be
   your being summoned before His Judgment Seat--how will you answer Him,
   then? How will you answer Him if you have refused His love and turned a
   deaf ear to the invitations of His mercy? If you have delayed, and
   delayed, and delayed, and delayed, how will you answer Him? How will
   you answer Him in that day? If you stand speechless, your silence will
   condemn you and the King will say, "Bind him hand and foot, and take
   him away."

   God grant that we may believe in the Lord Jesus unto life eternal and
   then wait for His appearing from Heaven, for His love's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. LUKE 12:12-48.

   Verses 13, 14. And one of the company said unto Him, Master, speak to
   my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. And He said unto
   him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you? Our Lord kept to
   His proper business, which was the preaching of the Gospel and the
   healing of the sick. We find, in these days, that the minister of the
   Gospel is asked to do almost everything. He must be a politician. He
   must be a social reformer. He must be, I know not what! For my part, I
   often feel as if I could answer, "Who made me to do anything of the
   kind? If I can preach the Gospel, I shall have done well if I do that
   to the glory of God and to the salvation of men. Surely there are
   enough people to be judges and dividers, there are quite sufficient
   politicians to attend to politics and plenty of men who feel themselves
   qualified to direct social reforms. Some of us may be spared to attend
   to spiritual affairs."

   15. And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
   man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he
   possesses. Jesus gave His hearers a good moral and spiritual lesson
   from the occurrence which they had witnessed, and then passed on to
   speak of the matter which always occupied His thoughts.

   16, 17. And He spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
   certain rich man brought forth, plentifully: and he thought within
   himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to
   bestow my fruits? He did not enquire, "Where can I find a needy case in
   which I may use my superfluity for charity?" Oh, no! "How can I hoard
   it? How can I keep it all to myself?" This was a selfish, worldly man.

   18-20. And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns and build
   greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will
   say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take
   your ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, You fool.
   Other men said of him, "This is a wise man. He minds the main chance.
   He is a fellow plentifully endowed with good sense and prudence." But
   God said unto Him, "You fool."

   20. This night your soul shall be required of you. I should like you to
   set that up as the counter picture to the one that we had this morning,
   "Today shall you be with Me in Paradise." [Sermon #2078, Volume 35--The
   Believing Thief.] That was said by Christ to the penitent thief, but to
   this impenitent rich man, God said, "This night your soul shall be
   required of you."

   20, 21. Then whose shall those things be, which you have provided? So
   is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
   "He that lays up treasure for himself." That was the chief point of
   this man's wrong-doing--his selfishness. His charity began at home and
   ended there. He lived only for himself.

   22, 23. And He said unto His disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
   no thought for your life, what you shall eat; neither for the body,
   what you shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body is more
   than raiment. Have no anxious, carking care. Do not be looking after
   the inferior things and neglecting your soul. Take care of your
   soul--your body will take care of itself better than your soul can. The
   raiment for the body will come in due time, but the clothing for the
   soul is the all-important matter. Therefore, see to that.

   24-27. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
   neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are
   you better than the fowls? And which of you with taking thought can add
   to his stature one cubit? If you, then, are not able to do that thing
   which is least, why take you thought for the rest? Consider the lilies
   how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you,
   that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. The
   lilies simply stand still in the sunlight and silently say to us, "See
   how beautiful are the thoughts of God?" If we could just drink in God's
   love and then, almost without speech, show it in our lives, how we
   should glorify His name!

   28. If then God so clothes the grass, which is today in the field, and
   tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will He clothe you, O you
   of little faith! But you have some faith, otherwise the Savior would
   not have said to you, "O you of little faith!" The man who has no faith
   may well go on fretting, toiling, spinning, but he that has faith, as
   he goes forth to his daily labor, looks beyond that to the God of
   Providence, and thus God keeps him without care, and provides for him.

   29, 30. And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink,
   neither be you of doubtful mind. For all these things do the nations of
   the world seek after: and your Father knows that you have need of these
   things. He knows that you must go and work for these thing, but He
   would not have you fret and fume about them. "Your Father knows." He
   will provide. It is enough for Him to know His children's needs, and He
   will be sure to provide for them.

   31. But rather seek you the Kingdom of God; and all these things shall
   be added unto you. Thrown in as a kind of make-weight. You get the
   spiritual and then the common blessings of life shall be added unto
   you.

   32. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to
   give you the Kingdom. That is your share. Others may have inferior
   joys, but you are to have the Kingdom of God! The Lord could not give
   you more than that and He will not give you less.

   33. Sell that you have, and give alms. Do not merely give away what you
   can spare, but even pinch yourself, sometimes, and sell what you can
   that you may have the more to give.

   33. Provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the
   heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth
   corrupts. Put some of your estate where it cannot be lost. Take care
   that you invest some of it for God's poor, and God's work, where the
   interest will be sure and the investment will be safe.

   34. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. You can
   be sure of that. Your heart will go after your treasure and, if none of
   your treasure has gone to Heaven, none of your heart will go there,
   either.

   35. 36. Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and
   you yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will
   return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open
   unto him immediately. Our Lord constantly reminded His disciples that
   the time would come when He must leave them for a season, but He always
   kept before them the thought of His return and bade them watch for Him
   as those that wait for their lord.

   37-39. Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, shall
   find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and
   make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. And
   if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and
   find them so, blessed are those servants. And this know, that if the
   good man of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he
   would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken
   through. As he does not know when the thief will come, he is always
   watching.

   40, 41. Be you therefore ready also: for the Son of Man comes at an
   hour when you think not. Then Peter said unto Him, Lord, speak You this
   parable unto us, or even to all? And the Lord told him that, while it
   was spoken to all, it had a very special bearing upon Apostolic men,
   upon preachers of the Gospel, ministers of Christ.

   42-44. And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
   whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their
   portion of meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord
   when he comes shall find so doing. Of a truth I say unto you, that he
   will make him ruler over all that he has. Just as Pharaoh made Joseph
   ruler over all Egypt, so, when men have done well in the ministry of
   Christ, He will promote them, and they shall do still more for

   Him.

   45. 46. But and if that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his
   coming, and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat
   and drink, and to be drunken; the lord of that servant will come in a
   day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and
   will cut him in sunder. This is a truly terrible expression! We are
   sometimes charged with using too strong expressions with regard to the
   wrath to come. It is quite impossible that we should do so, even if we
   tried, for the expressions of the Lord Jesus are more profoundly
   terrible than any which even mediaeval writers have ever been known to
   invent!

   46. And will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. The worst
   portion that any man can get is with the unbelievers! Are there not
   some here who may, in this verse, see what a dark doom theirs will be
   if they are among those who are described as being cut in sunder, and
   having their portion with the unbelievers?

   47. And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
   himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many
   stripes. So that there are different measures of responsibility--there
   are degrees in guilt, and degrees in punishment.

   48. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
   shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomever much is given, of
   him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him
   they will ask the more. O my Brothers and Sisters, let those of us who
   are privileged with the possession of the Gospel, and privileged with
   any amount of ability to spread it, enquire whether we could give in a
   good account if the Lord were to come tonight and summon us, as
   stewards, to give an account of our stewardship. God bless to us all
   the reading of His Word! Amen.

Three Arrows--or Six?

   (No. 2303)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 9, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   25, 1889.

   "And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the
   king of Israel, Strike the ground. And he struck three times, and
   stopped. And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should
   have struck five or six times; then had you struck Syria till you had
   consumed it: whereas now you shall strike Syria only three times." 2
   Kings 13:18,19.

   IT is a very difficult task to show the meeting place of the purpose of
   God and the free agency of man. One thing is quite clear--we ought not
   to deny either of them, for they are both facts. It is a fact that God
   has purposed all things both great and little. Neither will anything
   happen but according to His eternal purpose and decree. It is also a
   sure and certain fact that, oftentimes, events hang upon the choice of
   men. Their will has a singular potency. In the case before us, the
   arrows are in the hands of the king of Israel and, according to whether
   he shall shoot once, twice, three times, or five or six times, so will
   the nation's history be affected. Now, how these two things can both be
   true, I cannot tell you. Neither, probably, after long debate, could
   the wisest men in Heaven tell you, not even with the assistance of
   cherubim and seraphim! If they could tell you, what would you know, and
   in what way would you be benefited if you could find out this secret? I
   believe that it would be as difficult to show that these two things do
   not agree, as it is to show how they can agree. They are two facts that
   run side by side, like parallel lines. Things are often left to the
   will of men, yet everything does come to pass, in the end, according to
   the will of God! Can you not believe them both? And is not the space
   between them a very convenient place to kneel in, adoring and
   worshipping Him whom you cannot understand? If you could understand
   your religion, it would be one that did not come from God--it would
   have been made by a man of limited capacity, like yourselves, who was,
   therefore, able to make what you can comprehend. But inasmuch as there
   are mysteries in your faith, to the top of which you cannot climb, be
   thankful that you need not climb them.

   But sometimes a practical question about these two points does arise.
   It is correct to say, speaking after the manner of men, "If men are
   earnest, if men are believing, if men are prayerful, such and such a
   blessing will come." And that the blessing does not come may be rightly
   traced to the fact that they were not as prayerful and as believing as
   they ought to have been. I believe that God will save His own elect,
   and I also believe that if I do not preach the Gospel, the blood of men
   will be laid at my door. I believe that God will give to His Son to see
   the travail of His soul, but yet, if you who are His people are not
   earnest in seeking the salvation of souls, and they perish, their blood
   will be required at your hands! This remark seems to be suggested by
   the story before us. God knew how many times the Syrians would be
   beaten and yet He left king Joash to decide whether they should be
   beaten three times or six times.

   Next, reflect what great things may lie in a man's hands. There stood
   Joash, an unworthy king, and yet in his hands lay, measurably, the
   destiny of his people. If he will take those arrows and will shoot five
   or six times, their great enemy will be broken in pieces. If he will be
   dilatory and will only shoot three times, he will get only a measure of
   victory. And poor Israel will ultimately have to suffer, again, from
   this enemy, who has been only scratched, and not killed. You do not
   know, dear Friends, what responsibility lies upon you! You are the
   father of a family--what blessings may come to your household, or may
   be missed by your children--through your conduct! Dear Mother, you
   think yourself obscured, yet your child's future will depend upon your
   teaching, or non-teaching! Great events depend upon little matters, as
   large vessels hang upon small nails, and you who are here, tonight,
   sitting in the pews, and meditating upon your future course of action,
   may do that which shall lead many to Heaven. But if you decide another
   way, you may do that which will curse many through time and eternity.
   Remember that, and remember in what a position of responsibility you
   may

   be placed many a time in your life--and how necessary it is that the
   Grace of God should be with you, to guide you, that you may not be an
   injury to others by what you do or leave undone.

   Once more, notice what great results may come from very little acts. It
   was a very trifling thing, was it not, to shoot an arrow from a bow?
   Your child has done it many times in his holidays. He has taken his bow
   and shot his little homemade shaft into the air. This is what the king
   of Israel is required to do--to perform this very slight and common
   feat of archery--to shoot from an open window and to drive his arrows
   into the ground beneath. And yet upon the shooting of these arrows will
   hang victory or defeat for Israel. So there are some who think that
   hearing the Gospel is a little thing. Life, death, and Hell, and worlds
   unknown, may hang upon the preaching and hearing of a sermon! To hear
   attentively and not be disturbed in the sermon may seem a very
   insignificant thing and, yet, upon the catching of the Word of God may
   result either the attainment of faith or the absence of faith--and so
   the salvation that comes by faith! In our affairs that appear to be
   trifles, we are often shaking worlds. That which looks like a great
   action may turn out to be a puff-ball, and nothing more, but a little
   occasion may prove to be great in its consequences. The mother of
   mischief is no bigger than a gnat's egg and the beginning of Divine
   Grace is no larger than the mustard seed. Therefore, do not trifle with
   little things, for on these little things may hang the greatest things,
   even the great things of an eternal state!

   That lesson seems to me to lie upon the very threshold of our subject,
   tonight. But I cannot detain you on the threshold. We must enter into
   the theme, itself.

   I. First, let me speak of SOME MATTERS IN WHICH MANY MEN TOO SOON
   PAUSE. There are some who, having great opportunities--and we all have
   them, more or less--shoot only three times when they ought to shoot
   five or six times.

   One of these matters is in the warfare with the evil within. Some, as
   soon as they begin their Christian life, fit an arrow to the string and
   shoot down big sins, such as swearing, or drunkenness, or open
   uncleanness. When they have shot these three times, they seem to think
   that the other enemies within them may be tolerated. My Brother, you
   should have shot five or six times! There remains a bad temper within
   you that must be conquered. Or there remains an unforgiving nature that
   must be slain. There is no going to Heaven with that evil thing alive.
   Or you are proud and self-confident. Have you not an arrow for that
   evil, for God hates pride, and so should you! But certain people say,
   "Well, you know, that is my constitution." Well then, you must be
   constituted differently, or else you will not get to Heaven. "Oh!" says
   one, "that is my besetting sin!" How often is that used as an excuse!
   If I were to go across Clapham Common, tonight, and a dozen men were to
   come around and knock me down and rob me, I should be beset by them!
   But when I stay at home and ask them into my house, and feast with
   them, and let them rob me, I cannot talk about being beset, for I have
   invited them there. Some professors tolerate themselves in sin. I
   repeat, they tolerate themselves in sin. One says, "Well, you see, I
   always was so hot-tempered." You must get cool, my Brother. Another
   says, "I was always very irritable." You must get rid of that
   irritableness, my dear Friend--the Grace of God should teach you to
   overcome that evil habit. We sin, but we must not tolerate any sin. It
   will ruin a man if he sits down and says, "I cannot overcome that sin."
   You MUST overcome it--every sin is to be overcome--and if you have
   struck three times and stopped, you must not rest satisfied. The man of
   God, tonight, will not give you any peace if that is your condition.
   But he will say to you, "You should have struck five or six times."
   There must be a clean sweep of every sin, for Christ has died, not to
   save us in our sins, but to save us from our sins.

   There are some who shoot three times and then leave off with regard to
   Christian knowledge. They know the simple Truth of Justification by
   Faith, but they do not want to know much about Sanctification by the
   Spirit of God. Why not, my Brother? Can you be saved unless you are
   sanctified? Some are perfectly satisfied with laying, again, the first
   principles, always going over those--but they want to know no more. I
   beseech you, strive to be educated in the things of God! Read not only
   the first spelling book, "Believe and live," but go on to read in the
   high classics of holiness and communion. Seek to be well established in
   the faith and, "to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
   length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which
   passes knowledge." Be a diligent student of the Word of God-- give
   yourself wholly to it. Lie asoak in Divine Truth till it colors you
   through and through!

   Some, again, sin in this way with regard to Christian attainments. They
   have little faith and they say, "Faith like a grain of mustard seed
   will save you." That is true. God forbid that I should discourage the
   little ones! But are you always to be a little one? A grain of mustard
   seed is not worth anything if it does not grow--it is meant to grow
   till it comes to

   be a tree and birds lodge in its branches. Come, my dear Friend, if you
   have little faith, do not rest till you have great faith, till you have
   full assurance, till you have the full assurance of understanding! You
   love Christ, but why not love Him more? You have hope, but why not a
   clearer expectation? You have a little patience, but why not have
   abundance of Grace to endure affliction, and to glory in tribulations,
   also? "Oh, I cannot get to that!" Truly, the man of God is not angry,
   tonight, but he would be a little angry with you if he thought that you
   meant that utterance! You can get to it-- you must get to it! You are
   not to be content without the prize of your high calling in Christ
   Jesus, but you are to run and press forward, and not to be satisfied
   unless you daily make progress in the Divine life.

   Others, again, seem satisfied with little usefulness. You brought a
   soul to Christ, did you? Oh, that you would long to bring another! Do
   you not remember what the General said, in the war, when one rode up to
   him and cried out, "We have taken a gun from the enemy"? "Take
   another," said the General. If you have brought one soul to Christ, it
   should make you hunger and thirst to bring another! You have been in
   the Sunday school. Keep to it--increase your class and rest not till
   all your girls and boys are saved! You preach, sometimes, in the
   villages. Preach twice as often--you will do that without knocking
   yourself out. Some dear friends have only enough Grace and enough
   usefulness to serve as specimens of what they ought to do. I have heard
   of one, who, going to Paris, walked into a restaurant and asked for a
   beef steak. They brought him a little something on a plate and he took
   it all up upon his fork at once, and said, "Yes, that is the kind of
   thing! Bring me some of that." Some people's usefulness just serves for
   a mouthful to a really earnest person. We say to such, "Yes, that is
   the right sort of thing! Bring us some of that." Why are you not doing
   much more? You have done more than some others, but why do you stop at
   the third shot? "You should have struck five or six times."

   And this spirit comes out very vividly in prayer. You pray--otherwise
   you are not the living children of God at all--but oh, for more power
   in prayer! You have asked for a blessing--why not ask for a far greater
   one? We need more Christians of the type of the importunate widow. They
   have become very scarce nowadays. I should like to see that woman's
   successors, those who will not let the King go unless he blesses
   them--who lay hold upon the angel, as Jacob did, and wrestle all night
   until they got a blessing. You have done well to pray, but you should
   have prayed much more. What blessings are waiting, what treasures are
   in the hands of God, ready for the man who can bend his knees and stay
   at the Mercy Seat till he wins his suit with God!

   The Church of God, as a whole, is guilty here, as to her plans for
   God's Glory. She is doing much more, now, than she used to do, but even
   now, though she strikes three times, we may say to her, "You should
   have struck five or six times." Oh, that the Church of Christ had a
   boundless ambition to conquer the world for her Lord! Oh, that we never
   rested day or night till our neighbors knew the Savior, till sinners of
   every class were made to know that there is a God in Israel! Start up
   you, you who have done so little, Churches that have been satisfied
   with now and then stirring the Baptismal Pool, and the adding of
   half-a-dozen in a year! Oh, for cries to God, and labors for God of a
   very different sort from those of the past! My time would fail me if I
   dwelt on this point. You will all think of many matters in which we
   begin well and then we stop.

   II. But now, secondly, let me speak of THE REASONS FOR THIS PAUSING.
   Why do men come to a dead halt so soon?

   Some of them say that they are afraid of being presumptuous. You are
   afraid of being too holy, are you? Dismiss your fear! You are afraid of
   asking for too much Grace? Be afraid of having too little! You are
   afraid of conquering sin-- tremble for fear of an unconquered sin!
   There is no presumption in taking the largest promise of God and
   pleading it, and expecting to have it fulfilled.

   Perhaps one says, "/have not the natural ability to be doing more, or
   enjoying more." What has natural ability to do with it? When all your
   natural abilities are in the grave and you look only to the spiritual
   strength of God, then you shall see greater things than these! Talk not
   so, I pray you. Another says, "Well, I am getting old, I cannot shoot
   as I used to do." Well, dear Friend, if you want to get old, the surest
   way is to get old. I mean it. Think that you cannot do what you used to
   do and give up your religious engagements because you are getting so
   old? Give up preaching because you are so old? Give up the Sunday
   school because you are so old and you will be old fast enough--that is
   the sure way to make yourself old! Look at our statesmen and notice to
   what an age they still continue working. One reason is because they
   work on--if they gave up, they would have to give up! If we will but
   persevere, we shall prove that there is life in the old dogs, yet. We
   can do something, yet, in the cause of God, even though the hair turns
   gray and the voice gets weak!

   Let us not make an excuse out of our age until it really does prevent
   us from doing our work for Him--then we must take to something else
   that we can do to serve the Lord, and so bring forth fruit even in old
   age.

   Shall I tell you the real reasons why men pause in their work? With
   some, it is because they are too dependent upon their fellow men. This
   king Joash could shoot when Elisha put his hand on his hand--probably
   Elisha only did that once, and then left him to himself and said--"Now,
   you shoot." Then he only shot three times. There are many Christian
   people who are a great deal too dependent upon their ministers, or upon
   some elderly Christian who has helped them onward. When he is dead and
   gone, or when he has moved away, then they do not shoot any more. I
   want you, dear Friends, not to have to be carried all your days. We do
   not object to be nursing fathers and nursing mothers to the children,
   but we want you who are grown up to run alone. What would any father,
   here, think if he had to carry his boy when he was twenty-six? It is
   time, I think, that he went on his own two feet. There are some Church
   members who still want always to have the influence of somebody who is
   a superintendent to them, just as Elisha was to Joash in his shooting.
   Do not let it be so with you, but shoot away, God helping you, and keep
   on shooting till your arrows are all gone!

   Another reason why some pause is that they are too soon contented.
   Joash thought that he had done very well when he had shot three
   times--and that Elisha would pat him on the back, and say--"How well
   you have done!" That kind of feeling creeps over many workers for the
   Lord. They fancy that they have done their share. They have had their
   time, now they will let somebody else take a turn. And they have done
   the work so well, too! Ah, yes, the power to do more oozes out by the
   leakage of contentment with what you have done! We have done nothing
   well enough to say, "It is finished." Still is there much more land to
   be possessed and, in the name of God, let us banish from our hearts all
   contentment with our attainments, or with our services, and let us do
   much more than we have yet attempted for that dear Lord who has bought
   us with His precious blood!

   Joash, too, I dare say, gave up shooting because he was unbelieving. He
   could not see how shooting the arrows could affect the Syrians, and he
   wanted to see. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, we do not, any of us, believe
   enough in God! Believe in God to the uttermost. Thus will you be
   successful workers and accomplish great things for God. No man knows
   the possibilities that lie at his feet. It is impossible to measure
   them--only unbelief can contract them. Remember that even Christ could
   not do many mighty works in His own country because of the people's
   unbelief. And nothing stops us from doing work for Him like unbelief in
   the Ever-Blessed One.

   I should not wonder, also, if Joash was too indolent to shoot five or
   six times. He did not feel in a shooting humor. Now, whenever you do
   not feel in a humor for prayer, then is the time when you ought to pray
   twice as much! If you do not feel in a humor to take your class, say to
   yourself, "You shall do it well, today. I will make you do so, poor
   lazy flesh of mine!" I heard of a person who, being, weary in walking
   to the Meeting House, stopped, and said to his legs, "Come, you have
   carried me a good many miles to the theater--and I will make you carry
   me to the House of God!" So may we say to ourselves and to one another,
   "We were active enough when we ran to our amusements and went with the
   giddy multitude to do evil--and we will be active, now, in the service
   of our God." None of us will ever got to Heaven on a featherbed. No, it
   is a marching pilgrimage from this place to the gates of pearl.

   Joash also probably had too little zeal. He was not wide awake. He was
   not thoroughly energized. He did not care for the Glory of God. If he
   could beat the Syrians three times, that would be quite enough for him.
   He thought that they would have had enough of it, too, and so he laid
   down his bow and his arrows. I wonder whether I am speaking to anybody
   who has just been putting up his bow and arrows, some Brother who has
   made up his mind that he will retire from the school, or one who has so
   much to do in the world that he must give up that village station? If
   so, turn this subject over, and ask yourselves whether you were not
   sent in here, tonight, on purpose to be told that you ought to have
   shot five or six times and done much more than you have done. God does
   speak to men, here, often--and very pointedly, sometimes. Some have
   written to me to know who told me all about them--when I never heard
   about them in my life. God does speak to men's consciences by His
   servants and I put it to every child of God, here, whether this is not
   a message from the excellent Glory--"Keep on! Keep on as long as there
   is life in you! Keep on growing in Grace and advancing in the service
   of Christ."

   III. But now, thirdly, and very briefly, notice THE LAMENTABLE RESULT
   OF THIS PAUSING.

   When Joash had shot three times, he paused and, therefore, the blessing
   paused. Three times he shot, and three times God gave him victory. Do
   you see what you are doing by pausing? You are stopping up the conduit
   by which the river of blessing will flow to you! Do not do that--to
   impoverish yourself must certainly be a needless operation.

   You will suffer in consequence, as this king did, for, after the three
   victories, the rival power came to the front again. You will suffer in
   many ways if you cease to draw daily supplies of Grace from God, or
   cease to shoot the arrows against sin.

   Others will also suffer with you. All Israel was the worse for Joash
   leaving the arrows unshot. Your children, your neighbors, your
   friends--who can tell how many may suffer because you are slack in
   Grace and in the service of the God of Grace?

   Meanwhile, the enemy triumphed. There is joy in Hell when a saint grows
   idle! There is gladness among devils when we cease to pray, when we
   become slack in faith and feeble in communion with God.

   What was even worse, Jehovah, Himself, was dishonored. The worshippers
   of false gods triumphed over Israel and the infinitely-glorious Jehovah
   did not manifest His might as He would otherwise have done. Let us not
   rob God of His Glory, for that is the worst of robberies, but let us
   live so that as much glory as is possible may be gotten out of such
   poor creatures as we are by the ever-blessed God.

   Yet again, glorious possibilities were lost. See what glorious
   possibilities lie before you and do not let them lie there untouched!
   If you were poor and there was a gold mine in your field at home, which
   only needed the use of a spade to make you rich, would you not be sorry
   that you had neglected it so long? Behold, the blessed promises of God
   are before you! You children of God may be rich, blessed and
   happy--will you leave this mine unworked? You Sinners who, as yet have
   only begun to seek the Savior, seek Him more earnestly! Cling more
   closely to Christ and you will soon get the blessing. Shall it be your
   own hand that locks you out of the Kingdom of God? Suffer it not to be
   so.

   IV. I am warned by the time that I must close, but I must say a few
   words about THE CURE FOR THIS PAUSING.

   If we pause in our holy service, or in getting near to God, or in
   sucking the marrow out of the promises, remember that the enemy will
   not pause. You cannot make the drink traffic stop. You cannot make the
   harlotry of London stop its temptations. You cannot make the infidels
   stop. You cannot make the "Down-Graders" stop. They will all be at it,
   with all their might, seeking to do mischief against the Kingdom of our
   Lord Jesus Christ. And there is the same choice for you that the Scotch
   captain put to his men--"Lads," he said, "you see the enemy there? If
   you don't kill them, they will kill you." If you do not overthrow the
   powers of evil, the powers of evil will overthrow you! Oh, that God
   would give us to have no hesitation about our choice, but may we
   continue, by the power of the Spirit, to shoot the arrows of God's
   deliverance till Christ, Himself, shall come!

   A cure for this stopping lies in the reflection that in other things we
   are generally eager. If a man engages in business, he is all alive in
   it. If a man takes to a certain study, he will weary himself that he
   may understand it. And shall we do the work of the Lord half-heartedly
   and, in matters of Grace, slur over things and only do as little as we
   can? The Lord save us from this spirit! A little religion is a very
   dangerous thing--drink deep if you would come to the sweetness of it.
   It is bitter at the top--but when you drink it to the very depths--the
   lees thereof are the choicest cordial for a fainting spirit. God grant
   us to know the inner core of religion, for that is where the sweetness
   lies!

   And lastly, this question ought to prevent us from ever pausing. Can we
   ever do enough for our Savior? Did He stop anywhere? Did He cry a halt
   when the work was half done? Did He not set His face steadfastly to go
   up to Jerusalem? When the scourges fell, He did not turn back and leave
   us. When the nails were driven into His hands and feet, He did not
   desert us. When He came to be forsaken of the Father, He did not
   forsake us, but He went through with His work till He could say, "It is
   finished." Oh, that we might, each of us, resolve that we would go
   through with our work, saying, "I have lifted my hand unto the Lord and
   I cannot go back! May every Christian man and woman say the same! And
   you who have not yet believed in Christ, may you be brought to believe
   in Him who died for the guilty! Surrender yourself to Him who died upon
   the Cross and, having done so, when He looks upon you, and says, "Your
   sins are forgiven you," look up to Him, and say, "I bless You for that
   sweet word, my Lord, and now I will serve You all the days of my life."
   May the Quickening Spirit add the Divine quickening to these feeble
   words and set you all shooting five or six times, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. 2KINGS13.

   Verses 1, 2. In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of
   Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over
   Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years. And he did that which
   was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam
   the son, of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
   "Seventeen years"-- that is a long time in which to do mischief.
   Seventeen years of reigning over a people, influencing them all for
   mischief, turning them aside from God and doing his utmost to erase the
   name of Jehovah from the hearts of the people. Remember, this Jehoahaz
   was the son of Jehu who had been called to the front because of the
   sins of the house of Ahab. Though Jehu was brought forward to be a
   reformer, yet he and his race were as bad as those who were cast out.
   What a sad thing this is, when those who are planted where the
   cumber-ground tree used to be, become just as barren as the one that
   has been cut down, or are only fruitful in sour fruit!

   See here the force of evil example. It was many years since Jeroboam,
   the son of Nebat, had set up the calves at Bethel and Dan, yet here is
   another king walking in his footsteps. You cannot tell, if you leave a
   bad example behind, how your children and your grandchildren to distant
   generations, may follow your evil footsteps. Bad examples are very
   vital-- they live on age after age--and influence others long after the
   first transgressor is dead. The thought that we may be ruining those
   who are yet unborn should keep us back from sin.

   Notice also, at the end of the second verse, "He departed not
   therefrom." There is a final perseverance in sin--some men seem to
   prove it--"He departed not therefrom." He was warned against it. He was
   chastened for it, but, "He departed not therefrom." If men hold on in
   sin, how much more ought the people of God to hold on in righteousness!
   Whatever happens to you when you are once in the good old way, may it
   be said of you, "He departed not therefrom." If all other men should
   turn aside, yet let that be said of you, "He departed not therefrom."
   But, if you are in the wrong road, may the Lord cause you to turn from
   it and to turn to Him at once! If you depart not from evil, you must
   depart from God.

   3. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He
   delivered them into the hands of Hazael, king of Syria, and into the
   hands of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, all their days. God's people
   cannot sin without coming under chastisement. Remember this Word of the
   Lord, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
   therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." If you become
   Church members, and yet live unholy lives, you come under a special
   discipline, a discipline which I plainly see to be going on in the
   Church of God even to this day. "For this cause," said Paul of the
   Church in Corinth, "many are weak and sickly among you, and many
   sleep." No doubt God does send many rods to His rebellious family. He
   is not one of those fathers who "spare the rod, and spoil the child."
   Hazael and Benhadad were both wicked men, yet God used them as rods to
   chastise His sinning people.

   4. And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him. Bad
   as he was, he knew the hand that smote him, and he sought Jehovah. What
   a wonder it is that God hears the prayers of even wicked men! I have
   heard it said, sometimes, that, "the prayer of the wicked is an
   abomination unto God." There is no such passage as that in the
   Scripture. It is "the sacrifice of the wicked," that is "abomination to
   the Lord." Even when a wicked man cries unto God and even if his prayer
   is not a spiritual and acceptable prayer, yet God may hear it in a
   measure, as he did in this case. Sometimes that hearing of prayer leads
   men to repentance and they then pray better prayers and receive greater
   blessings.

   4. For He saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria
   oppressed them. God cannot bear to see the sorrows of His own people.
   Even when He, Himself, is laying on the rod, if His child cries, it
   goes to His heart. Remember what He did to Pharaoh when He heard the
   sighing and crying of His people in Egypt. There is nothing more
   powerful with a father's heart than the tears of his child--and God
   heard the prayers of this bad man because, "He saw the oppression of
   Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them."

   5. (And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under
   the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their
   tents, as beforetime. The Lord gave them deliverance from the cruel
   fetters of the Syrians. They had been so tormented, so plundered, so
   oppressed in every way that God had pity upon them and gave them peace.

   6. Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
   Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained
   the grove also in Samaria). Israel's repentance was only half-hearted.
   They repented because they suffered. They repented because of the
   suffering rather than because of the sin. They went back to the sin
   after they escaped from the sorrow. Oh, be not so, my Hearer! If God
   has chastened you on account of sin, let yours be a thorough
   repentance. Go to God with hatred of your sin, for until you get rid of
   sin, your being rid of sorrow will be a small blessing.

   7. Neither did He leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen,
   and ten chariots, and ten-thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had
   destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing. God
   helped them and delivered them, but they were brought very, very low.
   If God's people sin, their deliverance will cost them dearly. Israel
   was once a great and powerful nation--their armies went forth in vast
   hosts--but now they have only the remnant of an army.

   8. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his
   might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
   of Israel? They were not worth writing in the Scriptures. We have very
   slender records concerning Je-hoahaz, but quite enough for such a
   wicked man.

   9-11. And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
   Samaria: and Joash, his son, reigned in his stead. In the thirty and
   seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, began Joash the son of Jehoahaz
   to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. And he did
   that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. One sinner was followed
   by another! This young man must have seen the mischief that his
   father's idolatry brought on the people, but he went on in the same
   evil way. Oh, you sons of godly parents, you ought to follow your
   fathers' footsteps, for these wicked sons of wicked men followed their
   fathers' evil example! Oh, that there were an inclination in all the
   children of the godly to be like their parents, for there is evidently
   a tendency in the heart of the children of the ungodly to be like their
   sires!

   11. He departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,
   who made Israel sin: but he walked therein. I repeat what I said
   before, what a mischievous thing is one evil example! When a man makes
   another sin, the other who sins is guilty and the man who makes him sin
   is a sharer in his guilt. Here is Jeroboam, dead for years, and yet he
   keeps on sinning. I may say of him, "He, being dead, yet sins." His sin
   goes on burning like a fire and surely the punishment continues if the
   sin continues. As long as souls exist, sin will exist--you cannot stop
   it. Sin will repeat itself again and again, and multiply in its
   repetition spreading among thousands, perhaps, yet unborn! Oh, what an
   evil thing is sin! Prove to me that sin ever ceases to operate and you
   might give me some thought that the punishment will cease--but that can
   never be--and, as long as sin continues to poison, God will continue to
   punish.

   12, 13. And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
   might wherewith he fought against Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? And Joash
   slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was
   buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Now, here is a story about
   this Joash which is preserved to us.

   14. Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died. An old
   man, probably in his 90th year, he had served his generation well. We
   read nothing of him for 45 years. He seems to have been in comparative
   seclusion--perhaps in his old age he had been neglected and
   forgotten--as many a man of God has been who once stood in the front
   rank. El-isha has fallen mortally sick, at last, and he is about to go
   Home.

   14. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him. This is one good
   thing that Joash did. He remembered that it was through Elijah and
   Elisha that the men of his house, the house of Jehu, had been put upon
   the throne, and when he heard that Elisha was dying, something like
   compunction crossed his heart and he "came down unto him."

   14. And wept over his face. As Bishop Hall says, he gave him some drops
   of warm water--and if a cup of cold water, given to a Prophet, shall
   not be without its reward--so neither shall those tender tears be
   without their reward.

   14. And said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the
   horsemen thereof. Elisha must have opened his eyes when he heard those
   words, for he remembered that those were nearly the last words that he
   said to Elijah when his master was taken up to Heaven. Perhaps the king
   had heard that and, with a kind of delicate thoughtfulness, he applied
   the words to this grand old man who was now about to die. He was to
   Israel, chariot and horsemen, for it was by his means that Israel had
   been delivered.

   15, 16. And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto
   him bow and arrows. And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hands
   upon the bow. And he put his hands upon it; and Elisha put his hands
   upon the king's hands. Not because he could lend much strength, for he
   was an old man, but because this signified that God would be with the
   king, that the power which dwelt in the Prophet's God would come
   through the Prophet's hands to help the king.

   17. And he said, Open the window eastward. They had no glass windows in
   those days, you know, but they threw back the iron bars that made the
   shutter and opened the window eastward.

   17. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he
   said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance
   from Syria: for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, till you have
   consumed them. It was usual, in the East, when war was proclaimed, to
   do it by shooting an arrow towards the enemy's country, and this brave
   old man, soon about to breathe out his life, had strengthened the king
   in the great weakness of the Israelite state to proclaim war once more
   against Syria!

   18. And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. I suppose, a quiver
   full.

   18. And he said unto the king of Israel, Strike the ground. "Shoot the
   arrows out of the window and let them strike into the ground and stick
   there."

   18, 19. And he struck three times, and stopped. And the man of God was
   angry with him. Elisha was angry, but he did not sin. He loved the
   people and he was grieved to think that the king was so slack and
   slothful.

   19, 20. And said, You should have struck five or six times; then had
   you struck Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall strike
   Syria only three times. And Elisha died, and they buried him. God has
   different ways of taking His people Home. Some go all of a sudden,
   whirled away, as Elijah was. This Prophet died gently, worn out with
   age, but there is something very beautiful about his death. A king
   weeps over his aged face. He has the pleasure, though it was mingled
   with pain, of helping to deliver his people and, after his death, God
   bore full witness to him.

   20, 21. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in
   of the year. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that,
   behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the
   sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the
   bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. Thus God gave
   Elisha power, even after death, and certainly set the Divine seal upon
   his message! It was as great a glory to him to give life to the dead as
   it was to Elijah to pass to Heaven without dying at all.

   22, 23. But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
   Jehoahaz. And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
   them, and had respect unto them, because of His Covenant. Ah, that is
   what always lies at the bottom of God's mercy, "His Covenant." Oh, that
   grand word, "covenant"! Some think very little of it. Few preach much
   about it. But this is the very foundation of mercy. This is "the deep
   that lies under," out of which all the wells of Divine Grace spring up.

   23, With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
   cast He them from His Presence as yet. He would not do it till He was
   fully driven to it, till provocation upon provocation should wear out
   His patience,

   24, 25. So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad, his son, reigned in
   his stead. And Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, took again out of the hand
   of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of
   the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him,
   and recovered the cities of Israel. He shot three arrows and now it
   came to pass that three times did Joash beat Benhadad and recover the
   cities of Israel. Oh, that he had beaten the king of Syria six times,
   and set Israel completely free from its enemy!

Blinded By Satan

   (No. 2304)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 16, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH
   31, 1889.

   "The god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe
   not." 2 Corinthians 4:4.

   THE practice of blinding men is a horrible process, too horrible for us
   to say another word about it, but there is also a spiritual blindness
   which comes upon some men. These are, to begin with, unbelievers. The
   god of this world does not blind Believers--but he blinds the minds of
   them which believe not. It is, therefore, a very dangerous thing not to
   believe on the Son of God. The penalty of unbelief is death and
   condemnation--and that penalty begins to fall on men when, in
   consequence of their unbelief, their foolish heart is darkened, their
   intellect loses the power to perceive spiritual ob-jects--and the god
   of this world blinds their mental vision. Ah, my Hearers, how anxious
   Satan is to secure your destruction, since, rather than that you should
   see the saving Light of God, he takes the trouble to blind your eyes!
   God grant that no man here may die under this dreadful deprivation of
   Light which is caused by Satanic influence upon the minds of men who
   have not believed in Jesus!

   Remember that this blindness to spiritual things is quite consistent
   with much sharpness as to natural things. A man may be a very keen
   politician. He may be a first-rate man of business. He may be an
   eminent scientist, a profound thinker and, yet, he may be blinded as to
   spiritual Truths of God. How often is it true, "You have hid these
   things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes"!
   As an old writer says, "Poor, ignorant men often find the door to
   Heaven and enter in, while the learned are looking for the latch." Yes,
   a man may have clear eyes for worldly things. He may be very keen as to
   his insight into the problems of life and, yet, the god of this world
   may have blinded his eyes!

   What is more remarkable, still, a man may have much Scriptural
   knowledge. He may understand, in the letter, the things of the Kingdom
   of God. He may be very orthodox in his beliefs and may be able to give
   an answer to those who ask him what he believes, and why he
   believes--but, still, he may have no spiritual perception of the
   reality of these things. A person may know something of botany from
   books and he may even understand the Linnaean system of classifying
   plants, but he may never, after all, have seen the primrose by the
   river's brim, nor have gathered a single flower out of the garden. He
   is a poor botanist, is he not? He who has studied natural history in
   his own chamber, but has never seen a living animal, knows very little
   about the subject, after all! We have many round about us who can talk
   of Heaven and Hell, and sin and salvation, and Christ and the Holy
   Spirit who, nevertheless, have never had one true perception of the
   meaning of any of these words. They see, but perceive not. They hear,
   but do not understand--they are unbelievers and the god of this world
   has blinded their minds.

   Now, I am going to say, tonight, first, that this blindness is very
   common. Secondly, that it is worked by the Evil One upon men in
   different ways. And, thirdly, I shall speak upon the kind of treatment
   that this blindness requires.

   I. First, then, THIS BLINDNESS IS VERY COMMON.

   It is manifested in some by occupation with this world. Here is a man
   who has lived in this world for a good many years and, all that while
   he has been thinking, working, proposing, projecting, but what about?
   Why, about this world! He has generally been concerned with a trinity
   of questions--"What shall I eat? What shall I drink? With what shall I
   be clothed?" This man believes that he is to live forever in another
   world, that this present life is only like the porch of a house--that
   the state to come is the house, itself. All these years, 30, 40, 50,
   60, seventy--may I say 80 years?--this man has never thought about the
   eternal world, but only about the temporary world! He has never thought
   about where he is to dwell forever, but has spent all his power and
   strength upon the passage to it. This is so unreasonable that I am

   sure he must be blind! I cannot account for his folly anyway else.
   Surely, the soul is more important than the body! We think more of the
   body than we do of the garment it wears, but the body, after all, is
   only the garment of the soul! The true ego, the I, myself, is my soul!
   Am I never to think of that, but only to be thinking of my earthly
   house, my food, my garments, my daily work? That is the kind of thing
   that a brute would think of--oxen and asses think of what they shall
   eat, and what they shall drink, and where they shall lie down--if they
   think at all! And is this all of which you and I think? Surely, that
   occupation of the mind upon what must be of secondary consideration is
   a proof that the god of this world has blinded the mind!

   I will give you another example, from a different quarter, and that is,
   the extreme easiness of conscience which we see in many men and women.
   They can commit a great sin, wash their hands and then have done with
   it, as if the very washing of the hands or the wiping of the mouth was
   quite enough to put away all thought of the wrong. Many will sit here,
   tonight, who have, through a long life, committed a hundred sins of
   which they would be ashamed to be reminded, and yet they are not
   ashamed of them! They would only be ashamed to be found out--they are
   not ashamed of the sin, itself. A man truly awakened by the Spirit of
   God feels the remembrance of his sin to sting him as with scorpions! He
   cannot bear it. But the great mass of people do a thousand wrong things
   and yet they are not troubled, but feel quite at their ease.

   Some of you are probably within a very short time of death and
   judgment, and yet you can make sport of sin! How often does it happen
   that people come to the place of worship and go their way, having
   rejected solemn appeals--and they will never hear any more! They have
   had their last warning. Oh, if they could but know that, during the
   week, they will fall down dead, or be laid aside by sickness, never to
   leave the bed, again! Yet they trifle, on the brink of fate, on the
   very verge of everlasting woe! If you saw a man going straight on to
   the very brink of some dreadful precipice, and you saw him about to
   take another step, you would say, "That man is blind. I am sure that he
   is, or else he would not act like that." People do not go into terrible
   danger with their eyes open--yet there are many of our fellow men,
   perhaps many of ourselves, going right on, carelessly and
   heedlessly--to the very brink of the awful abyss without a thought of
   danger! They must be blind! This horrible peace of conscience, this
   quenching of the Spirit whenever conscience stirs itself, this playing
   and trifling with death and judgment prove that they are blind!

   To give you another example, there are many who have presumptuous hopes
   about the future. At any rate, they do not trouble themselves. I do not
   know why they are so easy, but there are different forms of presumption
   which enable them to look into the future without fear. One says,
   "Well, you see, I was christened when I was a child, and I was
   confirmed as a youth." Another says, "I have always attended the
   Meeting House. I am never absent from any of the services. I have
   subscribed my guinea to the hospital. I am kind to everybody. I think
   that most people would give me a good name." Their dependence is on
   that sort of thing and they have never looked at what is really
   lacking. They will not stay to hear that Word of God, "You must be born
   again." They will not listen to Christ when He says, "He that believes
   not shall be damned"--whatever his profession or moral character may
   be! No, but they go on dancing to destruction with a light and merry
   heart. Surely these people are blinded by Satan!

   Then see another sort of people, and note their readiness to sin. They
   yield to the tempter, they yield at the first request! There is no need
   for Satan to importune them to evil. They seem always ready for it,
   especially if they think that they can escape from trouble by doing
   wrong. Why, are there not many persons who would tell a lie to save a
   sixpence? Ah, to save a penny? The shop was open this morning--the
   profit made did not amount to two pence--but, still, the Sabbath was
   broken for that paltry sum! How many are selling their souls, not to
   gain the whole world, no, not to gain a four penny piece! They think so
   little of their souls and their eternal destiny, that, for the sake of
   a drop of beer, for the sake of an evening's amusement, for the sake of
   pleasing a foolish companion they will fling their souls away as if
   they were only pebble stones not worth the keeping!

   Ah, Sirs, such people must be blind! People who have had their eyes
   opened spiritually have been known to die sooner than do the least
   thing that was wrong. Remember the man who was told that if he would
   give one farthing to be spent on incense to the heathen gods, his life
   should be spared? But the man knew the Lord and, therefore, he would
   sooner die than give a single mite towards the worship of idols! Men of
   God have cheerfully laid down their lives to defend even a slight point
   of God's eternal Truth. But these men who think nothing of such holy
   heroism and are willing to lose their souls for a paltry pleasure, why,
   they must be blind!

   I need not stay to say more except this one thing. This blindness shows
   itself in trifling with eternal things. There is a person here who, not
   long ago, was very greatly awakened, even resolved to seek the Savior
   then and there. But when in the Enquiry Room he put off the final
   decision. There was no reason why he should put it off except the
   reluctance of his mind to accept Christ. That was not the first time
   that he had procrastinated and postponed. And yet he is still putting
   off his reception of Christ. He is not sure that he will live to get
   home, tonight. He is not certain that, should he fall asleep, tonight,
   on his bed, he will wake up in this world in the morning! Yet he leaves
   his soul in jeopardy, as if it were a matter of very small concern.

   A person came here, not long ago, who had taken off a diamond ring when
   he washed his hands. And all the while he was sitting here, he kept
   wondering what would become of that ring, whether, when they emptied
   the water out of the basin, it would be thrown away. He was so anxious
   about his ring that he hurried home as quickly as ever he could after
   the service. He did not wait a week to see about it, yet there are men,
   here, who have waited weeks, months, years, ah, many years,
   procrastinating and procrastinating! They would not leave their worldly
   business like that, but they leave the eternal business of salvation or
   damnation as though it were but as a sere leaf that might be blown
   whichever way the wind might please! Such people must be blind! I am
   sure they must be blind. Oh, that they were wise enough to cry, in the
   language of Charles Wesley's hymn--

   "O God, my inmost soul convert,

   And deeply on my thoughtful heart

   Eternal things impress!

   Give me to feel their solemn weight,

   And trembling on the brink of fate,

   Wake me to righteousness!"

   I could heap up many proofs that this blindness is very common, but I
   have not the time to do so, for we must pass on to consider the next
   point.

   II. Secondly, I want to prove to you, very earnestly and very
   pointedly, that THIS BLINDNESS IS WORKED BY THE EVIL ONE IN DIFFERENT
   WAYS.

   In some, it comes by utter worldliness. There are some people who say,
   "We cannot attend to that matter, we have enough to do to earn our
   living." Others say, "Well, thank God, we have not to earn our living
   by the sweat of our brow, but really, we have plenty of other things to
   think of besides turning our attention to that Methodistic stuff." One
   says, "I--, I--," yes, you may speak it out if you like--you think that
   God and Heaven and eternal things are trifles unworthy of your
   thoughts! Your house, your horse, your wife, your money--these, of
   course, are not trifles--these must come first. The world, the world,
   the world--this is in your heart and occupies it all. Said the captain
   of a whaler, one day, to a man of God, who spoke to him about his soul,
   "Mr. Bertram, it is of no use for you to speak to me about my soul, or
   ask me to come to the service, tonight. You see, I am out here after
   whales, and all the while that I was sitting, and you were talking, I
   should be thinking about whales. And when you gave out a hymn, I should
   just be thinking of whether there was a whale anywhere about. If I were
   to pray, I should be praying about whales. I have whales in my heart,
   Sir, and there is no room for anything else." It is so with many, many
   people. They have their business, they have set up a loom, they have an
   invention, they have all the materials of a building inside their
   hearts--and there is no room for God. Their hearts are blinded by utter
   worldliness.

   Some, again, are blinded by the devil in a very desperate way, by love
   of some favorite sin. I do not hesitate to say it is a general fact
   that when men kick against true religion and when they get offended by
   being spoken to about it, if you could track them home, you would find
   in their conduct some very good reason for their opposition. I
   recollect that in preaching, on one occasion, I happened to allude to
   the pleasure it gave me to see the gleaners picking up the wheat in the
   harvest time, as Ruth did, and I said, "I verily believe that there are
   some farmers who would rake their fields with a small tooth comb, if
   they could, to get every grain of the wheat up." I noticed a
   respectable-looking gentleman, in the

   front of the gallery, get up and go out. Somebody at the door said,
   "Why are you going out, Mr._?" He replied, "I

   won't stop to listen to such a fellow as that. I always rake my fields
   three times."

   Yes, you see, it was the truth that made him angry. It is usually so.
   There is a reason for men being angry with the Gospel and turning away
   from it, when it strikes at some of their favorite sins. Such and such
   a man says that he does not believe in Jesus Christ. It is not likely
   that he should! I will not tell you why, but his wife knows. There is
   another man

   who keeps a shop. He says that he does not need to be converted. No, if
   he were, he could not keep that shop! Or if he did, be would have to
   alter the line of business in which he is engaged. Ah, the god of this
   world blinds men's eyes with sin! I cannot go into all the particulars,
   but if there is any man here who has a pet sin that he cherishes, do
   not let him wonder that he cannot see the beauties of Christ, or the
   glories of salvation! And let him not think that we would do anything
   to win his approbation while he remains in love with that sin! It is
   with us very much as it was with Martin Luther when he said, "I could
   be proud to think how badly some people speak of me! For them to speak
   badly of me is the highest honor that such as they are can confer upon
   me." When you who are living in unchastity and dishonesty speak badly
   of Christ and of Christians, you only speak after your own manner--and
   we cannot wish you to alter your tone till God has changed your heart!

   Many are blinded as to the things of God by following a party. "Well,"
   you say, "I could not begin to study these matters of religion, because
   I am linked in with such a set. I know how they would treat me. They
   would laugh at me, first, and they would give me the cold shoulder,
   next. No, really, my dear Sir, if you know how I am connected, you
   would not expect me to ever give any consideration to these doctrines
   that are preached, whether they are true or not." It is a pity, it is a
   solemn pity, that a man should ruin his soul to keep in with his party!
   I rejoiced to read of the praise that was passed in the House of
   Commons, the other night, upon John Bright who deserved much more than
   was said, especially upon this one point, that, whenever his conscience
   came in conflict with his party, he followed his conscience and let his
   party go where it might. Public approbation and applause were nothing
   to him so long as he could keep clear in the sight of God by doing what
   he believed to be right. Now, when he dies, every party has a word of
   honor for him. There is nothing lost, after all, by sticking to what
   you believe to be right--and if it is so in politics, how much more
   should it be so in the matter of religion!

   Cut your sinful connections, quit your evil companions! It were better
   to do that than to go with them, applauded and approved, and find
   yourself wrong at the last. Oh, that men had but a grain of grit in
   them, so that they would never make the things of God, Heaven and
   eternal realities to hang upon the breath of men's nostrils, or the
   smiles or frowns of their fellow men! But I am afraid that a great many
   will never come to know Christ because they will continue to follow
   their party, or the prejudice of their early education still clings to
   them.

   A fourth way in which Satan blinds a great many, and he does it very
   commonly, is by raising objections to the Truth of God. There is
   nothing in this world to which you cannot object. I venture to say that
   there is no fact, however palpable to all the senses, but what you can,
   if you like, find reasons for not believing it to be a fact. If
   somebody were to assert that I am not here and that I am not speaking,
   I have no doubt that, with proper pay, a lawyer could be found to prove
   it--and what a lawyer could do, a great many, who are not learned in
   the law--could do as well. To answer objections is an endless task--it
   is like trying to empty a flowing fountain with bottomless buckets. Men
   do not object to the religion of Jesus Christ really and truly. It is
   not this to which they object, but they invent objections, they go
   abroad searching after objections that they may then have an excuse for
   rejecting Christ. In this way many prove that they are blind-- they
   have a difficulty they cannot get over, and do not mean to get over,
   either--and so they see not Christ.

   With others, blindness is worked by wrong inferences. It is astonishing
   how many eyes are blinded by wrong inferences drawn from the Truth of
   God. We have known one say, "Well, the mercy of God is very great--it
   is universal-- therefore I am sure that God will not cast us into
   Hell." This is a wicked lie derived from a great Truth! Another says,
   "I read that God has an elect people." That is most surely true, but
   not the inference that is drawn from it--"Therefore, if I am to be
   saved, I shall be saved. And if I am to be lost, I shall be lost, so
   that I need not trouble my head about the subject." That is another
   false inference deduced from a great Truth of God. When a man means to
   commit suicide, any rope will do, and when a sinner is resolved to
   perish, he can always find an argument, fetched even from the Truth of
   God, itself, as the means of his own destruction! I am not going to
   answer any of these lies, but only to say that, by these false
   inferences, many a man has been blinded to his own eternal ruin.

   Then there is another way of being blinded, and a very common one, too.
   That is, by general conceit of knowledge. I know a man stone blind of
   it. When I met him last, he looked at me, condescended to ask how I was
   and he as much as intimated that he was occasionally prepared for a
   little conversation with an inferior person and, therefore, he did not
   mind speaking about religion with me, he, himself, being a very
   superior person, indeed, knowing everything and, if possible, a few
   things besides! This man called himself an agnostic--and when a man
   says that he is an agnostic, he is an ig-

   noramus--that is, a person who knows nothing. Yet, such a man usually
   talks as if he knew everything and the appendix at the end of that. He
   mentions Calvinism and he says in a tone of contempt, that his
   grandmother was a Calvinist! He says that he remembers the Evangelical
   School, but that they have nearly died out now. You have not talked
   long with him before you discover that the Lord Jesus Christ and he
   could never get on together because the Savior has said, "Except you be
   converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the
   Kingdom of Heaven," and this man will never become a little child, not
   he!

   If you need the opposite of a little child, there you have the
   gentleman--and he wishes you, "Good afternoon," when you begin to quote
   Scripture. He is not at all the person to receive any instruction of
   that sort. The "superior" person will always be lost, take my word for
   it! The more superior he is, the more sure he is to be lost--I mean not
   that he is really superior, but that he thinks himself so--superior to
   all teaching. He is not prepared to be a learner. He is ready to set up
   as a teacher and a master of anything you like. He is not the kind of
   man to enter the gates of Heaven--he carries his head too high for
   that. He is a man of broad thought and, of course, he goes the broad
   way. Narrow-minded people go in the narrow way--but then it leads unto
   life eternal and, therefore, I commend it unto you--

   "Broad is the road that leads to death, And thousands walk together
   there. But wisdom shows a narrower path, With here and there a
   traveler."

   We have another set of people who are blinded by some special conceit
   of false grace. Here is a man who has attended to many duties. Some, of
   course, he does not care about, but he compounds for duties he does not
   like by attending to others that are to his taste. He does not pray,
   but then he sings in the choir! Communion with God--he does not know
   anything about that--but he takes the sacrament! He has never repented
   of sin, but then he has found fault with other people for their sins,
   and he regards that almost as good! He does not help the poor and
   needy, but then he has a capital plan for lowering the poor rates! He
   is always doing some good thing or other, of a sort, but not of the
   sort that Scripture proscribes. As to believing in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, that is, by a living faith trusting Him, that is beyond his
   range. As to seeking a new heart and a right spirit--and being
   converted and turned from darkness to Light--he does not know anything
   about that, either, but there has been, after all, a very great
   improvement in him. He has given up some very questionable practices
   and, on the whole, he has done a good deal which ought to be spoken of
   with considerable commendation. This is the kind of gentleman who is
   blinded by the god of this world!

   But it is idle for me to talk about people being blinded except to
   those who can see, for the blindest man is the man who says that he is
   not blind, who will not have it that he does not see everything aright,
   even though he has never had his eyes opened by the Lord! He says that
   he could always see--it is an insult to suppose that he is blind. He is
   like the Pharisees who said to Jesus, "Are we blind, also?" to whom
   Jesus answered, "If you were blind, you should have no sin but now you
   say, We see, therefore your sin remains." This is sinning against the
   Light of God! This is sinning with a vengeance! May God preserve all of
   us from such a sin!

   III. Now I come to the most practical point, that is, THE KIND OF
   TREATMENT THAT THIS BLINDNESS REQUIRES. I pray God to bless to you what
   I have to say upon this matter.

   I should say, first, dear Friends, beware lest this blindness be sent
   as a punishment. Although our blind friends have our loving sympathy
   and God blesses them, yet it must be a great calamity to be without
   their eyesight. Now, blindness of heart is not only a sin, but it is
   the punishment of sin, and it comes to many as the result of violating
   conscience, resisting the Holy Spirit, trifling with solemn things and
   being desperately set on mischief. Oh, you who have a tender
   conscience, mind that you do not lose it! You who have the power to sit
   and hear a sermon and to feel it, do not trifle with that holy
   sensitiveness. Once lost, so that you can read the Book of books and
   hear the most earnest talk, and yet feel nothing, you have lost one of
   the greatest privileges that you ever had. May God help the man who is
   going on towards this fatal blindness--and stop him before he gets any
   further!

   I would say, also, to you who are in any way blind, beware lest that
   blindness becomes the herald of your doom. Before Haman was hanged, the
   first thing that the servants did was to cover his face. And when a man
   is about to be lost forever, the first thing that the devil does is to
   blind his eyes so that he cannot see. Now the poor blind Samson will
   make sport for the Philistines! Now they hope that they can kill him
   whenever they please. Beware of a blinded conscience--it is the prelude
   of eternal destruction! God save you from it!

   Next, if you have even a little Light, value it greatly. If any one of
   us should be gradually losing his eyesight, I know that he would
   greatly prize the little sight that he had. How often have I spoken to
   a friend who has said, "This eye is quite gone, Sir, there is just a
   little light left in this one, and the doctor says that I must wear a
   shade and be very careful, or I may lose that." Oh, take care of the
   little Light of God you have! If you can feel a little, be very tender
   of that feeling. If you can see a little of the beauty of Christ, be
   very jealous over that sight. Have I not often said that he who has
   starlight, if he thanks God for starlight, and uses it, will get
   moonlight, and he who has moonlight, and thanks God for it, and uses
   it, will get sunlight--and he who has the sunlight shall yet come to
   that Light which is as of seven days in the glorious Presence of God?
   Take care, then, of any Light that you have.

   And then, the next thing is, if you are at all conscious of your
   blindness, but do not see the full evil of sin, do not see the glory of
   Christ, and do not perceive the way of salvation, confess your
   blindness. Go home, tonight, and, in your chamber, alone, acknowledge
   that you do not see what you ought to see, and do not feel what you
   ought to feel. Show your sightless eyeballs to the Savior who gives
   sight to the blind. Do not cloak your sin, confess it. "He that covers
   his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them
   shall have mercy." Say with David, "I acknowledged my sin unto You, and
   my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions
   unto the Lord." So shall you also be able to say with him, "and You
   forgave the iniquity of my sin."

   When you have confessed your blindness, do one more thing, trust to the
   Lord Jesus to open your blind eyes. Put yourself consciously into the
   Presence of the Divine Savior and say to Him, "I believe that You are
   able to work this miracle of mercy. I believe that You can make me see
   Your Truth and feel Your Truth. I believe that You can make me see
   Yourself, and trust You. Here are my eyes, Lord, I would receive my
   sight! I believe that You can give it! Give it to me now!" Ah, perhaps
   while I speak these words, the flash of the Divine Light is coming into
   some dark heart! Salvation does not take hours--it is in one single
   instant that we pass from death unto life! The moment that we believe
   in Jesus, we are saved! The moment that we look to Him hanging on the
   Cross, our iniquity is pardoned! God grant us that blessed look of
   faith tonight, each one, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   It may help some to look to Christ if we sing a verse of that
   well-known hymn--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for thee! Then look, Sinner--look unto Him, and be saved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree."

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. ISAIAH 6; MATTHEW 13:10-17;
   LUKE18:35-43.

   Isaiah 6:1-4. In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD
   sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the
   Temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with two
   he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he
   did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
   LORD of Hosts: the whole earth is full of His Glory. And the posts of
   the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled
   with smoke. Isaiah was awe-stricken by this vision of the Glory of the
   Lord. It was a sight such as few eyes have ever seen. Isaiah was never
   actually in the Holy Place, for he was no priest and, therefore, he
   could not stand there. It was in vision that he saw all this Glory and
   it was a vision that must have remained upon his memory through the
   rest of his life. The holiness and the Glory of God struck him at once.

   5. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
   unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for
   my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts. There was, indeed,
   enough to make him say, "Woe is me!" A sinful preacher, an imperfect
   preacher, among a sinful and imperfect people, he felt as if the
   society in which be moved was the reverse of the society in which God
   dwells. Pure seraphim cry, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts,"
   but as for us, our very talk is unholy--"a people of unclean lips."

   6, 7. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his
   hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid
   it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your
   iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged. The live coal from off the
   altar does not represent the holy flame which burns in the Prophet's
   heart, but it

   represents purgation, cleansing, participation in the sacrifice, and
   the putting away of sin. With a blister on his lips, Isaiah stood
   silent before God.

   8. Also I heard the voice of the LORD, saying, Whom shall I send, and
   who will go for Us? Here we have the Divine Trinity in Unity. "Whom
   shall I send?" There is Unity. "Who will go for Us?" There is the
   Trinity. God is seeking a messenger to deliver His message to men.

   8. Then said I--Stammering it out with the blistered lip--

   8. Here am I; send me. Isaiah did not know the errand; perhaps, if he
   had known it, he would not have been quite so ready to go. Who can
   tell? But God's servants are ready for anything, ready for everything,
   when once the living coal has touched their lips. I thank God that I
   was never called to such a work as Isaiah had to undertake.

   9, 10. And He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but
   understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of
   this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest
   they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
   their heart, and convert, and be healed. That was no Gospel ministry!
   It was a ministry of condemnation. The house of Israel had rejected the
   Prophets and had rejected God and, in the fullness of time would reject
   God's own dear Son! When Isaiah in vision looked forward to all this,
   he was not sent to soften, but to harden--his word was to be a savor of
   death unto death, and not of life unto life.

   11, 12. Then said I, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities
   are wasted without inhabitants and the houses without man, and the land
   is utterly desolate, and the LORD has removed men far away, and there
   is a great forsaking in the midst of the land. This was a heavy task
   for the Prophet--he had no tidings of God's relenting, no tokens of
   Divine Mercy.

   13. But yet.--You never get this deep bass note of Divine Justice
   without having a, "but yet," to accompany it!

   13. In it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as
   a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast
   their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. When the
   oak sheds all its leaves, it is not dead--there is living sap that will
   again cause the tree to be verdant. Though the nation was to be brought
   very low, there was still to be left a remnant according to the
   Election of Grace. Sin never reaches such a point in God's people but
   what Divine Grace triumphs! Still, where sin abounded, Grace did much
   more abound. This is a terrible chapter! It shows the Sovereignty of
   God in a lurid light and reveals how, when sin comes to a certain
   point, the Lord gives men up and leaves them to the blindness of their
   heart, so that even the means of Grace, the prophetic message, becomes
   a means of condemnation to them.

   Now we are going to read in one of the many places in the New Testament
   in which this passage is quoted.

   Matthew 13:10-12. And the disciples came, and said unto Him, Why do You
   speak unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it
   is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but
   to them it is not given. For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he
   shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken
   away even that he has. You can understand this Truth of God if you go
   into certain museums. I will suppose that you know nothing whatever of
   comparative anatomy and you go into the Museum of Comparative Anatomy
   at Paris. If you understand a little of the science, you will learn a
   great deal more--"for whoever has, to him shall be given." If you do
   not know anything about the subject, you will say, "Well, this is the
   most uninteresting exhibition I ever saw," and you will come out with
   the feeling that you do not know anything. What you did know will have
   vanished in the sight of all that mass of bones arranged in those
   extraordinary shapes. You will only feel your own lack of knowledge in
   that de-partment--you will show your ignorance, and nothing else. So it
   is in the things of God. If you understand the fundamental principles
   of true godliness, you will soon understand more. But if you do not
   comprehend as much as that, even the reading of the Scriptures will be
   but slightly instructive to you.

   13-15. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
   not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them
   is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, By hearing you shall
   hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not
   perceive: for this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
   dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they
   should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should
   understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal
   them. Now the Savior turned to His disciples and spoke especially to
   them.

   16. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
   hear. It is no use having eyes that do not see, or ears that do not
   hear, and yet I fear that there are many eyes of that kind, and many
   ears of that sort, in this congregation tonight.

   17. For verily I say unto you, That many Prophets and righteous men
   have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them:
   and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.

   Now let us read one other passage to show how the Lord heals the blind
   and makes them see.

   Luke 18:35, 36. And it came to pass, that as He was come near, unto
   Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging: and hearing
   the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. If he could not see, he
   could hear and he could speak. Use all the ability that you have and
   God will give you more!

   37-39. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by. And he
   cried, saying, Jesus, You son of David, have mercy on me. And they
   which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. They told
   him that he was spoiling the Preacher's sermon. They had lost his last
   sentence. They could not catch the Savior's meaning, so they cried out
   to the blind man, "Hold your tongue, Sir."

   39, 40. But he cried so much the more, You son of David, have mercy on
   me. And Jesus stood. I can see Him stop. He had been walking on,
   before, and talking as He went, but prayer can cause the Savior to be
   spell-bound. Here Jesus stood.

   40, 41. And commanded him to be brought unto Him: and when he was come
   near, He asked him, saying, What will you that I shall do unto you? Our
   Lord likes us to know what it is that we need. He would have us feel
   our need, that we may have a distinct perception of the blessing when
   it comes and know just what it is.

   41. And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. He needed nothing
   else, but oh, how badly he needed that gift!

   42. And Jesus said unto him, Receive your sight. Notice the echo. The
   blind man said, "Lord, that I may receive my sight." Jesus said,
   "Receive your sight." With a little turn in the expression, Christ's
   answer is the echo of our prayer!

   42. Your faith has saved you. No, surely it was Christ who saved him.
   Yes, but Christ delights to put His crown on Faith's head, for Faith
   always puts the crown back on Christ's head--"Your faith has saved
   you."

   43. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him. What
   should we do when our eyes are opened by Christ but follow him? The
   moment that we can see Him, we should begin to follow Him!

   43. Glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise
   unto God. May we have cause to praise the Lord, tonight, for many blind
   eyes opened!

No Fixity Without Faith

   (No. 2305)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 23, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, APRIL
   11, 1889.

   "If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established." Isaiah
   7:9.

   As I told you in the reading, Isaiah had a very heavy commission from
   God. He was to go and speak to people who would not hear him and to be
   to them a messenger rather of death, than of life. Though the message,
   itself, would be full of life, yet they would refuse it, and so bring
   upon themselves a tenfold death. As a sort of experiment in his work,
   he was called upon, first, to go and speak to king Ahaz, that wicked
   king. He knew in his own soul that what he had to say would be
   rejected, but, nevertheless, at the command of God, he went to speak to
   the king. He was told where he would meet him. God knows where to send
   His faithful servants. He has arranged every circumstance about the
   true preacher-- what he shall say and where he shall say it--and every
   congregation is a picked congregation for God's sent servants. He knows
   who comes and who is away. He knows how to adapt the message with great
   specialty to the individual case of each person who is within sound of
   the preacher's voice and He knows how to adapt even the voice, itself,
   to the ears of every hearer. We know all this, for we have had abundant
   evidence of it again and again.

   The tidings which Isaiah took to Ahaz were very pleasant ones. He was
   not to be afraid of the king of Israel and the king of Syria. These men
   were determined to destroy him and his people, but they were only like
   smoking firebrands, almost extinct. Their power would soon come to an
   end and, therefore, the Prophet told the king not to be distressed, but
   to be quiet and to wait patiently till he saw what God would do. Then
   he challenged the faith of Ahaz and warned him that if he did not
   believe, neither would he be established! Isaiah anticipated what was
   all too true, that Ahaz would not trust, that he would prefer to look
   to outward means, send for the king of Assyria and lean upon an arm of
   flesh rather than put his trust in God. He might have waited, surely,
   and not have indulged his fears until there was reason for them, but
   no, he must be all in a fright and a fume notwithstanding that God had
   said to him, by His servant, Fear not, neither be faint-hearted."

   Well now, these words of Isaiah to Ahaz furnish us with a warning and
   an encouragement. God seems to speak out of this blessed Book to you
   and to me, tonight! Certainly, He speaks to me--I hope to you,
   also--"If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established."

   I. Our first head shall be, GOD DESERVES TO BE BELIEVED. We cannot say
   this of everybody. Many men deserve to be believed--their character is
   such that we are bound to trust them. Some men, on the other hand,
   ought not to be believed--their character is such that we would be
   foolish to confide in them. But I say, tonight, of Him who created the
   heavens and the earth, the God of this Word of God, the God and Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He claims to be believed and He deserves
   to be believed!

   For, first, He is God and, being God, He cannot lie. The conception of
   a lying God may be possible to a heathen, but I trust that to you it is
   quite out of the question. The very idea of "God" to us means perfect
   truthfulness, indisputable veracity--God who, from the very necessity
   of His Nature, cannot lie. He can do anything that is right, but He
   cannot do a wrong thing. He cannot say an untruthful thing. He cannot,
   either in word, or deed, or thought, be guilty of falsehood. He is God
   and He cannot lie. To impute a lie to God is blasphemy! I will use no
   softer word. You have brought dishonor upon the sacred name when you
   have, in any way, connected the name of Jehovah with a lie. "Has He
   said, and shall He not do it?" Oh, Beloved, do not treat the Lord as if
   He were a liar! Remember that when you doubt His promise--since you
   know He can fulfill it if He wills, for He is Omnipotent--when you
   doubt His promise, you are casting a

   suspicion upon the veracity of the Eternal God! Do you mean to do that?
   Have you never read that word of the beloved and loving disciple, "He
   that believes not God has made Him a liar; because He believes not the
   record that God gave of His Son"? Did you really mean to make God a
   liar? Were you guilty of such infamy as that? Well, I will say no more
   upon that point but He deserves to be believed because He is God. It is
   essential to every true idea of God to believe that God must be true.

   He deserves to be believed because His Word has always been true. Any
   person who is a student of prophecy knows how literally, even in small
   things, the prophecies of God have been fulfilled. There was a little
   book which was published, some time ago, by Mr. Urquhart, of
   Weston-super-Mare, upon fulfilled prophecy. I gave a copy to a Brother,
   the other day, and on writing to me, he said that he had found it much
   more interesting than any story or novel he had ever read in his life,
   and vastly more astounding than any romance, for every jot and tittle,
   to the dots of the i's, and the crosses of the t's, in the prophecies
   of God's servants, had been recorded in history! In the ruins of Tyre,
   Sidon and Babylon, and the like, we have, in every stone, a witness of
   the faithfulness of God to His Word!

   Nor is it merely in history that the Lord has been proved to be true.
   You and I--I hope I may say that, but I do speak for many here--have
   proved the faithfulness of God. He has thrown us into different trials.
   We have had opportunities for testing the promises which we could not
   have tested if we had not been tried. Just as you are unable to see the
   stars by day, but if you go down a well, you can see them, directly, at
   any time of day or night, so, dear Friends, God puts us down these deep
   wells of trial, and then we see His starry promises shining brightly! I
   would rather take the promise of God than the promise of the Bank of
   England! The Bank of England might fail--a terrible disaster,
   certainly, and highly improbable--but the Word of God cannot fail, for
   the Lord has greater resources than the whole nation has, or all the
   nations of the earth put together!

   The inhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers in God's sight! He
   takes up such isles as we dwell in as very little things. Oh, Friends,
   the Lord may well have all our confidence, for when we confide in Him
   to our utmost, we have leaned with very little pressure upon the
   veracity of God! The bull that bore the gnat upon his forehead smiled
   when the gnat hoped that his weight was not too much for him--and for
   God to bear us up is as nothing to Him! We may come to Him with what we
   call our great needs and He will smilingly say, "A crumb from My table
   will suffice for a million such as you." The things that are but
   trifles with the Most High would be enough for all the inhabitants of
   the world, if they would come to Him--therefore let us trust Him, as I
   sometimes say, "Up to the hilt." Let us go in for glorious trusting of
   our God! When a man swims, it is a good thing to have deep water. You
   do not need, then, to calculate whether it is a mile deep or twenty
   miles--if you are swimming, why, you are swimming! When you come to
   trust in the Infinite God, let Him be infinite in your thoughts as far
   as the finite can accept infinity. Trust Him without limit or bound,
   without suspicion or mistrust!

   For, further, as He must be true, being God, and as He has been true,
   being God, so He has no motive for being untrue. Why does God ever
   speak to us at all? Why does the Infinite ever stoop out of His
   boundless Glory to make Himself known to creatures that, before Him,
   are much more insignificant than an ant on the anthill can be to a man?
   You have never strained yourselves, I am sure, to reveal yourselves to
   a worm--and yet God has put forth all His sacred ingenuity to manifest
   Himself to man who, compared with his Maker, is but the insect of a
   minute! Why, do you think, He should speak to us--to deceive us? It
   seems to me to be the height of absurdity to suppose that if Jehovah
   breaks the eternal silences, it is to mislead a poor, miserable
   creature like man. Oh, no! The love that makes Him speak cannot be
   questioned and the Truth which He speaks must not be doubted!

   If God reveals Himself to men at all, men may, like little children
   with a father, feel themselves quite sure that they may most safely
   trust every word of the Revelation. Men talk of all the "mistakes of
   Scripture." I thank God that I have never met with any! Mistakes of
   translation there may be, for translators are men, but mistakes of the
   original Word there never can be, for the God who spoke it is
   Infallible and so is every Word He speaks! And in that confidence we
   find delightful rest. There can be no motive for God to give us a Book
   that is partly true and partly false, about which we are to be the
   judges, accepting this portion and discarding the other. That would
   make us worse off and fill us with yet more self-conceit than we would
   have had if we had been left without the Book at all! This can never be
   the case--therefore let us believe that, in God's motive for speaking
   to us, which must be condescending love, there is a guarantee that He
   speaks the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.

   I feel almost ashamed to be talking like this about Him who is so
   surely true, and whom you and I have tried and proved these many years.
   It seems so idle to have to prove what nobody ought to doubt. For, once
   more, remember that the honor of God is involved in His veracity. If
   you say that God is not Almighty, we may pray God to forgive your
   mistake. But if you say that He is not truthful, there is a
   spitefulness, a malice about your assertion which is a grievous wrong
   to His holy Character. God untrue? Oh, Sir, I beseech you, do not think
   so for a moment, for this is a high crime and misdemeanor against the
   Majesty of the Eternal Throne! God will sooner cease to be than break
   His promise or forget His pledged Word. He is very jealous for His own
   Glory. He calls Himself, in the Ten Commandments, a jealous God, and so
   He is. He will never permit the Glory of His infinite Majesty to be
   tainted by the suspicion of a falsehood. Therefore, let not any child
   of His ever doubt Him and, as I fear we have done so, let us tremble
   before Him and repent that we should ever have had the audacity, even,
   to tolerate within a mile of our thoughts, anything like a suspicion of
   our God. His honor is compromised if He breaks His Covenant, but this
   He cannot do, as Paul writes to the Hebrews, "Wherein God, willing more
   abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His
   counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in
   which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
   consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
   before us." The blood of the only-begotten Son of God has sealed the
   Covenant--and sooner shall Heaven and earth pass away than any part of
   that Covenant shall fall to the ground!

   Only this one thing I add. Suppose, even for a moment--a supposition we
   will not even make--that we could not trust in the truthfulness of God?
   What would be left for us to trust to? When rocks move, what stands
   firm? If God, Himself, can change, or be not true--come, Night, and
   swallow me up in your blackness! Come Chaos, and devour me! Oh, for
   annihilation, that we might cease to be if God has ceased to be true!
   Then would the harbors be turned to whirlpools! Then would the rocks be
   turned into clouds! Would there be anything left? Would not everything
   disappear, like the foam of the sea, if God could be proven to not be
   true? Thank God, we do not live in such a chaos as that! We know that
   He is true and, with Paul, we cry, "Let God be true, but every man a
   liar." Let everything else be swept away like chaff before the wind,
   but the eternal God and His Word will stand unmoved forever and ever!

   That is my first point--God deserves to be believed.

   II. But, secondly, SOME ARE NOT WILLING TO BELIEVE GOD. That is clear
   by the fear expressed in the text--

   "If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established."

   "If you will not believe." Believing is a matter of the will. A man
   does not believe without being willing to believe. God's Grace works
   faith, not upon us, but in us. God works in us to will and to do and,
   in the willing, He leads us up to believing. We voluntarily believe
   and, certainly, men voluntarily disbelieve--and some of them, with
   strong perversity of will, would not believe even though one rose from
   the dead! Why is this, this strange unwillingness of some men, no, in a
   sense, of all men, to believe in God?

   They are willing to believe other things. We have numbers of persons
   about who are like fish with their mouths open, ready for any bait. It
   does not matter how absurd may be the dream of a man, if he will
   persistently enough stand up in the street and publish his dream, or
   will print it, he will be certain to find a number of fools who will
   believe what he says! In this country, although we think ourselves so
   very wise, Carlyle was not far off when he spoke of our population as
   consisting of so many millions, "mostly fools." At any rate, there is a
   considerable sprinkling of them about. See how readily men believe what
   they read in the newspaper, though, probably, there is not a fragment
   of truth in it! That is all the better for the paper because the lie
   can be contradicted tomorrow, and that will make another column or two,
   and so fill up at a time when there is a dearth of news! But there is
   great credulity among men in general. Do you think that anybody could
   sell patent medicines if everybody were wise? No, but everybody is not
   wise. We are willing to believe what a man tells us if he will only
   tell it to us bravely enough, with a sufficient quantity of brass. But
   when it comes to believing God's Word, many manifest a strange
   incapacity to believe! The box is shut and you cannot find the key! But
   bring a lie of man, and the box opens of its own accord! There is a
   sort of, "Open sesame," then. Alas, often the falsehood of men is
   received and the Truth of God is rejected!

   Another thing is significant, that men cling tenaciously to faith in
   themselves. They do believe, they will believe, that they can work
   their way to Heaven. You talk to them about their sin. Well, they
   cannot deny it, but they so extenuate it as to make it appear to be
   rather their misfortune than their fault. It is, with them, a calamity
   to be sinners, rather than a grave offense. So they make it out to be
   and, in the future, those poor creatures are going to manage
   themselves! The

   wine cup, it is true, has tempted them, and they have fallen many
   times--but now they know better--they will never be affected by drink,
   again! The lust of the flesh which has led them captive to many a
   Delilah--oh, yes, they have "sown their wild oats"--but they will never
   go into that form of evil, again--and so on, and so on! The creature
   that has done nothing right, but everything that is wrong, still
   believes in himself. He goes to church and calls himself a "miserable
   sinner," and yet continues to be a happy believer in his capacity to
   rule himself. "We have done the things we ought not to have done, and
   have left undone the things we ought to have done; and there is no
   health in us." Yes, we said that on our knees, but when we get on our
   legs, again, we are going to do the things we ought to do, and to leave
   undone the things which should be left undone--and we feel as
   healthy--from the crown of our head to the sole of our feet, as if we
   never had a disease about us in our lives! Now, that is a strange
   thing, that man can believe in himself and yet cannot believe in God!
   This is the madness of our nature--that man thinks that he can do
   everything when he can do nothing!

   Then, observe how, instead of believing in the Lord Jesus Christ unto
   eternal life, some prefer an emotional religion. I am astounded at some
   people, how readily they are excited, how easily they are "saved"--at
   least they say they are saved. Do they believe the promises and hang
   upon the Word of God? No, but they "feel" so much. These same feelings
   that seem to lift you up to Heaven will thrust you down to the depths
   of Hades! Yet these people prefer mere natural emotions, an inward
   feeling, to this which is the infinitely sounder way--to believe in God
   and in Jesus Christ whom He has sent.

   Next, some stubbornly suffer under unbelief. They have been pining for
   rest for years and they have not attained it, yet. Still, they will not
   believe in Christ. Oh, what would they not give if they could but have
   a night's calm rest and could by day go to business without distress of
   mind! Yet they will not give themselves up to Christ to be saved,
   simply trusting Him to save them. They have brought themselves near to
   the door of suicide and wished they had never been born--yet they will
   not take the healing medicine that lies close by their hands! They will
   do anything, sooner than trust

   in God!

   I notice, too, that such people demand this and that of God, beyond
   what He has revealed. God has spoken, but that is not enough for them.
   God must do something else for them--they must dream some peculiar
   dream, they must see some strange vision--they must fancy that they
   hear a voice in the air. Pshaw! Put the whole of that nonsense away!
   Believe what God has said and you are on sure ground. Come to this
   "more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed,
   as unto a light that shines in a dark place." Believe this and your
   peace shall be like a river and your righteousness as the waves of the
   sea! But no--they will not. God must do this or that to oblige them, or
   else they will not believe Him. You make Him a liar if He will not
   pamper your whims--but He will do nothing of the sort!

   I might, with profit, dwell on that point, but time flies too rapidly
   for me to say more upon it.

   III. Notice, in the third place, that FAITH IS NOT A THING TO BE
   DESPISED.

   Have you never heard people say, "Oh, they preach up faith, you know"?
   "Well, what is faith?" "Well, it is just believing so-and-so." Listen,
   Sirs, and then speak like that no more! Faith is a most wonderful
   thing, for it is a fair index of the heart. If you will not believe in
   God, I see that in your heart you hate God. But if you will believe
   Him, you love Him. We trust a man whom we love. I think that there is
   little trust in men towards whom we have no esteem and affection. If
   you believe God, your heart is right with Him. If you will not believe
   Him, do what you may, you are out of order with your God, I am sure of
   that. We know that a child who does not believe his father's word is
   not a loving and obedient

   child.

   Faith in God is, next, a sure proof of a change of mind, for, by
   nature, we do not think of God, much less do we trust Him--we trust
   what we can see, hear, taste and feel. When we trust God, it shows that
   we have undergone a great change of mind, an amazing change, of which
   there can be no surer evidence than that we see Him who is invisible
   and we live under the influence of His Presence, and we really seek to
   please Him whom mortal eyes have never seen.

   Does anyone think that faith is a little thing? Why, it inaugurates
   purity of life. The moment that a man believes in Christ Jesus, and
   trusts Him, he ceases from the sin he formerly loved. Sin becomes to
   him a burden and a plague. If you believe, your belief will kill your
   sinning, or else your sinning will kill your believing! The greatest
   argument against the Bible is an unholy life--and when a man will give
   that up--he will convict himself. The Book will convict him when he has
   put out of the way that darling sin that now stands between him and
   God. A belief in God, as He reveals Himself in Christ, is the
   inauguration of a life of self-sacrifice and holiness.

   Do any still talk of faith as being a little thing? Why, it is faith
   that leads to prayer, and prayer is the very breath of God in man,
   returning from where it came! If you believe, you will pray. How can
   you pray if you do not believe? Do you knock at a door of which you are
   persuaded that there is nobody there to hear you? You are not such a
   fool, I trust, but when you believe that there is a God, and that God
   is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him, you will begin to
   seek Him--and you will never leave off seeking Him as long as you are
   in the land of the living!

   Faith little? Why, it is faith that glorifies God. All the works that
   we can ever do, be they what they may, can never bring such Glory to
   God as a single act of trust! I venture to say that the highest
   adoration is not that of cherubim and seraphim before the blazing
   Throne of God, but that of a poor sinner, conscious of guilt, who,
   nevertheless, believes in God as He reveals Himself in Christ, putting
   away sin by the great Sacrifice. If you can, tonight, believe, even if
   you are the biggest sinner out of Hell--it you can believe, I say--that
   God can pardon you, you have done Him honor! And if you, poor, troubled
   Christian, in the very vortex of your grief, can still believe that God
   is faithful and that He will bear you through, you have glorified His
   blessed name more than angels can! This is practical music that
   consists not in sound, but in the inner sense of the heart. It is true
   melody to God. Faith is not the trifle that some think it to be. This
   holy trust in God is the heart and soul of all true experimental
   godliness!

   IV. So I have come to my last point, grieving that I have had to slur
   so much where I should have liked to speak at length--THOSE WHO REFUSE
   TO EXERCISE FAITH WILL MISS MANY GREAT PRIVILEGES. I might mention
   many, but the text gives us the one which I will dwell upon--"If you
   will not believe, surely you shall not be established."

   It means, first, that those who believe not will miss establishment in
   comfort. If you believe not in God, your heart shall be moved like the
   trees of the woods by the wind. You shall be tossed to and fro like the
   waves that dash on the rocks. You shall be driven along like a rolling
   thing that is twisted about by the whirlwind. But if you will believe
   in God and in His dear Son who reveals Him, then you shall come to an
   anchorage and there you shall outride every storm! Fear shall depart
   and your soul shall be at rest. Oh, you do not know the profound calm
   that spreads over the spirit when it has done with itself and just
   commits itself to God! You never can know this if you will not believe.

   In the next place, if you will not believe, you shall never enjoy
   establishment in judgement. There are many persons who do not know what
   to believe--they heard one man, the other day, and they thought that he
   spoke very cleverly, and they agreed with him. They heard another, the
   next day, who was rather more clever, and he went the other way, so
   they went with him! Poor Souls, driven to and fro, never knowing what
   is what! "If you will not believe, surely you shall not be
   established." You shall be like the moon that is never, two days,
   alike. You shall seem to believe this and to believe that, and yet,
   really believe nothing! But if you will come and trust your God--wholly
   believe every Word that He has spoken and, especially, believe the
   Incarnate Word, the ever-blessed Son of God who gave Himself for the
   guilty--then you shall begin to know something! You shall put things in
   their right places and, knowing the Truth of God, you shall know more
   of it and you shall get the assurance of faith from which you shall
   never be shaken, as the Holy Spirit shall bear witness to the Truth
   within your soul.

   Next, we need an establishment in conduct. Look at certain men who once
   professed to be converted. They were down at a revival meeting the
   other day and they went to the penitent form. But then, a day or two
   after, they went to quite another form. They made a confession of faith
   and joined the Church. Ah, me, the Church will be well rid of them if
   their conduct is such as it has been, lately! But why is it that their
   conduct is not always as it should be? How is it that many men are this
   and that and 20 things? How is it that there is inconsistent behavior?
   My text supplies the answer, "If you will not believe, surely you shall
   not be established." But a genuine faith in God, a solid faith in the
   blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ, a true realization of the
   sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit will keep you from stumbling and
   you shall be preserved faultless until the coming of your Lord!

   So it is, also, with establishment in hope. We know some who are, at
   times, all bright of eyes and cheerful with hope, and they look into
   the Eternal World with great delight. They half wish that they could
   die at once and be where Jesus is! But after a very short time their
   castle in the air melts away--they have no joy, no hope, no peace. No,
   "If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established." If you
   hope without believing, your hope is an anchor that has not gripped
   anything. If you expect without a proper ground of expectation, or if
   the ground is not what God has said, then you may expect what you like,
   but as your expectation is not from Him, it will certainly be
   disappointed. Oh, that you would

   make the Word of God the top and bottom of everything in your life! Oh,
   that you would take it as the Alpha and Omega of your knowledge of
   things Divine! Then would you be established, for there would be
   something to ground your hope upon, which even Satan could not destroy!

   And, lastly, we need to be established in spiritual vigor and strength.
   You do not need to be always babes in Christ-- you need to be fathers.
   You desire to be useful--you need to be bringing others to Christ.
   Perhaps you look at some with envy. You say, "Such-and-such a person is
   quite a mother in Israel. Such-and-such a man is a standard-bearer for
   Christ. But I am a poor, puny thing, of no use to the Lord." If you
   would grow, you must believe your God! He that gets close to God and
   leans wholly upon God, shall have Divine strength imparted to him. We
   have never believed God, any one of us, as we ought to have believed
   Him. Some of us have believed Him, as we thought, without reserve at
   times. Have we not gone to Him? We will not tell the story now--but
   have we not gone to Him in abject need and cast ourselves upon Him--and
   found all supplies even exceeding abundantly above what we asked for or
   even thought? Then have we found that our God has been to us like the
   illimitable waters of the great sea, and we have cried to others,
   "Bring your great vessels and fill them from this ocean."

   I am told that in the olden times, on Christmas Day, it was the custom
   in country villages for the squire always to fill with good things
   whatever vessels the poor people brought up to the hall, that they
   might have a Christmas dinner. It was strange how big the basins grew
   year after year! Whenever the man came round with the crockery cart,
   every good housewife would look all over his stock to see if there was
   not a still larger basin. It was a rule that the squire's servants
   should always fill the bowl, whatever size it was, and thus the bowls
   grew bigger and bigger! Oh, my dear Friends, God will fill your bowl
   however large it is! Get as big a bowl as you can--and when you bring
   it, if ever there comes a whisper in your ear, "Now you have presumed
   upon God's benevolence, you have brought too big a bowl"--smile at
   yourself and say, "This is as nothing to His overflowing fullness."

   If I said, "O poor Sea, poor Sea, now you will be drained dry, for they
   bring such big bowls to be filled with your waters!" The sea, tossing
   its mighty billows far and wide, would laugh at my folly! Come, then,
   and bring your largest conceptions of God and multiply them ten
   thousand-fold and believe in Him as this Book would make you believe in
   Him! Open your mouth wide and He will fill it. He bids you, even, to
   command Him. He says, "Ask Me of things to come concerning My sons, and
   concerning the work of My hands command you Me." That is a wonderful
   expression! Rise to the sublimity of faith and be daring with your God!

   And you guilty ones, look up, believing that He is greater in mercy
   than you are in sin--and more able to forgive than you are to
   transgress--and you shall find it so! But "if you will not believe,
   surely you shall not be established." Let us all go home, believing in
   Christ Jesus, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. ISAIAH 7:1-16; 2 CHRONICLES 28:1-16.

   Isaiah 7:1, 2. And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of
   Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Tadah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
   and Pekah the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem
   to war against it, but could not prevail against it. And it was told
   the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his
   heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood
   are moved with the wind. They were tossed to and fro, bent, thrown
   down, as the trees of a forest in a tornado. They had already felt the
   power of these two confederate kings and they were terribly afraid.
   David, himself, would have had confidence in God, but, "the house of
   David" had gone far astray. Ahaz had cast off the fear of God and he
   had, therefore, great fear of men.

   3. Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and
   Shear-Jashub your son. Shear-Jashub was but a child and why Isaiah was
   to take his son with him does not appear, except that his name
   signifies, "The remnant shall return," and it was part of the Prophet's
   message that the remnant, the people who had been carried away captive,
   should return.

   3. At the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
   fuller's field. God knows the exact spot where His servants shall meet
   with the men to whom He sends them. There is a corner where the
   fuller's field just juts upon the up-

   per pool--there Isaiah will meet king Ahaz--and there he is to speak to
   him. Is there any spot by the "Elephant and Castle" where God means to
   meet with some soul, tonight? I pray that it may be so.

   4. And say unto him. The Prophet is told the word he is to speak as
   well as the place where he is to deliver the message. Isaiah knew that
   he was soon to go and deal with men of hard heart and deaf ears. The
   other day we read the sixth chapter of this prophecy and we noted the
   hard task that Isaiah had to perform. Now he is beginning his work with
   the man whom the Bible calls, "That King Ahaz," as if it could not say
   anything bad enough of him, but had merely to mention his name and
   everybody would know who was meant.

   4. Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the
   two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin
   with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. Their kingdoms were dying out.
   They were like burnt-out firebrands--they made a little smoke--and
   within a very short time there would be nothing left of them. And Ahaz
   need not be afraid of them.

   5-9. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
   counsel against you, saying, Let us go up against Judah, and vex it,
   and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of
   it, even the son of Tabeal: thus says the Lord GOD, It shall not stand,
   neither shall it come to pass. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and
   the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years
   shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. And the head of
   Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Renzaliah's son. God did
   not intend it to grow any bigger. These two little kingdoms of Syria
   and Ephraim were to keep as they were until they were destroyed.

   9-12. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.
   Moreover the LORD spoke again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask you a sign of the
   LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. But
   Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. He put his
   refusal very prettily, as men often do when they want to say an evil
   thing. He refused to accept a sign from the Lord under the idle
   pretense that it would be tempting God. We never tempt God when we do
   what He bids us! There is no presumption in obedience. It was an idle
   compliment, to conceal the impudence of his heart. The Lord invited him
   to acknowledge Jehovah as his God--"Ask you a sign of Jehovah your
   God." But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt Jehovah." He
   did not say, "Jehovah, my God." And his silence meant dissent.

   13. And he said, Hear you now, O house of David. Observe, the Prophet
   does not say, "Hear now, O Ahaz," as if God would not deal with Ahaz on
   his own account, but only because he was of the "house of David." The
   Lord remembered His Covenant with David. God sometimes blesses men for
   the sake of their fathers. He might not hear a word that they have to
   say, but He remembers their fathers and the amity and harmony which
   there was between Himself and their fathers.

   13, 14. Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my
   God, also? Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a
   virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son. A most wonderful sign is this!

   14, 15. And shall call His name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall He
   eat, that He may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
   Whereupon a wise commentator says that before children are able to
   learn, their parents should look upon the very feeding of them as a
   means of making them to know the difference between good and evil.

   16. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the
   good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings. This
   was the sign-manual. Judah could not be destroyed, for our Lord was to
   spring out of Judah--and this was the sign that Judah must stand
   because Immanuel must be born of that nation--and the time for this
   great event was fixed by the Lord. Until a child is some few years of
   age, he does not distinguish between good and evil; but in a shorter
   time than it would take a child to come to years of responsibility, God
   meant to cut off both those kings--and He did. This was a very
   wonderful prophecy and ought to have filled Ahaz with great delight,
   and with confidence in God, but it did nothing of the kind. Now we are
   going to read more of the story of this King Ahaz.

   2 Chronicles 28:1-3. Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign,
   and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
   was right in the sight of the LORD, like David, his father, for he
   walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images
   for Baalim. Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of
   Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
   the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
   God had driven out the Canaanites because of these abominations and,
   therefore, for His own people to practice them was peculiarly provoking
   to Him.

   4. He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the
   hills, and under every green tree. He could not do enough of it--so
   many trees, so many altars. There are some men who use every
   opportunity for sin with a diligence which would bring the blush into
   the face of Christians who are not as diligent in obeying as these men
   are in sinning.

   5. Therefore the LORD, his God, delivered him into the hands of the
   king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude
   of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also
   delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a
   great slaughter. It did not look as if the captives would ever return,
   yet the Prophet's son was named Shear-Jashub, "The remnant shall
   return." Ahaz might have said to Isaiah, "Your child's name is a lie."
   We shall see.

   6-11. For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, slew in Judah an hundred and
   twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they
   had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. And Zichri, a mighty man of
   Ephraim, slew Maaseiah, the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the
   house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. And the children of
   Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand,
   women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them,
   and brought the spoil to Samaria. But a Prophet of the LORD was there,
   whose name was Oded, and he went out before the host that came to
   Samaria and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your
   fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand, and
   you have slain them in a rage that reached up unto Heaven. And now you
   purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen
   and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins
   against the LORD your God? Now, hear me, therefore, and deliver the
   captives again, which you have taken, captive of your brethren: for the
   fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you. It was very wonderful that these
   wild fellows should listen to this Prophet with all those captives
   round about them. It was a brave act on the part of the Prophet Oded to
   go out and utter his protest.

   12-15. Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
   the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshil-lemoth, and Jehizkiah
   the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them
   that came from the war, and said unto them, You shall not bring in the
   captives here: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already,
   you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
   trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel. So the
   armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all
   the congregation. And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and
   took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
   them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to
   drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon
   asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their
   brethren: then they returned to Samaria. What a wonderful thing that
   was! Ahaz ought to have said to Isaiah, "Your child's name is right,
   after all, for the remnant has returned." Did it not seem as if Ahaz
   must now trust God? But notice what the next verse says.

   16. At that time did King Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help
   him. When men are determined to be unbelievers and disobedient, they
   will send anywhere for help but to the Lord. Israel and Syria were very
   little kingdoms, but Assyria was a great empire, the mighty nation of
   the period. Yet no help came to Ahaz from that quarter, for we read in
   the 20th verse, "And Tilgath-Pilneser, king of Assyria, came unto him
   and distressed him, but strengthened him not." The 21st verse tells us
   that Ahaz bribed the king of Assyria, "but he helped him not." That is
   always the dirge at the end of all efforts to secure human instead of
   Divine aid.

Servitude Or Service--Which?

   (No. 2306)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, APRIL 30, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   14, 1889.

   "Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know My
   service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries." 2
   Chronicles 12:8.

   THE people of God had left their God and He had left them, so that
   Shishak, the king of Egypt, came against them, and though the Lord had
   respect to their humble prayer and would not suffer Shishak to destroy
   Jerusalem, yet He brought them into subjection to the Egyptian king.
   Our text tells us the reason for this servitude--"They shall be his
   servants; that they may know My service, and the service of the
   kingdoms of the countries."

   Beloved Friends, the children of Israel were bound to the service of
   God. Jehovah had chosen them out of all the nations of the world to be
   His people. He had committed the Holy Oracles to the seed of Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob--they were, from before the foundation of the world,
   set apart in the eternal purpose to be the Lord's. That highly
   honorable and gracious choice ought to have bound them to His service.
   In addition to this, they were called out by His own voice. Their
   father, Abraham, was fetched out from Ur of the Chaldees where he
   served other gods, and he was led to know Jehovah and to follow Him. He
   walked with God and God was very familiar with him, so that He spoke
   with him as a man speaks with his friend. All along the ages God called
   His people out from the world. Especially did He call them out of
   Egypt, delivering them out of the house of bondage with a high hand and
   with an outstretched arm. He led them through the wilderness, fed them
   with manna and instructed them and, in this way, He separated them to
   be His own peculiar portion beyond all the sons of men. By their
   calling, then, as well as by their election, they were bound to keep
   close to the one living and true God.

   And above this, as if to make them doubly His own, He entered into a
   Covenant with them. It was first made with Abraham, then it was renewed
   with Isaac and with Jacob. The Covenant was still further ratified in
   the wilderness where the Lord promised that when they came into Canaan,
   He would be their God and He would bless them. But He stipulated that
   they must obey His voice, cling to Him and have Him, only, to be their
   God. Also His Word and His Law were to be the rule and guide of their
   life. This Covenant, God always kept, but the people broke it very
   soon, so that Moses shattered the tablets of stone, a fit symbol of the
   way in which Israel broke the Law of God!

   Is it not very sad to think that the great God, who made the heavens
   and the earth, should have but one nation out of all the inhabitants of
   the world--and these His by choice, by calling and by Covenant--and yet
   that they should continually grow weary of Him? Other peoples did not
   change their gods. It was a rare thing for a nation to cast away its
   idols in those days. But Israel, which alone had the true God, while
   the rest had gods that were only idols, quit the living and true God to
   set up in His place the gods of the heathen which could do them no
   good!

   Now, this phenomenon of human nature, this going after idols and
   leaving the true God, is constantly being renewed. We have the same
   thing, even, in the Church of God, which never seems to be satisfied
   with chaste love for Christ, but continually goes after one strange
   lover and another. Thus Christ's pure Truth is left for some brilliant
   error! And His simple worship is deserted for some invention of man!
   Even when God spoke by His servant, Shemaiah, the Prophet, the men of
   Judah were itching to be after their idols and panting to get away from
   God! And the Lord said, "Inasmuch as they have forsaken Me, I have left
   them in the hand of Shishak, and they shall be his servants; that they
   may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."

   I. In considering these words, tonight, I shall say, first, that THERE
   ARE SOME WHO HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN THE SERVICE OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE
   COUNTRIES.

   We have many round about us who have deliberately chosen not to serve
   God, but to serve other masters. O Beloved, if you have chosen to serve
   God, it is because God has chosen you! If I am speaking, tonight, to
   any of you whose one objective in life is God's Glory, who can truly
   say that you live as in the fear of God, and before Him, endeavoring to
   please Him--that is evidence of a work of Grace within your heart. You
   are very grateful that such a work of Grace has been worked upon you,
   but how many there are of our follow men who have chosen some other god
   and some other way of living!

   Some choose to be the slaves of open sin. Hardly, I think, would they
   choose such slavery if they really knew all that it included, but they
   have chosen it practically. How many there are who are the devotees of
   drunkenness! Ah, me, what can they see in Bacchus that they should
   worship him? Others are the slaves of licentiousness. I need not
   mention the forms of uncleanness in which so many wallow in this foul
   city of ours, where the temptation to sin is in every street. The forms
   of evil are many--I need not mention them, for, if I did, I might omit
   one and then, perhaps, the person who is under its influence might
   fancy that I did not think it to be a sin! But if you choose to live
   for sinful pleasure, let me tell you that you have entered upon a
   servitude compared with which the service of God is light and pleasant,
   indeed. Whatever the strictest form of religion may require of you, it
   will never demand of you so much as vicious pleasures will. I could
   stand here and tell of cases that have come under my own notice, of men
   and women who, in pursuit of sin, have brought themselves to beggary.
   Have I not seen the son of honest and godly parents clothed in rags and
   covered with vermin, so that when I spoke to him, I could not, with the
   utmost sympathy, dare to come within an arm's length of him?

   Have I not seen the same sort of person, through drunkenness, full of
   disease, bloated and surely soon to die? And when other sins have been
   added to these, have we not, sometimes, been in a hospital where,
   talking with a wretched man upon his bed, who brought upon himself the
   whole of his disease, we could not but feel that a martyr, when he died
   at the stake, did not endure for God such awful agony as this poor fool
   endured in the pursuit of his lusts? I tell you, and I defy the world
   to doubt the statement, that the service of sin is the most horrible of
   slaveries and, that, when men give themselves to it, and their passions
   become dominant, the worse serfdom that there ever was upon the face of
   the earth is freedom compared with the bondage of a man's own passions!

   If you want to know the truth about this matter, I would not advise you
   to learn it by experience, but I would recommend you to go to someone
   who has run his evil course and has come to the end of it--and ask him
   if it is not true that the wages of sin is death! Then go to the dying
   Christian, like one of our Brethren who has passed away this week, a
   man who spent his Sabbaths preaching the Word and earned his bread in
   the week-days. When he came to die, with an internal cancer, those who
   saw him said that nobody could be happier, nobody could be more full of
   triumph than he in the prospect of soon being with his Savior! Oh, let
   me serve God! Let me not serve my lusts! Young men, young women, God
   help you, by His Grace, to make that wise and happy choice at once!

   There are many persons who are not the worshippers of vice, but they
   are the votaries of making money. They are the slaves of the thirst for
   wealth. This is a very common evil and I invite you to look upon those
   who have made gain the one objective of life. Some have carried it out
   very resolutely. The miser lives poor that he may die rich. He scrapes
   money together that his heir may fling it away. I think that his god is
   a very poor one and that the service he renders to his god is a very
   wretched business, for when he succeeds in gathering money, then there
   is the care of keeping it--and with some it is a very great care,
   indeed! I will not mention the name of one of the richest men of this
   period, but I believe it is true that when one congratulated him upon
   his great wealth, he said, "Oh, do not talk in that way! Here is a
   fellow who has just written to me, saying that I must give him L200 or
   else he will blow my brains out! And, wherever I am, I am always being
   persecuted for money. Money brings no happiness to people who possess
   it." He is one who ought to know, for he has more than most men. You
   will find that persons who rise in what are called the ranks of
   society, do not have more happiness--they only have a heavier load to
   carry.

   I find one stick to be a great help to me when I go out walking, but if
   I had a bundle of 20 sticks, I suppose I should find it quite a load to
   carry. And those who accumulate so much wealth often have to confess
   that the game is not worth the candle--they have only acquired that
   which they cannot enjoy. A man cannot wear more than one suit of
   clothes at a time, after all, and let him do what he likes, he cannot
   eat seven dinners in a day, and he cannot enjoy ten times more than

   anyone else. While the poor man always has a stomach for his meat and
   his only trouble is to get meat for his stomach, this poor rich man can
   find no appetite to enjoy his dainties. Ah, the advocate of making
   money is employed in a hard service! I have seen him, even when he is
   getting old, and when he has made sufficient wealth, with his nose
   still on the grindstone! He must always be at the office. He must be
   always sticking to his post like the worst paid clerk in the place--and
   he is still as stingy as ever. He has buried himself beneath a hill of
   gold. Live for God, my dear Sir--He will give you the things of this
   life--He will show you how to get as much as shall be truly useful to
   you! But if you make gold your god, you will serve a hard master!

   There are some others who do not try to get much money, but they are
   lovers offashion, lovers of society, admirers of the world. I will not
   say much about these ladies and gentlemen. I do not think that I have
   enough respect for them to speak about their special form of slavery.
   They must go away from London when "society" goes. They would be
   ashamed to stay at home when fashionable people go out of town. They
   must go to such-and-such a place, not because they care to go there,
   but because it is the fashion! They have to do just this much and they
   must not do that much. Poor slaves, I should like to snap every link of
   their chains! It does seem such a dreadful piece of slavery for men and
   women that they dare not do what is right, and what they would like to
   do, but must do what other people do! Etiquette binds them hand and
   foot. Oh, that they had but the will and the strength to break these
   fetters! The man who dresses for fashion and lives for fashion, ceases
   to be a man! I know what they call such creatures, but I will not
   repeat the term of contempt which is applied to them. The woman who
   lives only to be fashionable ceases to be a woman. I will say no more
   about her. This idol of fashion is a hard and silly god, for it
   requires its devotees to make themselves into fools, if not into
   something worse.

   Then there is another cult that has lately come up which some have
   chosen, so that they have become the devotees of "culture." Many have
   forsaken the simple Gospel and turned away from the belief in their
   Bible which their mother had, and in which their father died, because
   they want to be considered very thoughtful and clever and superior
   persons! Now, I have noticed that whenever a person gives up his belief
   in the Word of God because it requires that he should believe a good
   deal, his unbelief requires him to believe a great deal more. If there
   are any difficulties in the faith of Christ, they are not one-tenth as
   great as the absurdities in any system of unbelief which seeks to take
   its place! I do not hesitate to say that the whole doctrine of
   Evolution, with which many men are fascinated today, is ten thousand
   times more absurd than the most ridiculous travesty of what is taught
   in the Word of God and, it requires more faith, and also far greater
   gullibility than to believe any doctrine which is deduced from Holy
   Scripture!

   You will find great demands made upon your faith by Shishak, if you
   become his servants. He will tax you and take all you have, whereas, to
   believe what God has said is, after all, but a reasonable service. The
   man who goes in for the new ideas in religion--the man of "progress,"
   who is so wise and learned--must confess that he loses that sweet rest
   of heart that he has seen in Christian people, which was enjoyed by the
   godly woman described by Cowper--

   "Who knows, and knows no more, her Bible true, A truth the brilliant
   Frenchman never knew." There is safe anchorage for us, here, but there
   is no anchorage in the sea ofpersonal infallibility. "Oh!" says one, "I
   never claimed that." No, my dear Sir, but there must be infallibility
   somewhere--and if you are the judge of the Word of God, you have
   shifted the infallibility from the Word to yourself--and you are really
   the claimant of it. In your own heart of hearts, you think so! Where
   will you ever get rest with such a delusion as that? He who rests on
   himself, rests on a very frail foundation, indeed!

   I believe this night that upon which I can pray, that upon which I can
   live, that upon which I can die! My faith is fixed in the revealed Word
   of God and I find that it sustains me in the hour of bitter bodily
   pain, with which I am too well acquainted--and in the hour of deep
   depression of spirit, with which I am all too familiar--and in the time
   of cruel desertion, for I have had some of the best friends fail me.
   And in the time of slander, for who has had anything worse spoken of
   him than they have uttered against me? I can fall back upon the eternal
   Truths of God--they are the hills from which my help comes--and they
   never fail me. Can any man say the same of his "culture" and
   "progress," and of his "advanced thought"? Can he live or die on such
   stuff as that? Why, he cannot even live on it, for, by his own
   admission, he cannot write out his creed because he believes one thing,
   today, but he may believe quite another thing tomorrow--and

   the next day he will, in all probability, have shifted his ground,
   again. Oh, this Shishak, this new god, lately come up-- his service is
   unspeakably harder than the service of the eternal Truth of God--and
   there is no wage to be won from it!

   I will only refer to one more class of those who have chosen the
   service of the kingdoms--these are the seekers of self-righteousness.
   This is an old-fashioned and very respectable deity whom many still
   worship. They are seeking to be saved by their own works, by their
   charitableness, by their religiousness, by sacraments, by priests, by
   their own feelings, by something of their own! It is a hard way in
   which a man never has any rest or assurance. It is a way in which he
   runs because of the crack of the whip behind him--"Do this and you
   shall live! Do not do this and you shall perish!" How infinitely
   superior is the way of simply trusting Christ and then obeying Him out
   of gratitude--not working for life, but from life! Not seeking to serve
   Christ in order to be saved, but because you are saved, and wish to
   work out that which God has worked in you, to will and to do of His own
   good pleasure!

   Surveying these different masters, I venture to say, once and for all,
   and then I leave this part of my subject, that those who have chosen
   the service of the kingdoms have made a very foolish and evil
   choice--and that those who have chosen the service of God may forever
   bless the Lord with all their hearts!

   II. Here is our second point. SOME SEEM TO BE PINING TO GIVE UP THE
   SERVICE OF GOD AND TO GO TO THE SERVICE OF THE KINGDOMS.

   It is a strange thing, but this evil is always breaking out even among
   the people of God. Some want to change out of sheer love of change.
   That you should want to change ministers, I do not at all wonder--my
   voice must have become very monotonous to some of you--but that you
   should want to change gospels, that does distress me! That there should
   be any man who grows weary of the everlasting chimes of the glorious
   notes of Free Grace and dying love appalls me. No, no! Let me hear the
   voice of God through eternity, for it has a perpetual freshness and
   novelty about it! I can bear with the monotony of the preacher, if the
   monotone is still full of Jesus and His love. But there are some people
   who cannot be constant to anything. They are like the moon. You could
   not measure the moon for a suit of clothes with the hope of ever
   fitting it and, so, you cannot tell what these men are or where they
   are, for they are always changing.

   Some want to be off to their idols because of the outward aspect of the
   new thing. It looks grand to them to go in for the "culture" ideas, and
   it seems a fine thing to live for the world. Men of the world seem so
   grand as they roll along in their carriages--why should we not be as
   great as they? Then there is something very tangible about minding the
   main chance, for, after all, if you do not get the pounds and pence,
   where are you? The world will not think much of you! "Oh!" says one, "I
   like the thought of this following after Christ, but He is a root out
   of a dry ground, and His people are generally poor, common sort of
   folk. I should like to get in among the uppermost people." When men
   begin to run down the people of God, I always find that they are not
   worth much, themselves. When any man is ashamed of a child of God
   because he is poor, he must be a very poor creature, himself. But that
   is often a reason for turning away from the service of God to the
   service of the kingdoms.

   Sometimes men turn aside because of their loss ofjoy in the service of
   God. They are not serving the Lord as they used to do. They are doing
   but little for Him. Now, a little religion is a very bitter thing. If
   you have only a little of it, you will find that there is no sweetness
   in it. It is like the boys that go to bathe in the river in the early
   morning. One just dips his foot in the water. "Ugh!" he cries. It
   shivers him right through, but he who takes a header and plunges in,
   glows all over in a moment! I wish that some religious people would
   just take a header. If they did, they would feel the joy of the Lord
   thrill through them and there would be no fear that they would ever
   want to leave His service. Beware of a little godliness! To say, "I
   want just as much religion as will take me into Heaven, just as much
   godliness as will save my bacon," is dishonoring to Christ and
   essentially evil. When the joy is gone out of religion, we do not
   wonder that men want to get away from it.

   Then, there are many who are led to want a change from the service of
   God by the flagging of others. They meet with many who say, "Well,
   really, you are not going to keep to that old style of things, are
   you?" Another says, "I have found something very brilliant and fresh."
   They listen to these tempting voices and they think to themselves, "One
   cannot always go against the stream." If they would really think, they
   would remember that live fish swim against the stream--it is the dead
   fish that go floating down with the tide. I like the man who says, "I
   am not going to take my religion from my companions. If they do not
   intend to go to Heaven, I am sorry for them. But as for myself, I know
   what I am doing. My heart is fixed, almighty God, fixed on You,
   believing in Your dear Son, resting in His precious blood! I am
   resolved,

   come fair or foul, to keep my face towards the Celestial City till I
   behold the King in His beauty and reign with Him forever and ever." God
   give you that fixed and firm resolution! Many cannot do anything
   contrary to their surroundings-- they must do as other people do, poor
   creatures that they are.

   There are some who turn aside because religion has brought them to a
   point where it entails some extra self-sacrifice. I have known some who
   have said, "Well, I am prepared for many things in the cause of God,
   but we must draw a line, somewhere. One may buy gold too dearly. I
   could not, for instance, give up my employment. If my employer
   commanded me to do a wrong thing, I think that I should stretch my
   conscience a little and do it. I could not lose my job." Another says,
   "Well, I could not enter a protest against such-and-such an error. If I
   did, I should have all my friends down upon me and they would call me
   bigoted and narrow-minded." And that would break your heart, would it?
   It would be a very soft heart if it would. "Oh, but really, I am not
   the man to stand out by myself!" Are you not? Remember that text, "The
   fearful"--that is, the cowardly--"and unbelieving shall have their part
   in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone." God grant that you
   may not have that for your portion! Oh, that you may follow Christ at
   all hazards! Be this your word--

   "Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes!
   'Hinder me not,' shall be my cry, Though earth and Hell oppose."

   III. I am going to finish with this point. THERE IS A GREAT CONTRAST
   BETWEEN THE SERVICE OF GOD

   AND ANY OTHER SERVICE.

   The service of God is delightful. Remember, young man, if you are about
   to engage in the service of God, there is nothing demanded of you that
   will harm you. There is no Commandment of God which, if you keep it,
   will injure either your body or your soul. There is nothing asked of
   you but what will be for your benefit--nothing that will really be to
   your loss. If it should seem to involve a present loss, yet it shall be
   turned to future gain, for God will overrule it for your permanent
   good.

   Next, notice, that there is nothing denied you in the service of God
   that would be a blessing to you. The promise is, "No good thing will He
   withhold from them that walk uprightly." You shall neither have less
   pleasure, nor less strength, nor less real honor if you obey the
   Commands of God. You may seem, sometimes, to give up what appears to be
   pleasant to you, but God denies His children nothing that would be
   really for their advantage. The service of God is, after all, such a
   service that if we lived selfishly, we might wish to live as God bids
   us live. If a man were infinitely wise and could fashion a life which,
   upon the whole, would be best for himself, he could not do better than
   to fashion it according to the Commands of God and the example of
   Christ--and you cannot say that of any of the servitudes of which I
   have spoken.

   Once more, observe, that in the service of God strength will always be
   given according to your day. When you serve the Lord, if He sends you
   out upon a tough piece of work, He will give you extra Grace. And if He
   calls you to great suffering, He will give you greater patience. He
   does not require of you more than He is prepared to give you. He will
   do for you exceeding abundantly above what you ask or even think! What
   a service is this in which we are never sent to warfare at our own
   charges? Shishak, the king of Egypt, and all the Egyptian kings built
   pyramids and dug canals. You have often wondered how they made them. In
   the reign of one of them, nearly a third of a million of people were
   forced to go and dig a canal--and they were not only never paid a
   penny, but they never had even a piece of bread given to them, nor were
   they even furnished with tools. The bulk of them had to dig out the
   canals with their own fingers and they perished by the thousands. That
   is your Shishak, king of Egypt! That is the devil's service all over!
   There is no reward given and no help whatever. You are left to do the
   best you can--and that best brings you no reward, either in this life
   or in that which is to come.

   Here, again, is a further beauty about the service of God, that there
   is no threat made to hang upon it. You are saved if you are a believer
   in Christ--that matter is done with--Christ has saved you! You do not
   go out to work for God with any idea of winning Heaven, or of escaping
   Hell by what you do. You are saved and you serve the Lord with a
   higher, purer, grander motive, namely, that of unselfish gratitude,
   loving Him because He first loved you! You serve God after a very
   different fashion from the servitude of sin. The servitude of a slave
   is bitter, but the service of a son is sweet-- and to that we are
   called!

   And all the while that you are the servant of God, you have a sweet
   peace in reflecting upon what you have done. Did you ever go out for a
   day, or for an evening, with friends, spending a merry time in gaiety,
   perhaps not altogether censurable, but still, not entirely commendable?
   When you have gone upstairs to bed, have you not thought, "Well,
   somehow, I do not feel quite happy"? When you went to pray, did you not
   feel as if you had broken your knees? And when you awoke in the night
   and thought over what seemed so very nice at the time, was it not honey
   in your mouth, but gall in your stomach? Did you ever spend a whole day
   in the service of God? When you have gone to bed at night, how have you
   felt? Very tired, perhaps, but oh, so thankful that you could look upon
   it all without regret! You could chew the cud of that service! There
   was something in the remembrance that soothed you in the night. As
   George Herbert said, when he helped a poor woman with her load--and men
   wondered that the parson of the parish should carry a poor woman's
   basket for her--"The memory of this will make the bells ring in my
   heart at night," so the service of God makes the bells ring in our
   hearts!

   Lastly, there is above all this, a hope of the eternal reward which is
   so soon to come. I spoke, the other day, on board ship with a Brother
   in Christ, and as we talked together, I said, "Well, you know, I may be
   in Heaven in a quarter of an hour. If the ship went down, I do not
   believe that it would make any difference to me." And he said, "Nor to
   me." I believe that we were the happiest men on board that steamer! How
   sweet it is to feel that you are not your own, but that you belong to
   God! If you really belong to God, He will not lose you. He has never,
   yet, lost anything that was truly His. He puts the broad arrow or the
   bleeding heart on you to show that you belong to the King! The devil,
   himself, dares not run away with you. God will call for you in that day
   when the inventory of the Divine possessions shall be read. You shall
   be known as marked by the King--and you shall be His forever and ever!
   Oh, let us try to live so that we can die in the same style as we are
   living!

   It is well to be walking in such a way that you can walk right straight
   on though a grave should be in your way-- and walk right straight
   through it--and out at the other side. Young man, are you going the way
   that you would like to keep on going forever and ever? The train is
   starting. You are taking your seat. Which way do you want to go, to the
   realm of brightness, or the land of eternal darkness? Take your seat in
   that carriage which will go right through to the better land and,
   taking your seat, feel, "Now the train may go right onto the terminus.
   For this purpose did I enter it, that I might go to the end of the
   journey." Many want to go as far as they can down the dark valley and
   then they hope that they will get out at some station or other and
   change their track. Be not so unwise, but, tonight, enter the right
   train! Lay hold on eternal life! Put your trust in Jesus and may we
   meet in Heaven without having had to know by bitter experience the
   awful difference between the service of God and the service of the
   kingdom of darkness!

   God bless you, dear Friends, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. 1 KINGS 14:21-24; 2 CHRONICLES 12.

   1 Kings 14:21. And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. After
   great mountains often come low valleys. Solomon was a wise
   man--Rehoboam was otherwise.

   21. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when be began to reign, and he
   reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did
   choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. Rehoboam
   ought to have been a good king. Jerusalem was the holy city, the chosen
   city. God put His own name there. It is a sad thing that this king
   should try to put away God's name from the chosen city.

   21. And his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. There was bad
   blood in him. How often do we find that the good king has a good
   mother's name mentioned with his own! Bad kings generally come from
   some stranger, some heathen princess. It was so with Rehoboam.

   22. And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him
   to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that
   their fathers had done. Their fathers had been great sinners, but, in
   the days of David, they had not set up false gods. In the days of
   Solomon, after the Temple had been built, they began to go astray. It
   is a curious thing that a high ritualistic service, even if it is
   right, is usually attended with a coming down in spirituality. When the
   Temple

   service was instituted, it was the beginning of a decline, but in
   Reboboam's day that decline became more apparent, the "down-grade"
   became more visible.

   23. For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
   every high hill, and under every green tree. They could not have enough
   of it. When men go wrong, they generally go wrong very greedily--they
   cannot have too much of evil.

   24. And there were also Sodomites in the land: and they did according
   to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before
   the children of Israel. When men once turn aside from the living God to
   follow inventions of their own, there is no telling where they will go.
   Nothing is too foul, nothing is too filthy for them. Now read the same
   story as you find it in

   2 Chronicles 12. Verse 1. And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had
   established the kingdom. and had strengthened himself, he forsook the
   Law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. They prospered, at first, by
   adhering to Jehovah. The good people out of the neighboring land of
   Israel emigrated to them, strengthening them, but, as soon as they grew
   strong, they forsook the Law of Jehovah.

   2. And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam,
   Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem because they had
   transgressed against the LORD. Shishak did not know that fact, nor did
   he care about Jehovah. God so ruled in Providence that when His people
   cast Him off, He soon found a rod with which to chasten them. The King
   of Egypt determined to conquer them. You do not know, my Friends, how
   God will strike you, but if you err from His statutes, He will never be
   long without a rod. You will bring chastisement on yourself if you
   depart from the living God. You will have yourself to blame if some
   dire affliction happens to you.

   3. With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and
   the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the
   Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. This vast crowd ate up
   everything! The rule was to quarter on the enemy. They would devour
   every eatable thing throughout the whole country!

   4. And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to
   Jerusalem. When God means to chasten a people, He does not take long to
   do it and neither can their weakened strength successfully oppose their
   enemy.

   5. Then came Shemaiah the Prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of
   Judah, that were gathered together at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and
   said unto them, Thus says the LORD, You have forsaken Me, and therefore
   have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. The Prophet gave them no
   invitation to repentance, but just an explanation of the sorrow which
   had come upon them.

   6. Whereupon the princes of Israel and the King humbled themselves; and
   they said, The LORD is righteous. That was well done. They had not yet
   become so confirmed in their rebellion as to reject the Prophet of God
   and to turn in willful, wanton, resolute disobedience against him.

   7. And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves. Though it was
   not in a spiritual way, yet

   7. The Word of the LORD came to Shemaiah saying, They have humbled
   themselves: therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them
   some deliverance; and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem
   by the hand of Shishak. He shall not storm the city! He shall not
   destroy it.

   8. Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know My
   service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. The Lord's
   people were to know the difference between the service of God and the
   service of the kings of the countries round about them. It would be a
   very sharp contrast and a very bitter one.

   9. So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, and took away
   the treasures of the house of the LORD. The Temple was always very
   rich. Shishak came and stripped it. Everything there that was really
   valuable was taken away.

   9. And the treasures of the king's house; he took all. He could not
   very well take any more. That is generally the way with the devil. God
   is satisfied with tithes, but Shishak and Satan take all.

   9-11. He carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
   Instead of which king Rehoboam, made shields of brass, and committed
   them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of
   the king's house. And when the king entered into the house of the LORD,
   the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard
   chamber. That was a come-down, indeed, from shield's of gold to shields
   of copper! That is, I suppose, what is meant here by the brass. This is
   what the king suffered at the hands of Shishak and it was an emblem of
   the condition of his people. The golden kingdom had became a bronze
   one.

   12. And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him,
   that He would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went
   well. Or, some behaved well. Even a measure of humiliation is
   acceptable with God. And though He did not save the nation from being
   plundered, yet He did rescue it from being altogether struck. Alas for
   Rehoboam, he did a bad day's work when he turned away from God!

   13, 14. So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
   reigned: for Rehoboam, was one and forty years old when he began to
   reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the
   LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there.
   And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And he did evil because
   he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD. He was one of that fickle
   sort, neither here nor there--a compromising gentleman--not very
   definite in anything. He would go right if he were driven that way, and
   he would go wrong if he were led in that direction. Oh, how many there
   are who never prepare their hearts to seek the Lord! They are not
   determinately bad--they have not enough backbone in them to be leaders
   in evil--but they are never good for much because they have never made
   up their minds to do the right at all costs. They have never had their
   heart prepared by the Holy Spirit to seek the Lord.

   15, 16. Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
   in the book of Shemaiah the Prophet, and of Iddo the Seer concerning
   genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
   continually. And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
   city of David: and Abijah, his son, reigned in his stead. So they pass
   away. One generation dies and another follows. God grant that when we
   fall asleep it may not be with the sin of Rehoboam lying upon us,
   neither may we be succeeded by evil sons, but may we serve God in our
   day and be followed by those who shall serve Him still better! The Lord
   grant it! Amen.

The Greatest Exhibition of the Age

   (No. 2307)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 7, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   5, 1889.

   "For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show
   the Lord's death till He comes.'" 1 Corinthians 11:26.

   FIRST, let me say that the Lord's Supper is nothing to us unless we
   partake of it as spiritual persons in a spiritual way. We must
   understand what we are doing in coming to the Communion Table. The mere
   mechanical celebration will be vanity. It may even be a sin. To observe
   this ordinance aright, you must bring your mind in an awakened state.
   You must come with holy faith, love and concentrated thought. I pray
   that we may so come, tonight. I know how mechanical we all get. We even
   stand up and sing and, oftentimes, we forget what we are singing while
   the sounds issue from our lips. We cover our eyes in prayer, but we do
   not always pray. There is such a thing as preaching from the mouth
   outward, instead of speaking from the heart. And I believe there is a
   kind of hearing which is dreadfully superficial and can do the hearer
   no good. Now, if you come to the Supper, tonight, bring your hearts
   with you! And if your hearts are warm with love to Christ, desire to
   have them yet more full of love to your Lord.

   I remember reading of a Mr. Welch, a very devout minister of the Gospel
   in Suffolk, who was found weeping one day. And when he was asked by a
   brother minister why he wept, he said it was because he should love
   Christ more than he did. That was a very good reason for weeping. Now,
   let us love our Lord much, tonight, and if we cannot feel the glow of
   love as we wish to feel it, let us weep to think that it is so. May the
   Spirit of God come and put life into our Communion, that every child of
   God, here, may have real fellowship with Christ in the breaking of
   bread!

   But now, let us get to our work. The Lord's Supper, dear Friends, is,
   first of all, a memorial. "This do in remembrance of Me." It is
   intended to keep alive in our own hearts and in the minds of others,
   the wondrous fact that the Son of God was here among men and laid down
   His life a Sacrifice for sin. It is well known that a custom, a rite, a
   festival, has a very great historical power to keep up in the minds of
   men the recollection of a fact--and our Lord has selected this common
   meal, this Supper, as a method by which men should be made to know to
   the very end of time that He died. There can be no doubt about the
   death of Christ because through long ages all history bears record that
   Christian men and women have met together--and have eaten bread and
   have drunk wine--to keep up the memory of His sufferings and death.
   This is better than if there had been a statue erected, or than if a
   document had been written, or than if a brass tablet had been
   inscribed. We are not without memorials of other sorts, especially are
   we not without books, but this perpetually celebrated feast--kept up
   without cessation, kept up in every country on the face of the
   earth--is one of the very best memorials that the death of Christ can
   have. All of you who come to the Table, tonight, will be helping to
   keep alive, in the memory of men, the great fact that Jesus died.

   But the Lord's Supper is more than a memorial, it is a fellowship, a
   communion. Those who eat of this bread, spiritually understanding what
   they do--those who drink of this cup, entering into the real meaning of
   that reception of the wine--do, therein, receive Christ spiritually
   into their hearts. Their heart, soul, mind feeds upon Christ, Himself,
   and upon what Christ has done. We do not merely record the fact, but we
   enjoy the result of it. We do not merely say that Christ died, but we
   desire to die with Him and to live only as the result of His having
   died! We take scot and lot with Christ as we come to the table. We say
   deliberately, "Yours are we, You Son of God, and all that we have. And
   You are ours and, in testimony thereof, we eat this bread and we drink
   of this cup to show that we are one with Yourself, partners with You in
   this great fellowship of love."

   Well, now, if you need a permanent memorial and a perpetual means of
   fellowship, it will be wise to have a rite or ceremony in which there
   shall also be a likeness to the fact that has to be remembered! This
   supper is, therefore, an exhibition, a showing, a setting forth, a
   proclamation of the death of Christ. That you may remember that Jesus
   died, there is something here that bears a resemblance to His death.
   That you may the better have fellowship with Him in His death, here is
   something which is a vivid picture of that death and which will help to
   bring it more clearly before your mind's eyes. That is the subject for
   tonight's meditation--this Supper as a showing forth, an exhibition of
   Christ's death, "till He comes."

   In speaking of this exhibition, this showing forth, we will consider,
   first, what it shows. Secondly, how it shows it. And thirdly, how long
   it is to show it.

   I. Thinking of this Supper that we are about to celebrate, we will
   consider, first, WHAT IT SHOWS. "As often as you eat this bread, and
   drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death."

   Brothers and Sisters, tonight we are to show, to exhibit, to
   demonstrate, to set forth, to symbolize, to represent, to picture the
   death of Christ! He lived, or He could not have died. That fact is,
   therefore, included in our confession of faith. But the point we
   especially set forth is this, that He died, He who was born at
   Bethlehem, the Son of Mary, and who lived here on earth, being also the
   Son of God, in due time, died! He gave His life a ransom for many. Why
   do we record that fact? To my intense grief, I have heard it said, even
   among a certain class of preachers, that we dwell too much upon the
   death of Christ. They ask why we do not talk more about His life. The
   death of a man, they say, is not so important, by a great many degrees,
   as his life. The Lord have mercy upon the miserable and ignorant men
   who talk in that fashion! But we have a reason for making so much of
   Christ's death--the Lord has instituted no memorial of His life--the
   memorial that He has instituted is to keep before His people the
   perpetual remembrance of His death. And why is that the case?

   I take it because this is the very heart of the Gospel of Jesus Christ!
   The doctrine that He died, "the Just for the unjust, that He might
   bring us to God," is essential to the Gospel. Leave out the vicarious
   Sacrifice unto death, and you have left out the life of the Gospel of
   Jesus Christ! There are some Truths of God which ought to be preached
   in due proportion with other Truths, but if they are not preached,
   souls may be saved. But this is a Truth of God which must be preached
   and if it is left out, souls will not be saved! I should have more hope
   of the salvation of a man hearing a Romish priest, with all his
   superstition, if he preached the death of Christ, than I should of one
   hearing a Unitarian, with all his intelligence, if he left out the
   doctrine of the atoning blood of the Lord Jesus Christ! "The blood is
   the life thereof." "Without shedding of blood is no remission." Because
   the death of Christ is the life of the Gospel, therefore it is that
   there is an ordinance to set forth that death "till He comes."

   And this is the more so, in the next place, because this is the point
   where the Gospel is always being assailed. You shall find, in almost
   every controversy, that the fight thickens about the Cross. It is
   around the standard that the foemen cluster. There the sword rings upon
   the armor! There the loudest shout is heard! There you see the garment
   rolled in blood! So the Cross, the Cross is the standard of our
   Christianity! Round the Atoning Sacrifice the controversialists gather.
   They think they are aiming at other things, but the real password is,
   "Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the Divine
   Substitute for men." If they could once get rid of the Doctrine of the
   Atoning Sacrifice, they would destroy that which is the greatest tower
   of strength to the Gospel of Christ! But, thank God, they cannot get
   rid of the Cross! We can still sing--

   "The Cross it stands fast, Hallelujah! Defying every blast, Hallelujah!
   The winds of Hell have blown, The world its hate has shown, Yet it is
   not overthrown. Hallelujah for the Cross! It shall never suffer loss!

   Therefore, set forth the Atoning Sacrifice of Christ, Brothers and
   Sisters, in this ordinance, "till He comes."

   So well does this Supper set forth the death of Christ in that respect,
   that it has been argued by some Brethren that, if a man comes to the
   Communion Table, unless he is a great liar, he has already made a
   confession of faith in Christ. I will not go that length, but there is
   a good deal of truth in the argument. If you truly eat and drink of
   this Supper, you must

   believe in the Atoning Sacrifice--you come here under false pretences
   if you are not a believer in that, for, at the institution of this
   Supper, the Savior said, "This is My blood of the New Testament (or
   Covenant) which is shed for many for the remission of sins." The pardon
   of sin must be by the shedding of the blood of Christ--and if you
   reject the blood of Christ, you have rejected the true meaning of this
   Supper--and, certainly, you cannot come here with a clear conscience.
   This Supper, then, sets forth the great fact that Jesus died, and it is
   ordained to set that death forth because it is essential to the Gospel,
   and because it is the point which is most fiercely attacked.

   And you will notice, Brothers and Sisters, according to our text, that
   this showing of the death of Christ is to be kept up through every age
   "till He comes." It will not be needed after the Coming of Christ for
   reasons which we will speak of, by-and-by, but until then it will
   always be needed. Shall I always have to preach the Doctrine of
   Atonement? Yes, always. Shall we always have to set Christ forth
   evidently crucified among men? Yes, always. First, because we always
   need to have this Truth of God set forth. You and I, who are firm
   believers in this glorious Truth of God, yet cannot too often think
   upon it. I love to come every Lord's-Day to the Communion Table--I
   should be very sorry to come only once a month, or, as some do, only
   once a year. I could not afford to come as seldom as that. I need to be
   reminded, forcibly reminded, of my dear Lord and Master very often. We
   do so soon forget and our unloving hearts so soon grow cold. How is it
   with you, my Brothers and Sisters? I know that it is thus with me. I
   sing, sometimes--

   "Gethsemane, can I forget?

   Or there Your conflict see,

   Your agony and bloody sweat,

   And not remember Thee!'

   But that is the point of my argument. We need to go often to Gethsemane
   and there see our Lord's agony and bloody sweat, that we may remember
   Him. I suppose that, until we see His face, we shall never have one
   Communion too many, and we shall never have a thought of Christ that is
   superfluous. No, banish all poetic thought rather than that I should
   lose a thought of Him! Be gone the most delightful classical expression
   and the most charming thoughts of philosophers, if they would push out
   one thought of Jesus, for thoughts of Christ are golden thoughts--and
   thoughts of other things, however burnished by the wit and genius of
   men--are but poor metal compared with thoughts of Jesus! We need this
   Supper for ourselves, Brethren, and we should partake of it often, for
   that is what is meant by our Lord's words, "As oft as you drink it." We
   need that often we should eat this broad and drink this cup--and show
   His death for our own sins.

   But this Supper is as much needed for the sake of others. We are to
   show Christ's death that others may know about it, that others may be
   impressed by it, that others may be saved by it! I sometimes wonder,
   when I am talking to you upon this theme, that I do not preach much
   better. And yet, when I have done, I say to myself, "Well, how can
   there be anything better if one only tells the tale truly?" That God
   came here in human flesh and for our sins did serve, did die. That He
   bore the vengeance due to our guilt, the punishment which our
   transgressions had incurred. Brethren, that is poetry! It is essential
   poetry, even though I only put it into a child's speech. It needs no
   garnishing. The face of perfect beauty must not be touched with
   Jezebel's paints! And all the garnishing of eloquence that can be
   brought to such a fact as this is unnecessary, meretricious, and
   degrading. Oh, hear you the tale, and then, as you come to the Table,
   remember what it is that you set forth, and say to yourself, "I am, by
   this action, telling a story more wonderful than all the histories of
   men put together. I am showing to those who look on something which
   angels desire to look into, which the most wonderful intelligences
   will, throughout all the ages, study with ever-growing wonder and
   delight--God Incarnate, suffering in the sinner's place!"

   Show that forth, Brothers and Sisters, for it is worth the showing!

   II. But now, secondly, having mentioned what it is that this Supper
   shows, let me prove to you HOW IT SHOWS IT.

   It does so, first, very instructively in the emblems themselves. We
   need to tell men and to tell our own hearts that Jesus died. Well,
   look, here is bread! Mark you, not a wafer, but a piece of household
   bread. And here is wine in a cup. Not wine and water, but the true
   juice of the grape, which our Lord called, "the fruit of the vine."
   What then? Here are bread and the fruit of the vine, separately. Bread,
   representing the flesh of Christ, has a million sermons in it. Shall I
   tell you its story? It was a grain of wheat. They threw it into the
   ground, they buried it beneath the clods, it lay there exposed to
   winter's cold. It sprang up and many a frost nipped it in the green
   blade. But then came spring weather and summer tide, and the wheat grew
   and grew on till it turned into the yellow golden grain. Look, they
   come along with a sharp sickle and cut it down! It must feel the keen
   edge. After cutting it down, they take it away in sheaves. They spread
   it out upon

   the barn floor. Here are flails which come hammering down upon it--in
   those olden times they used flails. Now they beat out the grain from
   the ear and now, when they have all the grain separated from the straw,
   it must be winnowed and the chaff must be blown away.

   Then they take this wheat and put it between two stones and grind it.
   Woe unto you, O Grain, you are ground into the finest flour! But it has
   not finished its history of suffering yet. When well ground and
   separated from the bran, it is taken and a woman kneads it with all her
   might, and makes it into dough. Nor is its suffering ended, yet, for
   she thrusts it into the oven! Now does it feel the heat of the fire and
   when the loaf is taken out of the oven, it is cut, or broken, and
   devoured. It is a story of suffering from the beginning to the end!

   Now take that cup and look into its ruddy depths. Do you see that vine
   yonder? You expected to find it festooned on trelliswork, a lovely
   object--but looking at it in the winter and spring, you say to
   yourself, "Is that a vine? It looks like an old, dead stick left in the
   ground." Yes, it has been cut down. Did you not see the pruner's knife?
   How sharply he cut! "Surely," you said, "he is killing that vine." No,
   vines are made to bear much fruit by being closely cut and pruned. But
   now it is summer and in the early months of autumn the vine is loaded
   with red grapes--and those grapes must be taken off the vine and
   severed from the branch. Look, they are throwing them into the
   winepress, heaps upon heaps! Look how they are piled up! And what
   happens now? Men leap in upon them and with their feet they tread the
   grapes. The blood of the grape runs out of the winepress, red like
   ruddy gore! This is the history of the wine of which you drink and so
   it comes to you. And, oh, I need not tell you of your Lord, how He was
   thrown into the winepress, and how He suffered even unto death! These
   elements of bread and wine are stories to you and emblems of suffering!

   You notice, too, that these emblems are separate. If I were to take the
   bread and crumble it into the cup, and then pass it to you that you
   might drink of that curious mixture, you would not celebrate the Lord's
   death at all! It would not be possible, for it is the body with the
   blood separated from it that sets forth death! While the blood is in
   the veins, you have life, but when the blood is drawn away from the
   body, which is set forth to you in the pure white bread and in the red
   juice of the grape, then you have the picture of death--and in that way
   you show Christ's sufferings and death in the celebration of this
   Supper.

   So much I have, I hope, made plain enough for all to understand.

   Now notice the manner of the use of these two elements, for the manner
   of their use vividly shows Christ's death. I think it is in the Church
   Catechism that we are taught that the word, "sacrament," means "an
   outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual Grace." That
   definition will do for this ordinance, which is the outward and visible
   sign of an inward and spiritual Grace.

   It is very remarkable how the emblems before us appeal to our various
   senses. Notice, first, the Savior took the bread and the cup. You see
   them--they are before you, you can see them. After He had blessed them,
   He said, "Take." Did you ever see, in a very Ritualistic church, that
   little game played by the priest with his napkin held out under the
   chin of the communicant and, telling him to open his mouth and popping
   the wafer in? This is not eating the Lord's Supper, for the command at
   the institution of the Lord's Supper was, "Take, eat." It is essential
   that you take it in your hand. "Take, eat." So there is another sense
   that is affected in this sacred exercise, that is, the sense of touch.
   Jesus took the bread and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, that
   they might employ the second sense. They had seen, now they touched.
   "Take, eat," said the Lord, and they held it in their hands.

   Never do you have the Lord's Supper without an appeal to the ears, for
   He said, "This is My body." Whenever we break this bread, we say the
   same, "This bread is Christ's body," so there is an appeal to the ears.
   You put the bread and the wine into your mouth--there comes in your
   fourth sense, your taste, so that four senses are made to assist you in
   realizing that Christ did really die, that His death is no dream, no
   fiction! It is not merely a man in a book, but a living Man who died, a
   real Man who poured out His life unto death for you! I have said that
   four senses are appealed to, but I might add the sense of smell, also.
   There is an old proverb, "Nothing smells so sweet as bread," and to a
   hungry man there is nothing so refreshing as the presence of bread
   which regales the nostril. The Lord has given us an ordinance, here, in
   which He brings our body to support our soul and to render vivid to our
   mind by at least four, if not all of our five senses, this most blessed
   fact, that Jesus Christ, the Son of Mary and the Son of God, did really
   lay down His life a Sacrifice for us!

   But now I remind you of another thing. We show the death of Christ, in
   the next place, by the mode of the disposal of this bread and this
   wine, for these elements go into our bodies. They are received into the
   inner man and are digested and assimilated there, and taken up into our
   system to build us up. And herein we teach that Christ, dying for us,
   is to be received by faith into the heart. We are to believe in that
   death as being for us. We are to appropriate it as our own. We are to
   trust in it. We are to live upon it. It is to become part and parcel of
   our spiritual nature and we are to be built up, thereby, for Christ's
   death on the Cross saves nobody to whom Christ does not come into the
   heart. If you do not believe, even Christ lifted up between earth and
   Heaven will not save you. "As many as received Him, to them gave He
   power to become the sons of God." But without receiving Him, Christ is
   dead in vain so far as you are concerned. You have no part nor lot in
   this matter. This fact, I say, we set forth by the method of the
   disposal of the emblems.

   And now, carefully note that the spirit of this ordinance is also very
   instructive. How does it begin? Jesus takes bread and blesses it. In
   other words, He gives thanks. It is very usual to call this ordinance
   the Eucharist, or, the giving of thanks. That is the spirit of it--it
   is all through a giving of thanks. Now, mark you, there is no reason to
   give thanks for the death of Christ unless it was an Atoning death and
   an expiation for sin. I should regret, infinitely regret, that a good
   man should die as Jesus died unless there was an end to be accomplished
   by it worthy of that death. The end of Christ's death was that, dying
   for us, by the shedding of His blood, there might be remission of
   sins--and for that we may well give thanks! The Communion begins with
   thanksgiving, but how does it continue? It continues by our sitting at
   ease. There are some who think that to kneel at the Communion is the
   most reverent posture. So it is, and I doubt not that God accepts their
   reverence--but it is a most unscriptural posture! There is more
   presumption than reverence in it, for to alter the ordinance of Christ,
   even on the pretense of reverence, is not justifiable! When our Lord
   first of all instituted the Supper, they did not sit down as we do, but
   they reclined as the Orientals still do, at their ease, so much at
   their ease that the head of John was on the breast of Jesus.

   I cannot conceive anything more exactly the opposite of coming up to an
   altar rail and kneeling down, than this reclining upon couches with
   your head upon your next neighbor's bosom! The fact is that it meant
   ease, it meant rest--and that is what the posture which we take up
   should mean. Our nearest approach to that which can be tolerated in our
   western clime is to sit as much as you can at ease, as a person in this
   country does at a banquet, as near an approach as possible to the
   method of the Oriental at his banquet. That is how the feast goes
   on--it began with a blessing, it proceeds with a restful posture. How
   does it end? After Supper they sang a hymn. It was not a dirge, it was
   not funeral--they celebrated the death of Christ, but not with funeral
   rites. They sang a hymn! It was joyous, probably part of the great
   Hallel of the Jewish Passover. This indicates to us and we set it
   forth, that the death of Christ is now a joyous event--that to the
   whole of His people it is not a thing to sigh over, but that, believing
   in Christ--it is a thing to thank God for, to be at ease about and to
   sing over! And we set that forth by the manner in which we partake of
   this Supper.

   One thing more we set forth. The persons who come to the Table must be,
   according to Christ's rule, believers in Him. They, and they only, have
   a right to eat of this feast. Others eat and drink unworthily and drink
   and eat condemnation to themselves. We do, therefore, say, albeit that
   there is no limit to the value of the Sacrifice of Christ (that were
   inconceivable), yet He had a special objective in it and He died for a
   special people, which people are known by their being led to believe in
   Him, to unite with Him in a distinct affiance by trusting in Him. Not
   for you all will this avail, but for all of you that believe, for so it
   is written, "For God so loved the world," so much and no more, "that He
   gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life"--a universality which, nevertheless,
   has a specialty hidden in its inner self.

   Believe this, or else this death is not for you. Trust Christ, or else
   you shall have no share in the blessings which His death has purchased.
   And we set that forth when, gathering at the Table, we come as
   Believers, but we are obliged to tell others that if they are not
   Believers, they must not come--they have no right to come.

   III. My time has nearly gone, and therefore I must finish with the
   third point. We have seen what this Supper shows, and how it shows it.
   Now we are to consider HOW LONG IT IS TO SHOW IT.

   I have tried, as best I could, in a very simple way, to show how this
   Supper symbolizes and sets forth the death of Christ. How long are we
   to do it? "Till He comes." Well, now, what does that teach us? When
   Jesus comes, we are to leave off observing the Lord's Supper, but not
   till He comes.

   It teaches us, then, that there will always be a value in Christ's
   wondrous death. God would not have us set forth a thing that is done
   with, a sucked orange, a mere shell out of which the seed is gone. If
   the death of Christ were not abundantly efficacious, still, He would
   not have us set it forth. But tonight we can sing, with as much meaning
   and force as ever we could--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its power, Till
   all the ransomed Church of God Be sa ved to sin no more."

   It is nearly 1,900 years since Jesus was here and yet His blood is
   still powerful, His death can still take away sin! Come and try it,
   tonight, some of you who have never believed in Him! Tonight, I say, at
   the close of this--

   "Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,

   The bridal of the earth and sky." Come now, tonight, and yield yourself
   to the Lamb of God, and wash in His precious blood, and you shall be
   whiter than snow! The Communion Table is just now covered with a white
   cloth, but when it is uncovered, and you see the bread and the wine,
   they will say to you, "The Atonement is still existing, it is still
   efficacious, it is still full of power." We celebrate the ordinance
   because Christ's death is still available for all who trust to it.

   The next thing is, dear Friends, that by saying that we will partake of
   this Supper till Christ comes, we set forth our belief in the
   perpetuity of this ordinance until the influence of Christ's death
   shall have been infallibly secured. We are now in a world where men
   forget and, as long as we are in such a world, we must keep this
   signpost, this direction to those who want to journey to Heaven! We
   must never take this signpost down till there will be no need of it
   because Christ will have come--and when He shall have come, Beloved, we
   shall not, even then, forget His death! When He shall come, do not
   think that we shall give up the Lord's Supper because we give up
   thinking of Him. No, we shall give it up because we shall, then, never
   give up thinking of Him! He will be present with us and He, being
   present with us, we shall not need the help which now our weakness
   requires!

   So then, in closing, I say to you that this Supper is a window, a
   window of agate, and the outlook of this Supper is the Second Coming of
   the lord from Heaven. This Supper is also a gate of carbuncle and
   through this gate we are to watch for the return of the Lord Jesus
   Christ from the Throne of His Glory to this earth. The Lord shall come.
   As surely as we are sitting here in this house, so surely will He,
   before long, appear a second time on earth, "without sin, unto
   salvation!" And we mean to keep up this feast "till He comes."--

   "See, the feast of love is spread.

   Drink the wine, and break the bread--

   Sweet memorials, till the Lord

   Calls us round His hea venly board.

   Some from earth, from Glory some,

   Severed only 'Till He come!'"

   Could you keep on feasting "till He comes," my unsaved Hearer? I think
   that you had better weep and mourn, repent and believe, and so get
   ready for His appearance! But those who are ready may just keep on
   feasting upon Him and rejoicing in Him, till He puts in His last and
   glorious appearance! God help us to continue so, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. JOHN161-20.

   This chapter contains some of the most precious Words that the Lord
   Jesus uttered before He died upon the Cross.

   Verse 1. These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be
   offended. Or, as the Revised Version translates it, "be made to
   stumble." Christ would not have His children stumble. There is an
   offense of the Cross, but He would not have us needlessly offended. How
   careful is our dear Savior not to give us offense! We ought to be very
   careful not to offend Him, but what condescension it is on His part
   that He should be careful of offending us, or of permitting us to be
   offended, or made to stumble!

   2. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes that
   whoever kills you will think that he dose God service. Can you remain
   faithful to your Master, then, when you lose your position, or your
   character, or men put you out of the synagogue? When you nearly lose
   life, itself, and when they shall think they are doing God's service by
   seeking to kill you, can you stand true to Christ, then? The Master
   knew that days of bitter persecution would soon come upon His
   followers, so He strengthened them against those evil times that were
   approaching.

   3. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known
   the Father, nor Me. It is ignorance that makes men hate God's people
   and His Son--"They have not known the Father, nor Me." Truly did Paul
   say, "I did it igno-rantly in unbelief," and for such persecutors there
   is full and free forgiveness. When they turn unto the Lord, even this
   sin shall be forgiven them. But they will not forgive themselves for
   having committed it and, like Paul, they will count themselves the
   chief of sinners because they persecuted the Church of God.

   4. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you
   may remember that I told you of them. "You will then see My foresight,
   My care for you, My prophetic power. To be forewarned is to be
   forearmed. You will not be taken by surprise." If any of you who have
   lately been converted should meet with great opposition, do not be
   surprised--Jesus has told you to expect it--and if the fire should get
   seven times hotter, count it no strange thing that the fiery trial has
   happened to you. It has happened unto others before you and will happen
   to others after you! Therefore be prepared for it.

   4. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was
   with you. "While I was with you, you could run to Me and tell Me all
   about your trials and difficulties. If anybody was hard with you, I
   could come to your help and comfort you. You did not need to know these
   things, before, so I did not tell you of them. You need to know them,
   now, and now I tell you of them."

   5. But now I go My way to Him that sent Me. Christ was going to the
   Cross and to the grave, and afterwards to Heaven.

   5. And none of you asked Me, Where go you? For lack of asking that
   question, Christ's disciples were full of grief. Sometimes we do not
   ask enough questions. We ask too many questions of doubt--it would be
   well if we were to ask a few more questions of believing curiosity!
   There are some things that we ought to wish to know and Christ
   encourages His people to come to Him for information.

   6. But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled
   your heart. When a poor Christian friend is dying, you are full of
   sorrow because he is going away from you. Why do you not ask where he
   is going? If he is going Home to Heaven and to Glory, why, then, be
   comforted about him! You have no cause for distress on his account.

   7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go
   away. "It is better for yon that I should be absent than that I should
   be present." Their Lord was their joy, their Leader, their Teacher,
   their Comforter. He is going away and He tells them that His absence
   will be a gain to them! "It is expedient for you that I go away."

   7. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I
   depart, I will send Him unto you. Now, it is better for us to have the
   Comforter than to have Christ here in bodily Presence, for if Christ
   were here, tonight, in this Tabernacle, where could we put Him so as to
   be equally near, each one of us? I should certainly want Him up here on
   the platform! And you, up there in the top gallery, would say, "Well,
   we are a long way off--why should He not come up here?" You see, if it
   is bodily Presence that is enjoyed, some must be near, and some must be
   far off. But now that Christ has gone up to Heaven, His Spirit is here.
   Where is that Spirit? On the platform, I hope, and everywhere else! Any
   of you who desire Him, may have the Holy Spirit's Presence. The Lord
   says," I will put My Spirit within you." Better than the bodily
   Presence of Christ is the real, though spiritual, Presence of the Holy
   Spirit.

   8. And when He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of
   righteousness, and ofjudgement. What? A Comforter reprove? Yes. The
   Holy Spirit never comforts till He has reproved. There must be a
   reproof of sin before there can be comfort in Christ! And while the
   Spirit comforts saints, He reproves the world.

   9. Of sin, because they believe not on Me. The greatest sin in all the
   world is not believing on Jesus. Our Lord did not say, "Of sin, because
   of the evil of drunkenness." That is a great sin, a cursed sin and
   there are other great sins, but Christ said, "Of sin, because they
   believe not on Me." That is the root sin, the foundation sin--the sin
   that keeps a man in his sin.

   10. Of righteousness, because I go to My Father, and you see Me no
   more. It is God's Righteousness that takes Christ up to Heaven. He has
   been here. He has lived a perfect life. He has died a Sacrificial death
   and God has shown His acceptance of Him, for He has gone to His reward.

   11. Of judgment, because the Prince of this world is judged. When
   Christ came here, there was a crisis, a judgement. And sin was judged
   and condemned and the Prince of the world, the chief sinner in the
   world, received his deathblow-- "the Prince of this world is judged."

   12. I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them,
   now. See how Christ teaches us slowly, wisely, prudently? There are
   some things which some of you young Christians do not know--you could
   not bear them if you did know them. You shall know them when you can
   bear them. A man with a doctrine that he cannot handle is often like a
   child with a tough piece of meat which he cannot bite. Give the child
   milk, or the crumb of the loaf! Do not put crusts into his mouth till
   he has teeth to bite them. Do not give him meat till he can digest it.
   See the gentle Savior's way of imparting instruction? He teaches us
   much, but not too much at a time.

   13. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of Truth is come, He will guide yon
   into all Truth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatever He
   shall hear, that shall He speak: and He will show you things to come.
   See, my dear Brothers in the ministry, how little store the Holy Spirit
   sets by originality? We have men, nowadays, straining to be original!
   Strain the other way, for listen, "He shall not speak of Himself--not
   even the Holy Spirit--"He shall not speak of Himself; but whatever He
   shall hear, that shall He speak." He is the Repeater of the Father's
   message, not the inventor of His own! So let it be with us ministers.
   We are not to make up a Gospel as we go along, as I have heard some
   say. We are not to shape it to the times in which we live, and suit it
   to the congregations to which we speak. God forbid! Let this be true of
   every one of us, "He shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall
   hear, that shall he speak"

   14. He shall glorify Me. The Holy Spirit does that. Therefore, surely
   we, who are the preachers of the Gospel, should aim at the same
   objective--"He shall glorify Me." It should be our one desire to
   magnify and glorify our Lord Jesus

   Christ!

   14-16. For He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you. All
   things that the Father has are Mine: therefore said I, that He shall
   take of Mine, and shall show it unto you. A little while, and you shall
   not see Me; and again, a little while, and you shall see Me, because I
   go to the Father. That was a very simple statement! Every Sunday
   scholar understands it, now, but the 12 Apostles did not understand it
   when they heard it.

   17, 18. Then said some of His disciples among themselves, What is this
   that He says unto us, A little while, and you shall not see Me: and
   again, a little while, and you shall see Me: and, Because I go to the
   Father? They said therefore, What is this that He says, A little while?
   we cannot tell what He says. They said this "among themselves." This
   was not a wise course, for what can ignorance learn from ignorance?
   Here were disciples questioning one another--none of them knew
   anything--and yet they were trying to teach one another. If they had
   all gone to their Master, how much more quickly would they have
   understood His words! Take everything to Jesus! Try everything by the
   Word of God. Do not believe what you hear because I say it, or because
   somebody else says it. Go to the Word of God to learn what you need to
   know, and to the Spirit of God to teach you the meaning of what you
   read!

   19, 20. Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask Him, and said
   unto them, Do you enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little
   while, and you shall not see Me: and again, a little while, and you
   shall see Me? Verily, verily, I say unto you, That you shall weep and
   lament. Christ would die. He would go away and be unseen. On the Cross
   He would depart out of this life. In the tomb He would be hidden from
   His disciples--"You shall weep and lament."

   20. But the world shall rejoice. But not for long--the world's joy at
   Christ's death was soon over.

   20. And you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into
   joy. I think we may leave off our reading at this verse, with these
   words to flavor our mouth all this week--"Your sorrow shall be turned
   into joy." God grant that it may be so with many here present, for
   Christ's sake! Amen.

Ten Wrong Kinds of Hearers

   (No. 2308)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 14, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   21, 1889.

   "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show My
   people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they
   seek Me daily and delight to know My ways, as a nation that did
   righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of
   Me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God."
   Isaiah 58:1,2.

   IF we would understand these words aright, we must remember that the
   people here mentioned were not good people--they were a set of
   hypocrites. This is quite clear if we read the verses that follow our
   text--"Why have we fasted, they say, and You see not? Why have we
   afflicted our souls and You take no notice? Behold, in the day of your
   fast you find pleasure, and exploit all your laborers. Behold, you fast
   for strife and debate, and to strike with the fist of wickedness. You
   shall not fast as you do this day, to make your voice to be heard on
   high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict
   his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread
   sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and an
   acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To
   loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let
   the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke? Is it not to
   share your bread with the hungry, and that you bring the poor that are
   cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and
   that you hide not yourself from your own flesh? Then shall your light
   break forth as the morning, and your health shall spring forth
   speedily: and your righteousness shall go before you; the Glory of the
   Lord shall be your rear guard."

   It is a very pleasing sign when people like to go up to the House of
   God. I do not know of a more beautiful sight than the present
   congregation, with every seat occupied, and some people even willing to
   stand to hear the Word preached! There are many who would give all they
   have to see such a sight! How sad is the opposite of this! An empty
   place of worship--people loafing about at home all the Sabbath, not
   caring to listen to the eternal Truth of God--that is a very melancholy
   state of things. We take delight in seeing persons anxious to get in to
   hear the Word.

   I know that there are some here who would not be absent from the
   assembly of God's people on any account. When they are ill, their
   Sabbaths are always dull to them. And if they go into the country, they
   seem to miss the opportunity of hearing the Gospel as they have been
   accustomed to hear it. All this is most pleasant and most delightful,
   yet remember that there may be nothing at all in it! This congregation
   will soon scatter and break up--and when it is divided into its
   separate particles and nothing is left of it--it may come to pass that
   nothing will be left of it in another sense, that is, that there will
   be no result whatever from our meeting together. As I said in the
   prayer, it may be just one big wave breaking on the shore, dying away
   and leaving nothing behind. I pray God that it may not be so.

   Yet, my dear Friends, you who are the most regular hearers of the Word
   and who have been so from your childhood, you need to be warned that
   the mere hearing of the Gospel will not save you! Yes, and the
   continuous hearing of it may increase your responsibility and do
   nothing more! If you are hearers, only, it may come to pass that, at
   the last, you will have heard for the worse, not for the better, for
   the only record that will remain of all those Sundays and of all those
   sermons, will be that you have just so many times willfully hardened
   your neck and continued in rebellion against the tender mercy of God!

   What I am going to do, tonight, is not so much to preach Christ, though
   I trust I shall not fail to do that, as to deal with different classes
   of hearers and to show the difference that there is between those who
   hear without acceptance and without profit, and those who hear so as to
   please God--those whose hearing becomes a part of worship, those who
   hear

   desiring benefit for themselves, and whose hearing becomes a saving
   act--for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the

   Word of God!

   While I try to draw a few distinctions, not occupying too much of your
   time upon any one of them, I invite every person here to examine
   himself, whether he is in the faith. I invite every hearer to put
   himself into the crucible to see what is his true condition in the
   sight of God. Never mind your neighbor--let him use his own ears for
   himself--you use your ears for yourself just now. Better still, let
   each one of us go to the Lord with the Psalmist's prayer, "Search me, O
   God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there
   is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."

   I. First, THERE ARE SOME WHO GET NO GOOD OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE
   GOSPEL BECAUSE THEIR HEARING IS SOON FOLLOWED BY FORGETTING. It is true
   that they hear and, for a time, they hear it with considerable
   attention. But it is only for a time. They regard the exercise of
   hearing as being confined to the time which the sermon occupies and,
   with some, the shorter that time is, the better they like the
   discourse! When the sermon is over, it is done with as far as they are
   concerned. They may happen to remember that they were at such a place,
   on such a day, and heard a sermon from such a text--but that is all
   that they remember. They are glad that the preacher's words should drop
   as the dew, and distil as the rain--but they like it to be like the
   rain when it trickles off the leaf of the plant and leaves no mark--or
   like the dew which is exhaled before ever the sun is up. They do not
   want to have any abiding result from the hearing of the Word. It is a
   temporary thing with them. I was going to say it is a trumpery thing
   with them. They hear the preacher's message, the service is over and,
   at the door of the sanctuary they leave behind everything that they
   have gathered there--in fact, they have really gathered nothing.

   Now, it is not so with the profitable hearer. He says to himself, "That
   which I am about to hear, today, is God's Word. My Soul, take heed that
   you retain it and lay it by in store! You are listening to a Gospel
   which is the wonder of the ages. You are hearing of mysteries which
   angels desire to look into. You are hearing the story of God sending
   His own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem men
   from going down into the Pit. Now, my Soul, hear for eternity!" Ask
   that the impression made upon you shall last in life, in death and be
   seen at the Day of Judgment to be a saving, enduring, sanctifying
   impression upon you. Oh, that men felt that to come to hear the Gospel
   is not like going to the market to hear goods cried, or going to an
   auction to hear an estate set forth and extolled, or attending a
   lecture to listen to what was done in the rocks in the ages past, or
   what is going on in the stars that glitter in the heavens! These are
   all things that will pass away!

   We are come together to hear about God, Heaven, Hell, the soul,
   eternity, immortality, the Judgment, the eternal rewards--everlasting
   life and the everlasting doom--eternal death! Here is something worth
   the hearing. I sometimes think that I have no need to fret myself about
   how I put these things before my hearers, for if men were in their
   senses, they would naturally want to know the truth about their souls
   and, knowing that, in whatever language it was put, they would be quite
   content. If there were a lecture, tomorrow evening, upon how to make
   500 pounds a day--if a man could tell you how to do that and yet he
   spoke in broken English, you would be quite satisfied so long as you
   could put in practice what he was teaching you!

   And when we are teaching men the way to Heaven, the way to peace with
   God, the way to got sin pardoned and the heart renewed, it ought not to
   matter how we deliver the message--the news, itself, ought to be so
   precious that men would be glad to hear it even though we stuttered and
   stammered it out! Alas, it is not so. But it would be so if all men
   were the right kind of hearers! Wrong hearers belong to the Slate
   Club--they write on a slate what they hear and then wipe it all off.
   But the Christian hearer has the Gospel message "engraved as in eternal
   brass" and it abides with him world without end.

   II. Next, THERE ARE SOME WHOSE HEARING IS THE HEARING OF MAN--NOT THE
   LISTENING TO

   THE VOICE OF GOD. Dear Friends, if you go into some places of worship
   where the preacher does not believe that the Word of God is Inspired,
   you may listen to him or not as you like. He has no claim on your
   attention if what he preaches has not, "Thus says the Lord," at the
   back of it. You have as much right to require him to listen to you as
   he has to expect you to listen to him! He has to tell you and he will
   tell you his latest thoughts, his freshest inventions, his most novel
   excogitations. Well, you may throw them over the wall and have done
   with them, if you like. If he is a learned and clever

   man, you may attach to what he says the importance which you ought to
   attach to the words of a clever man, but you are not required to pay
   any more attention than that to anything that he has to say!

   But if we plead with you that what we read to you is God's Word, every
   syllable of it, and that what we preach, if it is not taken from God's
   Word is nothing, that its only weight and force lie in this, that we
   deliver the Inspired Truth of God, putting it into our own language,
   but still giving you the Truth as far as we know it, as a Revelation
   from God, then at your own peril will you refuse it! These gentlemen
   who, themselves, deny the Inspiration of the Book of God, thereby
   renounce all claim upon your attention except such as you like to give
   to your fellow men. But if a man can say, "Thus says the Lord," and the
   Lord has sent him in the power of His Spirit and by His anointing, to
   deliver His Gospel as the Gospel of God and not the Gospel of man, then
   I pray you to give an earnest and a diligent heed to the things that
   you hear lest by any means you should let them slip!

   We are nothing of ourselves, but if we deliver God's message, that
   message is everything, and we can say to our hearers, with deep
   solemnity, "How shall you escape if you neglect so great a salvation?"
   If this is what God really speaks to you, then woe unto you if you will
   not hear it! And if this is in very truth an Inspired message from
   Heaven, then shall you be blessed if you hear it, for it is written,
   "Incline your ear, and come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall live."
   It makes all the difference between hearer and hearer whether you are
   hearing God or hearing only a man! If you hear the sermon as the word
   of man, it shall be the word of man to you and do you no good. But if
   you hear it as the Word of God--if you search your Bibles to see
   whether these things are so and if, finding them to be God's Word, you
   receive them, and tremble at them, and do honor to them as coming from
   God--then they are able to save your souls and they will save your
   souls! Oh, my dear Hearers, this may not seem a great point, but it is
   a truly essential one! Here we may divide our hearers. They who hear
   the Gospel as God's voice, hear it to live--and they who hear it as the
   mere lecture of man, hear it in vain!

   III. Let me draw another line of distinction, a pretty clear one, too.
   THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL HEAR THAT

   WHICH PLEASES THEM, BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR THAT WHICH TRIES THEM. I
   know my hearers pretty

   well by this time. There is one who likes good sound doctrine and if
   you preach doctrine to him, he says, "Oh, ah, that is delicious!" Give
   him a precept. "Ugh!" he says, "I do not like that, you know. I never
   care much about duties." You are a bad hearer--and you will get no
   blessing out of it. There is another man who likes to hear about the
   practical part of Christianity. He belongs to the Ethical Society, but
   if you give him Scriptural teaching about the person and work of the
   Lord Jesus Christ, he grinds his teeth and he is ready to turn on his
   heels and depart in a rage. That is not the kind of hearer whom God
   will accept, or who will get any good out of what he hears. There are
   some hearers who like a sermon when it just brushes their fur the right
   way. "Oh!" they say, "that is the right sort of preacher for us! Those
   are our sentiments. Now we can go on as we have been going. See what
   excuses he makes for us? He will allow us to be Christians and
   worldlings, too. That is the kind of preacher we like, one of your
   liberal sort."

   But the true hearer says to himself, "I do not ask to be pleased. Give
   me the man who just tells me the Truth of God though it vexes me at the
   time that I hear it." I do not need a doctor of the sort that says,
   "Oh, my dear Sir, there is very little, indeed, the matter with you!
   You need just a week's rest and change, and then you will be all
   right"--all the while knowing that you have a deadly and incurable
   disease upon you. Do you think that such a man deserves his guinea from
   the patient he is deceiving? Give me the doctor who examines me through
   and through, who finds out to the best of his knowledge what ails me,
   and then deals with me like an honest man, not trying to make out that
   I am better than I am, but who tells me what my disease really is, and
   treats me for what he knows is wrong! Oh, yes, God's ministers are not
   sent to please men! We are not sent to tickle itching ears, but to
   drive the sword of God's Spirit into the hearts of men, for He says,
   "Therefore have I hewed them by the Prophets; I have slain them by the
   words of My mouth."

   God's Prophets are rough hewers. They come with the axe and with the
   rod. They come not to fiddle while you dance, nor to blow the trumpet
   to tell you of a victory won without fighting. Ah, Sirs, you are bad
   hearers if you cannot hear that which rasps you, that which stings you,
   but which is honest Truth of God and is meant to make you repent of
   your sins! Give me not the man who makes me merry, but the man who
   makes me penitent! Not the man who sends me home filled with a fine
   conceit of myself, but the man who, whatever I think of him, makes me
   think badly of myself and brings me to my knees to seek mercy through
   Jesus Christ my Savior! This point reveals a great difference among
   hearers, does it not?

   IV. Now, there is another class, with whom I would deal next, namely,
   THOSE WHO ALWAYS WANT TO HEAR

   SOMETHING NEW. We have in London a sort of flying camp of people who
   always turn up when there is anything fresh. Every new man gets a
   congregation for a time out of these celestial gypsies, that put up
   their tents on every common. You know this sort of people. If there is
   a new thing cried up, they are after it. There will be another novelty
   in six months' time and they will be after that just as eagerly. They
   are always looking out for something fresh. Did you ever grow any fruit
   trees? If so, did your gardener ever recommend that they should be
   transplanted every six months? If so, the apple chamber may be as small
   as you like! That kind of hearer, who first hears this, and then hears
   that, and then hears the other, and after that a fourth, and a fifth,
   and a sixth thing and always likes the last new toy best, is a baby to
   begin with, and he remains a baby to the end of the chapter! No, give
   me the Truth of God that I knew as a boy, and fed upon, then, and let
   me feed upon it, still!

   As I said this morning, the true Israelite was as well fed on the manna
   after 40 years as he was at the first. It is the mixed multitude that
   needs the quails and something else, but the heir of Canaan, the true
   Israelite, is satisfied to eat the bread that came down from Heaven. He
   needs nothing better. He knows that there cannot be anything better.
   His prayer is, "Lord, give us this bread forevermore." Do I address any
   here who go about from one place to another in this style? You sheep
   that never stop in one pasture, how will you ever fatten? How will you
   ever grow spiritually strong? Besides, I think your conduct shows that
   you do not know the great secret, after all. If you did, you would be
   of his mind who said, "The old is better" and, having tasted that, you
   would keep to it even to the end!

   V. Let me draw another line of distinction. THERE ARE SOME HEARERS
   WHOSE HEARING IS ALL FOR THE ELOQUENCE OF THE SPEAKER--NOT FOR THE
   SUBSTANCE OF THAT WHICH IS SPOKEN. That comes home to some of you, I
   know. If a man can speak thoroughly well, and is a man of fluent
   utterance, a man of dramatic action, a man who makes the subject alive
   before your eyes, that is the preacher whose words you will remember!
   And he may preach any doctrine he likes, or no doctrine at all--that is
   not the point. Why, surely, you are like stupid people who will go to a
   shop because it is such a handsome shop, no matter what is sold in it!
   It may be utter rubbish and your money may be all wasted, but then it
   is such a pretty shop, is it not? Why, you good housewives know better
   than to do that! Many a man has a pretty shop, but his wares are
   bad--buy not from him, I pray you! We do not need, on the few Sundays
   that we have, the few days which we have to live, and with death so
   near--and judgment so tremendous--to go to the House of God merely to
   have primroses and pretty flowers presented to us by the preacher!

   Oh, for God's sake, put your flowers away! These souls are being
   damned! Come to close grips with them, Sir! Show them the way to Heaven
   and leave your flowers until they get there! And then they will not
   care for your tawdry, artificial eloquence! The only eloquence that is
   worth having is that of the heart--that which comes straight up from
   the soul of a man and he speaks well because he speaks out of his
   heart! O Sirs, I charge you, do not so insult the God of Heaven as to
   spend His Sabbath in merely listening to big words and fine oratory!
   What is this but to turn the Chapel into a theater and to make the
   preacher to be a mere performer? I had rather use market language and
   be as vulgar as vulgarity, itself, and carry souls to Heaven, than be a
   very Demosthenes, or a Cicero, and leave men's hearts untouched! Alas,
   that there are hearers to whom the words are everything and the sense
   is nothing!

   VI. I will draw another line, helping you at the same time to draw one
   for yourself. THERE ARE MANY WHO

   HEAR THE GOSPEL, BUT DO NOT HEAR IT FOR THEMSELVES. They hear it as
   people look at a picture. You

   know what we do with it--we stand and look at the foreground, and judge
   as to the distance, and the side lights, and the perspective and so on.
   (I do not know much about the terms of painting). And we just say,
   "That is a very beautiful view, that piece, of water yonder, that wood,
   those trees, the cattle, all are very pretty." Is not that how many
   people hear sermons? "Under the first head, did you notice so-and-so?"
   Or, "Under the second head, did you observe what the preacher said?"
   "When he came to that point, I thought it was rather well-turned." "I
   did not like so much that observation toward the close of the sermon--I
   thought that was rather rough."

   Yes, you see, you are judging the discourse as if it were a painting!
   That is all it is to you--but is this what it was meant to be? No, the
   true hearer looks into the Word of God as into a glass in which he may
   see himself as he really is. And when he sees himself in that glass, he
   says, "I did not know that I had that spot over the left eye. I was not
   aware that I had that blotch on my forehead. I must go and wash and be
   cleansed." It is well to hear a discourse that makes you see yourself
   as you are in God's sight.

   Many, when they hear a sermon, say, "I wonder how So-and-So would feel
   that sermon." What have you to do with him? Lend anything that you have
   to spare, but do not lend your ears! They will never come home so sound
   as when you lent them out. Keep your ears for your own use and let the
   Truth of God go home to your own heart, for this, and this only, is the
   kind of hearing that will ever save the soul! When you, yourself, hear
   for yourself, then you may yourself get right with God and live by
   faith in Christ Jesus!

   VII. Now I will mention a point which, I am afraid, will come home to a
   very large number now present. THERE IS

   AMONG HEARERS TOO MUCH OF UNPREPARED HEARING. I will tell you what I
   mean. The man comes fresh

   from the shop. That I do not mind, but perhaps he comes in fresh from
   care, from anger, from quarrelling, from the use of unhallowed
   language. And he comes in to hear the Word of God with his ears stopped
   up. Now, the right way to hear so as to get a blessing is to hear with
   prayer, to come up to hear what God the Lord shall speak, praying all
   the while, "O God, bless the message to my soul! Send me strength,
   tonight, through some part of what is said or sung that I may really be
   fit to hear Your Word. Prepare me, for the preparation of the heart is
   from You. Make me like a plot of plowed land that, when the seed falls
   upon me, I may receive it and bring forth a harvest."

   Now, my dear Hearers, do you think that we really prepare ourselves
   enough for the hearing of the Word of God? Do you not think that we
   lose a great blessing because we do not come prepared to hear what God
   the Lord will say unto us? I have sometimes been greatly rejoiced when
   I have seen the numbers of persons who have been brought to Christ by
   my preaching, but I have always taken a very large discount off
   anything like praise that I might give to myself, for I have said,
   "Why, those people, as a rule, come on purpose to hear me!" When I have
   preached in the country, the people have come there on purpose to hear
   and have had almost to fight to get in--and they have made up their
   minds that they are going to hear something that they need to hear and
   something that will be a blessing to them--and they have sat with their
   mouths wide open, taking in every word. Of course, anybody can open
   oysters when they open their shells, themselves. When people come
   prepared, then it is that their hearts are readily reached. But when
   people come prejudiced, with their shells tightly shut up. When they do
   not mean to hear, do they wonder that no good comes to them through the
   discourse? How could it? Only by a wonderful act of the sovereignty of
   Divine Grace could they expect to get a blessing.

   VIII. There is a further distinction that I must mention. THERE ARE
   MANY WHO COME TO GOD'S HOUSE TO HEAR FROM A LOW MOTIVE and such do not
   usually get a blessing. Some come from a very base motive. We have
   known some come that they may catch up a word with which they may find
   fault. Oh, dear Hearts, if you need to find fault with me, you need not
   listen but for five minutes! I shall always give you plenty of
   opportunity and let me tell you another thing, I shall not fret if you
   find the opportunity. It will not, in the least degree, trouble me. I
   would rather that you should find fault than that you should be quite
   indifferent. If you will only let the Word enter your hearts, you may
   do what you will with me--kick me, if you like--only mind that you get
   to Heaven! There are some who make a man an offender for a word. They
   turn over all the basket of fish and because there is one that does not
   smell quite sweet, they cry it all over the market. That is their style
   of acting towards the preacher. They would not like to be dealt with in
   that way, themselves. It is a base motive altogether.

   Some come from another motive. There is one here, tonight. He has come
   up to see his brother. He does not generally go to a place of worship,
   but John said to him, "William, come to the Tabernacle with me,
   tonight." He does not like to offend John and so he comes. Another
   young man has come because there is a young woman who comes here. I am
   not going to blame him for that, but still, it is not an honorable
   motive for going to hear the Word of God. Another has come to see the
   Tabernacle, to look at the building. And another has heard that the
   preacher is such a strange man. He will come to see what he is really
   like. That is a poor motive. Many of you come because, well, you have
   only come here because your mother comes here. You come because it is
   the custom and the habit--and you would not like to become perpetual
   Sabbath breakers, forsaking the assembling of yourselves together. If
   that is all you come for, you will get it, and it is nothing. But if
   you come to hear the Word, saying, "I come to weigh it, to see whether
   it is God's Word, and if it is, I will follow it. If it comes to me
   with the power of the Holy Spirit, commending itself to my conscience,
   I will obey it, I will yield to it, for I need to find salvation
   through the Word of God, and I come with that intention"--I do not
   believe you will come a dozen times, any one of you, to hear the Gospel
   with a view of finding Christ in it, but what you will find Him! "He
   that seeks, finds."

   IX. I must draw yet another distinction and that is, that MANY COME TO
   HEAR THE WORD, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD IT, THERE IS NO IMPROVEMENT IN
   THEM. One of our Brethren told me, just now, that a friend in the
   market said to him, "Do you always hear Mr. Spurgeon?" "Yes," he
   answered, "I have heard him these 25 years." The other said, "Then you
   ought to be a good fellow." "Well," I said, "he did not say you were a
   good fellow, did he? "No, but he said I ought to be." If you have heard
   the Gospel for 25 years, you ought to be a good fellow. If it is the
   Word of God that you have heard--and you have not improved by
   it--surely you are becoming like that fig tree that brought forth no
   fruit. At last the mandate went forth, "Cut it down, why cumbers it the
   ground?" But, alas, there are many who hear the Word for years, but are
   none the better for all their hearing.

   X. Lastly, THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO DO NOT HEAR TO PROFIT BECAUSE
   THEY DO NOT BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. You have not accepted the
   Christ who has been preached. You have heard

   about faith, but you have not believed. You have heard about
   repentance, but you have never repented. What do you come for, if you
   never make any practical use of what you hear? Why do you come? A man
   keeps a shop on the Causeway and you go into the shop when he opens it
   on Monday. You go up and down, look at all the things, and go out
   again. Do the same on Tuesday and Wednesday, ask to see his goods, and
   look them all over, but do not buy anything. Try that for a week and
   you will get some very clear hints that you are not wanted there! If
   you go to a shop, you are expected to buy!

   I would like to give some of you a plain hint about that matter. You
   have come to my shop and turned my goods over, but you have not bought
   anything. Is my price too high? It is, "without money, and without
   price," so you cannot say that! "Whoever will, let him take the water
   of life freely." Come and take the Savior and He is yours! Trust Him
   and you are saved! Why, would a person go to see a physician and go
   often, and pay his guinea, as some of you pay your pew-rents, and yet
   never take the medicine, never get the prescriptions made up--but just
   get the directions--and then neglect them? It is absurd! Such a man as
   that must be a fool!

   I will not say that anybody here is a fool, but I do not know what else
   he is if he understands what he must do to escape from the wrath to
   come and yet never does! This line is a very clear and distinct one and
   I wish that we might cross it, tonight, if we have never before crossed
   it. Cross the line by decision for Christ! That is the point. You have
   heard aright if you have found Christ! You have heard for nothing if
   you have not found Him. If you have looked to Him upon the Cross, you
   have heard to your eternal profit, for he that looks to Him shall live!
   If you believe that Jesus is the Christ, you are born of God! If you
   are trusting yourself wholly to Him, you have eternal life, for he that
   believes in Him has everlasting life! But if you believe not in Christ,
   you might as well have heard the noise of Cheapside as have heard the
   sound of the Gospel! You might as well have heard the toll of the drum
   at the barracks as have listened to the proclamation of Jesus Christ,
   for all the good that it will ever bring to you.

   Now hear God's message to every one of you, tonight, you who have not
   yet believed--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he
   that believes not shall be damned." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and you shall be saved, and your house." God help you to do it, for His
   dear love's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. LUKE 13:6-30.

   Verse 6. He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
   planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and
   found none. It was a fig tree, a fruit-bearing tree by profession, so
   it ought to have borne fruit. It was planted. It was not a wild tree,
   it was planted in a vineyard, in the proper place for fig trees to
   grow, in good soil and, therefore, the owner of it had a right to come
   and look for fruit on it. But he found none. Have we not here, tonight,
   some who are planted in the Church of God who ought, by their
   profession, to be bearing fruit, but they are not? Christ has come and
   He has looked for fruit. But He has found none.

   7. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three
   years I came seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it
   down; why cumbers it the ground? The owner seems to say, "If I had not
   found fruit the first year, I should have thought that the season was
   unfavorable. If I had found no fruit the second year, I might have
   thought that, perhaps, the tree was a little out of condition and would
   come round again. But when I come for three years, and three years
   consecutively, and I find no fruit, then it is clear that the fig tree
   is a barren one! Why should it stay here and spoil the

   soil, occupy the place that a good fig tree might have occupied and
   take away the nutriment from other trees?" So if, after many years,
   some of you have brought forth no fruit, God may well complain about
   you. You are eating the bread that might have nourished a saint. You
   are occupying a place in which your influence is injurious to others.
   Others do less because you do nothing. I pray the Holy Spirit to bring
   this home to the conscience of any barren professor whom it may
   concern, lest the command should go forth, "Cut it down; why cumbers it
   the ground?"

   8, 9. And he answering said unto him, Sir, let it alone this year,
   also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it bears fruit,
   well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down. Even the
   vinedresser's pleading has a limit--"Give it one more year." He admits
   that the time must come for the axe to cut down the tree that is
   fruitless. The cumber-ground tree cannot stand forever--it is
   unreasonable that it should. And you cannot be permitted to live
   forever in sin--you cannot be allowed to taint the air with blasphemy
   for another 50 years. There must come an end to such a life as yours
   and that end may come very soon. The edge of the axe is sharp and the
   hand that wields it is strong. Beware, O barren tree!

   10, And He was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath. When
   there happened a very remarkable miracle. The parable that preceded it
   was a parable of judgement--the miracle that followed was a miracle of
   mercy and Grace.

   11, 12. And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
   eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up
   herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to Him. You can see her
   slowly moving along, bent double. Hers was a painful walk, but she came
   at Christ's call.

   12, 13. And said unto her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.
   And He laid His hands on her: and immediately she was made straight,
   and glorified God. See what Christ can do! After I had preached this
   morning, I had to speak with just such a woman as this, one who has
   been, for many years, the victim of deep despondency. How I wished that
   I could lay my hands on her and say, "Woman, you are loosed from your
   infirmity"! But we cannot work such a miracle as that. It is Christ who
   must do it all and, blessed be His name, He is always great in a pinch!
   Christ loves to come in at a dead lift. When we are all beaten and we
   have reached man's extremity, then it is Christ's opportunity! Oh, you
   poor despairing woman, bent double by your sadness, the Lord's hand can
   restore you and we pray for you, tonight, even the thousands of Israel
   pray for you at this moment! Lord, lay Your hand upon that poor child
   of infirmity!

   14. And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation. Wretched
   creature, to be indignant at Christ's doing good! There is no reckoning
   with self-righteous people! They are mad, themselves, and they think
   others so.

   14, 15. Because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath and said unto the
   people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them
   therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath. The Lord then
   answered him, and said, You hypocrite--It served him right! This is
   just the word that would naturally come to the lips of the Savior.
   Because He was loving and tender, He could not endure this hypocritical
   indignation--"The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite."

   15,16. Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass
   from the stall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this
   woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these
   eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath? A very
   conclusive argument. You may do deeds like this on the Sabbath and you
   may come and be healed on the Sabbath, even though it should involve
   you in a journey. It is so necessary that you should get the Bread of
   Heaven, so necessary that you should get the blessing of Christ, that
   on this day you may come and be healed.

   17-19. And when He had said these things, all His adversaries were
   ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that
   were done by Him. Then said He, Unto what is the Kingdom of God like?
   And to what shall I compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed,
   which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a
   great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. You
   get a little Grace, tonight. Let that Divine Man take but a grain of
   the mustard seed of His Grace and drop it into your heart, which He
   will have prepared like a garden, and there is no telling what will
   come of it! That sigh, that tear, that wish will grow into holiness of
   life and zeal of conduct! It may be but very little in its beginning,
   but it will grow. Both good and evil begin with very small eggs, but
   they grow into great things.

   20. And again He said, To what shall I liken the Kingdom of God? Now
   take the bad side and see how the Kingdom of God may be perverted and
   injured by evil influences.

   21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of
   meal, till the whole was leavened. That woman of Rome has hidden her
   leaven in the Church and it has leavened the whole--and now the woman
   of intellect has put her leaven into the Church. Conceited
   self-invention of new doctrines, perversion of the simplicity of the
   Gospel--that kind

   of leaven has been hidden in the meal of the Church--and it is
   leavening the whole. God help us to keep out the leaven both of
   Romanism and of Rationalism!

   22. And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
   journeying toward Jerusalem. His face was toward the Cross. He was
   working His passage to His Sacrifice and preaching His way to that
   place where He should complete our redemption. This is a wonderful
   picture of Christ--"teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."

   23. Then said one unto Him, Lord, are there few that are saved? What
   business is that of ours? Our business is far more practical--to be
   saved, ourselves, and to endeavor to be the means of saving others!
   Jesus did not answer the question-- He did what was better.

   23, 24. And He said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate:
   for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
   You can get into the broad road without striving. But you must, "strive
   to enter in at the strait gate." Strive for that which requires
   self-denial, that which humbles you, that which goes against the grain,
   that which is not according to human nature. Do not imagine that Divine
   Grace is to be had while you are half asleep and that Heaven is to be
   gained on a feather bed. Strive, strive, for many will seek in vain to
   enter! Seeking is not enough! It must come to a holy violence--"Strive
   to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, many will
   seek to enter in, and shall not be able." When will that be? That will
   be when you are in another state.

   25. When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut the
   door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying,
   Lord, Lord, open unto us. They will be very respectful. They will call
   him, "Lord." They will be very earnest. They will pray, "Lord, Lord."
   They will be very simple and very honest in their request--"Open unto
   us." They will be very personal--"Open unto us." Such will the prayers
   of the ungodly be when they wake up to the fact that they are shut out
   of Heaven!

   25-26. And He shall answer and say unto you, I know you not who you
   are: then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in Your
   Presence, and you have taught in our streets. They came to the
   Communion Table. They used to hear sermons indoors and out of doors.
   "You have taught in our streets."

   27. But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not who you are; depart
   from Me, all you workers of iniquity. They shall be judged by their
   works. If they were workers of iniquity, it proved that they were
   unrenewed and unsaved. Christ will not endure their company but will
   say to them, "Depart from Me."

   28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see
   Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets, in the Kingdom of
   God, and you yourselves thrust out. You who thought that you had a
   share in the Kingdom of God, and were, by birth, the natural heirs of
   it--"You yourselves thrust out."

   29. 30. And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
   the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of
   God. And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
   first which shall be last. The least likely to be saved shall be saved!
   The blackest sinners, the vilest outcasts, the grossest unbelievers
   shall be brought to repentance and faith and shall be saved! While
   those who were first in privileges, children of godly parents,
   professors of religion. Those who appeared in every way likely to be
   first saved, will be left to the last, and be shut out of the Kingdom
   of God, never to enter. God grant, in His infinite mercy, that nobody
   in the Tabernacle, tonight, may be of that unhappy number! Amen.

God's Works Made Manifest

   (No. 2309)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 21, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY
   12, 1880.

   "Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents" (that he
   was born blind): "but that the works of God should be made manifest in
   him." John 9:3.

   NEVER attribute any special sorrow endured by men to some special sin.
   There is a tendency to consider that those on whom the tower in Siloam
   fell must have been sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem. And
   if any have met with a very sudden death, we are apt to suppose that
   they must have been exceedingly guilty--but it is not so. Very godly
   men have been burned to death in a train. I remember one who came to
   that terrible end. Many holy men have been drowned on board ship when
   they have been going about their Master's errands. Some of the most
   gracious men that I ever met have dropped dead without a moment's
   warning. You cannot judge of a man's state before God by that which
   happens to him in the order of Providence. And it is very unkind,
   ungenerous and almost inhuman, to sit down, like the friends of Job,
   and suppose that because Job is greatly afflicted, he must, therefore,
   be greatly sinful. It is not so. All afflictions are not chastisements
   for sin--there are some afflictions that have quite another end and
   objective. They are sent to refine, sent as a holy discipline, sent as
   sacred excavators to make more room in the heart for Christ and His
   love. Indeed, you know that it is written, "As many as I tenderly love,
   I rebuke and chasten." "Whom the Lord loves, He chastens, and scourges
   every son whom He receives."

   It was, therefore, in the last degree, absurd to suppose that if a man
   was born blind, it was a punishment for the sin of his parents, or a
   punishment sent beforehand for some sin which he might commit,
   by-and-by. Our Savior bids us look quite another way and regard
   infirmities and physical evils as sent to be a space wherein God may
   display His power and His Grace. It was very specially so in this
   particular instance and I am going to push the fact, further, and say
   that even sin, itself, existing as it does everywhere, existing
   especially in some, may afford what we call, "elbow room," for the
   Grace of God and may, indeed, become a platform upon which the
   wonderful power, patience and sovereignty of Divine Grace may be
   displayed.

   That will be the subject that we shall talk about, tonight, how God
   takes opportunity from the sorrows and the sins of men to make manifest
   His own works to His own Glory. As this man was born blind, in order
   that, through his blindness, the power of God might be seen in giving
   him sight, so I think there are many in whom the power of God may very
   readily be seen and the works of God be very clearly made manifest.

   I. So, first, let us enquire what works these are. WHAT WORKS OF GOD
   ARE SEEN IN THE SALVATION OF MEN?

   There is a man over yonder who is all out of order. There is nothing
   right about him. He is a man upside down. His heart loves that which
   will ruin it and does not love that which would bless it. His
   understanding is darkened. He puts bitter for sweet and sweet for
   bitter. His will has become very domineering and has usurped power
   which it never ought to possess. If you will study him well, you will
   not make much of him. He is all out of gear, like a piece of machinery
   in which the wheels do not operate correctly. To describe him briefly
   by one word, I should say that he is in a state of chaos, everything is
   in confusion and disorder, tossed up and down. "Well," says one, "that
   is my case. I am like that tonight."

   Now, the first work of God that we read of in the Bible is the work of
   creation--"In the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth." When
   the fullness of time was come for the fitting up of the world, which
   event we generally call, creation, although it was really the
   arrangement of that which had been created, then the Lord came forth
   and the Spirit

   of God, with outspread wings, brooded over chaos and brought order out
   of confusion. Oh, that the Spirit of the Lord would, tonight, come and
   brood over that man's confused and confounded mind where everything is
   tossed about in wild disorder! He cannot tell why he was born, nor for
   what objective he is living. He seems to have no purpose in life, he is
   tossed to and fro like a log in the ocean. His passions fly from vanity
   to vanity and you cannot put him in order. His mother tried it, but he
   scorned to be tied to her apron strings. Many friends have tried it
   since then, but he has now taken the bit into his mouth and has run
   away--he refuses to obey the reins. O God, if You will come, tonight,
   and make him a new creature in Christ Jesus, Your creating work will be
   made manifest in him! If You will mold, and model, and form, and
   fashion him until he shall be a vessel fit for Your use, then will the
   work of God begin to be manifested in him. Oh, that it might be so!
   There are some of us here who can bear witness that God is a great
   Creator, for He has made all things new within us and transformed what
   before was chaos into a world of beauty and delight wherein He delights
   to dwell.

   After the world was created, God's next work was that of making light.
   The earth was created, but it was swathed in darkness. "Darkness was
   upon the face of the deep." No sun, no moon, no stars had yet appeared.
   No light had yet fallen upon the earth--perhaps by reason of dense
   vapors which shut out the light. God did nothing but say, "Let there be
   light; and there was light."

   Well now, tonight there has come in here one who is not only without
   form and void, and dreadfully tossed about, but one who is, himself,
   dark and in the dark. He needs the Light of God, but he has none. He
   does not know the way of life. He does not see a ray of hope that he
   ever will find the way. He seems shut up in gloomy, thick, Egyptian
   night and, perhaps, worst of all, he does not know his true
   condition--he calls darkness light, and prides himself that he can see,
   when really he can see nothing at all! Lord, speak the Word, and say,
   "Let there be light," and the man will see the light, and see it at
   once! I am quite sure that, whether I can speak with power, or not, God
   can speak with power and, standing here, it is to my heart a sweet
   solace that He can, at this moment, find out the most darkened sinner
   in the building, sitting or standing anywhere about, and the Light of
   God can penetrate into his soul in less time than it takes me to say
   the words! And to his own surprise the darkness shall be light about
   him and the Egyptian night shall be turned into the midday of infinite
   love and mercy! Pray God that it may be so, Brothers and Sisters! Lift
   up a silent prayer to Heaven, for this light-giving! This illumination
   is a special work of God and there are many who are now in the dark, in
   whom it is possible for this work of God to be manifested.

   After these two works of God are done, after we have had creation and
   light-bringing, still there is death and there is need of the Divine
   work of resurrection. What is the use of a form beautifully fashioned
   if it is dead? And what is the use of light shining with all its
   brilliance upon a corpse? Yet in this House of Prayer there are,
   tonight, some who are dead in trespasses and sins. They do not feel the
   weight of sin, yet to a living man it is an intolerable burden. They
   are not wounded by the two-edged sword of the Lord, though a living man
   is soon cut and gashed by it. They do not even hear the joyous notes of
   Free Grace and dying love though they ring out like a peal of silver
   bells! These dead sinners do not appreciate their sweet music. It is
   the work of God to make men live. There will come a day, and perhaps
   sooner than we think, when all the myriads of bodies that lie in our
   cemeteries and churchyards will rise up from the grave to live again!
   That will be a manifestation of Divine Power, but it will not be a
   greater manifestation of Divine Power than when a dead heart, a dead
   conscience, a dead will is made to live with a Divine life! Oh, that
   God would work that mighty miracle of mercy tonight! Pray that it may
   be so, beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ. The dead will not pray
   for this resur-rection--therefore let us pray for it for them! And if
   there is a man who does pray for it, one who cries, "Lord, make me
   live!" that is a proof that already there is a thrill of life shooting
   through him, or he would not have that living desire!

   Brethren, I might thus continue working upon the line of the story of
   the creation and the arranging of the world in due order, but I will
   not--you can do that for yourselves. I want, next, to speak to you
   about the Divine work of cleansing. There is, tonight, in this place of
   worship, a man who is black with filth. He has done everything that he
   could do in order to rebel against God. Perhaps he is like Mr. John
   Newton who describes himself somewhat thus--he says, "I was, in many
   respects, like the Apostle Paul. I was a blasphemer, a persecutor and
   injurious, but there was one point in which I went beyond the Apostle
   Paul, for he did it ignorantly, but I sinned against light and
   knowledge." Do I speak to any here who, in sinning, have transgressed
   very grossly because they have done what they knew was wrong and have
   perse-

   vered in doing it against the checks of conscience and against the
   warnings of a better longing, which they have never yet been able to
   kill?

   I am amazed, sometimes, when I have had to talk with those whose lives
   have certainly gone almost to the very extremity of iniquity, but who,
   nevertheless, all the time have had a certain inward check that would
   never let them go just that little piece further which would have put
   them beyond hope. There was always a something that they still revered,
   even when they pretended to disbelieve everything and to blaspheme
   everything! There was some influence for good still operating upon
   them, as though God had a line and a hook in the jaws of leviathan--and
   though he ran out so far into the great deep of sin that you could not
   tell where he had gone, yet he had to come back, again, after all. God
   still does wonders of mercy and Grace!

   Now, suppose, tonight, that that black sinner, with all his years of
   sin, should be forgiven outright? Suppose that, tonight, the whole of
   those 50 or 60 years of sin should vanish once and for all? Suppose
   that God should forgive, better still, that God should forget? Suppose
   that, with one tremendous fling of His Omnipotent arm, He should take
   the whole mass of that sinner's sin and cast it into the depths of the
   sea? What a wonder of Grace that would be! That is what God will do for
   everyone who trusts in Jesus! If you will come and cast yourself at His
   dear feet, and look up to Jesus, Crucified, bleeding in your place, and
   believe those words of the Prophet Isaiah, "The Lord has laid on Him
   the iniquity of us all," or the words of the Apostle Peter, "Who, His
   own Self, bore our sins in His own body on the tree." If you trust
   Jesus, the great Sin-Bearer, He will make you whiter than snow! And in
   your case the works of God shall be manifested, for none but the
   Almighty God can make scarlet sinners white--and He can do it in a
   moment. Lord, do it now!

   Suppose that another thing should happen, that a man here, or a woman
   who is desperately set on mischief, should, tonight, be turned in an
   entirely opposite direction? That would be manifestly a Divine work of
   changing the whole current of life! I have never seen Niagara Falls and
   I do not suppose that I ever shall, but there are some here who have
   seen it. Down comes the mighty flood with a tremendous crash, forever
   leaping down from on high! Would you not believe Him to be God who
   should, in a moment, make that waterfall leap upward instead of
   downward and, as impetuously seek the heights as now it leaps into the
   depths? Well, the Lord can do that with some big Niagara Fall of a
   sinner here this very evening! You are determined, tonight, to go into
   evil company and to commit a filthy sin. You are determined, tomorrow,
   to grasp the drunkard's cup and not be satisfied until you have turned
   yourself into something below a beast! You are determined to pursue
   that evil business of yours, that getting money by gambling, or
   something worse. Yes, but if my Lord comes forth, tonight, determined
   to save you, He will make you sing to another tune!

   "Oh, but I could never be a Methodist!" says one. I do not know what
   you will yet be. "Oh!" says another, "you would never make a convert of
   me." I did not say that I could--but the Lord can make you what you
   think you never will be! There are some here, who, if they could have
   seen themselves 10 years ago, sitting here, and enjoying the Word,
   would have said, "No, no, Charlie, that is not you! I am sure, my boy."
   And, "No, Mary, that is not you, my girl! You will never be there,
   there is no fear of that." But you are here, you see, and what Free
   Grace has done for some of us, it can do for others. Lord, do it
   according to that mighty power which You did work in Christ when You
   did raise Him from the dead! Work in the same fashion in the ungodly,
   tonight, and turn them from the error of their ways to run as
   impetuously after You as now they run from You!

   I have only one more matter to mention under this head. I think that
   God's works are sometimes manifested in men by giving them great joy.
   There is a person here, tonight, convicted of sin. Mr. Conscience has
   come up against him. You know Mr. Conscience--he keeps a
   cat-o'-nine-tails. When he is allowed to get to work and he gets tight
   hold of a sinner who has long kept him under hatches, he says, "Now it
   is my turn!" And he lets you know it, believe me! Let a man once get
   conscience, with a cat-o'-nine-tails, laying it on, and he will never
   forget it! Every stroke seems to tear off a thongful of his quivering
   flesh. Look how the nine plows make deep furrows every time they fall!

   "You speak," says one, "like a man who knows it." Know it? I knew it
   for years while but a child! And neither night nor day could I escape
   from the falling of those terrible thongs! Oh, how conscience scourged
   me and I could find no rest anywhere till, once upon a time, I heard
   the Divine voice that said, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all you
   ends of the earth." And conscience put away his cat-o'-nine-tails and
   my wounds were bathed in heavenly balsam! And they ceased to smart and
   I was glad! Oh, how my heart cried, "Hallelujah!" as I saw Jesus on the
   Cross! Then I understood that God had

   executed the full vengeance due to my sin upon His Well-Beloved who had
   kindly bared His shoulders to the lash and undertaken to bear the
   punishment of my sin. Then did my heart leap with joy!

   You notice that I am always preaching that Doctrine of Substitution. I
   cannot help it, because it is the only Truth of God that brought me
   comfort. I should never have gotten out of the Dungeon of Despair if it
   had not been for that grand Truth of Substitution! I hope that no young
   lady is going to ask me to write in her album this week. That request
   is made to me, I do not know how many days in the week, and I always
   write this verse in all the albums--

   "Ever since by faith I saw the stream

   Your flowing wounds supply,

   Redeeming lo ve has been my theme,

   And shall be till I dee."

   If you once know the power of that blessed theme, then you will see
   that it is a work of God to sweep away our ashes and to give us the oil
   of joy--to take from us our robes of mourning and to clothe us with
   garments of beauty--to put a new song into our months and to establish
   our goings. May you all have this blessed work of God worked in you, to
   the praise of the glory of His Grace!

   II. Now, my second head is this, HOW ARE THESE WORKS MADE SPECIALLY
   MANIFEST IN SOME MEN?

   I will take this blind man and just run over his life. First, he was
   totally blind. There was no sham about his blindness. He could not see
   a ray of light--he was totally blind--he knew nothing about light. Is
   there anybody here who is totally blind in a spiritual sense? You
   cannot see anything, my poor Friend. You have not one good desire--you
   have not had, even, a good thought! Ah, you do not know what kind of
   people we have in this London, but we do meet with people who, for
   years, seem never to have had a good thought ever cross their minds.
   And if someone else were to speak to them about anything that is good,
   or even decent, he would be talking double Dutch to them! They do not
   understand it. We have multitudes of that kind in our slums, yes, and
   in the West End they are just as bad.

   Now, when the Lord, in His infinite mercy, comes to these people who
   are totally blind and He makes them see, there is room for His mighty
   power to work there, for everybody says, "What a wonderful thing that
   such a person as that should be converted!" I remember well a man with
   whom I have often prayed in very sweet fellowship. He was a strange
   fish when I first knew him, though he was a very good man afterwards.
   He was as eccentric a being as I ever met--and I am sufficiently
   eccentric myself--but he was a dead worldling. His Sundays--well, he
   did not know any difference between Sunday and Monday except that he
   could not be in the beer shop for quite so long on Sundays. He said, "I
   had been out one Sunday morning to buy a pair of ducks and I put one in
   each pocket of my coat. As I went along, and saw the people going into
   a place of worship, I thought that I would see what it was like, I had
   heard that it was a decent looking place inside."

   He went in. The Lord met with him--and that day those ducks did not get
   cooked--they had to wait till Monday! But he was, himself, caught and
   captured for Christ that day. A total change took place in him and he
   became a fervent Christian at once, whereas before he had been totally
   without any kind of religious thought, either of fear or of hope! Here
   was a case in which the works of God were specially made manifest! That
   man has gone to Heaven, now. Well do I remember him and how I praised
   God for his conversion!

   But the man mentioned in our text was born blind. Now, there are many
   like that, indeed--all people are born blind. It is original sin, from
   which we all suffer. Sin is a taint of the blood. We are born blind.
   There are some who, in a very peculiar way, are bred and born in a
   family utterly destitute of religion. They are brought up to despise
   it, or else brought up in the midst of superstition and taught to say a
   useless prayer to a crucifix of wood or stone. Can these people, who
   are so brought up, find Christ? Yes, by His Grace, they do find Christ,
   or rather, Christ finds them! And they hear the Gospel and it commends
   itself to their minds straight away. I suppose that nobody was ever
   more superstitious than Martin Luther was. I have seen that staircase
   in Rome, up which Martin Luther went on his knees. It is said to be the
   staircase which our Lord came down from the palace of Pilate. I have
   seen the people go up and down on their knees. Just think of Luther
   doing it--and there came to him, as he was going up the stairs on his
   knees, those words, "The just shall live by faith," and he rose up at
   once--and he did not go on his knees any farther! Oh, that God would
   appear in that way to some of you!

   Next, this blind man was cured by special means. That was another
   manifestation of God's works. The Savior spat, stooped down and with
   His finger worked that spittle into the dust until He had made clay.
   Then taking it up, He began

   to put it over the man's eyes. I believe that God is greatly glorified
   by the salvation of people through the simple preaching of the Gospel,
   the very simplest means that can be used. Often men say, when souls are
   saved in this place, as they are continually, "Well, I cannot see
   anything remarkable in the preacher." No, and if you were to look a
   great deal longer, you would see less than you see now, for there is
   not anything whatever in him--but there is a great deal in the Gospel!
   O Brothers and Sisters, if some preachers would only preach the Gospel,
   they would soon see how very superior it is to all their fine essays!
   "But they prepare their sermons so well." Oh, yes, I know, but did you
   ever hear of the man who used to prepare the potatoes before he planted
   them in his garden? He always boiled them--they never grew, for he had
   prepared all the life out of them! Now, many a boiled sermon is brought
   out to the people, but it never grows. It is elaborated and prepared so
   much that nothing will ever come out of it. The Lord loves to bless
   living words spoken in simple language out of an earnest heart. The man
   who speaks thus does not get the glory--the glory goes to God--and thus
   there is room for the works of God to be manifested!

   This blind man was also a specially fit sphere for God to manifest His
   works in because he was known as a public beggar. They used to lead him
   up in the morning, I suppose, to the gate of the Temple, and there he
   took his place and sat down. He was a man with a ready tongue, I should
   guess, so that he often used to exchange chaff with those that went by,
   and they remembered what kind of a man he was. He was always very
   sarcastic, I suspect, and when they spoke to him, and gave him nothing,
   he knew how to give them something! That blind beggar was a well-known
   character in Jerusalem, as well known as the blind beggar of Bethnal
   Green--so the Savior selected him because he was so well known-- and
   opened his eyes.

   So you have come here, tonight, my Friend, have you? You are well
   known, but I will not point you out. I do not like doing that kind of
   thing. There came in here, not long ago, a soldier who had been a
   professor of religion, but he had been a dreadful apostate and had gone
   back. But he wanted to hear the Gospel again. Just over yonder, where
   there are two pillars, he wisely chose a place where I could not see
   him. But it so happened on that Sunday night, and he is the witness of
   it--I well remember saying, "Well, Will, you have to come back, you
   know. You have got to come back. And the sooner, the better." And Will
   did come back! And he sent word to me to say that Will had come back
   with a broken heart to find his Lord. I did not know that his name was
   Will, I am sure, and I did not know why he had hidden himself behind
   the pillars, there, but God did, and He adapted the Word of God to the
   person, and so he fetched Will back again!

   If there is any Will, or Tom, or Jack, or Mary, or if there are any
   others here who have wandered far from God, O Sovereign Grace, bring
   them back, whether they are soldiers or civilians, that they may seek
   and find the Savior even now! This Will was well known and his
   restoration to Christ will, I trust, manifest the works of God in him
   because he was so well known. Oh, that the Lord would hear that prayer
   of my friend, this morning, and convert the Prince of Wales! We all
   said, "Amen," to that petition! We want the Lord to bring into His
   Church some of those who are best known, whether they are princes or
   whether they are beggars, that the works of God may be manifest in
   them!

   When this man was converted, instead of being a public beggar, he
   became a public confessor. I like that answer of his, "Whether He is a
   sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind,
   now I see." There is many a man who can say, "Well, I do not know much
   about theology, but I know that I was a drunk and I know that I am not
   a drunk, now. I know that I used to beat my wife and now, God bless
   her, she knows how I love her! Then I could have gone into all manner
   of sinful company, but now, thank God, His saints are my choice
   companions! Once I could have gloried in my own righteousness, but now
   I count it dross and dung, that I may win Christ and be found in Him.
   There is a great change in me--nobody can deny that fact--and I praise
   God's name for it."

   The Lord send out a great company of men who are not ashamed of Jesus
   Christ! We need many men and women who will come straight out from the
   world and say, "Christ for me, for He has so touched my heart, that I
   am for Him! And if no one else will confess Him, I must do so, for He
   is my best Friend, my Lord, my Savior, my All!" In such cases, the
   works of God are made manifest.

   III. Now I have done when I have just said three or four things by way
   of hints upon this last point, How MAY GOD'S WORKS BE MANIFEST IN US?

   Some of you are very poor. Others are very lame or very sickly. You are
   consumptive, asthmatic, full of aches, pains and complaints. Now, then,
   perhaps all this suffering is permitted that the work of God may be
   manifest in your afflic-

   tions by your holy patience, your submission to the Divine will, your
   persevering holiness amid all your poverty and trials. All this is sent
   that God's Grace may be seen in you. Will you look at your afflictions
   in that light and believe that they are not sent as a punishment, but
   as a platform upon which God may stand and display His Free Grace in
   you? Bear well all the Lord's will, for your trials are sent for this
   purpose, that God's works may be manifest in you.

   The same is true of your infirmities. We are, none of us, perfect, but
   we may also have physical infirmities. Now believe, if you are sent to
   preach the Gospel, or to teach children, or in any way to advance the
   Kingdom of God, that you would not be any better fitted for your work
   if you had all the eloquence of a Cicero and all the learning of a
   Newton! You, as you are, can serve the Lord and can fill a certain
   place, better, with all your drawbacks, than you could without those
   drawbacks. A sensible Christian will make use of his infirmities for
   God's Glory. There is a strange story that they tell of St. Bernard, a
   tradition which is believed, by some people, but which I look at as an
   allegory rather than as a matter of fact. He was going over the Alps
   towards Rome upon some business. The devil knew that the saint was
   about to do something that would greatly injure his kingdom, so he came
   and broke one of the wheels of the saint's carriage. Whereat Bernard
   called out to him, and said, "You think to stop me in this way, do you,
   Satan? Now you shall suffer for it yourself!" So he took him and
   twisted him round, and made a wheel of him--and fastened him to the
   carriage--and then went driving on,

   Now, the meaning of that allegory is that, when infirmities threaten to
   injure your usefulness, you are to use those infirmities in God's
   service. Turn the devil, himself, into a wheel and go ahead all the
   better because of the hindrance that he tried to cause. Why, it might
   be an advantage, sometimes, to be compelled by stammering to lay
   emphasis on a word! And if ever I did feel myself, now and then, stuck
   in a hole by that process, I would take care to be stuck somewhere near
   the Cross. Many a man has had the power to attract people by the very
   singularity which looked as if it must impair his usefulness. All our
   infirmities, whatever they are, are just opportunities for God to
   display His gracious work in us.

   So it will be with all the oppositions that we meet with. If we serve
   the Lord, we shall be sure to meet with difficulties and
   oppositions--but they are only more opportunities for the works of God
   to be seen in us.

   By-and-by, we shall come to die and, in our deaths, God's work may be
   manifest. I wonder by what death we shall glorify God? Was not that a
   beautiful expression of John's, when the Savior spoke of Peter? He told
   Peter how he would die, but John does not put it so. He says, "By what
   death he should glorify God." Perhaps it will be by a long, pining
   sickness. Some will be gradually dissolved by consumption. Well, you
   will glorify God by it! Those pale cheeks and that thin hand, through
   which the light will shine, will preach many a sermon on that sick bed.
   Or perhaps you will glorify God in some other fashion. You may have to
   die with bitter pangs of pain, but then, if the Lord cheers you and
   makes you patient, you will glorify God by that kind of death. You will
   look death calmly in the face, and not fret, and not be afraid. You
   will have to die somehow, unless the Lord, Himself, shall come and,
   blessed be His name, He will take you Home in a way that will somehow
   or other bring glory to His name, however it may be! So let us begin to
   rejoice in it even now.

   May God bless these words of mine and may many, here, be eternal
   monuments of the boundless, Sovereign Grace of God! And unto Him be
   Glory forever and ever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. JOHN 9:1-38.

   Verse 1. And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from his
   birth. The man could not see Jesus, but sight came to the man from
   Jesus. If there are any here who cannot look to Christ as yet, our
   prayer is that He may look on them as He looked on this blind man.

   2. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man,
   or his parents, that he was born blind? Beloved, if you had Christ with
   you, you could occupy your time better than in asking such questions as
   this! And I think that when we go to Holy Scripture, we can do better
   than pry into things of small practical importance, or even into great
   mysteries. However, in this case, since the disciples were liable to
   fall into grave error, our Lord gave them instruction upon the matter
   that perplexed them.

   3. Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but
   that the works of God should be made manifest in him. In other words,
   this man is not blind as the result of sin in himself, or in his
   parents. He is blind in order that God may have a platform for the
   display of His gracious power in healing him!

   4, 5. I must work the works of Him that sent Me, while it is day: the
   night comes, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am
   the Light of the world. Our Savior felt that He was commissioned as a
   Servant of His Father, sent here to do a certain work, and He must be
   doing it. It is well for God's servants to feel a holy compulsion--it
   does not take away from them the freedom of their action and their
   delight in the service of God--but exercises a powerful influence over
   a man when he feels, "Woe is me if I preach not the Gospel." Or when,
   like the Lord Jesus, he says, "I must work the works of Him that sent
   me." Did the Well-Beloved, the Prince of Heaven, come under compulsion?
   Did He put Himself under that, "must," which is for the King? Then you
   and I may well put ourselves under holy bondage for the Lord. There, do
   not hinder me! Do not tell me that I am too feeble in health--"I must
   work the works of Him that sent

   me."

   6, 7. When He had thus spoken, He spat on the ground and made clay of
   the spittle, and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
   and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by
   interpretation, Sent). He went his way therefore, and washed, and came
   seeing. Our Lord often works miracles without means and, sometimes,
   with means which appear to be quite inappropriate. It would seem to be
   more easy to blind a man with clay than to open his eyes with it! And
   there are some who assert that the Gospel plainly spoken would lead men
   into sin, but it does not. It is "the power of God unto salvation to
   everyone that believes." If you go to work in the name of God. If you
   put the clay on the sinner's eyes and bid him go and wash, you will see
   what will happen.

   8-11. The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that
   he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This
   is he: others said, he is like he. But he said, I am he. Therefore said
   they unto him, How were your eyes opened? He answered and said, A Man
   that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said unto me,
   Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I
   received sight. Does he not tell his story well? If he had not been a
   blind man whose eyes had just been opened, he would have exaggerated
   somewhere or other. I never heard a man tell a tale with absolute
   correctness--it is not the way of people--they are sure to put in some
   little item by way of garnishing, for there is a bump of romance in
   most men's heads. But this shrewd, strictly honest man tells the story
   briefly and leaves out no important particular.

   12-15. Then said they unto him, Where is He? He said, I know not. They
   brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. And it was the
   Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. Then again
   the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said
   unto them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see. That was
   short and sweet--and when you have to deal with Pharisees, do not give
   them much--they are not worth it and they are sure to misuse it! When
   he spoke to the common people, he enlarged and gave them details, but
   now that he comes to talk to these pragmatic professors, he cuts it
   down to as few words as possible.

   16. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This Man is not of God,
   because He keeps not the Sabbath day. Others said, How can a Man that
   is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. Yes,
   and there is always a division among the enemies of Christ--they cannot
   agree among themselves. If they could always lay their heads together
   and agree, they might have greater power, but the Edomites draw their
   swords against the children of Ammon, and they are sure to slay one
   another in the long run. There were also some among these Pharisees who
   had a conscience, men like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, and they
   asked, "How can a Man that is a sinner do such miracles?"

   17. They said unto the blind man again, What say you of Him, that He
   has opened your eyes? He said, He is a Prophet. He must be a Prophet.
   He could not have worked such a miracle as that if He had been a common
   man--"He said, He is a

   Prophet."

   18. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
   blind, and received his sight, until they called theparents of him that
   had received his sight. You see, John gives to the Pharisees the name
   which they arrogated to themselves--"we are Jews." But they were not
   true Jews. They called themselves Jews and so John speaks of them as
   "the Jews." It often happens that a certain clique or party will run
   away with a name which does not belong to them any more than it does to
   a great many who differ from them very widely. These Pharisees
   pretended that they would not believe the miracle. It was manifest
   before their eyes, but yet they would not believe it until they called
   his parents.

   19-21. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was
   born blind? How then does he now see? His parents answered them and
   said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: but by
   what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we
   know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. This was
   very shrewd on their part, but I think that I must add that it was very
   cowardly to throw all the testimony on their son. There are some
   parents who, if their children do right, if they follow Christ, seem to
   leave them to take care of themselves.

   22. These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for
   the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that He was
   Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Excommunicated--and they
   could not bear to be cut off from the respectable society which they
   had before enjoyed.

   23, 24. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. Then again
   called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the
   praise: we know that this Man is a sinner. Does it not sound pretty
   from their Pharisaic lips? Arch-hypocrites pretending to teach a man
   who knew much better than themselves! "We know that this Man is a
   sinner." You did not know it, but we know it and as we know it, and we
   are doctors, you must believe it.

   25. He answered and said, Whether He is a sinner or no, I know not: one
   thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. He could not be
   beaten out of that! You cannot argue a man out of an experience of this
   kind and, if the Lord Jesus Christ has ever opened your eyes, dear
   Friend, nobody can make you doubt that blessed fact!

   26, 27. Then said they to him again, What did He to you? How opened He
   your eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not
   hear: why would you hear it again? Will you also be His disciples? He
   threw a little sarcasm into that last question. The man was a very
   remarkable person--a simple-hearted, honest man--but quite able to hold
   his own in any company.

   28. Then they reviled him. It is a bad case, so abuse the plaintiff.
   There is nothing to be said for our side, so let us abuse the man who
   has had his eyes opened!

   28-30. And said, You are His disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. We
   know that God spoke unto Moses: as for this Fellow, we know not from
   where He is. The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a
   marvelous thing, that you know not from where He is, and yet He has
   opened my eyes. Does not that manifestation of miraculous power show
   where He must have come from? Could He have come from anywhere but from
   God?

   31-33. Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man is a
   worshipper of God, and does His will, him He hears. Since the world
   began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was
   born blind. If this man were not of God, He could do nothing. Well
   argued! The case is proven, indeed.

   34. They answered and said unto him, You were altogether born in sins,
   and do you teach, us? Cannot you hear them say it? "A blind beggar, who
   has just begun to see, 'Do you teach us?'--D.D.'s, men who are learned
   in the Law--'Do you teach us?'" Well, Brethren, if a man has only one
   eye, he may teach those who have not any, for the old proverb says, "In
   the realm of the blind, the man with one eye is king." Yet there is
   another proverb on this subject and that is, "In the realm of the
   blind, the man with one eye gets hanged." That was likely to be the
   case here--the blind Pharisees could not bear the man who could see! He
   knew too much for them.

   34-36. And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out;
   and when He had found him, He said unto him, Do you believe on the Son
   of God? He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on
   Him. He needed instruction. Christ may have done much for a man, but he
   may not, as yet, fully know the Lord. There may be some here, tonight,
   upon whom Christ has worked a great deal, and yet you do not know Him
   as you will know Him--"Do you believe on the Son of God?"

   37, 38. And Jesus said unto him, You have both seen Him, and it is He
   that talks with you. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped
   Him. That is the way with a genuine Believer--he worships Christ! Why?
   Because he believes Him to be God! It would be idolatry to worship
   Christ if He were only man! And Christ would have been an impostor if
   He had allowed this man to worship Him if he had not been God! But he
   was God and we, believing Him to be God, worship Christ as very God of
   very God, to whom be praise forever and ever! Amen.

Howling Changed To Singing

   (No. 2310)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, MAY 28, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY, EVENING,
   APRIL 28, 1889.

   "Howlong will You forget me, O LORD? Forever? How long will You hide
   Your face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having
   sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be exalted over
   me?...I wiil sing unto the LORD, because He has dealt bountifully with
   me." Psalm 13:1,2, 6.

   THIS is a very short Psalm, there are only six verses in it, but what a
   change there is between the beginning and the end of it! The first two
   verses are dolorous to the deepest degree, but the last verse is joyful
   to the highest degree. David begins many of his Psalms sighing and ends
   them singing, so that I do not wonder that Peter Moulin says, "One
   would think that those Psalms had been composed by two men of a
   contrary humor." If I were asked, "Are there two men here, or is there
   only one?" My answer would be that there is only one, but that one is
   two, for every man is two men, especially every spiritual man. He will
   find within himself an old man and a new man, an old nature and a new
   nature--and even the new nature, itself, is subject to strange
   changes--so that, like April weather, we have sunshine and showers
   blended. Sometimes it seems as if all the showers were poured on top of
   the sunshine and the sunshine, itself, were quenched and could scarcely
   gladden us.

   David was a wonderful man for changes of experience. God permitted him
   to go through many experiences, not so much for himself, as for the
   good of succeeding generations. Whenever you look into David's Psalms,
   you may somewhere or other see yourselves. You never get into a corner
   but you find David in that corner. I think that I was never so low that
   I could not find that David was lower--and I never climbed so high that
   I could not find that David was up above me, ready to sing his song
   upon his stringed instrument, even as I could sing mine! These are two
   instantaneous photographs. The first one gives us the man complaining,
   the second one gives us the man rejoicing. I wonder whether we shall
   get two such photographs, tonight--some sitting here complaining, who,
   before the service is over, will go their way rejoicing? God grant that
   it may be so!

   Possibly somebody here says, "I do not understand what you mean by each
   man being two men." Well, let me say a little more on that point. Every
   man is a mystery. He is a mystery to other people, but, if he ever
   thinks, he is a great mystery to himself! And, if he never does think,
   why then, I think that he is a mystery, indeed, that he should have
   such a wondrous faculty as the power of thought, and yet should let it
   lie idle! He who does not study himself may think that he understands
   himself, but it is the judgment of folly. He who has been accustomed to
   make a friend of himself and has had himself for his companion, and
   talked to himself, and cross-examined himself, is the man who will say,
   "I am puzzled. I cannot make myself out. I am often at my wits' end. I
   am such a strange mixture, and so dreadfully changeable."

   You must know yourself, dear Friend, in some measure, or else I am
   afraid that you will never know the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you do
   not know Him, then you do not know what eternal life means, for to know
   Him is eternal life! But why is it necessary for us to know ourselves,
   that we may know Christ? You must have some knowledge of the disease
   that you may know what the Physician can do--and there is also this
   Truth of God to be remembered--the Lord Jesus Christ is the model Man
   and only by knowing something about men do we know much about Him. Is
   it not strange that the Psalms are often so written that you do not
   know whether David is writing about himself or about the Lord Jesus?
   One verse can only be applied to Christ and you are certain that David
   is writing of the Messiah, but the next verse you can hardly apply to
   Christ, for there are some terms in it which would be derogatory to the
   Lord Jesus Christ, so it must refer to David. The fact is that there is
   a wonderful union between David and David's Lord--there is a marvelous
   union be-

   tween the saint and his Savior, between the Believer and Him in whom he
   believes--and you cannot always tell where one begins and the other
   ends.

   So, if you have no knowledge of man, it is to be feared that you have
   no knowledge of that Son of Man, the Man of men, the Savior of men, the
   First-Born among many brethren, to whose likeness we are yet to be
   fully conformed. I invite anybody here who has not yet known the
   Savior, to pray to God to make him know himself. It may be that the
   discovery of what you are will necessitate your discovering what Christ
   is! A true estimate of your own poverty may compel you to resort to Him
   for wealth. A true sight of your own disease may force you to apply to
   Him for His all-healing medicine. Certainly it is to be urged upon you
   by the highest of motives that you do not, with all your understanding,
   forget to understand yourself and that, while you have many books on
   your shelf, you do not read them so as to forget this Book which lies
   within, this wonderful Book which concerns you more than all the
   writings of men, the Book of your own nature, your own needs, your own
   desires, your own changes! God make you familiar with them and then
   make you also familiar with the Book of Grace which is written in the
   life of the Son of Man!

   Now, with that as a preface, I invite you to the study of our text.

   First, you will see, in the first two verses, a man complaining. Go
   three verses farther on and you will get to a man singing, about whom
   we will talk in the second place. And then we shall close our discourse
   tonight by asking, What are the connecting links between the man
   complaining and the man singing? How did this complaining man get up to
   concert pitch and begin to sing before he had gone more than a little
   way further on the road?

   I. First, then, here is A MAN COMPLAINING.

   Pardon me if I say that here is a man howling. Let me read the first
   two verses again--"How long will You forget me, O Lord? Forever? How
   long will You hide Your face from me? How long shall I take counsel in
   my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be
   exalted over me?" Said I not truly, when I called it howling? There is
   so much of complaining here, so much of questioning--"How long? How
   long? How long? How long?"--four times over, that we may call it, as
   David did once call his prayer--"the voice of my roaring." It is a kind
   of howling, roaring, moaning complaint before God in the bitterness of
   his soul. Let us take these four, "How longs?" and speak of them.

   Here is, first, the poor man's grief, as it seems to him--"How long
   will You forget me, O Lord? Forever?" Think for a minute. Can God
   forget? Can Omnipotence forget? Can unchanging love forget? Can
   infinite faithfulness forget? Yet so it seems to David. So it has often
   seemed to men in the deepest of trouble. "How long will You forget me?"
   You have been praying for mercy and you cannot find it--and you think
   that God forgets. You have been, perhaps, a seeker after peace for
   years, and yet you have not found it, and you think that God forgets.
   Or, perhaps, years ago, you were one of the happiest of the happy and
   you bathed in the light of God's Countenance. But now you are the
   unhappiest of the unhappy, you are at a distance from your God, you
   have been trying to get back and cannot get back, and you think that
   God forgets you. Or else wave upon wave of trouble has rolled over
   you--you have hardly had time to breathe between the surges of your
   grief. You are ready to perish with despondency and you think that God
   forgets you! That is how it looks to you, but it is not so, and cannot
   be so.

   God cannot forget anything, it is impossible! "Can a woman forget her
   sucking child?" Mark that expression, the child that still draws its
   nourishment from her bosom. That is just what you are still doing, for,
   albeit you think that God forgets you, you are still living on what He
   daily gives you and you would die if He did not give you of His Grace
   and strength. "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
   not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget, yet
   will I not forget you." Lay hold of that great Truth of God and dismiss
   that which can be only an appearance and an error. God has not
   forgotten to be gracious, nor has He forgotten you.

   The next, "How long?" the next piece of David's howling, represents his
   trouble as it really is. "How long will You hide Your face from me?"
   That is as it really is with some of you--God has hidden His face from
   you--not His heart, nor His mind. He has not forgotten you, but He has
   taken away from you the comfort of His smile. Are you crying, tonight,
   "Lord, how long will You hide Your face from me?" I am glad you cry
   about it! The ungodly do not cry for God's face to be revealed to
   them--they wish that God would always hide His face from them. They do
   not want either His face or His favor. But if you are longing to see
   His face, it is because that face is full of love to you. I do not
   wonder that you are unhappy if you have lost the light of God's
   Countenance, for he who has ever had it, cannot lose it, no, not for a
   moment, without feeling his heart ready to break!

   "There are many who say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift up the
   light of Your Countenance upon us." Only give us to know that You love
   us and we will not envy the man who owns the greatest estate, or enjoys
   the highest degree of human applause. This is enough for us, to have
   God with us! Oh, dear child of God, if you have lost the light of your
   Father's Countenance, and you sigh after it, you shall have it, again!
   You shall have it very soon! By the degree of your longing, you may
   measure the length of His absence. If you long but little, He will be
   absent long, but if you long much, He will come to you soon. You will
   soon find that the hidings of His face are over and the light of His
   Countenance is once again your joy.

   This is what the trouble really is and a great trouble it is while it
   lasts, though it works for your good. What plants would grow if it were
   always day? Does not night make them grow as well as day? Brothers and
   Sisters, if we always had fine weather, should we ever have a harvest
   at all? The Arabs have a proverb, "All sun makes the desert." If there
   is no rain, how can there be verdure? There is a ripeness given to the
   fruits by the moon as well as by the sun. Grieve when God hides His
   face from you, but do not despair as well as grieve, but believe that
   even in this, He still loves you. It is a face of love that you do not
   see. You believe that, yourself, or else you would not wish to see it.
   If it were a face of wrath, you would not be longing to see it again.
   It is a face of love that is hidden from you. Therefore, be of good
   courage, you shall see it, by-and-by.

   Notice next, that we have the man's sorrow as it is within himself.
   "How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart
   daily?" He talks to himself! That is the counsel he takes with himself
   and he does not get any very great help out of that. It is a mark of
   wisdom to talk with yourselves, sometimes, but not if you make yourself
   your own oracle. A man may talk to himself until he talks himself into
   despair, though there is a way of talking with yourself that will talk
   you up into the Light of God, such as David used when he said, "Why are
   you cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted in me? Hope you in
   God." That is the way to talk to yourself! But yet, as a rule, there is
   not much good comes of talking to yourself unless there is a third One
   present--that blessed One who can construe what self may say in
   mystery--and set right what self might twist into error. Oh, yes, I
   know some who pour out their hearts within them!

   Do you remember what David says in the 42nd Psalm? "I pour out my soul
   in me." Now, if it were possible to pour the contents of a jug of water
   out into itself, the water would be there, all the same, would it not?
   That is a grand passage where David says, "You people, pour out your
   heart before Him: God is a refuge for us." Take your pitcher and turn
   it bottom upwards, and let the contents all run out. That is a true
   easement. To pour out from itself into itself is a poor change. To pour
   it out before God is to find instant relief. Beloved, it may be that
   you cannot get any relief and that daily, from morning until evening,
   you are still in a fret and a trouble. Well, that is the case with
   David, here--and my text is a photograph of you!

   And, once more, the fourth, "How long?" shows the man's sorrow as it is
   without Him. "How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?" It adds very
   much to a man's grief when somebody from the outside says, "Oh, you are
   always miserable! It makes anybody wretched to be near you." It was
   thus when Peninnah exulted over Hannah's barrenness and "provoked her
   sorely, to make her fret." It happens to many Christians to have this
   sort of thing done by somebody, especially a very "candid friend." A
   candid friend is only an enemy candied over with a little sugar, as a
   general rule, and one who takes the opportunity to say nastier things
   than a downright enemy would say. You may have some such person in your
   family. Above all, there is our great adversary, from whom may God
   deliver us, who also delights to triumph and exult over us whenever he
   can!

   And so our trouble outside is that Satan and his allies exult over us
   and we have not yet learned to say, as we ought to say, "Rejoice not
   against me, O my enemy, when I fall, I shall arise." That last touch
   may, perhaps, make the photograph depict somebody here who said, "I do
   not think that I shall see my portrait tonight. I have been roaming
   about and got into great trouble, and I am one by myself." Well, but
   here is David, who is with you, and David's Lord is with you, too!

   That is the first photograph--a man complaining.

   II. I am glad to pass from the first view and bring on the second one.
   The second picture of the same person is found in the sixth verse,
   where we see A MAN SINGING--"I will sing unto the Lord, because He has
   dealt bountifully with

   me."

   It is the same man that we saw before, but he has done with his howling
   and has taken to singing, for, first, his heart is rejoicing. Read the
   fifth verse. He says, "My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation." It is
   not merely the appearance of joy--it is real joy--his heart is
   rejoicing! Have you never seen a friend who has been suddenly lifted up
   by the Spirit of God out of great mourning and of whom you have said,
   "Well, I should not have known that it was the same person"? Grief
   throws a peculiar cast over the human countenance. Well do I remember,
   as a child, a lady who used to come to my grandfather's house, whose
   face was terrible to look upon and when I asked who that sad lady was,
   they said, "Hush, child," and they made me hold my tongue until she was
   gone. And then they told me that she was one who thought that she had
   committed the unpardonable sin. I do not know what it was that struck
   me, but there was something about her face which has never gone from my
   memory, though it must be pretty well 50 years ago that I saw her.

   But when a person is full ofjoy, especially spiritual joy, have you
   ever noticed what a kind of transfiguration the face undergoes? You
   have been, yourself, to have your photograph taken, and the man places
   an iron clamp at the back of your neck and you go away, directly, I
   mean that you do. Your body stands there, but you, yourself, go
   traveling down the rod of iron, and you are not there at all, and the
   likeness is not yourself--it is your chrysalis, the case in which you
   used to be, but you are gone! Well, now, when you have joy in your
   heart, really in your heart so that everybody can see it on your
   countenance, your eyes begin to sparkle and your whole face is lit up,
   so that people say, "Well, really, he is only an ordinary-looking
   person as a general rule, but when he is in that state of mind, there
   is a wonderful kind of beauty about him!"

   Now, the Lord can work that change for some of you, so that when you go
   home, mother will say, "Why, Maria, you are quite different from what
   you were when you went to the Tabernacle! John, how changed you are!
   You went so dull and heavy, but now you seem to be quite another
   person." Yes, the secret is that it is with him as it was with
   David--his heart is rejoicing!

   The next thing is that his tongue is praising. "I will sing unto the
   Lord." That which is down in the well will come up in the bucket. That
   which is in the heart is sure to come up to the mouth before long--so
   the happy Believer begins to sing and, very likely, he breaks out with
   the children's hymn--

   "I feel like singing all the time, My tears are wiped away For Jesus is
   a Friend of mine, I'll serve Him every day."

   You may try, perhaps, to repress your emotion, but if the Lord has
   really brought you up out of the horrible pit, such as I have been
   describing, your emotion will not be altogether repressed. You will
   feel as if, should you hold your peace, the very stones would begin to
   cry out! A rejoicing heart soon makes a praising tongue!

   Notice, next, that the man's judgment is content. That cool,
   calculating faculty now begins to read God's dealings, and it comes to
   a very different conclusion from that which it arrived at before. Some
   of you used to learn, as children, a book called, "Why, and
   Because"--and it is a good thing to have a, "why, and because," for
   your own feelings. Now, says David, "I will sing unto the Lord,
   because, after weighing and judging the matter thoroughly, I can
   testify that He has dealt bountifully with me. I thought that He had
   forgotten me, but He has dealt bountifully with me. I thought that He
   had hidden His face from me, but He has dealt bountifully with me. I
   said in my heart that He treats me very harshly, but I take all such
   language back, Lord! I eat my own words with bitter herbs and I regret
   that I should ever have used them! You have dealt bountifully with me."
   "Return unto your rest, O my Soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully
   with you." This poor man who thought that he was forgotten, now looks
   at the food which God has put upon his table and he finds that he has
   Benjamin's portion--much more than was given to the rest of his
   brothers--and his verdict is totally changed, now, as to the dealings
   of the Lord with him. He, says, "You prepare a table before me in the
   presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.
   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and
   I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

   And now that his judgment has been set right, now that heart, tongue,
   judgement--all are right--his resolve is right, for he says, "I will
   sing unto the Lord." "Not only am I singing now, but I will make up my
   mind to this, I have been sighing long enough, I will now sing. I have
   been groaning and complaining, now I will sing! I will sing unto the
   Lord." I like this resolve, for it relates not only to present joy, but
   it is a resolution to project that joy throughout the whole of his
   life. "I will sing unto the Lord." I trust that some of you will go out
   of the Tabernacle, tonight, saying,

   "Well, I will sing. Yes, I will. God helping me, I will. I will sing
   unto the Lord. I will sing at my work. I will sing on my bed. I will
   sing when I wake in the morning. I will sing when I go to bed at night.
   The Lord has put a new song into my mouth and I cannot keep it there--I
   must sing it out. I must sing His praises." I am sure we will not try
   to stop you! We will encourage you to sing unto the Lord as much as
   possible.

   There is not half enough singing in the world. The music of the early
   mornings in the country, at this time of the year, always seems to
   chide me. The birds are up and they wake us up, and when they are up,
   the first thing they do is to sing! And there is a kind of contention
   among them, each one tries to sing the most sweetly and the most
   loudly. And one calls to another and the other answers him. They sing
   as they fly and they sing as they build their nests! And they make such
   a wonderful chorus of song that it often astonishes us that such little
   creatures can make such cataracts, such Niagara of music as they pour
   forth from their tiny throats! Oh, that God's people would sing more! I
   remember a servant who used to sing while she was at the washtub. Her
   mistress said to her, "Why, Jane, how is it that you are always
   singing?" She said, "It keeps bad thoughts away." I remember an old
   Methodist Brother who was pretty nearly eighty, and I never came across
   him, as he went along the street at a rather slow pace, without hearing
   him toot-tooting little bits of tunes as he walked. If you went by his
   door and heard a noise in his house, it was the old man singing! He
   never seemed to make any other noise but that of praising and blessing
   God. Oh, that we might do so continually!--

   "Sing a hymn to Jesus,

   When the heart is faint!

   Tell it all to Jesus,

   Comfort or complaint,"

   and, when you have done that, sing another! And when you have finished
   that, sing another! Whether it is a hymn of comfort or complaint, still
   sing to the praise of His name and make this your resolution as you go
   out tonight, "I will sing unto the Lord, my God, as long as I live."

   There are the two photographs. Put them into your album and take care
   of them.

   III. But how came this change to take place? What are THE CONNECTING
   LINKS BETWEEN THE MAN COMPLAINING AND THE MAN SINGING? How did No. 1
   get to be No. 2? How did this howler become a singer? What

   process did he pass through?

   If you read this 13th Psalm over again when you get home, you will
   notice that the first thing David did was, he pleaded with God. He
   stated his case to the Lord. He mentioned the separate particulars of
   it and then he pleaded, "Consider and hear me, O Jehovah, my God:
   lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death." For you, mourners,
   the first step towards comfort is to go and take the matter to your
   God. You have Rabshakeh's letter in your pocket--it is a dreadful
   letter, enough to make you sad. While I have been preaching, you have
   been sighing to yourself, "Ah, me! When I get home, I shall be thinking
   about that letter. I shall be awake thinking of it." Some of you, who
   are rather of a nervous temperament, will let some little thing keep
   boring into you like an awl. You cannot get away from it.

   Now, I invite you to take that letter out of your pocket when you get
   home and spread it before the Lord. Many and many a time I have had
   great troubles--who can be the pastor of such a Church without them? I
   have done my very best with the matter that has perplexed me and I have
   only made it worse and, at last, I have laid it before the Lord and
   prayed over it. And in such cases I have always said to myself, "I will
   never have anything to do with that matter again; I have done with it."
   I advise you to do the same. Cast your burden upon the Lord! Put it
   upon that shelf. But then if you take it down, again, what good have
   you done? No, leave it there! Leave it there and have done with it! The
   Lord will bring you out of the difficulty when you clear yourself of
   it. Do not go on hugging your trouble--take it to the Lord in prayer!

   If you have a solicitor and there is a suit at law, and the person
   against whom the suit is laid comes to you and says, "I want to hear
   what you are going to do," do not say anything to him, except, "I have
   left that with my solicitor. You must be so good as to see him. I refer
   you to him." If there are two of you to manage the business, one will
   be a fool and I think I know who that one will be! Either do not have a
   solicitor, and be your own lawyer, or else, if you have somebody to
   attend to the suit for you, let him do it! Why keep dogs and bark,
   yourself? So let it be in all things. If you lay the matter before God,
   then do not begin to take it on your own back, as well. That will be an
   absurdity!

   Although I made you smile, just now, by quoting an old proverb, I do
   seriously urge upon you, my Friends, the impropriety of attempting to
   undertake a case which you have laid before God in prayer. Leave it
   there. If you have done

   so, let your Advocate see you through with the business. Come, Beloved,
   you shall soon begin to change your mode of talking if you will go and
   tell your trouble to God, straight away. "Well, I shall see my brother,
   tomorrow." Do not see your brother--go and see your Father! "Oh, but I
   want to call in a friend!" That is what I want you to do, but not the
   friend you are thinking of--call in the Friend of Friends! Tell Him
   everything about your trouble and your difficulty and when you have
   done that, have done with it and leave it with Him. You will, then,
   soon begin to sing.

   The next thing is that David, having prayed and brought his cause
   before God, trusted in the Lord. This is the chief point. Read the 5th
   verse and you will see that the whole story is made plain--"I have
   trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation." I
   seem as if I could leave all you troubled saints, now, just to say to
   any sinner here who is in deep soul trouble, what you have said to
   yourself, "That first photograph was very like me. I cannot say that I
   am at all like the second one." No, but you will be like that second
   one if you will, from your heart, say this, "I have trusted in Your
   mercy." This is the remedy for the disease of sin and for the disease
   of the heart--trust Jesus! There He hangs on yonder Cross. Trust Him!
   "I cannot realize that He is mine," you say. Did I tell you to realize
   that? Trust Him! "Oh, but I do not feel as if I had a good heart to
   bring to Him." Did I tell you to bring Him anything? Trust Him! Trust
   Him! Trust Him! Oh, child of God, this is the lesson you need to
   learn--TRUST! Oh, old sinner, this is the essential lesson for you if
   you would enter into Light of God and peace--TRUST!

   "I have so many sins." TRUST! "But I have such tendencies to sin."
   Trust Him to overcome those tendencies. "But I have tried." No, I did
   not say, try, but TRUST. "But I, I, I will try." No, do not try. I did
   not say, try. "Sir, I was going to say I will try to trust." I did not
   say try to trust! Trying to trust is the very reverse of trusting! If
   Christ is a liar, do not trust Him. If He is true, trust Him. If He
   cannot save you, do not trust Him, but as He is the Almighty Savior,
   trust Him. Oh, that I could shout that word loud as a thousand thunders
   speaking at once, TRUST! O Soul, the way of the Law is OBEY--a hard
   word, with which you cannot comply, for you are too weak. But the
   Gospel way is trust, trust, TRUST! When you have learned that way, you
   shall afterwards learn how to obey and you shall obey through trusting!
   But the first thing is, trust! Is your leg broken, so that you can not
   walk? Lean on Him who can carry you. Have you a great weight? Lean
   hard, then. Is it greater than ever it was? Lean harder, then! Trust,
   implicitly trust! As the blind man puts his hand into the hand of him
   who can see, that he may lead him, so trust in Jesus. Put your hand
   into the hand of Him who was crucified and trust Him tonight.

   There, you may put away that first photograph. You may sit down, now,
   if you have trusted, and we will take your likeness again, and I am
   sure your likeness will agree with the 6th verse, and you will say, "I
   will sing unto the Lord; I will go home singing! I have trusted. I have
   found salvation!" Lord, lead these people to trust You! Why can they
   not trust You? What have You ever done that they should doubt You? Lord
   Jesus, if I had a million souls, I would trust them all with You, fully
   persuaded that You could wash them all whiter than snow! Trust, then,
   beloved Friends! Trust Jesus. God help you to trust, for Christ's sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. PSALMS 12,13,14.

   Psalm 12:1. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail
   from among the children of men. One might have thought that David still
   lived among us, his cry is so timely, so exactly true to the position
   of affairs today. What a prayer he offers! Driven away from confidence
   in men, be cries, "Help, Lord! You mighty One, put forth Your power!
   You faithful One, display Your Truth! 'Help, Lord; for the godly man
   ceases; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.'"

   2. They speak vanity, every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips
   and with a double heart do they speak. They speak vanity. There is
   nothing in it. It is all froth, no reality. Vain speech about vain
   subjects, having no real spiritual power to help the man that
   hears--"They speak vanity." "With a double heart do they speak," saying
   one thing and meaning an-other--trifling with words, orthodox to the
   ear--heterodox to the heart. Oh, how much there is of this falseness in
   these days! Still are there many who "speak with flattering lips and
   with a double heart." It is some comfort to us to know that no new
   thing has happened to us--we are merely going through an old part of
   the road which David traversed long ago.

   3, 4. The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
   speaks proud things: who have said, With our tongue will we prevail;
   our lips are our own: who is lord over us? There is the point in
   dispute! Man will be lord of himself and God will be Lord of all and
   everything--and there can be no compromise between these two. Not even
   a man's lips are really his own. Who gave the gift of speech? Who
   created the mouth? Who is LORD over us? Why, the answer is simple
   enough! He that made us, He that redeemed us, He should be Lord over
   us. Let us willingly put ourselves in subjection to Him.

   5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
   will I arise, says the LORD. God takes notice of the oppression of poor
   men and, especially, of poor saints when they are tried by the
   wickedness of the age--"Now will I arise, says the Lord."

   5, 6. I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him. The Words of
   the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth,
   purified seven times. There is no mistake about the words of this
   blessed Book. The very Words, themselves, are as accurate, as
   Infallible, as silver is pure when it has been refined seven times by
   the most skillful artist. There is no improving upon God's Words. We
   dare not leave one of them out. We would not presume to put one of our
   own side by side with them--"The Words of the Lord are pure words: as
   silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times."

   7, 8. You shall keep them, O LORD, You shall preserve them from this
   generation forever. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men
   are exalted. When sin gets into the high places of the earth, then it
   becomes very abundant. Every evil man takes liberty to creep out into
   public life when some great leader in vice occupies the throne. God
   save the people when such is the case!

   Psalm 13:1, 2. How long will You forget me, O LORD? Forever? How long
   will You hide Your face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my
   soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be
   exalted over me? When you and I have to spread our complaints before
   God, we are not the first who have done so. When we complain of God's
   forsaking us, we are not alone. There was a greater than David who,
   even in the article of death, cried, "My God, My God, why have You
   forsaken Me?"

   3, Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep
   the sleep of death. When it is dark, very dark, we get drowsy. Sorrow
   induces sleep. Remember how the Savior found the disciples sleeping for
   sorrow? Therefore David asks for light. Light will help him to stay
   awake and he fears to sleep, so he prays, "Lighten my eyes, lest I
   sleep the sleep of death."

   4, 5. Lest my enemy says, I have prevailed against him; and these that
   trouble me rejoice when I am moved. But. What a precious, "but," this
   is! You can hear the chain rattle as the anchor goes down to hold the
   vessel!

   5, 6. I have trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in Your
   salvation. I will sing unto the LORD, because He has dealt bountifully
   with me. What a climb there is, in this Psalm, from the abyss of sorrow
   up to the summit of joy! "I will sing unto the Lord because He has
   dealt bountifully with me." I hope many of us know what this blessed
   change means. If any of you are in great sorrow, tonight, may my Lord
   and Master lighten your eyes!

   Psalm 14:1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. He was a
   fool to think it. He was not fool enough, however, to say it except in
   his heart. Fools have grown more brazen-faced of late, for now they not
   only say it in their hearts, but they say with their tongues, "There is
   no God." Oh, no, I have made a mistake! They do not call them, "fools,"
   now--they call them "philosophers." That, however, is often exactly the
   same thing!

   1. They are corrupt, It is always so. When they will have no God, they
   will have no goodness "They are corrupt." That is the secret of
   infidelity. The Psalmist has put his finger on it--"They are corrupt."

   1, 2. They have done abominable works, there is none that does good.
   The LORD looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to see if
   there were any that did understand, and seek God. David represents God
   looking from the battlements of Heaven upon our fallen humanity and, at
   the time when He looked, He could see none that understood Him, or
   sought Him. By nature we are all in this condition. Until the Grace of
   God seeks us, we never seek God. Even God looked in vain. He was no
   stern critic--He was no hypercritic--"The Lord looked down from Heaven
   upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand,
   and seek God."

   3. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there
   is none that does good, no, not one. "That was in old Testament times,"
   says one. If you turn to the Epistle to the Romans, you will find that
   Paul quotes it as being true in his day. It is always true and it
   always will be true, apart from the Grace of God--"There is none that
   does good; no, not

   one."

   4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? Are they all so
   foolish?

   4. Who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
   They think nothing of God's people. They could swallow them at a
   mouthful, they so despise them. Notice, that whenever a man despises
   God, he soon despises God's people--it is only natural that he should
   do so. Meanwhile, he, himself, will not call upon the Lord.

   5. There were they in great fear. What? These very people who would not
   call upon God? Were they in great fear? Yes, God can bring great fear
   upon the men who seem most bold. It is noticed that the boldest
   blasphemers, when they become ill, are generally the most timid
   persons. These are the people who begin to cry and give up what they
   boasted of, when they get into deep waters--"There were they in great
   fear."

   5. For God is in the generation of the righteous. He is with His
   people. He always will be with His people and when He makes bare His
   arm, fear takes possession of His enemies.

   6. You have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his
   refuge. They mocked at the idea of a man's trusting in God for his
   daily bread, or trusting in God for his eternal salvation, but, mock as
   men may, there is no other refuge for a soul but God! When the floods
   are out, there is no safety but in the ark with God. Oh, that men would
   trust in Him!

   7. Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When the LORD
   brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and
   Israel shall be glad. May that time soon come! Amen.

Our Lord's Last Cry from the Cross

   (No. 2311)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 4, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITATN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   9, 1889.

   "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said, Father, into Your
   hands I commend My spirit: and having said this, He gave up the ghost."
   Luke 23:46.

   THESE were the dying words of our Lord Jesus Christ, "Father, into Your
   hands I commend My spirit." It may be instructive if I remind you that
   the Words of Christ upon the Cross were seven. Calling each of His
   cries, or utterances, by the title of a Word, we speak of the seven
   last Words of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let me rehearse them in your
   hearing. The first, when they nailed Him to the Cross, was, "Father,
   forgive them; for they know not what they do." Luke has preserved that
   Word. Later, when one of the two thieves said to Jesus, "Lord, remember
   me when You come into Your Kingdom," Jesus said to him, "Verily I say
   unto you, Today shall you be with Me in Paradise." This, also, Luke has
   carefully preserved. Farther on, our Lord, in His great agony, saw His
   mother, with breaking heart, standing by the Cross and looking up to
   Him with unutterable love and grief, and He said to her, "Woman,
   behold. your son!" and to the beloved Apostle, "Behold your mother!"
   and thus He provided a home for her when He, Himself, should be gone
   away. This utterance has only been preserved by John.

   The fourth and central Word of the seven was, "Eloi, Eloi, Lama,
   Sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, My God, why have
   You forsaken Me?" This was the culmination of His grief, the central
   point of all His agony. That most awful word that ever fell from the
   lips of man, expressing the quintessence of exceeding agony, is well
   put fourth, as though it had need of three words before it, and three
   words after it, as its bodyguard. It tells of a good Man, a son of God,
   the Son of God, forsaken of His God! That central Word of the seven is
   found in Matthew and in Mark, but not in Luke or John.

   But the fifth Word has been preserved by John, that is, "I thirst," the
   shortest, but not quite the sharpest of all the Master's Words, though
   under a bodily aspect, perhaps the sharpest of them all. John has also
   treasured up another very precious saying of Jesus Christ on the Cross,
   that is the wondrous Word, "It is finished." This was the last word but
   one, "It is finished," the gathering up of all His lifework, for He had
   loft nothing undone, no thread was left raveling, the whole fabric of
   Redemption had been woven, like His garment, from the top throughout,
   and it was finished to perfection! After He had said, "It is finished,"
   He uttered the last Word of all, "Father, into Your hands I commend My
   spirit," which I have taken for a text, tonight, but to which I will
   not come immediately.

   There has been a great deal said about these seven cries from the Cross
   by many writers and though I have read what many of them have written,
   I cannot add anything to what they have said, since they have delighted
   to dwell upon these seven last cries, and here the most ancient
   writers, of what would be called the Romish school, are not to be
   excelled, even by Protestants, in their intense devotion to every
   letter of our Savior's dying Words. And they sometimes strike out new
   meanings, richer and more rare than any that have occurred to the far
   cooler minds of modern critics, who are, as a rule, greatly blessed
   with moles' eyes, able to see where there is nothing to be seen, but
   never able to see when there is anything worth seeing! Modern
   criticism, like modern theology, if it were put in the Garden of Eden,
   would not see a flower. It is like the sirocco that blasts and burns.
   It is without either dew or unction, in fact, it is the very opposite
   of these precious things, and proves itself to be unblessed of God and
   unblessed to men.

   Now concerning these seven cries from the Cross, many authors have
   drawn from them, lessons concerning seven duties. Listen. When our Lord
   said, "Father, forgive them," in effect, He said to us, "Forgive your
   enemies." Even when

   they despitefully use you and put you to terrible pain, be ready to
   pardon them! Be like the sandalwood tree which perfumes the axe that
   fells it. Be all gentleness, kindness and love--and be this your
   prayer, "Father, forgive them."

   The next duty is taken from the second cry, namely, that of penitence
   and faith in Christ, for He said to the dying thief, "Today shall you
   be with Me in Paradise." Have you, like he, confessed your sin? Have
   you his faith and his prayer-fulness? Then you shall be accepted even
   as he was! Learn, then, from the second cry, the duty of penitence and
   faith.

   When our Lord, in the third cry, said to His mother, "Woman, behold
   your son!" He taught us the duty of filial love. No Christian must ever
   be short of love to his mother, his father, or to any of those who are
   endeared to him by relationships which God has appointed for us to
   observe. Oh, by the dying love of Christ to His mother, let no man here
   unman himself by forgetting his mother! She bore you--bear her in her
   old age and lovingly cherish her even to the last.

   Jesus Christ's fourth cry teaches us the duty of clinging to God and
   trusting in God--"My God, my God." See how, with both hands, He takes
   hold of Him--"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" He cannot bear
   to be left of God. All else causes Him but little pain compared with
   the anguish of being forsaken of His God. So learn to cling to God, to
   grip Him with a double-handed faith, and if you do ever think that He
   has forsaken you, cry after Him, and say, "Show me why You contend with
   me, for I cannot bear to be without You."

   The fifth cry, "I thirst," teaches us to set a high value upon the
   fulfillment of God's Word. "After this, Jesus knowing that all things
   were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I
   thirst." Take good heed, in all your grief and weakness, to still
   preserve the Word of your God, and to obey the precept. Learn the
   doctrine and delight in the promise. As your Lord, in His great anguish
   said, "I thirst," because it was written that so He would speak, have
   regard unto the Word of the Lord even in little things!

   That sixth cry, "It is finished," teaches us perfect obedience. Go
   through with your keeping of God's Commandments. Leave out no Command,
   keep on obeying till you can say, "It is finished." Work your lifework,
   obey your Master, suffer or serve according to His will, but rest not
   till you can say with your Lord, "It is finished." "I have finished the
   work which You gave Me to do."

   And that last Word, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit,"
   teaches us resignation. Yield all things. Yield up even your spirit to
   God at His bidding. Stand still and make a full surrender to the Lord,
   and let this be your watchword from the first even to the last, "Into
   Your hands, my Father, I commend my spirit." I think that this study of
   Christ's last Words should interest you, therefore let me linger a
   little longer upon it. Those seven cries from the Cross also teach us
   something about the attributes and offices of our Master. They are
   seven windows of agate and gates of carbuncle through which you may see
   Him and approach Him.

   First, would you see Him as Intercessor? Then He cries, "Father,
   forgive them; for they know not what they do." Would you look at Him as
   King? Then hear His second Word, "Verily I say unto you, Today shall
   you be with Me in Paradise." Would you mark Him as a tender Guardian?
   Hear Him say to Mary, "Woman, behold your son!" And to John, "Behold
   your mother!" Would you peer into the dark abyss of the agonies of His
   soul? Hear Him cry, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" Would
   you understand the reality and the intensity of His bodily sufferings?
   Then hear Him say, "I thirst," for there is something exquisite in the
   torture of thirst when brought on by the fever of bleeding wounds. Men
   on the battlefield who have lost much blood, are devoured with thirst,
   and tell you that it is the worst pang of all. "I thirst," says Jesus.
   See the Sufferer in the body and understand how He can sympathize with
   you who suffer, since He suffered so much on the Cross. Would you see
   Him as the Finisher of your salvation? Then hear His cry, "Con-summatum
   est"--"It is finished." Oh, glorious note! Here you see the blessed
   Finisher of your faith! And would you then take one more gaze and
   understand how voluntary was His suffering? Then hear Him say, not as
   one who is robbed of life, but as one who takes His soul and hands it
   over to the keeping of another, "Father, into Your hands I commend My
   spirit."

   Is there not much to be learned from these cries from the Cross? Surely
   these seven notes make a wondrous scale of music if we do but know how
   to listen to them! Let me run up the scale, again. Here, first, you
   have Christ's fellowship with men--"Father, forgive them." He stands
   side by side with sinners and tries to make an apology for them--"They
   know not what they do." Here is, next, His kingly power. He sets open
   Heaven's gate to the dying thief and bids him enter. "Today shall you
   be with Me in Paradise." Thirdly, behold His human relationship. How
   near of kin He is to us! "Woman, behold your son!" Remember how He
   says, "Whoever shall do the will of My Father who is in Heaven, the

   same is My brother, and sister, and mother." He is bone of our bone and
   flesh of our flesh. He belongs to the Human family. He is more of a Man
   than any man! As surely as He is very God of very God, He is also very
   Man of very man, taking into Himself the Nature, not of the Jew only,
   but of the Gentile, too. Belonging to His own nationality, but rising
   above all, He is the Man of men, the Son of Man.

   See, next, His taking our sin. You say, "Which note is that" Well, they
   are all to that effect, but this one, chiefly, "My God, My God, why
   have You forsaken Me?" It was because He bore our sins in His own body
   on the tree that He was forsaken of God. "He has made Him to be sin for
   us. who knew no sin," and hence the bitter cry, "Eloi, Eloi, Lama
   Sabachthani?" Behold Him, in that fifth cry, "I thirst," taking not
   only our sin, but also our infirmity--and all the suffering of our
   bodily nature. Then, if you would see His fullness as well as His
   weakness, if you would see His All-Sufficiency as well as His sorrow,
   hear Him cry, "It is finished." What a wonderful fullness there is in
   that note! Redemption is all accomplished! It is all complete! It is
   all perfect! There is nothing left, not a drop of bitterness in the cup
   of gall--Jesus has drained it dry! There is not a farthing to be added
   to the ransom price--Jesus has paid it all! Behold His fullness in the
   cry, "It is finished." And then, if you would see how He has reconciled
   us to Himself, behold Him, the Man who was made a curse for us,
   returning with a blessing to His Father and taking us with Him, as He
   draws us all up by that last dear word, "Father, into Your hands I
   commend My spirit."--

   "Now both the Surety and sinner are free." Christ goes back to the
   Father, for, "It is finished," and you and I come to the Father through
   His perfect work!

   I have only practiced two or three tunes that can be played upon this
   harp, but it is a wonderful instrument. If it is not a harp of ten
   strings, it is, at any rate, an instrument of seven strings, and
   neither time nor eternity shall ever be able to fetch all the music out
   of them! Those seven dying words of the ever-living Christ will make
   melody for us in Glory through all the ages of eternity.

   I shall now ask your attention for a little time to the text
   itself--"Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit."

   Do you see our Lord? He is dying and, as yet, His face is toward man.
   His last Word to man is the cry, "It is finished." Hear, all you sons
   of men, He speaks to you, "It is finished." Could you have a choicer
   Word with which He should say, "Adieu," to you in the hour of death? He
   tells you not to fear that His work is imperfect, not to tremble lest
   it should prove insufficient. He speaks to you and declares with His
   dying utterance, "It is finished." Now He has done with you and He
   turns His face the other way. His day's work is done, His more than
   Herculean toil is accomplished, and the great Champion is going back to
   His Father's Throne--and He speaks--but not to you. His last Word is
   addressed to His Father, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit."
   These are His first Words in going Home to His Father, as, "It is
   finished," is His last Word as, for a while, He quits our company.
   Think of these words and may they be your first words, too, when you
   return to your Father! May you speak thus to your Divine Father in the
   hour of death!

   The words were much hackneyed in Romish times, but they are not spoilt
   even for that. They used to be said in the Latin by dying men, "In
   manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum." Every dying man used to
   try to say those words in Latin and if he did not, somebody tried to
   say them for him. They were made into a kind of spell of
   witch-craft--and so they lost that sweetness to our ears in the
   Latin--but in the English they shall always stand as the very essence
   of music for a dying saint, "Father, into Your hands I commend my
   spirit."

   It is very noteworthy that the last Words that our Lord used were
   quoted from the Scriptures. This sentence is taken, as I daresay most
   of you know, from the 31st Psalm, and the fifth verse. Let me read it
   to you. What a proof it is of how full Christ was of the Bible! He was
   not one of those who think little of the Word of God. He was saturated
   with it. He was as full of Scripture as the fleece of Gideon was full
   of dew. He could not speak, even in His death, without uttering
   Scripture. This is how David put it, "Into your hand I commit my
   spirit: You have redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth." Now, Beloved, the
   Savior altered this passage, or else it would not quite have suited
   Him. Do you see, first, He was obliged, in order to fit it to His own
   case, to add something to it? What did He add to it? Why, that word,
   "Father"! David said, "Into Your hand I commit my spirit," but Jesus
   said, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit." Blessed advance!
   He knew more than David did, for He was more the Son of God than David
   could be. He was the Son of God in a very high and special sense by
   eternal filiation and so He begins the prayer with, "Father."

   But then He takes something away from it. It was necessary that He
   should do so, for David said, "Into Your hand I commit my spirit: You
   have redeemed me." Our blessed Master was not redeemed, for He was the
   Redeemer, and He could

   have said, "Into Your hand I commit My spirit, for I have redeemed My
   people." But that He did not choose to say. He simply took that part
   which suited Himself and used it as His own, "Father, into Your hands I
   commend My spirit." Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, you will not do
   better, after all, than to quote Scripture, especially in prayer! There
   are no prayers so good as those that are full of the Word of God! May
   all our speech be flavored with texts! I wish that it were more so.
   They laughed at our Puritan forefathers because the very names of their
   children were fetched out of passages of Scripture, but I, for my part,
   had much rather be laughed at for talking much of Scripture than for
   talking much of trashy novels--novels with which (I am ashamed to say
   it) many a sermon nowadays is larded, yes, larded with novels that are
   not fit for decent men to read and which are coated over till one
   hardly knows whether he is hearing about a historical event, or only a
   piece of fiction--from which abomination, good Lord, deliver us!

   So, then, you see how well the Savior used Scripture, and how, from His
   first battle with the devil in the wilderness till His last struggle
   with death on the Cross, His weapon was always, "It is written."
   FATHERHOOD OF GOD

   Now, I am coming to the text, itself, and I am going to preach from it
   for only a very short time. In doing so, firstly, let us learn the
   doctrine of this last cry from the Cross. Secondly, let us practice the
   duty. And thirdly, let us enjoy the privilege.

   I. First, LET US LEARN THE DOCTRINE of our Lord's last cry from the
   Cross.

   What is the Doctrine of this last Word of our Lord Jesus Christ? God is
   His Father and God is our Father. He who, Himself, said, "Father," did
   not say for Himself, "Our Father," for the Father is Christ's Father in
   a higher sense than He is ours. But yet He is not more truly the Father
   of Christ than He is our Father if we have believed in Jesus! "You are
   all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Jesus said to Mary
   Magdalene, "I ascend unto My Father and your Father; and to My God, and
   your God." Believe the Doctrine of the Fatherhood of God to His people!
   As I have warned you before, abhor the doctrine of the universal
   fatherhood of God, for it is a lie and a deep deception! It stabs at
   the heart, first, of the Doctrine of the Adoption which is taught in
   Scripture, for how can God adopt men if they are already all His
   children? In the second place, it stabs at the heart of the Doctrine of
   Regeneration, which is certainly taught in the Word of God. Now it is
   by regeneration and faith that we become the children of God, but how
   can that be if we are already the children of God? "As many as received
   Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that
   believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of
   the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." How can God give to men
   the power to become His sons if they have it already? Believe not that
   lie of the devil, but believe this Truth of God, that Christ and all
   who are, by living faith in Christ, may rejoice in the Fatherhood of
   God!

   Next learn this Doctrine, that in this fact lies our chief comfort. In
   our hour of trouble, in our time of warfare, let us say, "Father." You
   notice that the first cry from the Cross is like the last--the highest
   note is like the lowest. Jesus begins with, "Father, forgive them," and
   He finishes with, "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit." To
   help you in a stern duty like forgiveness, cry, "Father." To help you
   in sore suffering and death, cry, "Father." Your main strength lies in
   your truly being a child of God!

   Learn the next Doctrine, that dying is going Home to our Father. I said
   to an old friend, not long ago, "Old Mr. So-and-so has gone Home." I
   meant that He was dead. He said, "Yes, where else would he go?" I
   thought that was a wise question. Where else would we go? When we grow
   gray, and our day's work is done, where should we go but home? So, when
   Christ has said, "It is finished," His next Word, of course, is,
   "Father." He has finished His earthly course and now He will go Home to
   Heaven. Just as a child runs to its mother's bosom when it is tired and
   wants to fall asleep, so Christ says, "Father," before He falls asleep
   in death.

   Learn another Doctrine, that if God is our Father, and we regard
   ourselves as going Home when we die, because we go to Him, then He will
   receive us. There is no hint that we can commit our spirit to God and
   yet that God will not have us. Remember how Stephen, beneath a shower
   of stones, cried, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit"? Let us, however we
   may die, make this our last emotion if not our last expression,
   "Father, receive my spirit." Shall not our heavenly Father receive His
   children? If you, being evil, receive your children at nightfall, when
   they come home to sleep, shall not your Father, who is in Heaven,
   receive you when your day's work is done? That is the doctrine we are
   to learn from this last cry from the Cross--the Fatherhood of God and
   all that comes of it to Believers.

   II. Secondly, LET US PRACTICE THE DUTY.

   That duty seems to me to be, first, resignation. Whenever anything
   distresses and alarms you, resign yourself to God. Say, "Father, into
   Your hands I commend my spirit." Sing, with Faber--

   "I bow me to Your will, O God, And all Your ways adore. And every day I
   live I'll seek To please You more and more."

   Learn, next, the duty of prayer. When you are in the very anguish of
   pain. When you are surrounded by bitter griefs of mind as well as of
   body, still pray. Drop not the, "Our Father." Let not your cries be
   addressed to the air. Let not your moans be to your physician, or your
   nurse, but cry, "Father." Does not a child so cry when it has lost its
   way? If it is in the dark at night, and it starts up in a lone room,
   does it not cry out, "Father!" And is not a father's heart touched by
   that cry? Is there anybody here who has never cried to God? Is there
   one here who has never said, "Father"? Then, my Father, put Your love
   into their hearts and make them say, tonight, "I will arise and go to
   my Father." You shall truly be known to be the sons of God if that cry
   is in your heart and on your lips.

   The next duty is the committal of ourselves to God by faith. Give
   yourselves up to God. Trust yourselves with God. Every morning, when
   you get up, take yourself and put yourself into God's custody--lock
   yourself up, as it were, in the box of Divine Protection--and every
   night, when you have unlocked the box, before you fall asleep, lock it
   again and give the key into the hand of Him who is able to keep you
   when the image of death is on your face. Before you sleep, commit
   yourself to God. I mean, do that when there is nothing to frighten you,
   when everything is going smoothly, when the wind blows softly from the
   south and the boat is speeding towards its desired haven--still make
   not yourself quiet with your own quieting! He who carves for himself
   will cut his fingers and get an empty plate. He who leaves God to carve
   for him shall often have fat things full of marrow placed before him.
   If you can trust, God will reward your trusting in a way that you know
   not as yet.

   And then practice one other duty, that of the personal and continual
   realization of God's Presence. "Father, into Your hands I commend My
   spirit." "You are here; I know that You are. I realize that You are
   here in the time of sorrow, and of danger; and I put myself into Your
   hands. Just as I would give myself to the protection of a policeman, or
   a soldier, if anyone attacked me, so do I commit myself to You, You
   unseen Guardian of the night, You unwearied Keeper of the day! You
   shall cover my head in the day of battle. Beneath Your wings will I
   trust, as a chick hides beneath the hen."

   See, then, your duty. It is to resign yourself to God, pray to God,
   commit yourself to God and rest in a sense of the Presence of God. May
   the Spirit of God help you in the practice of such priceless duties as
   these!

   III. Now, lastly, LET US ENJOY THE PRIVILEGE.

   First, let us enjoy the high privilege of resting in God in all times
   of danger and pain. The doctor has just told you that you will have to
   undergo an operation. Say, "Father, into Your hands I commend my
   spirit." There is every probability that that weakness of yours, or
   that disease of yours, will increase upon you and that, by-and-by, you
   will have to take to your bed and lie there, perhaps, for many a day.
   Then say, "Father, into Your hands I commend my spirit." Do not fret,
   for that will not help you. Do not fear the future, for that will not
   aid you. Give yourself up (it is your privilege to do so) to the
   keeping of those dear hands that were pierced for you, to the love of
   that dear heart which was set abroach with the spear to purchase your
   redemption!

   It is wonderful what rest of spirit God can give to a man or a woman in
   the very worst condition. Oh, how some of the martyrs have sung at the
   stake! How they have rejoiced when on the rack! Bonner's coal-hole,
   across the water there, at Fulham, where he shut up the martyrs, was a
   wretched place to lie on a cold winter's night, but they said, "They
   did rouse them in the straw, as they lay in the coal-hole, with the
   sweetest singing out of Heaven! And when Donner said, 'Fie on them that
   they should make such a noise!' they told him that he, too, would make
   such a noise if he was as happy as they were." When you have commended
   your spirit to God, then you have sweet rest in time of danger and
   pain!

   The next privilege is that of a brave confidence, in the time of death,
   or in the fear of death. I was led to think over this text by using it
   a great many times last Thursday night. Perhaps none of you will ever
   forget last Thursday night. I do not think that I ever shall, if I live
   to be as old as Methuselah. From this place till I reached my home, it
   seemed one continued sheet of fire--and the further I went, the more
   vivid became the lightning flashes. But when I came, at last, to turn
   up Leigham Court Road, then the lightning seemed to come in very bars
   from the sky and, at last, as I reached the top of the hill, and a
   crash came of the most startling kind, down poured a torrent of
   hail--hailstones that I will not

   attempt to describe, for you might think that I exaggerated! And then I
   felt, and my friend with me, that we could hardly expect to reach home
   alive. We were there at the very center and summit of the storm. All
   around us, on every side, and all within us, as it were, seemed nothing
   but the electric fluid--and God's right arm seemed bared for war. I
   felt then, "Well, now, I am very likely going Home," and I commended my
   spirit to God. And from that moment, though I cannot say that I took
   much pleasure in the peals of thunder, and the flashes of lightning,
   yet I felt quite as calm as I do here at this present moment--perhaps a
   little more calm than I do in the presence of so many people--happy at
   the thought that, within a single moment, I might understand more than
   all I could ever learn on earth and see in an instant more than I could
   hope to see if I lived here for a century! I could only say to my
   friend, "Let us commit ourselves to God. We know that we are doing our
   duty in going on as we are going, and all is well with us."

   So we could only rejoice together in the prospect of being soon with
   God. We were not taken Home in the chariot of fire--we are still spared
   a little longer to go on with life's work--but I realize the sweetness
   of being able to have done with it all, to have no wish, no will, no
   word, scarcely a prayer, but just to take one's heart up and hand it
   over to the great Keeper, saying, "Father, take care of me. So let me
   live, so let me die. I have, henceforth, no desire about anything! Let
   it be as You please. Into Your hands I commend my spirit."

   This privilege is not only that of having rest in danger, and
   confidence in the prospect of death--it is also full of consummate joy.
   Beloved, if we know how to commit ourselves into the hands of God, what
   a place it is for us to be in! What a place to be in--in the hands of
   God! There are the myriads of stars. There is the universe, itself!
   God's hand upholds its everlasting pillars and they do not fall. If we
   got into the hands of God, we get where all things rest and we get home
   and happiness! We have got out of the nothingness of the creature into
   the All-Sufficiency of the Creator. Oh, get you there! Hasten to get
   there, beloved Friends, and live, henceforth, in the hands of God!

   "It is finished." You have not finished, but Christ has. It is all
   done. What you have to do will only be to work out what He has already
   finished for you, and show it to the sons of men in your lives. And
   because it is all finished, therefore say, "Now, Father, I return to
   You. My life, henceforth, shall be to be in You. My joy shall be to
   shrink to nothing in the Presence of the All-in-All, to die into the
   eternal life, to sink my ego into Jehovah, to let my manhood, my
   creature hood live only for its Creator and manifest only the Creator's
   Glory!

   O Beloved, begin tomorrow morning and end tonight with, "Father, into
   Your hands I commend my spirit." The Lord be with you all! Oh, if you
   have never prayed, God help you to begin to pray now, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. LUKE23:27-49, MATTHEW27:50-54.

   Luke 23:27. And there followed Him a great company ofpeople, and of
   women, which also bewailed and lamented Him. Their best Friend, the
   Healer of their sick, the Lover of their children, was about to be put
   to death, so they might well bewail and lament.

   28-30. But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
   not for Me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For,
   behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are
   the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the paps which never
   gave suck. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us;
   and to the hills, Cover us. Our Savior spoke of the terrible siege of
   Jerusalem, the most tragic of all human transactions. I think I do not
   exaggerate when I say that history contains nothing equal to it. It
   stands alone in the unutterable agony of men, women and children in
   that dreadful time of suffering.

   31. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in
   the dry? If the Christ of God is put to death even while the Jewish
   capital seems vigorous and flourishing, what shall be done when it is
   all dry and dead, and the Roman legions are round about the doomed
   city?

   32. And there were also two other malefactors, led with Him to be put
   to death. Every item of scorn was added to our Savior's death and yet
   the Scriptures were thus literally fulfilled, for, "He was numbered
   with the transgressors."

   33. 34. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary,
   there they crucified Him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
   and the other on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for
   they know not what they do. And they parted His raiment, and cast lots.
   Do you bear the hammer fall? "Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them,
   for they know not

   what they do." Do you see the bleeding hands and feet of Jesus? This is
   all that is extracted by that fearful pressure-- nothing but words of
   pardoning love, a prayer for those who are killing Him--"Father,
   forgive them; for they know not what they do."

   35. And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
   derided Him, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself, if He is
   Christ, the chosen of God. You know how mockery puts salt and vinegar
   into a wound. A man does not at any time like to be reviled, but when
   he is full of physical and mental anguish and his heart is heavy within
   him, then ridicule is peculiarly full of acid to him.

   36, 37. And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him, and offering
   Him vinegar, and saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save
   Yourself. These rough soldiers knew how to put their jests in the most
   cruel shape and to press home their scoffs upon their suffering Victim.

   38. And a superscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek,
   and Latin, and Hebrew. These were the three languages that could be
   understood by all the people round about.

   38. THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And so He is, and so He shall be. He
   has never quit the throne. The Son of David is still King of the Jews,
   though they continue to reject Him. But the day shall come when they
   shall recognize and receive the Messiah. "Then shall they look upon Him
   whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for
   His only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that is in
   bitterness for His first-born."

   39. And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on Him, saying,
   If you are Christ, save Yourself and us. Matthew and Mark speak of both
   the thieves as railing at Jesus. We must take their expressions as
   being literally correct and, if so, both the malefactors at first cast
   reproaches in Christ's teeth.

   40. 41. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear
   God, seeing you are in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for
   we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this Man has done nothing
   amiss. Not only has He done nothing worthy of death, but He has done
   nothing improper, nothing out of place. "This man has done nothing
   amiss." The thief bears testimony to the perfect Character of this
   wondrous Man, whom he, nevertheless, recognized to be Divine, as we
   shall see in the next verse.

   42-47. And He said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into
   Your Kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto you, Today
   shall you be with Me in Paradise. And it was about the sixth hour, and
   there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the
   sun was darkened, and the veil of the Temple was rent in the midst. And
   when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said, Father, into Your
   hands I commend My spirit: and having said this, He gave up the ghost.
   Now when the centurion saw what was done, He glorified God, saying,
   Certainly this was a righteous Man. He was set there at the head of the
   guard, to watch the execution, and he could not help saying, as he
   observed the wonderful signs in Heaven and earth, "Certainly this was a
   righteous Man."

   48. And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the
   things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. What a
   change must have come over that ribald crowd! They had shouted,
   "Crucify Him!" They had stood there and mocked Him and now they are
   overcome with the sight, and they strike their breasts. Ah, dear
   Friends, their grief did not come to much! Men may strike their
   breasts, but unless God smites their hearts, all the outward signs of a
   gracious work will come to nothing at all.

   49. And all His acquaintance, and the women that followed Him from
   Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. Let "these things" be
   before your mind's eye this evening and think much of your crucified
   Lord, all you who are of His acquaintance, and who are numbered among
   His followers.

   (As the Exposition is shorter than usual, an appropriate extract is
   added from Mr. Spurgeon's Commentary on the Gospel According to
   Matthew).

   Matthew 27:50. Jesus, when He had cried again with a load voice,
   yielded up the ghost. Christ's strength was not exhausted. His last
   Word was uttered with a loud voice, like the shout of a conquering
   warrior! And what a Word it was, "It is finished"! Thousands of sermons
   have been preached upon that little sentence, but who can tell all the
   meaning that lies compacted within it? It is a kind of infinite
   expression for breadth, depth, length and height altogether
   immeasurable! Christ's life being finished, perfected, completed, He
   yielded up the ghost, willingly dying, laying down His life as He said
   He would--"I lay down My life for My sheep. I lay it down of Myself. I
   have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again."

   51-53. And, behold, the veil of the Temple was rent in two from the top
   to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; and the
   graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
   and came out of the graves after His resurrection, and went into the
   holy city, and appeared unto many. Christ's death was the end of
   Judaism! The veil of the Temple was torn in two from the top to the
   bottom. As if shocked at the sacrilegious murder of her Lord, the
   Temple rent her garments, like one stricken with horror at some
   stupendous crime! The body of Christ being rent, the veil of the Temple
   was torn in two from the top to bottom. Now was there an entrance made
   into the holiest of all, by the blood of Jesus, and a way of access to
   God was opened for every sinner who trusted in Christ's atoning
   Sacrifice.

   See what marvels accompanied and followed the death of Christ! The
   earth did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves were opened. Thus
   did the material world pay homage to Him whom man had rejected, while
   Nature's convulsions foretold what will happen when Christ's voice once
   more shakes not the earth, only, but also Heaven! These first miracles
   worked in connection with the death of Christ were typical of spiritual
   wonders that will be continued till He comes again--rocky hearts are
   rent, graves of sin are opened, those who have been dead in trespasses
   and sins, and buried in sepulchers of lust and evil, are quickened and
   come out from among the dead, and go unto the holy city, the New
   Jerusalem!

   54. Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
   Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared
   greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. These Roman soldiers
   had never witnessed such scenes in connection with an execution,
   before, and they could only come to one conclusion about the
   illustrious Prisoner whom they had put to death--"Truly this was the
   Son of God." It was strange that those men should confess what the
   chief priests and scribes and elders denied, yet since their day it has
   often happened that the most abandoned and profane have acknowledged
   Jesus as the Son of God while their religious rulers have denied His
   Divinity.

Achsah's Asking--a Pattern of Prayer

   (No. 2312)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 11, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   2, 1889.

   "And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him
   will I give Achsah, my daughter, to wife. And Othniel the son of Kenaz,
   Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah, his daughter,
   to wife. And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
   to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and
   Caleb said unto her, What wiil you? And she said unto him, Give me a
   blessing: for you ha ve given me a south land; give me also springs of
   water. And Caleb ga ve her the upper springs and the lower springs."
   Judges 1:12-15.

   IN domestic life we often meet with pictures of life in the House of
   God. I am sure that we are allowed to find them there, for our Savior
   said, "If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
   children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit
   to them that ask Him?" God is a Father and He likens Himself to us as
   fathers. And we who are Believers are God's children and we are
   permitted to liken ourselves to our own children--and just as our
   children would deal with us and we would deal with them--so may we deal
   with God and expect God to deal with us! This little story of a
   daughter and her father is recorded twice in the Bible. You will find
   it in the 15th chapter of the Book of Joshua, as well as in this first
   chapter of the Book of Judges. It is not inserted twice without good
   reasons. I am going to use it, tonight, simply in this manner--the way
   in which this woman went to her father, and the way in which her father
   treated her. May it teach us how to go to our Father who is in
   Heaven--and what to expect if we go to Him in that fashion.

   I would hold up this good woman, Achsah, before you, tonight, as a kind
   of model or parable. Our parable shall be Achsah, the daughter of
   Caleb--she shall be the picture of the true successful pleader with our
   Father in Heaven.

   I. And the first thing that I ask you to notice is HER CONSIDERATION OF
   THE MATTER before she went to her father.

   She was newly-married and she had an estate to go with her to her
   husband. She naturally wished that her husband should find in that
   estate all that was convenient and all that might be profitable. And
   looking it all over, she saw what was needed. Before you pray, know
   what you are needing. That man, who blunders down on his knees, with
   nothing in his mind, will blunder up, again, and get nothing for his
   pains. When this young woman goes to her father to ask for something,
   she knows what she is going to ask. She will not open her mouth till
   first her heart has been filled with knowledge as to what she requires.
   She saw that the land her father gave her would be of very little use
   to her husband and herself because it needed water. So she, therefore,
   goes to her father with a very definite request, "Give me, also,
   springs of water."

   My dear Friends, do you always, before you pray, think of what you are
   going to ask for? "Oh!" somebody says, "I utter some good words." Does
   God need your words? Think what you are going to ask for before you
   begin to pray and then pray like business men. This woman does not say
   to her father, "Father, listen to me," and then utter some pretty
   little oration about nothing. No, she knows what she is going to ask
   for and why she is going to ask for it. She sees her need and she
   prizes the blessing she is about to request. Oh, take note, you who are
   much in prayer, that you rush not to the holy exercise "as the horse
   rushes into the battle"--that you venture not out upon the sea of
   prayer without knowing within a little whereabouts will be your port! I
   believe that God will make you think of many more things while you are
   in prayer. The Spirit will help your infirmities and suggest to you
   other petitions--but before a word escapes your lips, I counsel you to
   do what Achsah did--know what you really need.

   This good woman, before she went to her father with her petition, asked
   her husband's help. When she came to her husband, "she moved him to ask
   of her father a field." Now, Othniel was a very brave man and very
   brave men are generally very bashful men. It is your cowardly man who
   is often forward and impertinent, but Othniel was so bashful that he
   did not like asking his uncle Caleb to give him anything more--it
   looked like grasping. He had received a wife from him and he had
   received land from him, and he seemed to say, "No, my good wife, it is
   all very well for you to put me up to this, but I do not feel like
   asking for anything more for myself." Still, learn this lesson, good
   wives--prompt your husbands to pray with you. Brothers, ask your
   brothers to pray with you. Sisters, be not satisfied to approach the
   Throne of Grace, alone, but ask your sister to pray with you. It is
   often a great help in prayer for two of you to agree touching the thing
   that concerns Christ's Kingdom. A cordon of praying souls around the
   Throne of Grace will be sure to prevail. God help us to be anxious in
   prayer to get the help of others!

   A friend, some time ago, said to me, "My dear Pastor, whenever I cannot
   pray for myself, and there are times when I feel shut up about myself,
   I always take to praying for you." God bless him, at any rate! "And I
   have not long been praying for you before I begin to feel able to pray
   for myself." I should like to come in for many of those odd bits of
   prayer. Whenever any of you get stuck in the mud, pray for me! It will
   do you good and I shall get a blessing. Remember how it is written of
   Job, "The Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his
   friends." While he prayed for himself, he remained a captive, but when
   he prayed for those unfriendly friends of his, then the Lord smiled
   upon him and loosed his captivity. So it is a good thing, in prayer, to
   imitate this woman, Achsah. Know what you need and then ask others to
   join with you in prayer. Wife, especially ask your husband. Husband,
   especially ask your wife. I think there is no sweeter praying on earth
   than the praying of a husband and a wife together when they plead for
   their children, when they invoke a blessing upon each other--and upon
   the work of the Lord.

   Next, Achsah bethought herself of this one thing, that she was going to
   present her request to her father. I suppose that she would not have
   gone to ask of anybody else, but she said to herself, "Come, Achsah,
   Caleb is your father. The gift I am going to ask is not of a stranger
   who does not know me, but of a father, in whose care I have been ever
   since I was born." This thought ought to help us in prayer. And it will
   help us when we remember that we do not go to ask of an enemy, nor to
   plead with a stranger, but we say, "Our Father, which are in Heaven."
   Do you mean it? Do you really believe that God is your Father? Do you
   feel the spirit of sonship in your heart? If so, this ought to help you
   to pray with a believing tone. Your Father will give you whatever you
   need! If there was anything that I needed and I should ask it of him, I
   expect that my dear father, old and feeble as he is, would give it to
   me if it were within the range of his possibility. And surely, our
   great and glorious Father, with whom we have lived ever since we were
   newborn, has favored us so much that we ought to ask very boldly and
   with a childlike familiarity, resting assured that our Father will
   never be vexed with us because we ask these things! Indeed, He knows
   what things we have need of before we ask Him!

   So this good woman, Achsah, feeling that it was her father of whom she
   was going to ask, and seeing that her husband hesitated to join her in
   her request, made the best of her way to go and pray alone. "Well,
   well, Othniel, I would have liked you to have gone with me, but as you
   will not, I am going alone." So she gets upon the ass, which was a
   familiar way for ladies to ride in that day, and she rides off to her
   father. The grand old man sees his daughter coming and, by the very
   look of her, he knows that she is coming on business. There is a
   something about her eyes that tells him she is coming with a request.
   This was not the first time that she had asked something of him. He
   knew her usual look when she was about to petition him, so he goes to
   meet her, and she alights from her ass, a token of great and deep
   respect, just as Rebecca, when she saw Isaac, alighted from the camel.
   She wished to show how deeply she reverenced that grand man, of whom it
   was an honor to be a child. Caleb survived Joshua a little while and
   still, in his old age, went out to fight the Canaanites and conquered
   Hebron, which the Lord had given him. Achsah pays reverence to her
   father, but yet she is very hearty in what she is going to say to him.

   Now, dear Friends, learn again from this good woman how to pray! She
   went humbly, yet eagerly. If others will not pray with you, go
   alone--but when you go, go very reverently. It is a shameful thing that
   there should ever be an irreverent prayer. You are on earth and God is
   in Heaven--multiply not your words as though you were talking to your
   equal. Do not speak to God as though you could order Him around and
   have your will with Him, and he were to be a lackey to you. Bow low
   before the Most High! Acknowledge yourself unworthy to approach Him,
   speaking in the tone of one who is pleading for that which must be a
   gift of great charity. So shall you draw near to God aright. But while
   you

   are humble, have desire in your eyes and expectation in your
   countenance. Pray as one who means to have what he asks for. Say not,
   as one did, "I ask once for what I need and if I do not get it, I never
   ask again." That is unchristian! Plead on if you know that what you are
   asking for is right. Be like the importunate widow--come again, and
   again, and again! Be like the Prophet's servant, "Go again seven
   times." You will, at last, prevail! This good woman had not to use
   importunity. The very look of her showed that she needed something and,
   therefore, her father said, "What will you?"

   I think that, at the outset of our meditation, we have learned
   something that ought to help us in prayer. If you put even this into
   practice, though no more was said, you might go away blessed thereby.
   God grant us to know our need, to be anxious to have the help of our
   fellow Believers, but to remember that, as we go to our Father, even if
   nobody will go with us, we may go alone, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
   and plead our case with our Father in Heaven!

   II. Now, secondly, in this story of Achsah, kindly notice HER
   ENCOURAGMENT. Here we have it--"She lighted from off her ass; and Caleb
   said unto her, What will you?"

   "Oh!" one says, "I could ask anything if my father said to me, 'What
   will you?'" This is precisely what your great Father says to you,
   tonight--"What will you?" With all the magnanimity of His great heart,
   God manifests Himself to the praying man or pleading woman, and He
   says, "What will you? What is your petition and what is your request?"

   What do I gather from that question, "What will you?" Why, this. First,
   you should know what you need. Could some Christians here, if God were
   to say to each of them, "What will you?" answer Him? Do you not think
   that we get into such an indistinct, indiscriminate kind of a way of
   praying that we do not quite know what we really need? If it is so with
   you, do not expect to be heard till you know what you need! Get a
   distinct, definite request realized by your mind as a pressing
   need--get it right before your mind's eye as a thing that you must
   have. That is a blessed preparation for prayer! Caleb said to his
   daughter, "What will you?" and Christ says to you, tonight, "Dear child
   of Mine, what do you want of Me? Blood-bought daughter, what do you
   want of Me?" Will you not, some of you, begin to find up a request or
   two if you have not one ready on the tip of your tongue? I hope that
   you have many petitions lying in the center of your hearts and that
   they will not be long in leaping to your lips!

   Next, as you ought to know what you need, you are to ask for it. God's
   way of giving is through our asking. I suppose that He does that in
   order that He may give twice over, for a prayer is, itself, a blessing
   as well as the answer to prayer! Perhaps it sometimes does us as much
   good to pray for a blessing as to get the blessing. At any rate, this
   is God's way, "Ask, and you shall receive." He puts even His own Son,
   our blessed Savior, under this rule, for He says, even to Him, "Ask of
   Me, and I shall give You the heathen for Your inheritance, and the
   uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession." It is a rule, then,
   without exception, that you are to know what you need, and you are to
   ask for it. Will you do this, dear Friend, while the Lord says to you,
   "What will you?"

   And when Caleb said, "What will you?" did he not as good as say to
   Achsah, "You shall have what you ask for"? Come, now, tonight is a
   sweet, fair night for praying! I do not know a night when it is not so,
   but tonight is a delightful night for prayer. You shall have what you
   ask for. "All things whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you
   shall receive." Desires written in your heart by the Holy Spirit will,
   all of them, be fulfilled! Come, then, think of these three things--you
   must know what you need, you must ask for what you need and you shall
   have what you need! Your Father says to you, as Caleb said to Achsah,
   "What will you?"

   And, once more, it shall be a pleasure to your Father to hear you ask.
   There stands Caleb, that good, brave, grand man, and he says to his
   daughter, "What will you?" He likes to see her open that mouth that is
   so dear to him! He loves to listen to the music of her voice! The
   father delights to hear his child tell him what she needs and it shall
   be no displeasure to your God to hear you pray, tonight! It shall be a
   joy to Him to have your petition spread before Him. Many fathers would
   quite as soon that their children did not tell them all their needs--in
   fact, the fewer their needs, the better pleased will their parents be!
   But our Father in Heaven feels a pleasure in giving to us all we need,
   for giving does not impoverish Him, and withholding would not enrich
   Him. He as much delights to give as the sun delights to shine! It is
   the very element of God to be scattering bounties! Come, then, and pray
   to Him--you will thus please Him more than you will please yourself! I
   wish that I could so speak, tonight, that every child of God here would
   say, "The preacher is talking to me. He means that I have to pray and
   that God will hear me, and bless me!" Yes, that is precisely what I
   mean! Take my advice and prove it to yourself, tonight, and see if it
   is not so, that God takes delight in your poor, feeble, broken prayer
   and grants your humble petition!

   Thus we have seen Achsah's consideration before prayer and her
   encouragement to pray. III. Now comes HER PRAYER itself.

   As soon as she found that she had an audience with her father of the
   kindest sort, she said to him, "Give me a blessing." I like that
   petition--it is a good beginning--"Give me a blessing." I should like
   to put that prayer into every believing mouth here, tonight, "Give me a
   blessing. Whatever You do not give me, give me a blessing! Whatever
   else You give me, do not fail to give me a blessing." A father's
   blessing is an inheritance to a loving child. "Give me a blessing."
   What is the blessing of God? If He shall say, "You are blessed," you
   may defy the devil to make you cursed! If the Lord calls you blessed,
   you are blessed! Though covered with boils, as Job was, you are
   blessed. Though near to death, like Lazarus, with the dogs licking his
   sores, you are blessed! If you should be dying, like Stephen, beneath
   the stones of murderous enemies, if God blesses you, what more can you
   wish for? No, Lord, put me anywhere that You will, as long as I get
   Your blessing. Deny me what You will, only give me Your blessing. I am
   rich in poverty if You bless me!

   So Achsah said to her father, "Give me a blessing." I wish that prayer
   might be prayed by everybody here, tonight. Printers here, tonight,
   pray for once, if you have not prayed before, "Lord, give me a
   blessing." Soldiers, pray your gracious God to give you a blessing!
   Young men and maidens, old men and fathers, take this prayer of
   Achsah's upon your hearts, tonight, "Give me a blessing." Why, if the
   Lord shall hear that prayer from everybody in this place, what a
   blessed company we shall be! And we shall go our way to be a blessing
   to this City of London beyond what we have ever been before!

   Notice next, in Achsah's prayer, how she mingled gratitude with her
   petition--"Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land." We
   like, when people ask anything of us, to hear them say, "You did help
   me, you know, Sir, a month ago." But if they seem to come to you and
   quite forget that you ever helped them, and never thank you, never say
   a word about it, but come begging again and again, you say to yourself,
   "Why, I helped that fellow a month ago! He never said a word about
   that." "Have I not seen you before?" "No, Sir I do not know that you
   ever have." "Ah," you say to yourself, "he will get no more out of me.
   He is not grateful for what he has had." I believe that ingratitude
   seals up the springs of blessing. When we do not praise God for what we
   have received from Him, it seems to me that He should say, "I am not
   going to cast My pearls before swine. I shall not give My precious
   things to those who set no value upon them." When you are praying, take
   to praising, also--you will gather strength thereby! When a man has to
   take a long jump, you have seen him go back a good distance and then
   run forward to get a spring. Go back in grateful praise to God for what
   He has done for you in days gone by, and then get a spring for your
   leap for a future blessing, or a present blessing! Mingle gratitude
   with all your prayers!

   There was not only gratitude in this woman's prayer, but she used
   former gifts as a plea for more-- "You have given me a south land; give
   me also." Oh, yes, that is grand argument with God--"You have given me,
   therefore, give me some more." You cannot always use this argument with
   men, for if you remind them that they have given you so much, they say,
   "Well, now, I think that somebody else must have a turn. Could you not
   go next door?" It is never so with God. There is no argument with Him
   like this, "Lord, You have done this to me. You are always the same.
   Your All-Sufficiency is not abated, therefore, do again what You have
   done!" Make every gift that God gives you a plea for another gift! And
   when you have that other gift, make it a plea for another gift--He
   loves you to do this. Every blessing given contains the eggs of other
   blessings within it. You must take the blessing and find the hidden
   eggs and let them be hatched by your earnestness--and there shall be a
   whole brood of blessings springing out of a single blessing!

   But this good woman used this plea in a particular way--she said, "You
   have given me a south land; give me also springs of water." This was as
   much as to say, "Though you have given me the south land and I thank
   you for it, it is no good to me unless I have water for it. It is a
   very hot bit of ground, this south land--it needs irrigating. My
   husband and I cannot get a living from it unless you give us springs of
   water." Do you see the way you are to pray? "Lord, You have given me so
   much, and it will all be good for nothing if You do not give me more.
   If You do not finish, it is a pity that You did ever begin. You have
   given me very many mercies, but if I do not have many more, all Your
   generosity will be lost. You do not begin to build unless you mean to
   finish and so I come to You to say, 'You have given me a south land,
   but it is dry. Give me, also, springs of water to make it of real value
   to me." In this prayer of Achsah's there is a particularity and a
   specialty--"Give me also springs of water." She knew what she was
   praying for and that is the way to pray! When you ask of God, ask
   distinctly--"Give me springs of water." You may say, "Give me my daily
   bread." You may

   cry, "Give me a sense of pardoned sin." You may distinctly ask for
   anything which God has promised to give, but mind that, like this
   woman, you are distinct and plain in what you ask of God--"Give me
   springs of water."

   Now, it seems to me, tonight, as if I could pray that prayer, "Give me
   springs of water." "Lord, you have given me a south land--all this
   congregation, Sunday after Sunday, all this multitude of people--but,
   Lord, how can I preach to them if You do not give me springs of water?
   'All my fresh springs are in You.' What is the use of the hearers if
   there is not the power of the Holy Spirit going with the Word to bless
   them? Give me springs of water."

   Now, I can suppose a Sunday school teacher here, tonight, saying,
   "Lord, I thank You for my interesting class and for the attention that
   the scholars pay to what I say to them. But, Lord, what is the good of
   my children to me unless You give me springs of water? Oh, that, out of
   myself, out of my very soul, might flow rivers of Living Water for my
   dear scholars and that I might have the power of Your Holy Spirit with
   all my teaching! Give me springs of water." I can imagine a Christian
   parent here saying, "Lord, I thank You for my wife and my children. I
   thank You that You have given me servants over whom I have influence. I
   thank You for all these, but what is the use of my being the head of a
   family unless You give me springs of Divine Grace that, like David, I
   may bless my household and see my children grow up in Your fear? Give
   me springs of water." The point of this petition is this, "O Lord, what
   You have given me is of little good to me unless You give me something
   more."

   dear Hearers, if God has given you money, pray that He will give you
   Grace to use it aright, or else, if you hoard it up or spend it, it
   may, in either case, prove a curse to you! Pray, "Give me springs of
   water! Give me Grace to use my wealth aright." Some here have many
   talents. Riches in the brain are among the best of riches. Be thankful
   to God for your talents, but cry, "Lord, give me of Your Grace, that I
   may use my talents for Your Glory. Give me springs of water, or else my
   talents shall be a dry and thirsty land, yielding no fruit to You. Give
   me springs of water." You see, the prayer is not merely for water, but
   for springs of water. "Give me a perpetual, eternal, always-flowing
   fountain. Give me Grace that shall never fail, but shall flow, and flow
   on, and flow forever! Give me a constant supply--"Give me springs of
   water."

   This woman's prayer, then, I have thus tried to commend to you. Oh,
   that we might all have Grace to copy her! IV. Now, lastly, see HER
   SUCCESS. Upon this I will not detain you more than a minute or two.
   "Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."

   Observe, her father gave her what she asked for. She asked for springs
   and he gave her springs. "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that
   is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will
   he for a fish give him a serpent?" God gives us what we ask for when it
   is wise to do so. Sometimes we make mistakes and ask for the wrong
   thing--and then He is kind enough to put the pen through the petition
   and write another word into the prayer--and answer the amended prayer
   rather than the first foolish edition of it! Caleb gave Achsah what she
   asked.

   Next, he gave her in large measure. She asked for springs of water and
   he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. The Lord "is able
   to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask, or think." Some use
   that passage in prayer and misquote it, "above what we can ask or even
   think." That is not in the Bible, because you can ask or even think
   anything you like. But it is, "above all that we ask, or think." Our
   asking or our thinking falls short, but God's giving never does!

   And her father gave her this without a word of upbraiding. He did not
   say, "Ah, Achsah, you are always begging of me!" He did not say, "Now
   that I have given you to your husband, it is too bad of him to let you
   come and ask for more from me, when I have already given you plenty."
   There are some gruff old fathers who would speak like that to their
   daughters, and say, "No, no, no! Come, come, I cannot stand this--you
   already have a good portion, my girl--and I have others to think of as
   well as you." No, Caleb gave her the upper and the lower springs and
   never said a word by way of blaming her. But I will be bound to say
   that he smiled on her, as he said, "Take the upper and the lower
   springs, and may you and your husband enjoy the whole! You have only
   asked, after all, what my heart delights to give you."

   Now, may the Lord grant unto us, tonight, to ask of Him in wisdom, and
   may He not have to upbraid us, but give us all manner of blessings both
   of the upper and the lower springs, both of Heaven and earth, both of
   eternity and time, and give them freely, and not say, even, a single
   word by way of upbraiding us!

   1 have done with this last point when I have asked a plain question or
   two. Why is it that, tonight, some of you dear Friends have a very
   parched-up inheritance? The grass will not grow and the corn will not
   grow. Nothing good seems to

   grow. You have been plowing and turning the plot up, and sowing, and
   weeding--and yet nothing comes of it. You are a Believer, and you have
   an inheritance, but you are not very much given to song, not very
   cheery, not very happy. And you are sitting here, tonight, and singing,
   to the tune Job--

   "Lord, what a wretched land is this,

   That yields us no supply!"

   Well, why is that? There is no need for it. Your heavenly Father does
   not want you to be in that miserable condition. There is something to
   be had that would lift you out of that state and change your tone
   altogether. May every child of God here go to his Father, just like
   Achsah went to Caleb! Pour out your heart before the Lord, with all the
   simple ease and naturalness of a trustful, loving child.

   Do you say, "Oh, I could not do that"? Then I shall have to ask you
   this question, "Are we truly the children of God if we never feel
   towards Him any of that holy boldness?" Do you not think that every
   child must feel a measure of that confidence towards his father? If
   there is a son in the world who says, "No, I-I-I really could not speak
   to my father," well, I shall not make any enquiries, but I know that
   there is something wrong up at his home--there is something not right
   either with the father or with the boy! Wherever there is a loving
   home, you never hear the son or daughter say, "You know, I-I-I could
   not ask my father." I hope that we have, none of us, got into that
   condition with regard to our earthly fathers! And let none of us be in
   that condition with regard to our heavenly Father--

   "My soul, ask what you will,

   You cannot be too bold

   Since His own blood for you He spilled,

   What else can He withhold?"

   Come, then, while in the pew, tonight, before we gather at the
   Communion Table, and present your petition with a child-like confidence
   and expect it to be heard, and expect, tonight, to have fellowship with
   the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ!

   And you, poor Sinners, who cannot pray like children, what are you to
   do? Well, you remember how the Savior said to the Syrophenician woman,
   "It is not right to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the
   dogs." But she answered, "Yes, Lord; yet the dogs under the table eat
   of the children's crumbs." You come in for the crumbs, tonight, but if
   a man is satisfied to eat crumbs with the dogs, God will not be
   satisfied till He makes him eat bread with the children! If you will
   take the lowest place, God will give you a higher place before long.
   Come to Jesus and trust in Him henceforth and forever. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. MATTHEW7.

   Verse 1. Judge not, that you be not judged. You are not called to
   judge--you are not qualified to judge. "God is the Judge: He puts down
   one, and sets up another." There is much better work to be done by us
   than that of setting up as judges of others.

   2. For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what
   measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again. Do not judge the
   whole character of a man by one single action. Do not attempt to judge
   his motives. You cannot read his heart--you are not Omniscient--you are
   not Infallible. You will very soon find other people judging you and
   when, one of these days, you shall be falsely judged and condemned, you
   will not need to have any surprise if you have done the same thing,
   yourself--it will be only your corn measured back to you with the
   bushel you used in measuring other people's.

   3. And why behold you the mote that is in your brother's eye, but
   consider not the beam that is in your own eye? There is something in
   yourself that is worthy of your consideration, something that you ought
   to consider--it is a big, blinding beam in your own eye! As for the
   mote that is in your brother's eye, there is no need that you should
   even see it. Why do you behold it? Charity is always a little blind to
   the faults of others, for it remembers so well its own.

   4. Or how will you say to your brother, Let me pull out the mote out of
   your eye; and, behold, a beam is in your own eye? A blind man cannot be
   a good oculist. He should see well who tries to mend other people's
   eyes, but with a beam in one's own eye, it must be poor work to attempt
   to take motes out of the eyes of others. This does not prevent our
   using reproof

   and rebuke when they are needed. Even under the Law, the command was
   given, "You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any
   wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him," as if it were
   a kind of hatred to avoid the duty of kindly and gentle rebuke. That is
   a very different thing from exposing the faults of others and
   aggravating and exaggerating the faults of others, as, alas, so many
   do! Oh, how much misery might be saved in the world if the scandal
   market were not so brisk! Perhaps tongues would not move so fast if
   eyes were used to a better purpose.

   5, 6. You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye; and
   then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brother's
   eye. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast you your
   pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn
   again and tear you. There are some holy enjoyments, some gracious
   experiences, some deep doctrines of the Word of God, which it would be
   out of place to speak of before certain profane and unclean persons.
   They would only make a jest of them--perhaps they might persecute you
   on account of them. No, holy things are for holy men and, as of old,
   the crier in the Grecian temple was known to say, before the mysteries
   were performed, "Far hence, you profane!" so sometimes, before we enter
   into the innermost circle of Christian converse, it would be well for
   us to notice who is listening.

   7, 8. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock,
   and it shall be opened unto you: for everyone that asks receives. This
   is invariably the rule of God's Kingdom, whenever the request is a
   right one, and is presented in a right manner.

   8-11. And he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks it shall be
   opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son asks for bread,
   will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a
   serpent? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
   children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven, give good
   things to them that ask Him? The point is, not only that God gives, but
   that He knows how to give. If He were always to give according to our
   prayers, it might be very injurious to us--He might give us that with
   which we could do hurt, as when a father should put a stone into a
   boy's hand. Or He might give us that which might do us hurt, as if a
   father were to give his child a serpent. He will do neither of these
   things, but He will answer us in discretion and, with prudence will He
   fulfill our desires. You know how to give to your children--how much
   more shall your infinitely wise Father, who from Heaven sees all the
   surroundings of men, give good things to them that ask Him?

   12. Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you,
   do you even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets. "The Law
   and the Prophets" are here condensed into a single sentence. This is
   the golden rule, a handy rule, a perpetually applicable rule, useful in
   every condition--and it never makes a mistake.

   13, 14. Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
   broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there are which go
   in there: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads
   unto life, and few there are that find it. It is a way of self-denial,
   it is a way of humility, it is a way which is distasteful to the
   natural pride of men! It is a precise way, it is a holy way, a strait
   way and, therefore, men do not care for it. They are too big, too proud
   to go along a narrow lane to Heaven--yet this is the right way. There
   are many broad ways, as Bunyan says, that abut upon it, but you may
   know them by their being broad, and you may know them by their being
   crowded! The Christian has to swim against the current--he has to do
   more than that, he has to go against himself--so strait is the road!
   But if you wish to go down to Hell, you have only to float with the
   stream and you can have any quantity of company that you like.

   15. Beware offalse prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing.
   Dressed like Elijah.

   15. But inwardly they are ravening wolves. Very Ahabs and Jezebels! And
   they will deceive you, if you are not Divinely guarded against them.

   16. You shall know them--How? By their eloquence? No. Some of the worst
   of teachers have had great persuasiveness. You shall know them by their
   earnestness? No. Some have compassed sea and land to make proselytes to
   a lie. You shall know them how, then?

   16. By their fruits. If their teaching makes you better, if it makes
   you love God, if it draws you to holiness, if it inspires you with
   noble and heroic sentiments so that you imitate Christ--then listen to
   them.

   16-20. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so
   every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings
   forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither
   can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that brings not
   forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. Therefore by
   their fruits you shall know them. After all, this is the best test of
   any doctrine, the practice to which it leads. I remember discussing,
   one day, with a person about the

   doctrine of future punishment. We were arguing and the gentleman who
   owned the vessel on which we were, said, "Come up on deck and enjoy the
   fresh air, and leave that subject. But," he said, "you, Sir, will
   kindly go as far as possible from my men, for they are bad enough as
   they are, and if you tell them there is no punishment for sin, they
   will be worse than ever. As for you, Mr. Spurgeon, you may go where you
   like--you won't do them any harm." I thought that rough and ready mode
   of argument was about as good a commendation as I could wish to have!

   21. Not everyone that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   Kingdom of Heaven; but he that does the will of My Father which is in
   Heaven. Not talking, but doing! Not loud profession, but quiet,
   practical godliness wins the day!

   22,23. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
   prophesied in Your name? And in Your name have cast out devils? And in
   Your name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them,
   I never knew you: depart from Me, you that work iniquity. If Christ
   does not know us, it matters not what we do! Even if we work miracles,
   if we astound the world with our abilities--it is all nothing if Christ
   does not know us! Now, I think there are many here who can humbly but
   confidently say, "He knows me." He knows some of us, if by nothing
   else, by our constantly begging of Him. We have been at Him day and
   night in our necessities, pleading for His bounty, His mercy, His
   company--and He cannot say He does not know us. He knows a great deal
   about us through our prayers, if by no other way.

   24. Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I
   will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock. What
   a mercy there is a Rock to build on! We could not have made one, but
   there is the Rock.

   25. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew.
   For the best man will have his troubles. 25. And beat upon that house.
   For the best man will feel the troubles--they will come home to him.

   25-27. And it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And everyone
   that hears these sayings of Mine, and does them not, shall be likened
   unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand: and the rain
   descended. For the worst of men will have their troubles. There is no
   escaping the trials of life by sin.

   27. And the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;
   and it fell: and great was the fall of it. There was no building it
   again--it was altogether gone, swept right away--no vestige of it
   remained.

   28, 29. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
   people were astonished at His doctrine: for He taught them as One
   having authority, and not as the scribes. He touched their conscience.
   His teaching came home to them. They could not help feeling that it was
   true. Besides, He did not keep on quoting Rabbi This and Rabbi That,
   but He spoke from His own knowledge--"He taught them as One having
   authority, and not as the scribes."

Charity and Purity

   (No. 2313)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 18, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 23,
   1889.

   "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
   visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
   ourselves unspotted from the world." James 1:27.

   THERE is a great deal said, a great deal written, a great deal of zeal
   on the one side and of anger on the other, expended upon the externals
   of religion. Some think that they should be very fine, not to say
   gaudy, very impressive, not to say imposing. They like what they call,
   "bright" services, though we might call them by another name. But the
   great question with many people is, "What are to be the externals of
   religion?" What dress is religion to wear? Shall it be robed in the
   plainness of Quakerdom, or shall it be adorned with all the brilliance
   of Romanism? Which shall it be?

   Well, dear Friends, after all, we may spend much time over that
   question and find no satisfactory answer to it. But the Biblical
   Ritualism, the pure external worship, the true embodiment of the inward
   principles of religion is to visit the fatherless and widows in their
   affliction and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world. Charity and
   purity are the two great garments of Christianity. Charity was once
   cried up by the Romanists to an extreme point--almsgiving seeming to
   be, to many--the beginning and the end of piety. It was an almsgiving
   which had a great deal that was excellent about it and which I cannot
   regard, as some do, altogether with abhorrence--an almsgiving which
   covered this land with houses of entertainment for the poor, so that
   they journeyed from one halting-place to another--and were freely
   lodged and housed. And we had, at least, no poor law, or workhouse,
   with all (I was about to say) the horrors which accompany the present
   system.

   But, unfortunately, charity was thought to be everything, and purity
   was too much neglected, so that even those houses which were originally
   built to be the abode of those who should help the poor and needy, and
   instruct the ignorant, became, to a sad degree, the haunts of luxury
   and vice! The monastery, which should have been a place of pure and
   undefiled religion before God and the Father, as it entertained the
   fatherless and the widows, was not famed for being unspotted by the
   world's sins, but, on the contrary, it was famous or infamous for its
   foulness! I have no doubt that this was a great deal exaggerated, but,
   at any rate, the accusation did seem to lie, to a very sad extent,
   against it, that those who were supposed to be dedicated to God were
   not such consecrated men as they professed to be. Purity went down and
   charity went up.

   Well, in these days, I sometimes fear lest we should by no means insist
   too much on purity, but should certainly insist too little upon
   charity! The visitation of the fatherless and widows in their
   affliction is not left optional. It is not to be the privilege of a few
   worldly men who give all their substance to orphanages. Every Christian
   is bound to wear his part of the external dress of religion, that is,
   charity! This charity is to be manifested especially to those who need
   it most, whose need cannot be a matter of imposture, but must be real.
   These are the fatherless and widows during the time of their
   destitution and affliction--when the orphans are not able to earn the
   bread that perishes--and the mother has her children weeping around her
   and pining in poverty. Not only may this charity be shown, but it must
   be manifested if we would have pure and undefiled religion before God
   and the Father. The increase of charity, of careful and discreet
   consideration for the poor and needy, would bring a great blessing with
   it, and is what is greatly needed, even in these times, when, perhaps,
   we fancy that we are doing almost enough in this direction, although we
   certainly are not.

   Yet charity without purity will be of no use. In vain should we give
   all our substance to the poor and give our bodies to be burned if we do
   not walk in the way of holiness, "without which no man shall see the
   Lord." If we do not come out

   from the world and keep ourselves from its polluting influence, we have
   not yet learned what pure and undefiled religion really is! We may be
   very orthodox in creed, or we may be very far advanced in our knowledge
   of religious matters. We may think ourselves to be Hebrews of the
   Hebrews, Pharisees of the Pharisees, and as touching the righteousness
   which is of the Law, blameless. But we are, in the sight of God, only
   as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal, unless, by Divine Grace, we
   have learned to keep ourselves unspotted from the world!

   Without forgetting what I have said to you about charity, we will
   examine those words in our text which especially speak of purity and,
   in doing so, I notice, first, that they indicate separation. Look below
   their surface and they certainly indicate that. Secondly, they impress
   upon us spotlessness--"to keep ourselves unspotted from the world."
   And, thirdly, they insist upon careful self-watching.

   I. First, then, beloved Friends, if you look below the surface of the
   words here, you will see that THEY INDICATE SEPARATION.

   "To keep ourselves unspotted from the world," implies that we are not a
   part of the world. We are in it, but evidently not of it. We are one
   thing and the world is another thing--and we are so much apart from the
   world that even a spot from the pools of the world would defile us. We
   are to be quite outside the world even while we are in it. Those of you
   who were here on Monday night must have been greatly amused and also
   instructed by what was said by a young seller of religious tracts. He
   was a little fellow--you remember him! He was going along with his pack
   on his back and a big man accosted him in this way, "Well, my little
   fellow, do you belong to the Militia?" "No, Sir, I do not, but I belong
   to the King's Own." "You little fool," said the man, "why, there is not
   any king in this country, so you cannot belong to the King's Own." The
   lad replied, "I don't know that I am a fool any more for that, for, do
   you know, I belong to another country?" "What do you mean by saying
   that you belong to another country? You are not a foreigner." "Well, I
   won't say that I am a foreigner, but I can say that I am a stranger in
   this land, and I belong, as I have already told you, to another
   country. And that I am not a fool is quite certain, for in the country
   to which I belong there is a King, and I am in His army. And if you
   would like to know how to enlist in it, I have a book in my pack which
   you can buy, and in which you can read all about my King and His army."

   It was well put and it also expressed nothing more than the real truth.
   Here, in the midst of this world, you and I, if we are truly born again
   from above, are strangers and pilgrims. We have come into this land as
   gypsies might have come--pitching our tent here and there--but having
   no abiding city anywhere. We are in this world as Abraham was in
   Canaan. We are not related to any of the Canaanites among whom we
   dwell. We are of another country, to wit, a heavenly one--and we are
   looking for "a city which has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is
   God." There are some professing Christians who also try to be worldly,
   but a worldly Christian is an anomaly and a contradiction!

   No, beloved Friends, if we are truly the Lord's, we are severed from
   the world. I will mention two or three of the many ways in which we are
   thus separated.

   The first is by Divine Election. The Lord Jesus Christ had a people
   given to Him--a people whom He received of His Father, as He
   said--"Yours they were, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept
   Your Word." "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them
   which You have given Me." These are they whom God chose in Christ Jesus
   from before the foundation of the world, having predestinated them,
   according to the good pleasure of His will, that they should be holy
   and without blame before Him in love--"for whom He did foreknow, He
   also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He
   might be the First-Born among many brethren." Now this eternal choice
   of God has severed Believers from the rest of mankind and they stand
   apart as much as Israel stood apart in Egypt, even in the midst of the
   plagues. Thus God's chosen ones constitute a people that shall dwell
   alone--they shall not be numbered among the nations. He has made them
   to be His portion, "for the Lord's portion is His people. Jacob is the
   lot of His inheritance."

   This Truth of God, some of you may say, leads us into the great
   mysteries of the Kingdom of God. Well, in due time, our separation from
   the world is the result of Divine calling as well as Divine election,
   for the Apostle writes, "moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He
   also called." There is a people in this world who have been called out
   from the world and they make up the ecclesia, the called-out assembly,
   the people to whom a Voice has come which others have not spiritually
   heard. They are the people who have been drawn by Christ and have run
   after Christ--the people who were dead and who have been quickened--the
   people who were slumbering and who have been awakened. They are the
   people who

   were afar off and who have been brought near, the people who have been
   brought out of darkness into Christ's marvelous light, the people whom
   He has separated unto Himself--and who shall show forth His praise. Do
   you know anything about this calling, my dear Hearers? Were you ever
   led, by conviction of sin, repentance and faith, to fly to Jesus? Have
   you come to Him? If so, in that wondrous calling out, you have one
   evidence that you are distinct from the world that lies in the Wicked
   One.

   Another clear distinguishing mark is redemption. The blood of the
   paschal lamb was on the lintel and the two side posts of the house of
   every family of Israel. It was not on the houses of the Egyptians and
   to their dwellings the Destroying Angel came with swift, sure, unerring
   blow, killing the first-born in every house throughout the land. It was
   the blood-mark that distinguished Israel from all the rest of the
   people! And today, only those who are sheltered by the sprinkled blood
   of Jesus, the Lamb of God, are safe! Christ has redeemed His people
   from among men. He loved His Church and gave Himself for her--and He
   has redeemed that Church and brought her out of the Egyptian bondage of
   sin with a high hand and an outstretched arm, redeeming her by power as
   well as by price--and she shall be His forever. Has He not espoused her
   unto Himself and will He not have her of whom His soul was eternally
   enamored and to whom, in the Covenant of old, He was joined by bonds of
   everlasting wedlock? Yes, verily, He will have her to be His own bride,
   world without end! This is another mark of our separation from the
   world--the blood-red mark of redemption, effectual redemption by the
   Lord Jesus Christ.

   Then, Beloved, in due time, separation from the world comes out,
   externally, more fully in sanctification. There is a people in this
   world who have another nature from that of the men of this world. Would
   to God there were more of them! But there has come, by Divine Grace, a
   work of Christ in their heart which has changed their entire nature,
   aspirations, loves, hates--their whole selves--and made the whole world
   to become new to them because they are totally new to it. When this
   great change is worked in the heart of a man, it crucifies him to the
   world and the world to him. And he becomes a member of a community as
   much above the common race of humanity as a man is above a horse or a
   dog! He becomes possessed of a higher nature which was born in him by
   regeneration and which lifts him up into familiarity with God, so that
   he becomes a partaker of the Divine Nature, having escaped the
   corruption that is in the world through lust. So says this Book on
   which we rest and I beseech you to believe that it speaks the Truth of
   God.

   Sanctification is the great open separator of Christians from the
   world! And they are so separate and so distinct that they will never be
   mixed together, not even in that day when their bones shall lie mingled
   in the same cemetery--when grave by grave the righteous shall sleep
   side by side with the wicked! There shall be a distinction in that day
   of resurrection when the dead in Christ shall rise first--"The rest of
   the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." There
   shall be a distinction in that day when the King's words, "Come, you
   blessed," or, "Depart, you cursed," shall make an everlasting division
   between them--and all the universe shall know that the Lord does put a
   difference between Israel and Egypt!

   Now, Beloved, you can judge for yourselves, tonight--I pray you to do
   it--whether you are separate from the world. If you are not, you will
   be judged with the world. If this day there falls to your lot, special
   Grace, as well as special joy--if you have a new life and a heavenly
   experience all your own, then, inasmuch as you are not of the world,
   hear again the words of my text and keep yourselves "unspotted from the
   world."

   Now, I want you to notice, before I leave this point, that, inasmuch as
   there is an evident separation between the people of God and the world,
   we make it a part of worship to manifest that separation. Observe what
   the text says--"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father
   is this...To keep ourselves unspotted from the world." Religion does
   not consist simply in meeting together for prayer, in singing hymns and
   hearing sermons. There is much of this that is profitable and glorifies
   God, but there is something more needed to complete real worship of
   God.

   When you and I live daily with the fear of God before our eyes, in the
   presence of men of the world who care not whether there is a God or
   not, then are we truly manifesting "pure and undefiled religion." When
   we judge all our conduct by thinking how it will appear in the sight of
   God. When, assailed by temptation, we say to ourselves, "How can I do
   this great wickedness and sin against God?" When we keep ourselves
   apart from every evil thing that might fascinate and entice us, saying,
   "So did not I, because of the fear of God," this is true worship! It is
   quite as real worship as the hymns we sing and the prayers we offer.

   Abstinence from evil and seeking that which is right will manifest our
   separation from the world, especially if the Glory of God is our one
   great objective in life. I like that word of my dear friend, Mr. George
   Muller, when he says, "Never begin a day without feeling joy in the
   Lord." I think that is a very blessed rule--to live constantly walking
   in such a way that you and God are on close terms of happy fellowship
   so that all that you do you do heartily as unto the Lord! Your common
   service as a domestic servant, or your public service as a preacher,
   you do in the Presence, not of the great Taskmaster, but of your great
   Father and Friend, of whom you have become an adopted child and to whom
   you are separated to be a priest serving Him every day! If everything
   is done, from the taking down of the shop shutters on the Monday
   morning to the putting of them up on Saturday night, as well as what is
   done on Sunday--if all is done for God's Glory, this will make a great
   gulf between you and the man of the world who lives for baser ends.

   Thus I have tried very plainly to show that the words in our text
   indicate separation.

   II. Now, in the second place, THEY IMPRESS UPON US SPOTLESSNESS--"To
   keep ourselves unspotted from the world."

   We learn from this, first, that the Christian never expects to get any
   good from the world. He is to keep himself from the world, specially
   from the spots of the world. Dr. Watts wisely asks--

   "Is this vile world a friend to Grace, To help me on to God?"

   No, it never is. It never was. It will never be. There is enmity,
   today, between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent--and
   so there will be to the end of the chapter. You will never get anything
   out of the serpent, even though you stand and listen to his
   philosophical questions and his new explanations of God's Word. You
   will get nothing more out of him now than mother Eve did when she got
   from him a curse to all her posterity. You can get no good out of the
   world, nor out of the Prince of this world.

   It is implied in our text, also, that we cannot go and wallow in the
   world's filth. If there is any man here who is a professor of religion
   and who can go, tonight, and indulge himself in vice, or who can find
   himself at home with the world, well, he belongs to the world. Where
   you find your pleasure, there your heart is! Do not pretend to belong
   to the Church and to the world as well. I like the honesty of the man
   who finds that his life is not consistent with the life of Christ and,
   therefore, gives up his profession--that is plain sailing. But do not
   pretend that you can wallow in the mire of open sin or secret sin and
   yet belong to Christ, for that cannot be! Keep yourselves unspotted
   from the world's puddles.

   In particular, we must keep ourselves unspotted from the lepers of the
   world. There is a certain number of leprous men in the world. You can
   tell them by their conversation and, sometimes you cannot help going
   very near where they are. But if you hear them cry, "Unclean!" just
   give them a very wide berth. I wish that Christians were more careful
   about this leprosy in the matter of books. As soon as ever you see that
   there is leprosy there, do not go and play with it, and examine it, and
   look at it. You will catch it if you are not careful! Keep clear of it!
   Keep yourselves unspotted from the lepers of the world. "Well, that is
   easy enough," you say. Perhaps it is not as easy as you think.

   But, further, we are to keep ourselves from all spots of the world when
   we have to mingle with it. Notice, there are spots which come from your
   circumstances. Are you wealthy? Well, use your wealth for God, but mind
   that it does not spot you. There is a great deal of rust about riches.
   Mind that it does not eat into your soul as does a canker. Are you
   poor? Does your poverty compel you to live in a very low neighborhood
   with people of groveling tastes? Well, the poverty will not necessarily
   hurt you any more than the wealth will, but keep yourselves unspotted
   from it. You will need a deal of Divine Grace to live in some parts of
   London and not be spotted, even, by the people who have apartments in
   the house where you live.

   And not only will your circumstances be likely to spot you, but the
   favors and honors of the world will spot you. So you have received a
   degree, or you have had a rise in business and the people all speak
   well of you, do they? And there is that thoroughly worldly lady who has
   a secret admiration for you. Well, well, well, be careful! Joseph had
   the favor of Potiphar and of Pharaoh in Egypt, but he kept himself
   unspotted. Mind that the world's favor does not spot you. "Ah," says
   one, "I don't get much of that! I get all frowns." Very
   well--persecution, slander and frowning need not spot you, but they
   may, you know. There are many who cannot bear the cold atmosphere and
   biting frosts of persecution. Mind that you are not spotted in that
   way.

   Then we may be spotted, dear Friends, in trade. I suppose that a man
   has good need to be wide awake in order to stay honest. A man can soon
   do a wrong thing in business by simple negligence and, unless he keeps
   both his eyes open, his very servants may be doing, in his name, that
   which will be injurious to the honor of their master. Dear Friends,
   trade away all you can--go and prosper in it--but mind that you do not
   get spotted! Then there are politics. You know what party politics are.
   We are all trying to got in another set of maggots to eat the cheese!
   That is about all it amounts to--first turn out one lot and then turn
   in another. It comes to little more than that! Even in the pursuit of
   really good matters of policy, do you know any Christian who goes into
   politics who is the better for it? If I find such a man, I will have
   him stuffed if I can, for I have never seen such a specimen yet! I will
   not say, do not attend to politics, but I do say, do not let them spot
   you.

   Then there are the societies of life. A man goes in with his neighbors
   and he sits at their feast. The Savior sat at a feast with a Pharisee,
   but mind that it does not spot you--it did not spot Him, but it may
   spot you, so beware! And as to your ordinary conversation with men of
   the world, are you not conscious, when you go home at night, that you
   need washing? After shaking hands with a good many men of the world and
   talking with them, do you not feel that you are apt to get spotted? And
   the literature, the common literature of the world. I do not mean that
   which we should censure, and condemn, and burn--but the common
   literature that is all around you--mind that it does not spot you,
   Brothers and Sisters.

   If we would be spotless, we must beware of the vanities and pleasures
   of the world, the thoughts and the tendencies of the world. It is
   supposed to be something wonderful to see "the tendency of the age,"
   "the current of the age," "the set of thought." It is all pollution and
   nothing else! Instead of wishing to be abreast of it, I only desire to
   be abreast of it in stemming it and, by opposing it, to drive it back.
   That is the only position for a Christian! If you go with the current
   of the age, you are swimming the wrong way, for all that is of the
   world comes of evil even to this day. There is no change in the
   Scripture and there is no change in the world. If you love the world,
   the love of the Father is not in you. The current of human opinion
   always was, is and will be, till Christ shall come, an evil current
   that will bear you the wrong way if you yield to it.

   I might thus enlarge, but I will not, and will only say that we must
   keep ourselves unspotted from the sins of the world. What are they?
   Well, one of them is atheism. Keep yourselves unspotted from that
   horrible crime, hatred of Deity! Doubt of every kind is in the
   air--this is the day of doubt. Keep yourselves unspotted from the
   world's unbelief. This is the age of compromises--to many people, the
   Truth of God is not a matter of great importance, nowadays, and
   principle is of no account. They snip and cut and mar the Scriptures as
   Jehudi cut the Prophet's roll--they have no care as to what God has
   said. Avoid compromises and be unspotted of the world! This is the age
   of trifling! There is more money spent on recreation, today, than ever
   was since the world began, unless it was that day in which God swept
   all away by the Flood! Keep yourselves unspotted by the world! It is
   the age of hollowness and gigantic shams and bubbles. Be real! Be true!
   Keep yourselves unspotted from the world. This subject is endless. God
   give us Grace to carry it out!

   III. I must finish by noticing, in the third place, that the words in
   our text INSIST UPON CAREFUL SELF-WATCHING.

   Do you understand that it is your very person, your soul, your heart,
   your very self that is to be kept unspotted? What a man is, the man,
   before long, does. But keep yourselves clean, unspotted, my Brothers
   and Sisters. Do you say, "O Lord, how can I do this"? It is plain from
   the text that I am not to sit down, and say, "The Lord will do it, the
   Lord will do it and the Lord must do it, for I cannot." The language of
   the text is such that it calls the Christian, himself, to watchfulness
   and care. What must he do, then?

   Brethren, first, let us go and wash. We were washed once, many years
   ago. Jesus washed us and made us clean. But now, today, we have been
   going through the world and our feet have become muddied. Let us come
   to Him, again, tonight, before we go to rest. Dear Master, wash our
   feet, again, from any spots of the world which we have acquired by
   going along these dusty pathways! The fairest lily in the gardens near
   London gets spotted by the soot of this great city--you cannot help
   seeing its defilement! But the shower comes and the dew falls, and the
   lily washes its fair face, and its loveliness is restored. Let us go to
   our Lord, again, to be washed in His precious blood. It is never
   supposed in the Scriptures that we shall be without sin to confess, but
   it is written, "If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have
   fellowship, one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
   cleanses us from all sin." We still need cleansing, even

   when we are walking in the Light of God! Let us get away to Christ,
   then, and say, "Lord, I would be, myself, unspotted. I come to You for
   washing."

   That done, avoid careless walking if you wish not to be spotted. In
   going home, after a shower, if you have to cross a road, it is very
   difficult to keep from being spotted. And if you run carelessly, you
   will plunge into a puddle and there will be splashes of mud all over
   you, before you know it! Now, do not run into the puddle--walk
   circumspectly. There is a clean way and it is called the way of
   holiness--the unclean shall not pass over it. The Lord help us to watch
   every action and, more than that, every thought and every word! I would
   like to be able to take my words out of my mouth and look at them
   before I speak them--and to have all the actions of my life done as
   under the watchful eye of God, to see whether they will look right in
   the Day of Judgment. If you cannot sleep over a thing, do not do it. As
   the good man said to his boy, "My boy, pay as you go." "Suppose I
   cannot pay, Father." "Then, don't go." So would I say to you, examine
   your life as you go. If you dare not examine an action, or look at it,
   then do not do it! When you do not know whether it is right, then it is
   always best to feel sure that it is wrong. Even though it might be
   right to another, it will be wrong to you if you have not faith that it
   is right, for, "whatever is not of faith is sin." If any question
   arises about moral conduct, that question makes it evil to you.

   Next, I would say that, as you would avoid careless walking, also avoid
   careless walkers. Very frequently, when I am riding alone, and I am not
   getting into any mud, an omnibus comes by and splashes me all over. It
   is no fault of mine, but then it is somebody near me that does it. As
   you walk along the street, you are very careful, but if your neighbor
   puts his foot in a puddle, the splash may come over you. So mind what
   company you keep! And when you find people getting rather "fast," or
   rather "loose," leave them--get away from them! You do not need to be
   muddied, so keep yourself unspotted from the world.

   Above all, cry to God to preserve you from evil. If you go out every
   day, covered and protected by Divine Grace, then, and then only, can
   you be kept unspotted from the world. I would like to see a Christian
   not kept in a glass case away from trial and temptation, but yet
   covered with an invisible shield, so that, wherever he went, he would
   be guarded and protected from the evil influences that are in the world
   in almost every place.

   Thus I have spoken to God's people, but I have said very little to
   sinners. Although I have not addressed them especially, tonight, if
   you, the people of God, will go and live godly lives, you will preach
   to sinners better than I shall. I have to say to you who fear God, keep
   yourselves unspotted from the world, but what am I to say to those who
   are not only in the world, but also of the world? Do you not know that
   "the earth, also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up"?
   What will become of you, then? And you who belong to the world and have
   your portion in this life--and your joy in this world--in that great
   day when the elements shall melt with fervent heat, where will you be?
   Then you may call to the rocks to hide you, but you will call in vain!
   If your portion is in this life, what will you do in the life to come?

   Some of you are living within the boundaries of this mortal existence
   and that is your all. Poor Soul! Poor Soul! Poor soul! Poor Soul! The
   Lord in His mercy bring you to know the life eternal! And when you once
   get that, your great desire will be to be delivered from the power of
   sin and to keep yourself unspotted from the world! The Lord bless you,
   for Christ's sake! Amen!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. JAMES1.

   Verse 1. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
   twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. "Where are the lost
   ten tribes?" asks somebody. They never were lost. That is a mere piece
   of nonsense! There were, and there still are, 12 tribes of Israel, as
   much one as the other. Ask any Jew if it is not so. James writes to all
   his compatriots by nature and to all the fellow citizens of the saints
   by Grace, and greets them. What a strange greeting it is!

   2. My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.
   Or "trials." Do not be sorry about it, be thankful for it. The gold
   should be glad to be put into the crucible--the Christian should
   rejoice to be tested and tried. Not only count it joy, but count it,
   "all joy when you fall into divers temptations."

   3, 4. Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience. But
   let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire,
   needing nothing. You need to grow--you will not grow without trials.
   You need to learn--you will

   not learn without affliction. It is God's school for you. Be thankful,
   therefore, when these afflictions come. They are the rumbling wagons of
   your Father, in which He sends you choice treasure. They are black
   ships that come from afar, loaded with precious things. But mind that
   you get this patience and, that when you have it, you have still more
   of it-- "Let patience have her perfect work."

   5. If any of you lack wisdom. Ah, James, you need not say, "If any of
   you lack wisdom," for we all lack it! We are all poor, foolish
   creatures--"If any of you lack wisdom."

   5. Let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraids
   not; and it shall be given him. The Lord might very well upbraid us for
   our folly and say, "Poor child, I will give you wisdom; yet you are
   very foolish." But He does not say that. He "gives to all men
   liberally, and upbraids not." Let him who lacks wisdom ask of God, "and
   it shall be given him." Can the Lord give wisdom? Surely we must study,
   learn, and gain experience before we can know and then, afterwards,
   knowledge, rightly used, grows into wisdom. Can God give us wisdom
   ready made? Ah, yes, He can! He gives wisdom if we ask for it.

   6. But let him ask in faith. A man who has no wisdom can have faith.
   Let him use his faith to get wisdom--"Let him ask in faith."

   6, 7. Nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea
   driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he
   shall receive anything of the Lord. He may receive something of the
   Lord, but he may not think that he shall. It may come as a spontaneous
   gift of Sovereign Grace, but we have no right to expect an answer to
   prayer when we pray in a wavering style.

   8. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. He sees double. He
   runs after two objects and, therefore, he staggers across the
   street--he "is unstable in all his ways."

   9. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted. Being
   lifted up by the Grace of God to sit among the princes of Israel!

   10. But the rich, in that he is made low. Hard work, this! Still, the
   child of God should rejoice in it, for now that he is stripped of
   earthly things, he finds his all in God.

   10-12. Because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the
   sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass,
   and the flower thereof falls, and the beauty of the fashion of it
   perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Blessed is
   the man that endures temptation. Or, "endures trial." Blessed is the
   man who is tried and tested, and who lives through it--who conquers,
   notwithstanding all the battle and struggle through which he passes. We
   would say, "Blessed is the man who is not tried," but it is not so. He
   who, bearing the heavy load, receives gracious strength to sustain him
   under it, gets a greater blessing than the man who escapes the burden.

   12,13, For when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which
   the Lord has promised to them that love Him. Let no man say when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God. That would be nonsense and falsehood!
   When a man is seduced to evil, when evil casts its attractive spell
   over him, let him not blame God!

   13, 14. For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts He any man:
   but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust and
   enticed. God tries men. God does not, in the sense in which the word is
   here used, tempt men. Satan tempts--God tries. But the same trial may
   be both a temptation and a trial--and it may be a trial from God's
   side, and a temptation from Satan's side, just as Job suffered from
   Satan and it was a temptation. But he also suffered from God through
   Satan, and so it was a trial to him.

   15. Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it
   is finished, brings forth death. That is the pedigree of sin--it is
   born of lust, and it brings forth dust. Any sin, whatever it is, if we
   cling to it and love it, will bring forth death--rest assured of that!
   The only hope we can have of eternal life is by being parted from sin.
   That must be taken away from us; for there shall never enter into
   Heaven anything that defiles. We have, from day to day, to fight
   against sin till it is utterly put away from us.

   16, 17. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every
   perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights,
   with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. God never
   turns from us, nor, in any way whatever, changes. He is the same God,
   ready always to bless us, ready to save us tonight as much as any other
   Thursday night! Ah, dear Friends, what variableness we have! The other
   day we were frostbitten and crying out with the cold. And now, tonight,
   perhaps, we feel dull, stupid and heavy because it is so hot! Yet, what
   a mercy it is that God has no vari-

   ableness, neither shadow of a turning, and we may come to Him, tonight,
   and say, "Lord, visit us as You are known to do! Revive us and refresh
   us. Put us into a lively, brisk, happy frame of mind tonight and send
   us on our way rejoicing."

   18. Of His own will He begat us with the Word of Truth, that we should
   be a kind offirst fruits of His creatures. We are His creatures, but we
   are better than His other creatures, for he has made us twice over! We
   are his twice-born creatures and we are the first ripe fruit of His
   creation, dedicated to His praise, gathered to His Glory--"a kind of
   first fruits of His creatures." Oh, that God would help us to honor Him
   and to live truly consecrated to Him!

   19. Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear. It
   is a great thing to have an open ear. Some are very slow to hear,
   especially to hear the Word of God and the voice of God speaking that
   Word. Oh, to have our ears unstopped that we may hear every syllable of
   the Truth of God gladly, cheerfully, retentively! God grant us that
   swiftness of hearing tonight!

   19. Slow to speak, slow to wrath. For, sometimes, when men are very
   quick to speak, they are also very quick in other respects as well--and
   volubility may be accompanied by a tendency to heat or passion. "Slow
   to speak, slow to wrath."

   20. For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God. Satan does
   not cast out Satan! Anger does not overcome evil. We may think we do
   well to be angry, but that will very seldom be the case.

   21. Therefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
   and receive with meekness the engrafted Word of God which is able to
   save your souls. Perhaps you have seen a man grafting a tree. What a
   gash he makes in the tree before he puts in the graft! How he wounds it
   to make the sap flow into the new wood! If the Lord has made any of
   your hearts bleed, tonight, by the sharp cutting of His Spirit, we are
   not sorry, if it shall the better prepare you for receiving the grafts
   of His own Nature, and His own Word.

   22. But be you doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
   own selves. It is a pity when a man deceives him-self--he must be an
   arch-deceiver!

   23-25. For if any is a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, he is like
   unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholds
   himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man
   he was. But whoso looks into the perfect Law of liberty, and continues
   therein. Perseverance to the end is needed--"Continues therein."

   25. He being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man
   shall be blessed in his deed. The blessedness of true religion lies
   very much in the practical effect of it. Hearing is pleasant, but doing
   is the effectual proof of Grace.

   26. If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his
   tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain. James
   settles that matter off very peremptorily. An unbridled tongue
   indicates a godless heart.

   27. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
   visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
   ourselves unspotted from the world. This is not the secret part of
   religion. Of that we read elsewhere. But this is the very dress that
   true religion puts on--charitably caring for the most destitute of our
   fellow creatures, and holy walking, that we are not as the men of the
   world are--"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
   this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
   keep ourselves unspotted from the world."

Three Blessings of the Heavenly Charter

   (No. 2314)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JUNE 25, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   16, 1889.

   "You have granted me life and favor, and Your visitation has preserved
   my spirit." Job 10:12.

   IT is well, sometimes, to sit down and take a grateful review of all
   that God has done for us, and with us, from our first day until now. We
   must not be like hogs under the oak, that eat the acorns but never
   thank the tree, or the Lord who made it grow. We must not receive the
   dew and yet never think of the Heaven from which it comes. To be
   ungrateful is to be unmanly--to be ungrateful to God is to commit high
   treason against the majesty of His goodness. I think that an hour would
   be well spent, by any person here, in sitting quietly and going over
   his autobiography. Turn over the pages of your diary--if you have none
   written, turn over the pages of your memory--and think of all that God
   has done for you from the day when you hung upon your mother's breast
   until the present moment--

   "Streams of mercy, never ceasing,

   Call for songs of loudest praise." But God does not hear the songs
   ofpraise because we let the streams of mercy glide by unnoticed. Far
   too often, we--

   "Let His mercies lie

   Forgotten in unthankfulness,

   And without praises die."

   We do not even put a tombstone over their graves, but let them lie as
   dead things, uncared for, forgotten, out of mind.

   If there is any time when it is unlikely for us to think of God's
   mercies, but when it would be especially wise for us to do so. If there
   is one time more unlikely than another, it is when we are in great
   trouble. Here is poor Job, covered with sore boils, sitting on a
   dunghill, scraping himself with a bit of a broken pot. His children are
   dead. His property destroyed and even his wife not giving him a word of
   comfort--and his friends acting in a most unfriendly manner. Now it is
   that he talks to his God and says, "You have granted me life and favor,
   and Your visitation has preserved my spirit." You are very ill--think
   of the time when you were well. You are poor--remember when you washed
   your feet in milk and your steps with butter--and had more than heart
   could wish. Friends have forsaken you--remember when you had plenty of
   friends.

   "Oh!" you say, "that will be rubbing salt into the wound." No, no, I
   trust not. You will remember that you were not always unhappy, that you
   were not always full of pain. God has spared your life and given you
   many favors. If you do not feel that you can bless Him for the present
   moment, yet forget not to bless Him for the past. And when you once
   begin to do that, you will soon find that your praise will overlap the
   past and cover the present--if it does not even run into the future!
   Only begin to praise God and you will find that he who praises God for
   mercy will never be long without a mercy for which to praise Him! I
   therefore invite those of you who are sad, tonight, to think of God's
   past goodness and, as I trust that the larger proportion here will not
   be found in that condition, I urge you to lead the way in taking a
   happy retrospect, tonight, of all that God has done for you in
   Providence and Grace.

   Job gives us, here, a charter with three blessings in it--"You have
   granted me life and favor, and Your visitation has preserved my
   spirit." These are choice favors! As we dwell upon them, may our hearts
   gratefully bless God for all that He has done for us!

   I. The first blessing of this heavenly charter is LIFE--"You have
   granted me life."

   Well, I think that we ought to thank God that we have lived at all. I
   know the pessimist version of the psalm of life is that, "'Tis
   something better not to be." Perhaps it would have been something
   better if that gentleman had not been--

   better, I should think, for his wife and family if they had not had to
   live with such a miserable creature! But the most of us thank God for
   our being, as well as for our well-being. We count it something not to
   be stones, or plants, or "dumb, driven cattle." We are thankful to be
   intelligent beings with powers of thought and capable of mental and
   spiritual enjoyment. Truly, O Lord, it is no small thing to be, even to
   be a man, for what is man? Well, with all his sin, yet as You did make
   him, when he had no sin, he was but a little lower than the angels and
   You did make him to have dominion over all the works of Your hands. You
   have made him immortal! You have made him a king! You have crowned him
   with glory and honor and if he does but know his destiny, and works it
   out aright, You have made him to be glorified with Yourself--You have
   made him to stand even higher than the angels, now that You have
   redeemed him, for he has tasted of a love which unfallen angels could
   not know!

   If you choose to make your being to be your eternal curse, why, you
   must do it, I suppose--but not without our tears. But if you are
   rational beings, and use your reason reasonably, you will thank God
   that you live and pray that your life may always be a blessing to you.

   But we also thank God that we have lived on in spite of many perils.
   There are some here who ought very much to thank God that they live on
   after the perils through which they have passed. It was something to
   find ourselves alive after the terrible thunderstorm of the week before
   last. It is something to be alive after an earthquake, or a tremendous
   storm at sea, or to be alive in the midst of a pestilence, or alive
   after a battle, to be alive after some fearful accident--to be alive, I
   say, when there are so many gates to the grave--

   "The rising morning can't assure

   That we shall end the day,

   For death stands ready at the door

   To take our lives away."

   And yet, despite all these things, we are still here! Some of you, not
   long ago, were very ill. It was thought that you would die--you thought
   so yourself, you were brought very low--and yet here you are! While
   others have died, you are still spared. You went hard by the gates of
   death and seemed to look into eternity for a while, but you were
   allowed to pass on and you are yet among the living, to praise God, as
   I hope you are doing this very day!

   Yes, it is God's Grace that has granted us life. I find that, in the
   Hebrew, it reads, "lives," as if we had several lives, as though, if we
   had not had many lives, we should not have had any life at this moment.
   But life upon life has come to us, like wave upon wave at sea and,
   whereas one might have washed us on the shore of death, another has
   carried us back to the sea of life, again, and still we live!

   I am addressing some from whom our text asks for gratitude because they
   are alive notwithstanding constitutional weakness. Perhaps from a child
   you were always feeble. Oftentimes you have asked yourself, "How is it
   that I have lived? Strong and hearty men and women have died before me
   and I, who have always been ailing, find that the creaking door hangs
   long on its hinges." Well, do not creak more than you can help, but
   bless God that you are not taken off the hinges! It is really very
   marvelous how some live, even, to old age when every day they seem to
   be on the very verge of departure. We account for their continued life
   by this fact, that they can say with Job, "You have granted me life."
   Let us praise God, then, even if we can only do it with a feeble
   tongue, for it is something, to still live.

   And I am speaking to a great many here to whom this text should commend
   itself because they have lived so long. I suppose that, in no other
   place in London, or perhaps in the world, is there so large a number of
   old men and women gathered together as in this Tabernacle. One is often
   struck with the snow that lies about this place on the heads of so
   many. Do not blame us for getting old! We were all young, together, and
   I remember that many here were introduced into the Church as young men
   and young women. Nearly 40 years ago they said of me, "He takes into
   the Church a parcel of boys and girls." Well, they have been cured of
   that fault, if it was a fault, long ago! And now, perhaps, some will
   complain that they are old! We do not complain--we are so much nearer
   Heaven. But when I look upon some dear friends, here, who have passed
   even their four-score years, who have quite run out their lease and now
   are living upon sufferance, as I trust they may for years to come--and
   when I remember what a poor tottering fabric this tent-body of ours is,
   I am amazed that we still live on!--

   "Our life contains a thousand springs,

   And dies if one is gone.

   Strange that a harp of thousand strings

   Should keep in tune so long."

   Yet it has kept in tune so long and we ought to bless God, tonight,
   those of us who are somewhere between 50 and a hundred, and others who
   are somewhere between 60 and 200 ought to bless God, tonight, that we
   have been spared so long, and say, in the language of the text, "You
   have granted me life and favor." You need not be frightened about that
   200 that I mentioned--you will not, any of you, be likely to reach that
   figure! If any of us live for a century, we shall have done exceedingly
   well! We may thank God if we do not live as long as that, for, while it
   is well to live here, it is better for us, after all, before our
   infirmities multiply, to be up and away to our Father's house above!

   Think of this a little longer, "You have granted me life." You have
   thought of the perils through which you have passed and the weaknesses
   that you have survived. Now think, beloved Friends, of the sin which
   might have provoked God to make an end of such a guilty life. Am I not
   speaking to some here who have lived without any thought of God, their
   Maker? Up till this time, God has fed you and preserved you in being,
   and yet you have not even given Him a thought! It is an amazing thing
   that He should have spared your life in the midst of such wicked
   ingratitude. Perhaps, my Friend--I hope it is not so--but perhaps you
   have been worse than this, and that mouth of yours has uttered
   blasphemies, and the members of your body have been given over to
   uncleanness. If you will look back, tonight, it will be a wonder to
   you, that you, perhaps professedly an atheist, possibly a drunk--you
   may be setting an evil example to wife and children and doing evil on
   all sides--but you have been spared!

   One seems to say, "Cut down that upas tree, it drips with poison!" But
   God puts away the axe and He still spares you. Did you not, this very
   day, imprecate a curse upon yourself, and yet the curse has not come?
   There was a tract that used to be given away and which did much good.
   It was called, "The Swearer's Prayer." If every swearer would look upon
   his dreadful imprecation as a prayer, for such it is, he might well
   wonder that God has not, long ago, blasted him as he has said, like
   some oak of the forest that we have seen struck by lightning, standing
   there with its stag's-horn branches high in the air, a monument of what
   Divine Judgment can do! God has granted you life, yet nothing in that
   life has been pleasing to Him, or good for your fellow men. Thank Him
   that He has not yet cut you down as a cumberer of the ground!

   But even if I speak to the best man and woman here, to those who have
   tried to be useful and are endeavoring to be holy, yet, dear Friends,
   what poor failures we are, after all! There is not one of us who can
   boast! We have to lay our hands upon our mouths and bow ourselves into
   the very dust. Truly, Lord, You have let us live, although we have done
   so little, and done that little so faultily. We can, tonight, praise
   You, and each one say, "You have granted me life."

   I might thus continue to show you that our preservation in life is a
   theme for great gratitude--"You have granted me life." But if we can
   say this in a higher sense, "You have granted me life," spiritual life,
   how much greater should our gratitude be! I could not even feel the
   guilt of sin, I was so dead, but You have granted me life to repent. I
   could not look to Jesus as my Savior and find rest in Him, but You have
   granted me life to believe in Him. Oh, what a mercy it is to have
   spiritual life! I do not like to ask you whether you have it. I do not
   think that that ever ought to be a matter of question with anybody. A
   man is either alive or dead and he must know which he is--and however
   faint and feeble he may be, the very feeling of faintness and
   feebleness is a sign of life--for the dead man does not even feel that!

   If, tonight, you have only life enough with which to groan, to weep and
   to cry to God, thank God for it, and say, "You have granted me life."
   But if you have that little life, do not be satisfied with it. Pray to
   have life more abundantly, that you may come to joy and peace through
   believing, that you may have the full assurance of faith, that you may
   be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, that you may tread
   down sin and may serve the Lord in your day and generation, and bring
   hundreds and thousands to Christ! Pray that it may be so and then, as
   each single increase of power comes to you, sing, in the words of the
   Patriarch, "You have granted me life." Oh, for more life! Do you feel
   dull and dead tonight? Cry to God to grant you life! Cry for Divine
   Grace and then, when it comes, gratefully say, "You have granted me
   life."

   II. The second blessing of this heavenly charter is DIVINE FAVOR--"You
   have granted me life and favor."

   Have you ever thought of the many favors that God has bestowed upon
   you, even upon some of you who, as yet, have never tasted of His Grace?
   What a favor it is to many to be sound in body! Dear friends are here
   tonight who have not seen the light of the sun for many a day. God is
   gracious to them in their blindness, but do you not think that we ought
   to praise Him for our eyesight? There are many beloved Christian
   friends who used to sit on this lower platform and around here, for
   although they were deaf, they could hear my voice in the preaching of
   the Gospel. But with great sorrow

   they have come to me, one by one, and said, "I cannot even hear with
   the trumpet now, I am getting so deaf." Bless God for your ears, if you
   still have the use of them--and take heed how you hear! Why, there is
   not a single faculty that God has given but what we ought to be
   thankful for it! When you see around you these who are crippled, those
   who are deprived of one limb or one sense, should you not say, "You
   have granted me life and favor"? They have favors, too, for which to
   thank God, but you have this particular favor which is denied to them.
   Do not fail to thank the Lord for it.

   It is a great mercy to have been born of good and honest parents and
   not to be the inheritors of disease, as some are who are born to a life
   of sorrow by no fault of their own. Be grateful for your ancestry,
   young man, if you have sprung of good sound stock, and say, "You have
   granted me life and favor." Do not go and give that body to the devil,
   I beseech you! Do not go and plunge yourself into vice and sin if God
   has restrained your ancestors from evil. By His Grace, may you also be
   kept back and enabled to say, "You have granted me life and favor, and
   I cannot sin against Your favor"!

   I cannot help reminding you, here, of the great favor of God in the
   matter of soundness of mind. There is a dear friend who has gladly
   heard the preaching of the Gospel, here, but now he has to be confined
   in an asylum, for it would be dangerous to have him at liberty. There
   is another and we often meet with such, who seemed as cheerful and
   happy as any of us, but he has now sunk into deep despondency. I have
   often prayed God to let me go anywhere sooner than into an asylum. It
   seems so dreadful to lose one's reason. Be grateful that you have your
   senses. Surely you must already be lunatics if you do not bless God
   that you are not lunatics! There must be a madness in your heart if you
   do not thank Him for sparing you from so terrible a trial. These favors
   are looked upon as very common things--a sound mind and a sound
   body--but if they were universal, they would still be mercies for which
   we ought specially to bless the name of the Lord.

   I speak to many here to whom God has also given a comfortable lot in
   life. You work and you work pretty hard, but still, you are not starved
   and you are not ground to death by forced labor. There are many in this
   House of Prayer who ought to be very grateful for the easy
   circumstances in which they are found. Why am I talking about these
   things? Why, because I want, by stirring you up to gratitude, to bind
   you with cords of thankfulness to God! Will you not thank Him who has
   done so much as this for you? If you were suddenly brought into the
   deepest poverty and the most painful sickness, and did not know where
   to lay your heads, you would then reproach yourselves to think that
   when your lives were cast in pleasant places, and you had a goodly
   heritage, you were not more grateful and more obedient to the God of
   Love.

   Some here, too, some few, at any rate, have been favored with much
   prosperity. O self-made men, do not begin to adore yourselves because
   you made yourselves, for if you made yourselves, you are poor sticks, I
   know! I would not trust myself to make myself, I would make an awful
   mess of myself. No, thank God for your prosperity and devote your
   wealth to His service, who granted it to you. Grow not purse-proud! Be
   not exalted above measure among your fellow men! The more you have, the
   more you owe to God--therefore be humble and be devoted to Him who has
   treated you with so much favor.

   And I may say, tonight, that in this congregation, God has given you
   the favor of hearing the Gospel--no mean favor, let me remind you.
   Multitudes, multitudes, multitudes are without it, perishing for lack
   of knowledge! And there are some who once heard the Gospel who are now
   far removed from the sound of it. Friends who once used to join in our
   great assembly are now far away in those parts of South America where
   as yet there is no Gospel teaching, or they are far away in the
   backwoods of America or Canada, or away in the bush in Australia,
   where, as yet, the Message of Mercy is not, at any rate, regularly
   brought to them, and they very much miss the means of Grace. Be
   thankful that you have the Gospel at almost every street corner and, if
   you are willing to hear it, you may hear it.

   Still, putting all these things together, they do not come up to this
   last point, that many of us have received the favors of saving
   Grace--"You have granted me life and favor." The highest favors of all,
   God has given to some of us--the favor of being chosen to be His from
   before the foundation of the world, the favor of being redeemed from
   among men, the favor of being called out by His effectual Grace, the
   favor of being renewed in the spirit of our minds, the favor of
   justification whereby we are made accepted in the Beloved--the favor of
   full, free, irreversible pardon, whereby our sin is blotted out
   forever, the favor of a Throne of Grace, the favor of answered prayer,
   the favor of Divine Providence which makes all things work together for
   our good, the favor of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit who is with
   us, and shall abide in us forever!

   I cannot run over the list of God's favors to His people, for it is too
   long. Only praise your God, each one of you, as you say tonight, "You
   have granted me life and favor." Happy people, thrice-happy people, of
   whom this is true! If we did not praise the Lord, the stones in the
   street might well cry out against us.

   III. The last blessing of the charter, upon which I shall be a little
   longer, is DIVINE VISITATION--"Your visitation has preserved my
   spirit." Does God ever come to man? Does He not? Yes, but it is a great
   wonder--"What is man, that You are mindful of him? And the son of man
   that You visit him?"

   May I remind some of you of how much you ought to praise God for His
   visitation? He visited you, first, with an awakening and conviction of
   sin. I remember when His Spirit came to me while I was yet a child, and
   made me feel a heavy burden on account of my childish sins. How I wept
   and cried, when alone, because I had been so guilty before God! And as
   a youth, that feeling still pursued me wherever I went. God visited me
   in the night, visited me often in the morning, when I woke up before
   anybody else, to read Baxter's, "Call to the Unconverted," and
   Alleine's, "Alarm," and suchlike books, over which I pored again and
   again, feeling the evil of my sin and having the sword of the Spirit
   piercing yet more deeply into my conscience at every page I read! I
   thank God for those early visitations! If any of you are having them
   now, quench not the Spirit of God! Be glad to know your real state as
   sinners while you are yet young. The visitations of God, in the form of
   conviction, if at first they bring us under bondage, are, nevertheless
   of the utmost value, for by these He preserves our spirit.

   After that first experience, there came visitations of enlightenment
   and conversion. Can you remember when Jesus first visited you and
   brought you up out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay? Does
   not your heart leap within you, even now, as you are ready to sing--

   "Happy day! Happy day! When Jesus washed my sins away"? Yes, God's
   visitations, by revealing Christ to your broken heart, preserved your
   spirit!

   Perhaps since then you have had visitations of another kind. You have
   had chastisement, or you have had affliction in the house. God's
   visitations are sometimes very unwelcome. We dread that He should come
   to afflict or chastise us and yet, in looking back upon all such
   experiences, I think that you can say, "Your visitation has preserved
   my spirit." I saw a young Sister, just before this service, and I said
   to her, "When did you find the Lord?" She replied, "It was when I was
   very ill." Yes, it is often so--God makes us ill in body that we may
   have time to think of Him, and turn to Him. "Your visitation has
   preserved my spirit." What would become of some people if they were
   always in good health, or if they were always prospering? Tribulation
   is the black dog that goes after the stray sheep and barks them back to
   the Good Shepherd! I thank God that there are such things as the
   visitations of correction and of holy discipline to preserve our spirit
   and bring us to Christ.

   But then, dear Friends, we have had other visitations, visitations of
   revival and restoration. Do you not sometimes get very dull and dead?
   Then you are glad to go and hear a sermon, or read some godly,
   soul-stirring book, or meet with some Christian friend, and you say
   afterwards, "Well, I do not know how it is, but I seem quite different
   from what I was. I have made a new departure, I have started off
   again." I think that some of our friends have need to do that,
   tonight--it will not hurt any of us if we all seem to begin again,
   tonight, and take Jesus Christ into our heart once more, and let Him
   come as He came at the first, and be like a new Christ to us! Let us
   joy and rejoice in Him with our first love and our early delights.
   Lord, give us that visitation, tonight, and revive our spirits! Oh,
   what visitations of joy He sometimes gives us when He comes very near
   to us! We do not hardly know how to bear it! We cry when the vessel
   gets quite full, "Hold, Lord, I cannot bear more of Your joy." "Ah!"
   you say, "we do not know much about that experience." Do you not? Then
   pray the Lord to visit you often, that you may know more about it!

   The best of all is when the Lord visits us and never goes away, but
   stays with us always, so that we walk in the light of His Countenance,
   and go from strength to strength, always singing, "Your visitation
   never ended, daily continued, preserves my spirit." You have all heard
   the phrase, generally used by juries at a coroner's inquest when a man
   has died suddenly, "Died by the visitation of God." No doubt some do
   thus die, but I want you to live by the visitation of God! That is a
   very different thing and that is the only way in which we truly can
   live--by God's visiting us from day to day-- preserving our spirit from
   the dangers that surround us. Live, then, by the visitation of God!

   You are sick, my Friend. Your heart is sick. Sin, like a grievous
   disease, is destroying you. The cancer of an evil habit is eating into
   your very vitals. What is to be done with you? Nothing but that Jesus
   Christ the Lord should come and give you a gracious visitation, come
   and look you in the face and feel your pulse, and lay His hand on your
   heart, and change it, and make you a new creature! And He will do all
   that if you send for Him. Doctors have a night bell, you know, and a
   night-tube, by which they may be called in cases of urgency. Now ring
   God's night bell at once, and speak up that tube of prayer, "Lord, I am
   sick unto death! Come and heal me. Come and heal me!" Will not somebody
   in these pews, now, without the use of a word, yet say in the silence
   of his heart, "Lord, I am sorely vexed; I am sick unto death with sin;
   come and heal me"? And Jesus Christ will say, "I will come and heal
   you." Then will you say, "Your visitation has preserved my spirit."

   You know how a farm will sometimes get smothered with weeds and things
   seem to go all wrong. What is the matter? On enquiry, you find that the
   farmer has been out on the Continent, he has been away from his farm.
   Well, then, of course the farm goes wrong! But have him back, again,
   and the farmer's eye does more than his hand--his foot manures the
   ground wherever he stands--and things soon get on better. Now, if the
   farm of your nature has fallen into a bad state, you need the
   Husbandman back. You need the Lord Jesus to come and survey the estate
   and give directions as to what is to be done to it. He will soon set
   the whole place right! Yes, if your farm has become like a desert, bare
   as the palm of your hand, He can come and turn it to fertility--He can
   make the wilderness like Eden, and the desert like the Garden of the
   Lord. A visitation from the Lord Jesus Christ is what we all need when
   we are barren and dead.

   May we expect it? Yes, He came on a visit here, once. We did not see
   Him when He came, but there were some who saw Him. You remember how
   George Herbert quaintly sings of His laying aside His azure mantle and
   making the sky with it? And taking off His bright rings, and hanging
   them up as stars?--

   "He did descend, undressing all the way And when they asked what He
   would wear, He smiled, and said as He did come, He had new clothes
   a-making here below." And poor clothes they were, when He was born of
   the Virgin and lived in our inferior clay! He paid us a visit, but men
   did not let Him lodge comfortably. There was no room for Him in the
   inn. It was a sorry entertainment that they gave Him, for they pierced
   His side before He went away, and He carried with Him the marks in His
   hands and feet that He had received in the house of His friends. Well,
   but still, having once come, and died on this earth, He knows the way--
   and as He cannot die again, He will come again--and now, tonight, in
   spirit, by His Spirit, He will come to you, if you only cry to Him,
   "Come." If you cry to Him, "Come," tonight, that will be only the echo
   of what He says, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy
   laden." He cries, "Come," catch up that word, and say, "Come." Echo
   His, "Come," by your own, "Come"--and you two will meet before the
   service is over, though we have reached the last few minutes of it. May
   your, "Come," and Christ's, "Come," blend in one! Come, Lord Jesus,
   even so, come quickly, and set Your poor servants free from the taint
   of sin, and from the dread of the wrath of God!

   Yes, you need a visitation from Him who has already come and, beside
   that, He has sent His Holy Spirit to abide until He, Himself, descends
   from Heaven with a shout. The Holy Spirit is here in this assembly
   right now--plead and cry to Him for His visitation!

   And if my Lord will come anywhere, tonight, it is to you who think
   yourselves unfit for Him to come to you! To you who would give your
   eyes to have Him, but scarcely dare to hope that He will ever come to
   you! The Lord says, "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor
   and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at My Word." Do you not belong
   to that kind of people, trembling at God's Word, wishing only that you
   dared to hope in His mercy? Come, now, and cast yourselves on Jesus!
   Come, now, and trust yourselves with the great Savior who has ascended
   on high to give repentance and remission of sins, and who is ready to
   give both the repentance and the remission to every soul that is
   willing to have them! If you would have them, they are yours! Believe
   for eternal life. Believe now!

   The Lord grant you such a visitation that you may be constrained to
   believe, for Jesus' sake! Amen and Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON. PSALMS 6, 8.

   Psalm 6: Here the Psalmist asks for a visit from God, for he is sick at
   heart, heavy and depressed. Be very thankful if that is not your case,
   but if it is, be very grateful that here is a prayer ready-made for
   you. Here you are taught how to cry to God and what to expect from Him.
   If you are very sick and sad, you are not worse off than David was.
   Send for David's Physician--you cannot have a better doctor than the
   royal Physician! He who waited on King David is prepared to wait on
   you.

   1. O LORD, rebuke me not in Your anger. "Rebuke me. It will do me good.
   I need it, Lord, but not in anger! Be gentle and tender with
   me--'Rebuke me not in Your anger.'"

   1. Neither chasten me in Your hot displeasure. "Chasten me. It may be
   that the rod will be very curative to me, but let not the chastening be
   given in Your hot displeasure. Be not very angry with Your poor sinful
   servant. If You do not turn away Your rod, yet turn away Your wrath. It
   is a sweet prayer. Some people cry to God about their sickness. It is
   much better to cry to God about the cause of it--that is to say if it
   is a chastisement for sin, get rid of the sin--and the rod will then be
   removed.

   2. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my
   bones are vexed. "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak." This was
   a sweet reason for David to urge--"For I am weak." He could not say,
   "For I am worthy." He would not have dared to say that. He could not
   say that when he said, "Have mercy," for mercy is for the unworthy.
   Justice is for the good! MERCY is for those who are guilty! "Have mercy
   upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are
   vexed." Plead the greatness of your disease as a reason for the remedy.
   Do not come with your self-righteousness--that will hinder you. Come
   with your sorrow and your sin, your weakness and your pain, and plead
   these before God.

   3. My soul is also sorely vexed. That is worse than the bones being
   vexed. "The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded
   spirit who can bear?"

   3. But You, O LORD, how long? There is the pith of the prayer. David is
   troubled because God is away from him. He has lost communion with his
   Lord. He has gotten out of fellowship with his God and here comes the
   most necessary cry of

   all--

   4. Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for Your mercies' sake.
   Will not that prayer suit you who are here, tonight, you who are full
   of sin and are heart-broken about it, and dread the wrath to come? I
   put this prayer into your mouths and pray the Holy Spirit to put it
   into your hearts--"Oh save me for Your mercies' sake."

   5. For in death there is no remembrance of You: in the grave who shall
   give You thanks? As much as to say, "If You let me die, You will lose
   one singer out of Your earthly choir. But if You will let me live, I
   will remember You--I will praise You; I will give You thanks." Do you
   feel like saying, tonight, "Lord, if You shall destroy me, You will
   gain nothing by it. But if You will save me, there will be one who will
   give You thanks forever"? I have told you, sometimes, of that old woman
   who said, "If the Lord saves me, He shall never hear the last of it."
   And you and I can also say that if He saves us, He shall never hear the
   last of it--we will praise Him throughout eternity for His great
   salvation!

   6. I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I
   water my couch with my tears. David was in a very sorry case when he
   wrote these words. So great was his pain, so acute his sorrow that all
   the sluices of his eyes were pulled up and he seemed to float his bed
   in tears and to be like George Herbert when he wrote--

   "O who will give me tears?

   Come, all you springs,

   Dwell in my head and eyes!

   Come, clouds and rain--

   My grief has need of all the watery things,

   That Nature has produced!

   Let every vein suck up a river to supply my eyes,

   My weary, weeping eyes, too dry for me,

   Unless they get new conduits, new supplies,

   To bear them out and with my state agree."

   7. My eyes are consumed because of grief. He had almost wept his eyes
   out--they grew red with his weeping, so that he could not see.

   7. It waxes old because of all my enemies. His eyesight grew dim, like
   that of an old man. A cataract of grief had put a cataract of blindness
   into his eyes.

   8. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity. He needs his God to
   come to him, so he bids God's enemies clear out. If we keep company
   with the wicked, we cannot invite God to our house and expect Him to
   come. "Depart from me," says David, "all you workers of iniquity." "You
   who are singing what you call a jolly song, be off with you! You who
   are merry with your jokes against religion, be gone far from me."

   8. For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping. "And if He has heard
   my tears, I do not need you to be here. I cannot associate with God's
   enemies, now that He has heard the voice of my weeping." Is not that a
   beautiful expression, "The voice of my weeping"? Why, there was no
   sound, was there? Yet there are songs without words and there are
   voices without sounds.

   9. The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
   "I thought at first that He would not take my petition; but I see He
   stretches out His right hand. He receives my prayer--and if He receives
   my prayer, I shall soon receive His answer."

   10. Let all my enemies be ashamed and sorely vexed: let them return and
   be suddenly ashamed. Now let us read the Eighth Psalm in which David
   expresses great wonder that God, whom he had asked to visit him, should
   deign to do so. I think I see him sitting with his window open. It is
   night and he is feeling better--and he bids them throw open the window
   and he sits and looks at the stars, glad of the cool, fresh air.

   Psalm 8:1. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the
   earth! Who has set Your Glory above the heavens? They are very high,
   but Your Glory is higher than the heavens.

   2-4. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have You ordained strength
   because of Your enemies, that You might still the enemy and the
   avenger. When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the
   moon and the stars, which You have ordained; what is man, that You are
   mindful of Him? And the son of man, that You visit him? He, whose voice
   rolls the stars along, who makes those bright worlds to fly like sparks
   from the anvil of His Omnipotence, how can He stoop so low as to regard
   His fallen creature, man, who is so small, so insignificant?

   5, 6. For You have made him a little lower than the angels, and have
   crowned him with glory and honor. You made him to have dominion over
   the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet. Man is
   God's viceroy. He reigns over God's works in God's name. Let him not
   set up to be a king and try to usurp the honor of his great Lord, the
   Imperator, the Universal Governor!

   7, 8. All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of
   the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths
   of the seas. What a king, man is! Let him not be cruel to the beasts of
   the field; let him not be a tyrant; God did not make him for that
   purpose. Let his reign be generous and kind--and if the animals must
   suffer, yet spare them as much suffering as possible. O man, be you a
   generous viceroy, for you are under a most generous King who is,
   Himself, the happy God and who delights in the happiness of all His
   creatures!

   9. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth! Thus
   does the Psalmist finish as he began the Psalm, by praising the name of
   the Lord.

Paul Apprehended and Apprehending

   (No. 2315)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 2, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 30,
   1889.

   "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfected;
   but I press on, that I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus." Philippians 3:12.

   OBSERVE the Apostle's condition when he wrote these words. I do not
   think that either you or I will be found to be in a better one. If any
   are, or think they are, I would suggest a question. I, for my part,
   would be satisfied to be just as Paul was.

   He was in a position of conscious safety. He was a saved man. He knew
   that he was saved, for he rejoiced in Christ Jesus and had no
   confidence in the flesh. He knew that he was justified by faith in
   Christ Jesus and he counted all his own works, which formerly were his
   ground of trust, to be as dross and dung, that he might win Christ. He
   was a saved man and he knew it! I do not think that he often had doubts
   about that point, but yet he was in a state of conscious
   imperfection--"Not as though I had already attained, either were
   already perfected." He had not yet reached his own ideal of what a
   Christian might be. He had not yet obtained from Christ all that he
   expected to obtain. He was not sitting down to rest and be thankful,
   but he was still hurrying on, reaching after something which was yet
   beyond him. He could not say, "Soul, take your ease, you have much
   goods laid up for many years," but he still felt his own spiritual
   poverty, and he cried, "Not as though I had already attained, either
   were already perfected."

   But, Beloved, let not that thought be any kind of solace to you, for I
   would remind you that though consciously imperfect, Paul was zealously
   making progress. He says, "I press toward the mark for the prize of the
   high calling of God in Christ Jesus." I know many who say that they are
   imperfect and they seem to be quite satisfied to be so. That was never
   the case with the Apostle--as long as any trace of a sinful nature or a
   sinful tendency remained in him, it made him cry out, "O wretched man
   that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" It was
   not because he was dead in sin that he cried in that way. It would be a
   new thing in this world for a sinner dead in sin to cry so, but because
   he was already largely delivered from sin and the reigning power of it
   had been broken! Therefore he felt the burden of any sort of contact
   with sin. A man who is in the sea, taking a plunge deep down under the
   water, does not feel the weight of the water. But bring him out on the
   shore, put a great tub of water on his head--and see what a weight that
   is to him! So, while a man is in sin as his element, it is no burden to
   him, but when he is out of it, and not under its power, then he feels
   the weight of it, he grows weary under it and would gladly be rid of
   every particle of it.

   The Apostle, I say, was conscious of imperfection, but he was also
   conscious that he was making progress, that he was running towards a
   mark, that he was leaving much behind him, and was pressing toward that
   which was before him. He was also in a state of anxious aspiration. He
   desired that he might be found in Christ, that he might attain unto the
   resurrection from among the dead, that he might, in a word, grasp that
   for which Christ had grasped him. I am going to talk about that double
   grasp, tonight--"That I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus,"

   Notice that there are two forces here mentioned which are at work in
   every gracious man. There is Christ's power by which He apprehends us
   and then there is the new power, the new life of God-given faith, by
   which we, in our turn, seek to apprehend that for which Christ has
   apprehended us. Christ has apprehended us for a purpose--we wish to
   realize that purpose even to the fullest. That is the intent of the
   Apostle's words. Let us consider them in detail.

   I. First, let us think of PAUL'S APPREHENSION BY CHRIST JESUS.

   We do not often use the word, "apprehended," now, in the sense in which
   it is here used. The only instance that I remember is when we speak of
   a policeman apprehending a person, that is, laying hold upon him,
   seizing him. At his conversion, Paul had been apprehended by his Lord.
   Take the word, "apprehend," in the sense of arresting him, and it
   stands true of Saul of Tarsus. I need not repeat the story--you all
   know how that desperate rebel was going down to Damascus to persecute
   the saints of God. Nothing was further from his mind than the thought
   of becoming a Christian, but while he was riding the high horse and
   Damascus lay below him, just like a sheep within reach of a wolf, the
   Lord Jesus Christ stepped in and laid His hand on his shoulder--

   "Thus the eternal counsel ran, 'Almighty Grace, arrest that man!'" And
   almighty Grace arrested him! He fell to the earth at the first blow. He
   was blinded with the second. No, not so much by a blow as by the
   greatness of the Light of God that shone round about him! And there he
   lay prostrate, broken in heart and blind in eyes--he had to be led into
   the city--and one of those poor men whom he had determined to haul to
   prison had to come and pray for him, that his eyes might be opened,
   that he might be baptized, and that he might thus make his confession
   of faith in Christ! He well says that he was "apprehended of Christ
   Jesus." The King sent no sheriffs officer to arrest him, but He came,
   Himself, and took him into Divine custody, laid him by the heels for
   three days in the dark--and then let him out into glorious liberty, an
   altogether changed man--to go forth to preach that faith which before
   he had sought to destroy!

   You may not all be able to remember any special day when you were
   apprehended by Christ, but some of us do. We remember when we, who had
   been formerly carried captive by the devil at his will, found ourselves
   arrested by One stronger than Satan. We managed, by Divine Grace, to
   escape from the clutches of the devil, but we could not escape from
   that dear pierced hand when once it was laid upon us! We surrendered
   ourselves prisoners. There was no resisting, any longer, when His
   mighty Grace came in to arrest us. I say that some of us remember that
   day. Other days, notable for great events, have been forgotten, but the
   day when we were apprehended of Christ Jesus is stamped upon our
   memory, and always must be, even throughout eternity!

   Since then, dear Friends, we have always felt that grip, just as Paul
   always felt himself in Christ's grasp. We have never got away from that
   one arrest. It was not the work of a few minutes to be remembered and
   to be then ended, and all over. No, at this moment we feel the same
   Divine hand upon us! We are prisoners, this day, unto Christ, who alone
   has set us free by capturing us! There was a legend among the heathen
   of old times, that if persons saw certain spirits in the woods, they
   became, from that moment, wonderfully changed--they became possessed by
   the spirit which they saw! They had, as we say in our language, a
   twist. I remember when--

   "Isaw One hanging on a tree, In agonies and blood, Who fixed His
   languid eyes on me, As near His Cross I stood"

   and I have had a twist ever since! I never got over it and never expect
   to. I hope that twist will get a more and more powerful hold over me.
   It turned everything upside down. It changed the right into the left.
   It made the bitter sweet and the sweet bitter--the light darkness, and
   the darkness light. It was a wonderful twist and, as I say again, that
   twist still continues! When it has once been experienced, there is no
   escaping from it. We can say not only, "I was apprehended," but as the
   text has it, "I am apprehended of Christ Jesus." He still binds us with
   the fetters of His love. We still sit at His dear feet, enthralled by
   His beauties. We are still under the Omnipotent fascination of His
   altogether lovely face. We could not depart from Him if we would and we
   could not if we could! If we went away from Christ, to whom would we
   go? He has the Words of eternal life! His love holds and binds us
   faster than fetters of brass. We must forever be apprehended by Christ
   Jesus our Lord.

   Now, Beloved, this arrest of Paul by Christ was the force and motive of
   his whole later life. Because Paul had been apprehended by Christ, he
   began to live differently from what he had ever lived before. He had an
   apprehension that he had lived amiss. He had an apprehension that his
   evil life would end in eternal destruction. He fled away from all his
   apprehensions of the wrath to come, to the Christ who had apprehended
   him in quite another sense! He had thus been apprehended, pressed into
   the service of Christ and made, by that pressure, to become a
   volunteer, for here there is a paradox--all Christ's soldiers are
   pressed men and volunteers, too! There are two senses, the one in which
   Grace constrains

   them, and the other in which their will, being made truly free, runs
   delightfully after Christ! But having once been apprehended, the
   Apostle never shook off Christ's grasp--he began to live as an
   apprehended man. He said to himself, "I cannot follow the world, for
   Christ has apprehended me. I cannot go after false doctrine, for Christ
   has apprehended me and crucified me with Himself. I cannot cease to
   preach the Gospel. I cannot become a self-seeker. I cannot do anything
   but live for Him who died for me, for the Master has apprehended me. He
   has put me under parole to keep close to Him forever and I must not,
   cannot, dare not, would not leave Him! I am His apprehended one
   henceforth and even forever."

   I want your hearts to talk over this first part of the sermon. Never
   mind my faltering tongue--let your own hearts speak. If Christ has
   never apprehended you, well then, you have nothing to do with this
   matter, and you may leave it alone. But if He has arrested you,
   acknowledge the soft impeachment, tonight. Say in your heart, "Yes, He
   has, indeed, laid hold on me, and my heart's desire is that He would
   bring every thought into captivity to Him. From henceforth I would be
   led in triumph by Him, His captive all the days of my life, to show the
   power of His illustrious love, the victories of His Grace!" Oh, that we
   might, each one, say with Paul, "I am apprehended of Christ Jesus"!

   Ah, dear Souls, you who have never been apprehended of Him, I hope that
   you will be, tonight! I pray God that you may run away from your old
   master, the devil, and not give him even five minutes' notice, but just
   start off directly! And while you are a runaway slave, may my Divine
   Master come and lay His hand upon you and say, "You are Mine. You never
   did really belong to your old master and even though you promised and
   swore that you would be his, thus says the Lord, 'Your Covenant with
   death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with Hell shall not
   stand.' I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name, you are
   Mine, and now I only take what I bought on the tree. I take by power,
   by might, by main force, by Grace, what I purchased with the blood of
   My hands and feet and heart. I will have you, for you are Mine." Lord,
   will You thus arrest some sinner, tonight, to the praise of the glory
   of Your Grace?

   II. Now let us notice PAUL'S DESIRE TO APPREHEND THAT FOR WHICH THE
   LORD HAD APPREHENDED HIM.

   Well, why did Christ apprehend Paul? First, it was to convert him
   completely--to make a new man of him, to turn him from all his old ways
   and pursuits--and put him on quite a different road. Now, Brothers and
   Sisters, that is why the Lord apprehended us--to make us new creatures
   in Christ Jesus! Let us pray God to carry out that design to the
   fullest, to make us altogether new creatures. Do not let us be
   satisfied while there are any remains of the old nature--let us cry to
   the Lord to drive the Canaanites out--and though they have chariots of
   iron, let us, by Divine Grace, drive them all out! Pray, "Lord Jesus,
   You have come to turn me from every sin--turn me and I shall be turned!
   You have provided medicine for every disease--Lord, heal me and I shall
   be healed!"

   Do not be satisfied, any of you, with half a conversion! I am afraid
   that there are a great many who have not much more than half a
   conversion. I know a man--I hope he is converted, but I wish that the
   Lord would convert his temper. He prays very nicely, but you should see
   him when he is red in the face with anger at his wife! I know a man--I
   hope he is a Christian, it is not for me to judge--but I wish that the
   Lord would convert his pocket. It needs a button taken off, for it is
   very difficult to get it open! It is very easy to put something in, but
   hard to get anything out for any good purpose. I know a great many
   professing Christians who do not seem to have had what we might call a
   thorough conversion. We need the power which has arrested us to do its
   work completely--till there is not any part of us but what has been
   renewed by Grace and sanctified to the service and Glory of God.
   Brethren, seek to apprehend that for which Christ has apprehended you,
   namely, a thorough conversion, a turning of yourself from every evil
   way!

   But the Lord apprehended each one of His people, in the next place, to
   make them like to Christ This is the great design of electing
   love--"Whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed
   to the image of His Son." That is the great objective of the very first
   act of Divine Love--and whatever the Holy Spirit does in us, He does it
   with this aim to make us like unto the Firstborn among many brethren.
   This will be our satisfaction in eternity--"I shall be satisfied when I
   awake with Your likeness." Come, then, Beloved, if Christ has arrested
   us to make us like Himself, let us not rest till we have become more
   like He! Perhaps the Lord has made you like Christ in some respects,
   but not in all. Or if you are like Christ in all respects, yet the
   likeness is dim, shadowy, rather in outline than in filling-up. Though
   we may be likenesses of Christ, there is not one of us who does not
   need many touches before we shall be good likenesses! Some, I fear, are
   caricaturesof Christ. May the Lord have pity upon us if that is the
   case, and go on with His work, and take out

   all the blotches and blemishes, and paint the true portrait till. at
   last. everybody who sees us will say, "There is Christ in that man--he
   is a likeness of Christ"!

   We may not all be paintings on ivory. We may not all be taken on a
   sheet of silver, but the Lord's portrait, even though it is on a piece
   of clay, has still great beauties in it. And as He intends to make us
   like Christ, O Beloved, let us aspire to this! Come, get it into your
   voice and get it into your heart! You are to be like Christ and as you
   are to be so, and this is the very reason why Christ has arrested you,
   pine after it, thirst after it, labor after it! Trust God to work in
   you to will and to do of His own good pleasure, and while He is doing
   that, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling because it is
   God that works in you!

   If you turn to Paul's description of his own conversion, which he gave
   to Agrippa, you will find that the Lord said to him that He had
   appeared to him to make him a witness of that which he had seen, and of
   that which He would afterwards reveal to him. So, in the third place,
   we have been apprehended of Christ that we may be witnesses for Him,
   first seeinga great deal and then tellingwhat we have seen, which is
   the other sense of the word, "witness." A witness sees or hears and
   then he tells in court what he has seen or heard and so he becomes a
   witness to others as once he was a witness to himself. Now, the Lord
   has apprehended every Christian, here, to see their Savior, to see His
   Grace, to see His love, to see His power, to see all the wonders which
   the Holy Spirit works among men--and then to go and talk of these
   things to others, that they, also, hearing from the lips of a witness,
   may be led to believe by the power of the Holy Spirit!

   Beloved, if the Lord Jesus Christ has apprehended you that you may be a
   witness, be on the lookout! Keep your eyes open! See all that you can
   see. Every Prophet of olden times was called a Seer. You cannot
   prophesy to others until you have been a seeryourself! Pray that you
   may see all that is in the Word. Cry, "Open You my eyes, that I may
   behold wondrous things out of Your Law." Pray that you may see the
   movements of God in Providence, and may see the hand of God in your own
   heart and your own experience. Pray God, first, to make you a witness,
   an observer--and then tell out to others what you have tasted and
   handled and felt of the Word of life--and be a faithful witness for
   your Lord and Master all your days. Do not some professing Christians,
   who are here, tonight, feel a little uncomfortable? You have not yet
   seen all that you should see and have you not kept very much to
   yourselves what you have seen? I would that you could apprehend that
   for which also you are apprehended of Christ Jesus, seeing what He
   means you to see and then, telling out what He means you to tell. May
   the Lord instruct us more and more that we may fulfill all His good
   pleasure!

   But, next, we were converted in order to be the instruments of the
   conversion of others. Paul, when he was speaking to Agrippa, expressly
   mentioned how the Lord said, "Delivering you from the people, and from
   the Gentiles, unto whom now I send you, to open their eyes, and to turn
   them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that
   they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which
   are sanctified by faith that is in Me." So, you see, there was a
   certain number of souls for whom Paul was apprehended that he might be
   the instrument of their salvation! Our Lord Jesus Christ prayed,
   "Father, the hour is come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may
   glorify You: as You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should
   give eternal life to as many as You have given Him."

   Now, that power Christ distributes among His people. There is a certain
   number of persons who will receive eternal life through my ministry.
   There is a certain number who will receive eternal life through another
   man's ministry. I wonder how many have, in this way, been appointed to
   you, that you might be the means of their salvation? You were not saved
   that you might only go to Heaven--you were saved that you might take
   others there with you! In the olden days, when a man needed pigeons, he
   used to take a dove of his own and smear its wings all over with
   perfume, and then, when it was very sweet to smell, he threw it up into
   the air and it went into other dovecots, and all the pigeons went after
   it. And when it came back, it brought them home to its master. That was
   a roguish trick, but it is a blessed method of bringing poor flying
   doves to Christ! When your wings are sweet with Christ's love. When
   every time that you move, you perfume the air with holiness and mercy
   and Grace, others will flock around you and fly with you like doves to
   their windows!

   I like to think of the many that God has appointed me to bring to Him.
   I cannot tell you how many I have met during the past week--they have
   made my heart dance for joy. Last Tuesday, when we had a large company
   of deacons of our Metropolitan Churches here, one would steal up to me,
   as I sat there shaking hands, and say, "On such a day, I heard you
   preach from such a text. I was a careless young man, but you brought me
   to the Savior." Another would come and say, "God bless you, Sir! I
   remember when you were the means of leading me to the Savior." One took
   my hand with a

   ferocious grip and could not say a word till he had shed many a tear.
   These things make us very happy and my heart's desire is that I may get
   all that Christ means me to get, that I may apprehend all that, or
   them, for which He apprehended me!

   I want every Christian Brother and Sister, here, to feel the same.
   There is somebody in the world whom you have to bring to Christ. I do
   not know where he is, or who he is, but you had better look out for
   him. Come, seek now. Say, "I would not lose a single pearl, though it
   lies deep under the waves of the sea, if my great Lord intends me to
   dive for it, and bring it up into the Light." Get to your searching
   after the hidden treasures and be intent, day and night, in the power
   of the Spirit, that you may apprehend that measure of usefulness for
   which you were apprehended of Christ Jesus! It will be a high honor to
   appear, at last, as a winner of souls! Kings might doff their diadems
   and forget that they ever wore them, in comparison with that crown
   which God will give to those who turn many to righteousness, for they
   shall shine "as the stars forever and ever!" Aspire to this, my dear
   Friends, and lose none of those for which you have been apprehended of
   Christ Jesus your Lord.

   In the Acts of the Apostles we read that the Lord said to Ananias about
   Paul, "I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's
   sake." Well, now, some of you were apprehended on purpose that you
   might suffer for Christ's sake. Did I see you wince at that word? Well,
   but if usefulness by labor is an honor, usefulness by suffering is a
   still greater honor! In Heaven, the brightest crown that any saint
   wears is that which is set with the rubies of martyrdom. When I have
   read the stories of those holy men and women who died in Roman
   amphitheatres, or were burned to death over at Smithfield, yonder, I
   must confess that I have envied them. To preach Christ seems so little
   compared with having Grace enough to suffer for His name's sake! As one
   reads of their intense suffering, one naturally shrinks from it and
   says, "I thank God that I am not called to endure that trial." But yet,
   if we were called to it, we would have Grace given to us to bear it
   What an honor it was for them, for the sake of the Prince of martyrs,
   the Leader of the sacramental hosts of God's elect, to be able and
   willing to give themselves up to death!

   Well, you may be called to suffer for Christ's sake, but, at any rate,
   you are called to this--to lay your all upon His altar, to devote
   yourself, your substance, all that you are and all that you have, to
   His honor and Glory! You are apprehended of Christ Jesus for this
   purpose--try to apprehend it. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us resolve
   to live wholly unto Christ! Let us bid Him take our hands, feet, heart,
   eyes, brain and every faculty of our being! May God get as much glory
   as He can, out of us, or reflect as much of His Glory as is possible
   through even our weakness and infirmities! But this is why we have been
   apprehended of Christ Jesus, that we may be wholly and only the Lord's,
   "For the love of Christ constrains us because we thus judge, that if
   one died for all, then all died, and that He died for all, that they
   which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him
   which died for them, and rose again." Here is the prize of your high
   calling--are you ready to run for it? God help you to do so, to
   apprehend, in personal self-sacrifice, all that for which Christ has
   apprehended you!

   But that is not all. Paul said that he regarded himself as having been
   arrested by Christ that he might attain unto the resurrection from
   among the dead. Oh, when that trumpet peals out and the righteous
   arise, shall I arise? Or shall I lie rotting in the tomb another
   thousand years? And when He calls His saints together, when--

   "EEast and west, and south and north, Speeds each glorious angel forth,
   Gathering in with glittering wings Zion's saints to Zion's King,"

   shall we be there? Shall we behold the splendor of Christ's appearing?
   Shall we sit upon the Throne of God with Him, judging mankind? Shall we
   be forever with the Lord? It is for this that we are apprehended. Are
   you getting ready for this? Are you preparing, by His Grace, for that
   eternal future? I believe that all the saints will get to Heaven, but
   every saint ought to aspire not only to get there, but to carry, there,
   with him, that which will make his Heaven more glorious to God than it
   otherwise would be. Part of the joy of Heaven will be to remember what
   the Lord did by us. We are not going there to go to bed forever--we are
   going there to do some glorious work for Christ. How does He describe
   it? He says that if His servants have been faithful and diligent, He
   will say to one, "Have authority over ten cities," and another shall be
   ruler over five cities. As we have proved our ability, such will be the
   dominion that Christ shall give us throughout the ages to come! And a
   little failing, today, as it were the loss of a penny, may mean the
   loss of thousands of pennies

   in the world to come. You shall be as full as the greatest vessel, but
   you shall have smaller capacity. Look to that matter, now.

   I believe that every action in this mortal life thrills through
   eternity. Time and eternity are like one tremulous mass of jelly--if
   you touch one particle of it here, it trembles right through, and right
   throughout the ages. Not a word is spoken but the echo of it shall be
   heard when time shall be no more. Not a deed is done that dies,
   especially the deeds of quickened men and women! They know not what
   they do--they will be astonished to find, at the Last Great Day--what
   they have done, for the Lord will evidently surprise His people when He
   says, "I was hungry, and you gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave
   Me drink." They will say, "Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed
   You? Or thirsty, and gave You drink?" And if you apprehend to the
   fullest the great purpose of Christ in apprehending you, that it is not
   of debt, but of Grace--not of works, but of faith, yet, in the ages to
   come, you shall be surprised to find how the little that you did shall
   bring you great reward! God gives His people good works and then
   rewards them for them! He works in us to will and to do, and then we
   will and do and He gives us a reward for willing and doing!

   I wish, dear Friends, that in Heaven we might feel, "Well, I did as God
   helped me. I apprehended that for which my Master apprehended me." You
   have no idea what you are going to do in Glory. I expect, one day, to
   preach to an assembled universe concerning my Lord and Master, to tell
   to principalities and powers what Christ has done--not to sit with a
   lot of you good people, some listening to me, and some, perhaps,
   not--but to have angels, and principalities, and powers to be my
   congregation! And I want to learn to preach well, here, that they may
   be attentive to me. Each one of you who has served your Lord shall be a
   monument of His love and His mercy--and the angels shall stop and read
   what is inscribed on you! Oh, that there might be some good letters
   written on you, that when Gabriel stops to read, he may clap his hands
   and then fly with swifter flight, as he says, "Bless the Lord for what
   He did for that poor man, for what He worked in that poor woman! His
   Grace is conspicuous there." As you are to be seen throughout all
   eternity, may you be fit to be seen! May the Lord, of His Grace, work
   in you that which shall be to the praise of His Glory!

   III. I have done when I just take a minute or two to show THE LESSONS
   WHICH PAUL IS TEACHING US BY THIS TEXT.

   The first is this, make sure of your apprehension by Christ Jesus, so
   that you can talk like Paul about it, "That for which I am
   apprehended." Pray the Lord that you may feel His hand on your
   shoulder, that you may feel His Grace in your heart, His blessed
   fetters on your feet, His Divine manacles upon your wrists. Pray that
   you may have no doubt about it, but may know beyond all doubt that the
   Lord has arrested you.

   This being known, do not let it make you idle. Do not say, "Christ has
   arrested me; I am saved; nothing more is needed." No. Why has He
   arrested you? He has a purpose in it. That arrest was but the beginning
   of a great lifework. Let it not make you idle, but let it be your
   encouragement. If Christ has arrested you to be holy, He will make you
   holy. If Christ has arrested you for usefulness, be confident in
   seeking it. If Christ has arrested you to make you an eternal monument
   of His Grace, believe that you will be, and press forward to the mark
   for the prize of your high calling!

   Finally, let this lead you to hope for the salvation of others. Go
   forward hopefully in your service for others. Teach that Sunday school
   class with a firm belief that you were apprehended on purpose that John
   and Tom might be converted! Go and teach the girls and say, "I was
   apprehended to bring Mary, and Jane, and Louisa to Christ--and do not
   be at all doubtful about it." This is the purpose of God--expect it to
   be worked out! Go to your street corner, my beloved Brother, and preach
   away--even when the mob disturbs you! Go from door to door with your
   tracts, even though they may be cast in your face. Go, city
   missionaries and Bible-women, to your holy and righteous toil. Go, each
   one of you, to the work for which God has apprehended you, for as the
   Lord has apprehended you, it is for a purpose! And rest not until that
   purpose is fully established.

   May the Lord arrest some sinners, tonight! Pray, as you go down the
   aisles, "Lord, arrest them! Bring them to Your dear feet and save them
   this night, for Jesus' sake!" Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. PHILIPPIANS 3.

   The Holy Spirit indited this Epistle by the pen of His servant, Paul.
   May He also write it on our hearts!

   Verse 1. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. When you get to,
   "finally." When you are very near the end of your journey, still,
   "rejoice in the Lord." "Finally," says Paul, as if this were the end of
   his Epistle, the conclusion of all his teaching--"Finally, my brethren,
   rejoice in the Lord." But never do it finally! Never come to an end of
   it! Rejoice in the Lord and yet, again, rejoice, and yet, again,
   rejoice--and as long as you live, rejoice in the Lord.

   1. To write the same things to you, to me, indeed, is not grievous, but
   for you it is safe. Some hearers are like the Athenian
   academicians--they want continually to hear something new. The Apostle
   says, "To have the same things written to you, is safe." So is it for
   you, dear Friends, to have the same Gospel, the same Jesus, the same
   Holy Spirit made known to you, is safe. New doctrine is dangerous
   doctrine!

   2. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers. They are like dogs. If they
   fawn upon you, they will dirty you, if they do not bite you.

   2, 3. Beware of the concision. For we are the circumcision, which
   worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
   confidence in the flesh. There were some who had confidence in
   circumcision, who greatly troubled Paul. The Apostle says that they
   were, "the concision," the cutters off, of whom he would have the
   Philippians beware.

   4. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
   thinks that he has of which he might trust in the flesh, I more. If any
   man might have had confidence in the flesh, truly Paul might.

   5, 6. Circumcised the eighth day, the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
   Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the Law, a Pharisee;
   concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness
   which is in the Law, blameless. So that I do not know what more he
   could have had. If a Jew had tried to select a man who had something to
   glory in, he could not have picked any man to stand in the front of
   Paul! He was truly a Jew. He had received the initiatory rite and on
   the right day. He was born of Law of God to the extreme. He tithed his
   mint and his cummin. Nobody could have anything to glory in which Paul
   had not.

   7. But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. So
   that, when we come to Christ, whatever we have to trust to, we must put
   away. We must write it on the other side of the ledger. We had entered
   it as a gain--now we must set it down as a loss--it is of no value,
   whatever! It is a loss if it shall tempt us to trust any less in
   Christ.

   8. Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of
   the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. Those are sweet words, "my
   Lord." Remember how Thomas cried, in ecstasy, "My Lord and my God"?
   Paul, by faith putting his finger into the prints of the nails, says,
   "My Lord."

   8, 9. For whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count
   them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in Him. Oh, what a
   precious place to be found in, "in Him," trusting in Him, hidden away
   in Him, a member of His body, as it were, losing myself in Him!

   9. Not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law. He does not
   say, not trustingit, but not even havingit, not counting it, not
   thinkingit worthwhile to put down among his possessions that which he
   once prized so much.

   9, 10. But that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
   which is of God by faith: that I may know Him. Paul means, "That I may
   know Him more than I now do," for he knew Him and delighted in Him, but
   he felt as if he had not really begun to know Christ. He was like a
   child at school who has learned to read and to write, and knows so much
   that he begins to want to know more.

   10, 11. And the power of His Resurrection, and the fellowship of His
   sufferings, being made conformable unto His death; if by any means I
   might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. He knew that all the
   dead would rise again, but he aspired to the frstresurrection--"The
   rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were
   finished."

   12, 13. Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also
   I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have
   apprehended. He did count himself as saved--he knew that he was
   Christ's--but he did not count himself as having realized all that
   Christ meant to do for him and by him. He did not reckon that he had
   reached as far as he could reach, or learned all that he could learn,
   or done all that he could do.

   13, 14. But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are
   behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
   toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
   Jesus. You have seen a man running very fast. How he leans forward, as
   though he would send his heart before him and go quicker than his legs
   can carry him! So did the Apostle, "press toward the mark for the prize
   of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."

   15, 16. Let us, therefore, as many as are mature, be thus minded: and
   if in anything you are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this
   unto you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk
   by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. Let us keep all the good
   that we have received. Let us not give up the Truth of God that we have
   learned. Let us not leave the way along which we have traveled so
   far--and let us keep together--let perfect unanimity prove that the
   work of Grace is going on in one as well as in another.

   17. Brethren, be followers together of me. In these days, certain
   people find fault with Paul and speak of him as if he were not
   Inspired, and not to be followed as Christ was, But here he expressly
   says what no man like Paul would ever say unless moved of the Holy
   Spirit, for he was modest and, by no means, anxious to push himself
   forward--"Brethren, be followers together of me."

   17. And mark them which walk so as you have us for an example. Mark
   them, but do not followthem. See how they walk, but do not imitate
   them--"Have us for an example."

   18. (For many walk, ofwhom Ihave toldyou often, andnow tellyou even
   weeping, that they are the enemies ofthe Cross of Christ. I lay a
   stress upon the article--"They are the enemies of the Cross of Christ."
   Professors of religion who get into the Church and yet lead ungodly
   lives, are the worst enemies that the Cross of Christ has! These are
   the sort of men who bring tears into the minister's eyes! These are
   they who break his heart! They are the enemies of the Cross of Christ.

   19. Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory
   is in their shame, who mind earthly things). "Who mind earthly
   things"--even when they profess to be minding spiritual
   things--pretending to be followers of Christ up to Heaven and yet
   really making a gain of the things of God here below.

   20. For our conversation is in Heaven. Can you say that, dear Friend?
   Is your citizenship in Heaven? Is your conversation there? Do you often
   commune with your Lord upon the Throne? Judge yourselves whether it is
   so or not. It is a very poor thing to have a name to be in Heaven and
   yet never to have any converse with Heaven! I wish that we could all
   say that we talk more to God than we do to men, and have more business
   upward than we have here below.

   20. From whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He
   is coming! He is coming! Are we looking for Him? This is the true
   position of the Christian--looking for the appearing of his Lord!

   21. Who shall change our vile body. "The body of our humiliation." We
   have only part of the redemption while we are here. The soul is
   regenerated, newly-born, but the bodyis not. "The body is dead because
   of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." The
   redemption of the purchased possession will be perfect at the
   resurrection. The resurrection will be, to the body, what regeneration
   is to the soul! We sometimes wonder why we are sick when Christ could
   make us well in a moment--but the reason is that, as yet, He has not
   fully brought His Divine Power to bear upon the body.

   21. That it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to
   the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself
   May He show some part of that blessed power in us tonight! Amen.

Twelve Covenant Mercies

   (No. 2316)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 9, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   30, 1889.

   "Incline your ear, and come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall live:
   and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure mercies
   of David." Isaiah 55:3.

   I GOT so far this morning [Sermon #2092, Volume 35--God's Own Gospel
   Call.] as to plead with men to come to God to hear what He had to say,
   to give diligent and earnest heed to His teaching about their souls and
   about salvation. And while I pleaded, I can truly say, with all the
   strength I had, I made this one of the master arguments that, in
   hearing, their soul would live--and in coming to God, they would find
   Him ready to enter into Covenant with them, "an everlasting Covenant,
   even the sure mercies of David."

   That seemed to me to be one of the most astonishing Truths of God that
   was ever given to man to preach, that God would be a high contracting
   party with poor insignificant and guilty man, that He would make a
   Covenant with man! Yes, with you and with me--that He would bind
   Himself by a solemn promise, give His sacred pledge--and enter into a
   holy contract of mercy with the guilty sons of Adam! I thought that if
   men were in their right minds and God had taught their reason to be
   reasonable, they would be drawn to the Lord by such a wonderful promise
   as this, "I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure
   mercies of David."

   Remember that there was a Covenant of old, which men broke--the
   Covenant of works, "This do, and you shall live." Keep such and such
   commands, and you shall be rewarded. That Covenant failed because man
   did not keep God's commands and so did not earn the promised reward. We
   broke the terms of that contract and it is no longer valid, except that
   we come under penalty for the breach of it, and that penalty is that we
   are to be cast away from God's Presence and to perish without hope, so
   far as that broken Covenant is concerned.

   Now, rolling up that old Covenant as a useless thing out of which no
   salvation can ever come, God comes to us in another way and He says, "I
   will make a new Covenant with you, not like the old one at all." It is
   a Covenant of Grace-- a Covenant made, not with the worthy, but with
   the unworthy! A Covenant not made upon conditions, but unconditionally,
   every supposed condition having been fulfilled by our great
   Representative and Surety, the Lord Jesus Christ! A Covenant without
   an, "if," or a, "but," in it, "ordered in all things, and sure." A
   Covenant of shalls and wills in which God says, "I will, and you
   shall!" A Covenant just suited to our broken-down and helpless
   condition. A Covenant which will land everyone who is interested in it
   in Heaven! No other Covenant will ever do this. I tried to expatiate
   upon that Covenant this morning and I thought that I would close the
   day by showing to any who desire to be in this Covenant of Grace what
   the blessings are that God promises to give to guilty men when they
   come to Him, when they accept His love and His mercy. What are these
   blessings?

   I have little else to do, tonight, but to refer you, again, as I did
   this morning, to God's Word. Beloved, if you had met together, after
   the death of some wealthy relative, and his will was about to be read
   to you, you would not require an eloquent lawyer--you would all be very
   attentive--and some of you who are a little deaf would recover your
   hearing! An important question would be, "What has he left?" A still
   more important enquiry would be, "What has he left to me?" Well, I want
   you to feel, tonight, that you do not need an eloquent preacher--I am
   only going to read God's will to you, His Covenant, which is virtually
   the testament or will of Christ. And all that you have to do is to
   listen and say, "What has He left? What has He bequeathed to me? What
   does He Covenant to give to me?"

   And remember that whoever you may be, if you are willing to be saved by
   Grace, you may be saved by Grace! If you give up all hope of being
   saved anyway else, you may be saved by the free mercy and love of God!
   "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land."
   If you come and take Christ to be your Savior, then all the promises of
   God, which in Him are, yes, and in Him, Amen, are made to you! If you
   take Him, you take all that is in the Covenant, for He is the Covenant.
   Embodied in Himself is the whole Covenant of Grace and He who has
   Christ has all it contains!

   I am going to point you to some of the passages in which we have this
   Covenant written out at length. I shall not say much upon any item, but
   I shall refer you to 12 wonderful mercies of the Covenant of Grace.
   Will you kindly look in your Bibles at the prophecy of Jeremiah,
   chapter 31, verse thirty-four? There is no music more sweet to me than
   the rustle of your Bibles. I sometimes preach, no, I frequently preach
   when I may read what I like and nobody follows me to see if I quote
   correctly. I have been inclined to buy you wheelbarrows, so that you
   may bring your Bibles to Chapel in them, since many of you do not seem
   to have any here. What is the best way of hearing the Word? Is it not
   to search and see whether what the preacher says is really according to
   the Word of God?

   I. One of the first mercies of the Covenant is SAVING KNOWLEDGE. Turn
   to Jeremiah 31, and let us begin to read at verse thirty-one--"Behold,
   the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the
   house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the
   Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by
   the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which My Covenant they
   broke, although I was an Husband unto them, says the Lord: but this
   shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; after
   those days, says the Lord, I will put My Law in their inward parts, and
   write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be My
   people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every
   man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me,
   from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the Lord." There
   is one of the first blessings of the Covenant of Grace--saving
   knowledge.

   Man by nature knows not God. He does not want to know God and when he
   is awakened to think of God at all, God seems a great mystery, a Being
   invisible, unreachable--and the man says, "Who shall make me to know
   God?" He reads his Bible, it may be, and even that he does not
   understand. He hears the preacher, but the Lord's servant seems to talk
   a jargon which the unconverted man cannot comprehend! Brothers and
   Sisters, there is no knowing God except through God! The man's neighbor
   cannot teach him, even though he may attempt it. Though he may say,
   "Know the Lord," yet he cannot give knowledge of God. By nature our
   eyes are blinded--we cannot see. You may hold, even, the electric light
   to a blind man's sightless orbs, but it will not give him sight. Blind
   Bartimaeus saw no light till Jesus spoke to him. Saul of Tarsus was
   blind enough, by his bigotry and self-righteousness, until God gave him
   a glorious light to shine into his soul.

   Now, here is a Covenant that God will give the knowledge of Himself to
   the lost, the guilty and the ruined--to those who have provoked Him and
   gone astray from Him. Where are those to whom this Covenant shall be
   fulfilled tonight? I cannot tell you, save by marks and tokens, and
   this is one of the marks. Do you know that you are blind? Do you know
   that you cannot see apart from Divine Grace? Do you long to see? He is
   not totally blind, in a spiritual sense, who knows that he is so. He is
   not in the dark who feels that he is in the dark--there is already some
   degree of the Light of God that makes him perceive the darkness
   visible. O Soul, if you desire to know God, here is the Covenant, "They
   shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them"!
   All God's chosen shall know Him! They shall not abide in ignorance.
   They shall not die in ignorance. They shall come to know the Lord and
   they shall grow in the Grace and in the knowledge of their Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ!

   Oh, what a privilege this is! "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
   of God." If any man is ignorant of his God, let him hear the Word of
   the Lord and let him seek the Lord, and God will give him instruction
   concerning Himself, and make him to know the great Jehovah, the Father
   of our spirits, who passes by iniquity, transgression, and sin.

   II. But I must not linger on any one blessing. The first Covenant mercy
   is saving knowledge. The next is, GOD'S LAW WRITTEN IN THE HEART. Let
   me read you verse 33, again--"After those days, says the Lord, I will
   put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and
   will be their God, and they shall be My people." You know that the Law
   of Moses was written on two tablets of stone. Wonderfully precious
   those two slabs of marble must have been when the Divine finger had
   traced the solemn lines. Moses had a great charge to keep when he had
   those two Di-

   vinely written tablets, but he destroyed them because the people had,
   in spirit, broken them. It could not be that such Divine writing should
   ever be handled or looked at by such an unholy people!

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, it was of no use writing the Law on tablets
   of stone except for the condemnation of the people! But when God comes
   in the Covenant of Grace, He does not merely give us the Law in a Book,
   the Law written in legible characters, but He comes and writes on the
   fleshy tablets of our heart. Then the man knows the Law by heart! What
   is better, he loves the Law. That Law accuses him, but he would not
   have it altered. He bows and confesses the truthfulness of the
   accusation. He cries, "Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts
   to keep Your Law." And this is the Covenant blessing--God makes men to
   love His Commandments and to delight themselves in the Truth of God,
   righteousness and holiness!

   A very wonderful thing is this writing in our heart. Nobody but God can
   write in human hearts. We can write certain thoughts upon your minds as
   we appeal to your ears, but to get at the heart is another thing! He
   that has the keys of Heaven, He that has the keys of the heart, He that
   shuts and no man opens, or opens and no man shuts, can really get at
   the human heart! And He does so get at it that He writes, there, His
   Commandments, and this He does to men who formerly hated those
   Commandments! He makes them love them. Men who despised His
   Commandments, He makes to honor them. As for men who forgot His
   commandments, He writes them in their hearts, so that they cannot get
   away from them. As for men who would have changed the Commandments, He
   changes their hearts, instead, and then their hearts and the
   Commandments agree together.

   This is a second Covenant blessing. Do any of you want these blessings?
   Would you like to know the Lord? Do you wish to have the Law written on
   your hearts? Be it unto you according to your faith! Believe that God
   can do this for you--trust in Christ that it may be done unto you--and
   even so shall it be!

   III. The third Covenant mercy (we cannot dwell long on any item) is,
   FREE PARDON. You will find this at the end of the 34th verse--"For I
   will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
   Oh, this is a great blessing of the Covenant! You people who have never
   sinned, or who think that you have not. You who believe yourselves to
   have always been good, or at least as good as you could be, and far
   above the average of mankind! You exceedingly excellent people who have
   never done anything that you need to repent of very greatly, well, I
   have nothing for you here! Only remember what Mary sang, "He has filled
   the hungry with good things; and the rich" (that is you) "He has sent
   empty away." But if there is a soul here that feels the burden of its
   guilt, one bowed down with grief because of the heavy load of past
   iniquity that lies upon it, why, surely you, if you have the faith,
   will jump for joy as you read these words, "I will forgive their
   iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more." First, He will
   forgive it, blot it right out. "Be," says He, "as if you had never
   offended. Come to Me, come to My heart, as if you had always loved Me.
   Guilty though you are, I will not impute iniquity to your charge, I
   will forgive it." The great Judge will put on the white gloves and not
   the black cap! You shall be forgiven!

   And then the Lord says, "I will remember their sin no more." It is a
   wonderful thing when Omnipotence overcomes Omniscience, when Omnipotent
   Love will not allow Omniscience to remember--"I will remember their sin
   no more." Satan comes and pleads against the sinner, "Lord, he did so
   and so." God says, "I do not remember it." Nor does He remember it, for
   He laid it all on Christ and Christ suffered the penalty due for it
   and, therefore, it is gone! It is never to be recalled! It stands not
   in the Book of Remembrance and, as the Lord looks over this man's life,
   when He comes to the black pages, there is a blank--not a line of it is
   left--for He who died has made the scarlet sins as white as snow! "I
   will remember their sin no more."

   Oh, what a precious Covenant mercy is this! I do not feel as if I need
   to elaborate or garnish it in any way, or give you any illustrations,
   or tell you any anecdotes. Was there ever set before you such a
   glorious gift? Will you not have it--the perfect pardon of every sin
   and a Divine act of amnesty and oblivion for every crime, of every
   sort--as promised in the Covenant of Grace to every soul that is
   willing to receive it through Christ Jesus the Savior?

   IV. Let us look a little farther and see if there is not something
   more. Look to the next chapter, Jeremiah 32, at the 38th verse--"And
   they shall be My people, and I will be their God." That is the next
   Covenant mercy, RECONCILIATION. The offense is put away, the sin is
   pardoned. "Now," says God, "they shall be My people." "Lord, they are
   the people who worshipped Baal! They are the horrid wretches who gave
   their children up to be burned in the red-hot arms of Molech." "They
   shall be My people," says the Lord. "But, Lord, these are the men and
   women who committed adul-

   tery and fornication and were even guilty of murder!" "They shall be My
   people," says the Lord. "But, Lord, they provoked You to anger year
   after year, and would not hearken to Your Prophets." "They shall be My
   people," says the Lord, "and I will be their God."

   Did you ever think how much there is involved in that expression, "I
   will be their God"? God is everything and when God gives Himself to us,
   He gives us more than all time and all eternity, all earth and all
   Heaven! "Fear not, Abram," said the Lord to the Patriarch, "I am your
   shield, and your exceedingly great reward," as if it was reward enough
   for any man to have God to be his God--and so it is! More riches than
   Croesus, more honor than the greatest conqueror, has that man who has
   this God to be his God forever and ever! "I will be their God, and they
   shall be My people." The young people might look that text up, and find
   how many times it occurs in the Word of God. I remember many times that
   God puts it, "I will be their God, and they shall be My people."

   This is another grand Covenant blessing! Are you willing to be the
   people of God? Are you willing to take Him, even this God, to be yours
   forever and ever? If so, then the text is true concerning you, "I will
   make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David."

   V. Will you follow me to the next verse for a fifth Covenant mercy, the
   blessing of TRUE GODLINESS? "And I will give them one heart, and one
   way, that they may fear Me forever, for the good of them, and of their
   children after them." See here, that the fear of God is the beginning
   of wisdom! "The fear of God" is a description of true godliness and God
   says that He will give this to men. He might have asked it of you, and
   rightly, too, but you would never have yielded it. But when He says
   that He will give it, that is a very different thing! He is willing to
   give you His fear, to give you true religion, to bestow upon you that
   veneration of His sacred name which lies at the bottom of all
   godliness! He will give you that, give that to you who never had it,
   and even despised it, to any of you who have lived all your lives
   without it, but who are willing to come and take it, this night, as the
   gift of His Grace through Jesus Christ our Lord! May the Lord make you
   willing in this, the day of His power, for that is a part of the
   Covenant blessing! The willingness, itself, is His gift and this He
   gives freely to His own.

   VI. Now look, dear Friends, to the next verse, which is more wonderful
   than anything that I have yet read. The sixth Covenant mercy is,
   CONTINUANCE IN GRACE--"And I will make an everlasting Covenant with
   them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will
   put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me." Talk
   about Final Perseverance--is it not taught here? "I will not turn away
   from them, and they shall not depart from Me." What a Covenant blessing
   this is! It reminds us of the words of the Lord Jesus concerning His
   sheep--"I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand." "Yes," I heard a man
   say, who did not believe what that verse teaches, "No man shall pluck
   them out of His hand, but they may crawl away from between His
   fingers."

   No, they shall not! See how this text secures them both ways. "I will
   not turn away from them, to do them good: but I will put My fear in
   their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me." Here are both gaps
   blocked--there is no getting out either way. God will not leave you and
   He will not let you leave Him! This is a Covenant blessing, indeed. Oh,
   for faith to grip it! The soul that comes to Christ and rests itself
   wholly upon Him, shall find two hands to grasp it, even these two
   gracious words, "I will not turn away from them," and, "they shall not
   depart from Me." And this is spoken of the guilty, of the very men who
   provoked God!--

   "Wonders of Grace to God belong, Repeat His mercies in your song." If
   God saved the good, the meritorious and the righteous, then the proud
   Pharisees would swarm in every street in Heaven and God would have no
   Glory! But when He saves the vilest of the vile--then the publicans,
   who are afraid to lift their eyes to Heaven when they think of their
   own unworthiness--will get near the Throne of God and sing! Oh, how
   they will sing of Free Grace and dying love! This Covenant would be
   great enough if there were nothing more in it than the six blessings
   that I have mentioned!

   VII. I must trouble you to turn in your Bibles to another prophecy, to
   read about another of the mercies of His Covenant, namely, CLEANSING.
   Some poor soul says, "Well, I can see that God is going to do great
   things, but I feel myself so unclean, I dare not come near to God. Why,
   Sir, I am polluted all over, inside and out, I am altogether like a
   leprous man!" Come then, let me read this verse to you, the 25th verse
   of the 36th chapter of Ezekiel--"Then will I sprin-

   kle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean: from all your
   filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you." God's Word
   elsewhere says, "Wash you, make you clean." That is your duty--but here
   you are told that the Lord will wash you, and make you clean. This is
   your privilege. "You are clean," said Christ to His disciples, "through
   the Word which I have spoken unto you." That is "the washing of water
   by the Word" of which Paul wrote to the Ephesians. The Lord sprinkles
   this "clean water" upon the leprous and the polluted sinner, upon him
   who lies covered with his own blood, a filthy thing in the sight of God
   and loathsome to himself. The Free-Grace Covenant runs, "Then will I
   sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean." When God
   Himself says, "You shall be clean," I know that we are clean, for He is
   the best judge of true cleanliness! His pure and holy eyes detect every
   spot of sin and every latent trace of disease. Though it is deep within
   the heart, He can spy it out, but He says, "I will sprinkle you, and
   you shall be clean." Blessed be His name!

   And then He goes on to enumerate that from which He will cleanse
   us--"From all your idols will I cleanse you." Is drink your idol? Is
   some lust of the flesh your idol? "Oh!" you say, "I cannot get rid of
   these things." No, but the Lord can cleanse you from them! Only come to
   Him, listen diligently to Him, trust Him, yield yourself up, surrender
   yourself to Him and He will dash your idols in pieces and tear them
   from their thrones! He will also cleanse you from whatever else there
   may be that is unmentionable, "from all your filthiness"--things not to
   be spoken of, not even to be mentioned--those things that are done in
   secret, "I will cleanse you from them," says the Lord.

   I may be speaking to somebody here who, as he listens to me, thinks
   that I am talking some novel, some romance. "Why," he says, "I am a
   filthy creature. I am a great sinner. Can God bless me?" Yes, He can
   bless even you! Did you never hear of Colonel Gardiner? On the very
   night on which he had made an appointment to commit a filthy sin,
   Christ appeared to Him and he thought that he heard Him say, "I have
   done all this for you; will you never turn to Me?" He did turn to Jesus
   and he became noted as an eminent Christian--more noted than he had
   formerly been as a debauched officer in the army! The Lord Jesus Christ
   still works these wonders of Grace! He meets men often when they are
   desperately set on mischief, just as a horse might be rushing into the
   battle, and He comes and lays His hand on the rein and turns it, and
   leads it back wherever He wills! Such is the power of His almighty
   love! I pray Him to do the same, tonight, according to this wondrous
   promise, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be
   clean: from all your filthi-ness, and from all your idols, will I
   cleanse you."

   VIII. Nor is that all, for, if a man should be made clean once, he
   would soon get foul again if left to himself, so here follows the next
   astounding Covenant mercy of RENEWAL OF NATURE. Listen--"A new heart
   also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I
   will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
   an heart of flesh." It is not said, "I will help you to this," but, "I
   will do it." Not, "I will help you to make yourself a new heart." No,
   nothing of the kind, but, "I will give you a new heart." You know that
   if you cut off the branches of a tree, it will grow fresh ones, but if
   you could tear out its heart, it would never grow a new one. There are
   some creatures, like the lobster, that will shed their claws and the
   claws will grow again--but a lobster never grows a new heart.

   If the center of animal or vegetable life is once destroyed, there is
   no renewing it. But God can work this miracle in human hearts, He can
   strike at the very center of man's nature and change it! It is little
   to render pure the streams, but it is a great marvel to cleanse an
   impure spring so that a spring of bitter water suddenly turns sweet.
   This is a miracle that can only be worked by the finger of God and
   there is nothing short of this renewal of nature that is worth having!
   I know that some people fancy that Christians, when they do not go into
   such and such worldly amusements, deny themselves very much. Nothing of
   the kind! It would be an awful denial to us if we had to go with the
   worldlings. Those who frequent the theater and places of loose
   amusement perhaps think that it is a denial to us not to go with them.
   Oh, dear, dear, dear, they little know us!

   When I go down to a friend's farm, I see a man carrying to the pigs a
   couple of pails full of food, but I never envy the pigs! I like them to
   have all that they can, and to enjoy themselves, but do not suppose
   that I am denying myself in not wanting their food! My taste does not
   lie that way. But suppose that a man has a hog's heart--what is the way
   to deal with him? To deny him his swill? Certainly not! Let him have it
   while he is like the hogs. The thing that is needed is a change of
   heart, and when his heart is turned into a renewed man's heart, and is
   made to be a God-like heart, then it is no denial to him to loathe the
   things which once gave him so much pleasure! His tastes are entirely
   changed and that is according to the promise of the Covenant, "A new
   heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you."

   The old heart is very hard in some. It seems to be altogether
   petrified--you cannot make any impression upon it. You are received
   with ridicule, however earnest you may be in your pleadings for God.
   But the Lord can change the stony heart--

   "Our heart, that flinty, stubborn thing, That terrors cannot move, That
   fears no threatening of His wrath, Shall be dissolved by love! Or He
   can take the flint away, That would not be refined; And from the
   treasures of His Grace, Bestow a softer mind."

   Then the man, who was just now as hard as flint, sits and weeps over
   his sins. See how watchful he is in the presence of all kinds of
   temptations. He is half afraid to put one foot before another! The very
   man who was called, "Devil-may-care," is now the one who does care and
   who trembles lest he should in any way grieve the living God! What a
   blessed Covenant mercy is this!

   IX. But I must hurry on. The ninth Covenant mercy is, HOLY
   CONVERSATION. Let me read verse twenty-seven-- "And I will put My
   spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall
   keep My judgments, and do them." When God deals with a man in the way
   of Grace, He not only calls him to holiness, but He gives him holiness!
   He not only bids him walk in His way, but He makes him walk in His
   way--not by compulsion, not by any kind of physical force--but by the
   sweet influences of Infinite Love. The man's entire life is changed
   externally, just as I have shown you that his heart is changed
   internally. "Oh!" says one, "this is very wonderful." It is. It is the
   standing wonder of the Gospel. Certain miracles have ceased, but the
   miracles of turning men from darkness to light, and from the power of
   Satan unto God, are being worked every day! I rejoice that they are
   constantly being worked in this very House of Prayer and I believe that
   they are going to be worked tonight on some who are listening to me! If
   this miracle is worked, you will not attribute it to me--I know you
   will not, for you will remember how feeble I am--but you will
   understand that there is the power of God working through the preaching
   of the Gospel making dry bones to live and turning black sinners into
   bright saints, to the praise of the glory of His Grace!

   X. Once again, will you kindly look at the 31st verse? This will be the
   10th Covenant mercy, HAPPY SELF-LOATHING. Perhaps you will wonder that
   I called this a mercy. Listen--"Then shall you remember your own evil
   ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves
   in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations." Free
   Grace makes men loathe themselves! After God has done so much for them,
   they feel so ashamed that they do not know what to do. "O Lord," says
   the saint, "to think that ever I should have sinned against One who
   loved me so much! That I, the elect of God, should have acted like the
   elect of Hell! That I, who was God's own, should have called myself the
   devil's own! That I, who was chosen unto holiness and eternal life,
   should have passed it all by as if it were no concern of mine!" Oh, may
   God grant us this holy loathing, as He will do when we have once tasted
   of His Infinite Love!

   XI. The next Covenant mercy, mentioned in the 37th chapter, verses 26
   to 28, is the blessing of COMMUNION WITH God--"Moreover I will make a
   Covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting Covenant with
   them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set My
   sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore. My tabernacle also shall be
   with them: yes, I will be their God, and they shall be My people. And
   the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when My
   sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore." God promises to
   set up His tabernacle and His Temple in the midst of His people, and to
   make them His priests, His servants, His children, His friends. God
   will be no longer absent from you when this Covenant work shall have
   been worked in you; but you shall be brought to dwell in His Presence,
   to abide in His house, and to go no more out forever, until the day
   when He shall take you to His palace home above, to be forever in His
   Presence, and to serve Him day and night in His Temple.

   And all this is promised to the worthless, to the vilest of the vile!
   All this without asking of you anything but that you will be willing to
   receive Him! All this without requiring of you anything but just your
   emptiness that He may fill it, your sinfulness that He may cleanse it!
   Only you must surrender to Him. What have you to surrender? Nothing but
   a lot

   of rubbish of your own your self-righteousness, especially, which is
   but filthy rags! The Lord bring you to this surrender even now!

   XII. There is only one more Covenant mercy for me to mention and I put
   it last because you will be surprised, perhaps, when I read it. It is
   about NECESSARY CHASTISEMENT. For that I must ask you to turn to Psalm
   89 and verse thirty--"If his children forsake My law, and walk not in
   My judgments; if they break My statutes, and keep not My Commandments;
   then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
   with stripes. Nevertheless My loving kindness will I not utterly take
   from him, nor allow My faithfulness to fail." There is a rod in the
   Covenant. Children of God, you do not like it--it were not a rod if you
   did--but it is good for you when you come under the fatherly discipline
   of God. Though He will never take His everlasting love from you, nor
   suffer His faithfulness to fail, yet, when you transgress, the rod
   shall be sure to fall upon you, and sometimes its strokes shall come
   upon you before you transgress, to keep you from sinning!

   I often hear of some of God's dearest servants suffering. I heard of
   one whom I am sure God loves very much. He is very useful. He spends
   himself in his Master's work. He is also very prosperous--God gives to
   him great wealth, which he discreetly and wisely uses, but he has had a
   very sharp affliction come upon him, lately, which is enough to break
   his heart. And when I heard it, I said, "Yes, yes, God loves him. God
   loves him." If you are a child of God, note this Truth of God and
   accept it with joy--our heavenly Father never pampers His children! We
   may spoil our girls and boys, but our Father never spoils His children.
   If He gives you great happiness, great success and makes you useful, He
   will, every now and then, give you a whipping behind the door. You
   think, sometimes, "That man is very happy. he has great blessing
   resting on his work." Yes, this man is very happy to tell you that he
   has not all sweets to drink, to make him sick and ill, but there are
   bitter tonics, sharp blows of the rod, to keep him right. If we have to
   bless God more for any one thing than for everything else, it is to
   thank Him that we have not escaped the rod.

   Sickness is a choice blessing from God! I cannot measure the
   unutterable good that comes to us full often in that way--and losses in
   business, and crosses, and bereavements, and depressions of spirit are
   all, when we see them in the light eternal, so many Covenant mercies.
   The true-born child of God cannot escape the rod and would not if he
   might. He gets afraid when he does not sometimes feel it. He will not
   long have to be afraid about it, for it will come in due time. I think
   that I hear somebody say, "I do not want that." No, just so--you want
   worldly pleasure. Perhaps God will let you have it till you have spent
   all your substance on it, as the prodigal did--and then you will find
   that it is all weariness and sorrow--and you will want something
   better.

   But if tonight you will say, "I will take the Covenant of Grace, rod
   and all, for if I can be God's child, I will very gladly take the rod
   as part of the mercies of the Covenant," come along, and you shall have
   it! Seek the Lord tonight! Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to
   your eyelids till you have found Him! God grant you all the mercies of
   the Everlasting Covenant, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. JEREMIAH32:30-42.

   Verse 30. For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have
   only done evil before Me from, their youth: for the children of Israel
   have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says the
   LORD. Here were people who had done nothing else but evil. God had been
   very good to them, but they had been very bad to Him. From their youth,
   and without a break, they bad continued to rebel.

   31. For this city has been to Me as a provocation of My anger and of My
   fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should
   remove it from before My face. Jerusalem, which ought to have been a
   holy city, had been so impure that it had been a standing provocation
   to God from the day it was built.

   32. Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
   children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger, they,
   their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the
   men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They seem to have been
   all alike. With scarcely an exception, from the highest class to the
   lowest, they were always disobeying God.

   33. And they have turned unto Me the back, and not the face: though I
   taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not
   hearkened to receive instruction. This is a fearful indictment! When
   men refuse to learn better, turn their back upon the King of kings, and
   will have nothing to do with Him, surely the time for vengeance has
   come.

   34, 35. But they set their abominations in the house, which is called
   by My name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which
   are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
   daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech. There was nothing so
   terribly bad but they would do it. There was nothing so unnatural, so
   detestable, but they must practice it.

   35-38. Which I commanded them not, neither came it into My mind, that
   they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. And now
   therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city,
   of which you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of
   Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; behold,
   I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in My
   anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again
   unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: and they shall
   be My people, and I will be their God. Is not this a wonderful passage?
   After all this sin, and all this provocation, when we expect the
   thunder and lightning of Divine judgment, behold, there is nothing but
   the sweet voice of pitying love--"They shall be My people, and I will
   be their God." Oh, the wonders of Divine Grace! See what the Covenant
   of Grace does for guilty men.

   39, 40. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear
   Me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: and
   I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, "With them"--with these
   very people who had provoked Him, and served Molech, and bowed before
   idol gods, and put the Lord to shame, and angered Him!

   40, 41. That I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I
   will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.
   Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in
   this land assuredly with My whole heart and with My whole soul. A
   whole-hearted God, blessing those upon whom He looks with an eye of
   Grace! It is a wonderful thing. If He had set His whole heart to
   destroy them, it would have seemed natural, but God is far above any
   conception of ours and so, in the midst of extraordinary and almost
   immeasurable guilt, behold Love equally extraordinary and Grace
   altogether measureless!

   42. For thus says the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil
   upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have
   promised them. Oh, for Grace to lay hold upon this Everlasting
   Covenant, even the sure mercies of David, and to be saved thereby!

Obeying Christ's Orders

   (No. 2317)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 16, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JUNE
   13, 1889.

   "His mother said unto the servants, Whatever He says unto you, do it."
   John 2:5.

   IT does not need a strong imagination to picture Mary, probably at that
   time the widowed mother of our Lord. She is full of love and of a
   naturally kind, sympathetic disposition. She is at a marriage and she
   is very pleased that her Son is there, with the first handful of His
   disciples. Their being there has made a greater demand upon the
   provisions than was expected and the supply is running short, so she,
   with an anxiety that was natural to such a mother of her years, and of
   her gentle spirit, thinks that she will speak to her Son and tell Him
   that there is a need. So she says to Him, "They have no wine."

   There was not much amiss in that, surely, but our Lord, who sees not as
   man sees, perceived that she was putting to the front her motherly
   relationship at a time when it was necessary that it should be in the
   background. How necessary it was, history has shown, for the apostate
   church of Rome has actually made Mary a Mediatrix and prayers have been
   addressed to her! She has even been asked to use her maternal authority
   with her Son. It was well that our Savior should check anything that
   might tend to give any countenance to Mariolatry which has been
   altogether so mischievous. And it was necessary for Him to speak to His
   mother with somewhat more of sharpness than, perhaps, her conduct, in
   itself, alone, might have required. So her august Son felt bound to say
   to her, "Woman, what have I to do with you in such a matter as this? I
   am not your Son as a miracle-worker. I cannot work to please you. No,
   if I work a miracle as the Son of God, it cannot be as your Son--it
   must be in another character. What have I to do with you in this
   matter?" And He gives His reason--"My hour is not yet come."

   It was a gentle rebuke, absolutely necessary from the prescience of all
   that would follow. You can easily picture how Mary took it. She knew
   Christ's gentleness, His infinite love, how for 30 years there had
   never come anything from Him that had grieved her spirit. So she drank
   in the reproof and gently shrank back, thinking much more than she
   said, for she was always a woman who laid up these things and pondered
   them in her heart. She says very little, but she thinks a great
   deal--and we see in her later conduct, in respect to this very miracle,
   that she thought very much of what Jesus had said to her. Brothers and
   Sisters, you and I, with the very best intentions, may sometimes err
   towards our Lord. And if He, then, in any way rebukes us, and puts us
   back--if He disappoints our hope, if He does not allow our ambitious
   designs to prosper--let us take it from Him as Mary took it from Jesus.
   Let us just feel that it must be right and let us, in silence, possess
   ourselves in His Presence.

   Notice, then, this holy woman's quietude, ceasing to say a word,
   quietly drinking it all in. And then observe her wise admonition to the
   servants who were there to wait at the feast. Inasmuch as she had run
   before Him, she would have them to follow after Him and she very wisely
   and kindly says to them, "Whatever He says unto you, do it. Do not go
   to Him with any of your remarks. Do not try to press Him forward. Do
   not urge Him on--He knows better than we do. Stand back and wait till
   He speaks, and then be quick to obey every single word that He utters."
   Beloved, I wish that when we have learned a lesson, we would try to
   teach it. Sometimes our Master gives us a sharp word all to ourselves
   and we would not tell anybody else what He has said. In our private
   communions He has spoken to our conscience and to our heart--and we
   need not go and repeat that, as Mary did not. But, having learned the
   lesson well, let us then say to our next friend, "Do not err as I have
   done. Avoid the rock on which I struck just now. I fear that I grieved
   my Lord. My Sister, I would not have you grieve Him. My Brother, I
   would try to tell you just what to do that you may please Him in all

   things." Do you not think that we would minister to mutual edification
   if we did that? Instead of telling the faults of others, let us extract
   the essence from the discoveries which we make of our own errors and
   then administer that as a helpful medicine to those who are around us.

   This holy woman must have spoken with a good deal of power. Her tone
   must have been peculiarly forcible and her manner must have made a
   great impression upon the servants, for you notice that they did
   exactly what she told them. It is not every servant who will let a
   guest come into the house and set up to be mistress. But so it was when
   she spoke to those servants, with her deep, earnest tones, as a woman
   who had learned something that she could not tell, but who, yet, out of
   that experience, had extracted a lesson for others. She must have
   spoken with a wonderful melting force when she said to them, "Whatever
   He says unto you, do it." And they were all looking on with awe after
   she had spoken, drinking in her message to them as she had drunk in the
   message of the Lord.

   Now I want, tonight, to try to teach that lesson to myself and to you.
   I think that our own experience goes to show us that our highest
   wisdom, our very best prosperity, will lie in our cautiously keeping
   behind Christ and never running before Him, never forcing His hand,
   never tempting Him as they did who tempted God in the
   wilderness--prescribing to Him to do this or that--but, in holy, humble
   obedience, taking these words as our life motto henceforth, "Whatever
   He says unto you, do it." I will handle my text in this way--First,
   What? Secondly, Why? Thirdly, What then?

   I. WHAT IS IT THAT WE ARE HERE TOLD TO DO? In a word, it is to obey.
   You who belong to Christ and are His disciples, take heed to this word
   of exhortation, "Whatever He says unto you, do it."

   I want you to notice, first of all, that these words were spoken, not
   to the disciples of Christ, but to the servants who, in the Greek, are
   here called diakonois, the persons who were brought in to wait at the
   table and to serve the guests. I know not whether they were paid
   servants, or whether they were friends who kindly volunteered their
   services, but they were the waiters at the feast. They were not told to
   leave their master. They were not told to give up their avocation as
   waiters. They were servants and they were to continue servants, but
   still, for all that, they were to acknowledge Christ as their Master
   without casting off their obedience to the governor of the feast. Mary
   does not say to these people, "Put down those pots. Leave off carrying
   those dishes." But while they continue to do what they were doing, she
   says to them, "Whatever He says unto you, do it." I thought that point
   was well worthy of our notice, that these servants, still abiding as
   they were, yet were to render obedience to Christ.

   That obedience, in the first place, would be prepared obedience. Mary
   came to get their minds ready to do what Christ should bid them. No man
   will obey Christ on a sudden and keep on doing so. There must be a
   weighing, a considering. There must be a thoughtful, careful knowledge
   of what His will is--and a preparedness of heart--that whatever that
   will may be, as it is known, so it shall be done! At first these
   servants did nothing. The guests needed wine but the servants did not
   go to Jesus and say, "Master, wine is needed." No, but they waited
   until He bade them fill the waterpots with water--and then they filled
   them to the brim. But they did nothing till He bade them. A great part
   of obedience lies in not doing. I believe that in the anxiety of many a
   trembling heart, the very best faith will be seen in not doing
   anything. When you do not know what to do, do nothing, and, doing
   nothing, my Brothers and Sisters, will be found to be, sometimes, the
   very hardest work of all. In the case of a man in business who has come
   into a difficulty, or of a Sister with a sick child, or a sick husband,
   you know the impulse is to do something or other. If not the first
   thing that comes to hand, yet we feel that we must do something. And
   many a person has aggravated his sorrow by doing something, when, if he
   had bravely left it alone, believingly left it in God's hands, it would
   have been infinitely better for him.

   "Whatever He says unto you, do it." But do not do what every whim or
   fancy in your poor brain urges you to do! Do not run before you are
   sent. They who run before God's cloud will have to come back,
   again--and they will be very happy if they find the way back! Where
   Scripture is silent, be you silent! If there is no command, you had
   better wait till you can find some guidance. Blunder not on with a
   headlong anxiety lest you tumble into the ditch! "Whatever He says unto
   you," do that. But until He speaks, sit still. My Soul, be patient
   before God and wait until you know His bidding!

   This prepared obedience was to be the obedience of the spirit, for
   obedience lies mainly there. True obedience is not always seen in what
   we do, or do not do, but it is manifest in the perfect submission to
   the will of God--and the strong resolve that saturates the spirit
   through and through--that what He bids us, we will do!

   Let your obedience, in the next place, be perfect obedience. "Whatever
   He says unto you, do it." It is disobedience, and not obedience which
   prompts us to select from the commands of Christ which ones we care to
   obey. If you say, "I will

   do what Christ bids me as far as I choose," you have, in fact, said, "I
   will not do what Christ bids me, but I will do what I please to do."
   That obedience is not true which is not universal! Imagine a soldier in
   the army who, instead of obeying every command of his captain, omits
   this and that, and says that he cannot help it, or that he even means
   to omit certain things. Beloved, take heed of throwing any precept of
   your Lord upon the dunghill! Every Word that He has spoken to you is
   more precious than a diamond! Prize it! Store it up. Wear it. Let it be
   your ornament and your beauty. "Whatever He says unto you, do it,"
   whether it relates to the Church of God and its ordinances, or to your
   walk out of doors among your fellow men, or to your relationship in the
   family, or to your own private service for the Lord. "Whatever." See,
   there are to be no trimmings, here, no cutting off of certain
   things--"Whatever He says unto you, do it." Breathe this prayer at the
   present moment, "Lord, help me to do whatever You have said! May I have
   no choice! May I never let my own will come in to interfere, but if You
   have told me do anything, enable me to do it, whatever it may be!"

   This obedience, then, being prepared and perfect, is to also be
   practical obedience--"Whatever He says unto you, do it." Do not think
   about it, especially for a very long time, and then wait until it is
   more impressed upon you, or till there is a convenient season.
   "Whatever He says unto you, do it." One of the great evils of the times
   is that of deliberating about a plain command of Christ and asking,
   "What will be the result of it?" What have you to do with results? "But
   if I follow Christ in all things, I may lose my job!" What have you to
   do with that? When a soldier is told to go up to the cannon's mouth, he
   is very likely to lose his "job" and something else--but he is bound to
   do it! "Oh, but I might lose my opportunities of usefulness!" What do
   you mean? That you are going to do evil that good may come? That is
   what it comes to. Will you really, before God, look that matter in the
   face? "Whatever He says unto you, do it." At any expense, at any risk,
   do it!

   I have heard some say, "Well, I do not like doing things in a hurry."
   Very well, but what says David? "I made haste, and delayed not--to keep
   Your Commandments." Remember that we sin every moment that we delay to
   do anything commanded by Christ. Whether every moment of delay is a
   fresh sin, I cannot say, but if we neglect any command of His, we are
   living in a condition of perpetual sinning against Him--and that is not
   a desirable position for any of Christ's disciples to live in! Beloved,
   "whatever He says unto you, do it." Do not argue against it and try to
   find some reason for not doing it. I have known some Believers who have
   not liked to have certain passages of Scripture read at the family
   altar because they have rather troubled their consciences. If there is
   anything in the Bible that quarrels with you, you are wrong--the Bible
   is not! Come to terms with it at once and the only terms will be obey,
   obey, obey your Lord's will! I am not holding this up to you as a way
   of salvation--you know I would never think of doing that! I am speaking
   to those of you who are saved! You are Christ's servants--His saved
   ones! And now you have come to the holy discipline of His house and
   this is the rule of it, "Whatever He says unto you, do it."

   Do it practically. Have we not been talking too much about what should
   be done by our friends, or observing what others do not do? Oh, that
   the Spirit of God would come upon us that our own walk might be close
   with God, our own obedience be precise and exact, our own love to
   Christ be proved by our continual following in His steps! Ours should
   be practical obedience.

   It must also be personal obedience--"Whatever He says unto you, do it."
   You know how much there is done by proxy, nowadays. Charity is done so.
   A is in a great deal of need. B hears of it and is very sorry, indeed.
   And so he asks C to come and help A. And then B goes to bed and feels
   that he has done a good thing! Or else when A has told his story to B,
   B looks out to see if there is some Society that will help him,
   although he never subscribes to the Society because he does not think
   of doing that! His part is just to pass A on to C, or to the Society
   and, having done that, he feels satisfied. Do you wish the Savior to
   say, in the Last Great Day, "I was hungry, and you sent Me to somebody
   else," or, "I was thirsty and you directed Me to the parish pump for a
   drink"? Nothing of the kind! We must do something personally for
   Christ.

   So is it in the matter of endeavoring to win souls to Christ. There is
   nothing like personally speaking to people, button-holing them, looking
   them in the eyes, talking your own personal experience over with them
   and pleading with them to fly to Christ for refuge! Personal obedience
   is what is needed. If one of these persons who were waiting had said,
   when the command had come from Christ to fill the waterpots, "John, you
   go and do it. William, you go and do it"--he would not have followed
   out Mary's command, "Whatever He says unto you, do it." Do I touch the
   conscience of anybody here? Well, if so, from this time forth cease to
   be a servant of God by proxy lest you be saved by proxy--and to be

   saved by proxy will be to be lost! But trust Christ for yourself and
   then serve Him for yourself, by His own mighty Grace--"Whatever He says
   unto you, do it."

   It must also be prompt obedience. Do it at once--delay will take the
   bloom from the obedience. "Whatever He says unto you," stand ready to
   obey. The moment that the command, "March," is given to the soldier, he
   marches. The moment a command comes to your heart and you see it to be
   really in the Word of God, do it! Oh, the murdered resolutions that lie
   round about most men's lives! What they would have done! What they
   could have done, if they had but done it! But they have been building
   castles in the air, imagining lives they would like to lead and not
   actually doing Christ's commands. Oh, for a prompt, personal, practical
   service to the Lord Jesus Christ!

   And in our case it is to be perpetual obedience. Mary said to these
   waiters, "Whatever He says unto you, do it." "Keep on doing it. Not
   only the first thing He says, but whatever He says unto you. As long as
   this feast lasts and He is here, do what my Son commands you." So,
   Beloved, as long as we are in this world, until life's last hour, may
   the Holy Spirit enable us to do just what Jesus bids us do! Can you
   say, my Brothers and Sisters--

   "Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave, and follow You"?

   Is it your wish that until you enter into His rest, you should always
   bear His yoke and follow His footsteps? Temporary Christians are not
   Christians! Those who ask for furlough from this Divine service have
   never entered it. We have put on our uniform to never take it off. As
   certain old knights in times of war slept in their armor and had the
   lance and shield always ready to hand, so must the Christian be, from
   this time forth and forever. "Ours not to reason why," ours not to
   delay when the command comes, but ours, while there is breath in our
   body, and life in our spirit, to serve Him who has redeemed us with His
   precious blood!

   Thus I have feebly set before you what it is that we are called to
   do--that is, to obey Christ's orders.

   II. Now for a few minutes let us ask, WHY IS THIS TO BE DONE? Beloved,
   why were these men to do what Jesus told them? Let that melt into, "Why
   are you and I to do what Jesus tells us?"

   First, Christ is, by Nature, worthy of obedience. I count it an honor
   to serve Christ. Oh, what is He? Perfect Man, rising nobly above us
   all! Perfect God, infinitely majestic in His two Natures. Why, it seems
   to me as if we ought to love to do His bidding and long to be conformed
   to His image! Here is the rest for our aspiring spirit. Here are the
   glory and the honor and the immortality for which we pant! By the glory
   of Christ, whom you adore unseen, "Whatever He says unto you, do it."

   Beside that, Christ is our only hope. All our prospects for the future
   depend upon Him. Glory be to His blessed name! There is none like He.
   If He were gone from us and we could not trust in Him, life would be an
   endless darkness, an abyss of woe! By all the glory of His Nature and
   all that we owe to Him, and all that we look for from Him, I charge
   you, beloved Friends, "Whatever He says unto you, do it."

   More than that, He is All-Wise, and so fit to lead. Who but He could
   get these people out of their trouble at the feast when they needed
   wine? He knew the way out of it all--a way that would manifest His own
   Glory, make His disciples believe in Him and make everybody round about
   happy. But if He did not show the way, nobody could. So let us obey
   Him, for His commands are so wise. He never has made a mistake and He
   never will. Let us commit our way unto His keeping and whatever He says
   unto us, let us do it!

   Besides, Beloved, Christ has rewarded our obedience before. Did you
   ever act rightly and, after all, find it a mistake? Some of us have had
   to do very grievous things in our time that have gone sorely against
   the grain. Would we do them again? Yes, that we would, if they cost 10
   times as much! No man has ever, in looking back, regretted that he
   followed the voice of conscience and the dictates of God's Word--and he
   never will, though he should even go to prison and to death for
   Christ's sake! You may lose for Christ, but you shall never lose by
   Christ! When all comes to be added up, you shall be a greater gainer
   because of the apparent loss. He has never deceived you and never
   misled you. Obedience to Him has always brought you real solid peace.
   Therefore, "whatever He says unto you, do it."

   Yet once more, Christ is our Master and we must obey Him. I hope,
   Beloved, that there is no one among us here who would call Him, Master,
   and yet not do the things that He says. We do not talk about Him as one
   who was once great, but who is gone away and whose influence is now
   upon the wane because He is not up to "the spirit of the age." No, but
   He still lives and we still commune with Him. He is our Master and
   Lord! When we were baptized into His death, it was

   no mere matter of form--but we were dead to the world and we lived to
   Him. When we took His sacred name upon us and were called Christians,
   it was no sham--we meant that He should be Captain, King and Master of
   our spirits! He is no Baali, that is, domineering lord but He is Ishi,
   our Man, our Husband and, in His husbandly relationship He is Lord and
   Governor of every thought and every motion of our nature! Jesus, Jesus,
   Your yoke is easy and your burden is light! It is joyous to bear it! To
   get away from it would be misery, indeed, and that is one reason why I
   say to you, tonight, "Whatever He says unto you, do it," because if you
   do not, you cast off your allegiance to Him--and what are you going to
   do, then?

   To whom will you go if you turn away from Him? Every man must have a
   master. Will you be your own master? You cannot have a greater tyrant!
   Will you let the world be your master? Are you going to be a servant of
   "society"? There are no worse slaves than these! Are you going to live
   for self, for honor, for what is called, "pleasure"? Ah, me, you may as
   well go down to Egypt, to the iron furnace, at once! To whom can we go?
   Jesus, to whom can we go, if we go away from You? You have the words of
   eternal life! "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of
   the altar." Throw another bond of love about me, another cord of sweet
   constraint and let me never ever think of parting with You! Let me be
   crucified to the world and the world to me!

   Do not your hearts pray after that fashion? Oh, to be wholly Christ's,
   entirely Christ's, forever Christ's! Yes, yes, we will listen to the
   command, "Whatever He says unto you, do it." I have given you the
   reason why we should obey Christ's orders.

   III. And now, Beloved, let me occupy the last few minutes in answering
   this question, WHAT WILL FOLLOW FROM THIS OBEDIENCE? Suppose we do
   whatever Christ commands us, what then? I will tell you what then.

   The first thing is, that you will feel free from responsibility. The
   servant who has done what his master has told him, may, in his own
   mind, fear that some dreadful consequences may follow, but he says to
   himself, "It will be no fault of mine. I did what I was told to do."
   Now, Beloved, if you want to get rid of the whole burden of life, by
   faith do whatever Christ commands you! Then, if the heavens should seem
   about to fall, it would be no business of yours to shore them up. You
   have not to mend God's work and keep it right. I remember what Mr. John
   Wesley said to his preachers--"Now, Brothers, I do not want you to mend
   my rules. I want you to obey them." That is pretty strong from John
   Wesley, but from our Lord Jesus Christ it comes most suitably. He does
   not want us to get to altering, mending, touching up and looking at
   consequences. No! Do exactly what He tells you and you have nothing to
   do with the consequences! You may have to bear them, but He will give
   you Grace to do that--and it shall be your joy to bear all ill
   consequences that come of firm obedience to Christ.

   This kind of doctrine does not suit the year 1889. If you go over to
   Scotland and see where the Covenanters' graves are, anybody who thinks
   according to the spirit of this age will say that they were just a lot
   of fools to have been so stubborn and so strict about doctrine as to
   die for it. Why, really, there is not anything in the new philosophy
   that is worth dying for! I wonder whether there is any "modern thought"
   doctrine that would be worth the purchase of a cat's life? According to
   the teaching of the broad school, what is supposed to be true, today,
   may not be true tomorrow, so it is not worth dying for. We may as well
   put off the dying till the thing is altered--and if we wait a month, it
   will be altered and thus, at the last, you may get the old creed back
   again! The Lord send it and send us yet a race of men who will obey
   what He bids them, do what He tells them, believe what He teaches them
   and lay their own wills down in complete obedience to their Lord and
   Master! Such a people will feel free from responsibility.

   Then you shall feel a sweet flow of love to Christ. The disobedient
   child--well, he will not be turned out of the house because he will not
   do the bidding of his mother and father. But when he does not submit to
   the rule of the house, he has a hard time of it and he ought to have.
   There is that evening kiss, it is not as warm as it would have been.
   And that morning greeting, after long disobedience, has no happiness in
   it. And, indeed, the more kind father and mother are, the more unhappy
   he is! And the sweet love of Christ is such that it makes us unhappy in
   disobedience. You cannot walk contrary to Christ and yet enjoy
   fellowship with Him. And the more dear and near He is to you, so much
   the wider does the gap seem to be when you are not doing His bidding.

   Besides, there is no carrying out your faith except by doing as He bids
   you. That faith which lies only in a creed, or in a little pious book
   is not good for much. Faith does what Christ bids it do and it delights
   to do so! It rejoices to run risks,

   it delights to put off from the land and get out to sea. It is glad to
   sacrifice itself when Jesus calls for it because faith cannot be
   satisfied without bearing fruit--and the fruit of faith is obedience to
   Him in whom we believe.

   Beloved, I also think that if we will obey Christ in what He says, we
   shall be learning to be leaders. Wellington used to say that no man is
   fit to command until he has learned to obey--and I am sure that it is
   so. We shall never see a race of really first-rate men unless our boys
   and girls are made to obey their parents in their childhood. The
   essential glory of manhood is lost when disobedience is tolerated and,
   certainly, in the Church of God, the Lord does put His leading servants
   through very severe ordeals. The best place for the books of a minister
   is not his library, but very often a sick-bed. Affliction is our school
   and before we can deal with others, God must deal with us. If you will
   not obey, you shall not be set to command.

   And lastly, I do believe that learning to obey is one of the
   preparatives for the enjoyments of Heaven. Why, in Heaven, they have no
   will but God's will! Their will is to serve Him and delight themselves
   in Him. And if you and I do not learn, here below, what obedience to
   God is, and practice it, and carry it out, how can we hope to be happy
   in the midst of obedient spirits? Dear Hearers, if you have never
   learned to trust Christ and obey Him, how can you go to Heaven? You
   would be so unhappy there that you would ask God to let you run to Hell
   for shelter, for nothing would strike you with more horror than to be
   in the midst of perfectly holy people who find their delight in the
   service of God! May the Lord bring us to this complete obedience to
   Christ! Then this world will be an inclined plane, or a ladder such as
   Jacob saw, up which we shall trip with holy gladness till we come to
   the top and find our Heaven in perfect obedience to God!

   It is not Mary who speaks to you, tonight, but it is the Church of God,
   the mother of all who truly love Christ, and she says to you, "Whatever
   He says unto you, do it," and if you will do it, He will turn the water
   into wine for you. He will make your love more glad and happy than it
   ever would have been without obeying Him and He will provide for you.
   Obey Him and He will comfort you. Obey Him and He will perfect you. Be
   with Him in the ways of duty and you shall be with Him in the home of
   Glory!

   The Lord grant this, of His infinite Grace, giving to us to know the
   will of Christ, and then working in us to will and to do of His own
   good pleasure! Amen and Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. JOHN2:1-11.

   Our Savior had lived on the earth for 30 years and had worked no
   miracle. There was the hiding of His power. He had been subject to His
   parents and had lived in obscurity. Now He has broken through the
   obscurity and He begins His public ministry by working a miracle.

   Verse 1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee.
   "The third day." John keeps a kind of diary for Christ. In those first
   days there was something for every day and they were a specimen of the
   whole life of the Savior. He could never say, like Titus, "I have lost
   a day." Every day had its deed--glorifying to God and blessed to men.
   Let us also try to labor for Christ every day--let there be no day
   without its mark. May God grant that there may be something to make
   every day memorable! "And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of
   Galilee." The first miracle of our Lord was not worked at Jerusalem,
   but away there in the back settlements, in "Galilee of the Gentiles."
   It was necessary for Him to be seen and to work miracles which might be
   seen, but He began in an obscure region, among a despised people.

   1. And the mother of Jesus was there. This expression leads to the
   belief that there was some kind of kinship between the bridegroom or
   the bride and the mother of Jesus, for it is not said that she was
   invited to be there, but that she "was

   there."

   2. And both Jesus was called and His disciples to the marriage. Happy
   marriage, where Christ is invited to be present! Where Christ goes, His
   disciples go. If they suffer with Him, they also rejoice with Him. If
   He goes to a feast, they must go, too--"Both Jesus was called and His
   disciples." They were only five, but five is a large number to add to a
   poor family's wedding party. It shows the generosity of their heart
   that they invited Jesus to come and bring His disciples. And He went to
   put honor upon marriage, especially as He foresaw that the day would
   come when the apostate church of Rome would reckon marriage to be
   dishonorable and not permit one who was married to officiate as a
   minister.

   3. And when they needed wine, the mother of Jesus said unto Him, They
   have no wine. I notice that John calls Mary "the mother of Jesus." I
   suppose he had in his mind the dying words of Christ, "Behold your
   mother!" Such things make a deep impression upon us and we are apt,
   when writing, to use the phrases that have been burnt into the memory.
   "The mother of Jesus." Because she has been too much exalted in the
   Romish church, I fear that we run to the other extreme, and think too
   little of this woman to whom the angel Gabriel said, "Hail, you that
   are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women."
   "They needed wine." They had not been long married before there was
   need in the house. Even in the brightest days of life, they needed
   something more. And when the mother of Jesus saw that they were in need
   and that the marriage festival would be dishonored, so she went to her
   Son and she said, "They have no wine." I fear she spoke a little like
   an ordinary mother addressing her son, but the time had come when that
   discipline was to end. Mary was not His mother as the Son of God. He
   was about to work a miracle and He would have her and all His relatives
   know that He would not use His miraculous powers merely for their
   advantage, but for the Glory of God and the instruction of men.

   4. Jesus said unto her, Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is
   not yet come. It was a very difficult position for Him to be in--to act
   the part of a loving and obedient son as far as His Manhood was
   concerned, and yet, as the Son of God, by no means to compromise His
   Divine Character, but to stand out there as being under no influence of
   the flesh. Just as we are not to know Christ after the flesh, so He no
   longer knew mother, or brother, or friend, according to earthly
   relationship. And when Mary intruded her motherhood upon Him, it was
   but right and fitting that He should say, "What have I to do with you?
   My hour is not yet come." The Savior had an hour for everything--an
   hour for suffering and an hour for working. And He did everything
   punctually, promptly to the minute. That was one of the beauties of His
   life--"My hour is not yet come." Perhaps He meant, "My hour to work
   this miracle is not yet come" and He would not be hurried by anybody.
   Beloved, it is not easy to be familiar with Christ, as I trust we are,
   and yet always to maintain humble deference to His sacred will. Never
   let us pray as if we were dictators, or His equals. We must keep our
   place, however near we come to the dear bosom of our Lord. He is still
   in Heaven and we are upon earth. He is the Master, we are the
   servants--and if we are as favored as His mother was, we must not go
   too far, as she did.

   5. His mother said unto the servants, Whatever He says unto you, do it.
   This holy woman took the rebuke in silence. She said nothing. She felt
   the force of Christ's words--she proved that she did by now fully
   believing that He would do something or other. Had He not said, "My
   hour is not yet come"? Did not that mean that the hour would come and
   that He would do something, by-and-by? So she quietly accepted His
   reproof. Oh, you who are in great trouble, you feel as if you could
   force the hand of Christ, but you must not think of doing that! Even if
   you could have power over Him, you would be very foolish to use it. Let
   Him alone! He knows best how and when to show His Grace towards you.
   Keep silence before Him and in patience commit your way unto Him.

   6. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of
   the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. I
   admire the accuracy of the Holy Spirit. John does not know exactly how
   much these vessels held. They were not made to measure things in, so he
   writes, "containing two or three firkins apiece." Let us always speak
   correctly. Sometimes, "almost," or, "thereabouts," will be words that
   will save our truthfulness. Let us not speak positively when we do not
   know! And when the accuracy of a statement is necessary and we cannot
   give it in terms that are definite, let us give it in words like these,
   "containing two or three firkins apiece." These were great "waterpots
   of stone." Stone will not, as a rule, hold the flavor of anything that
   has been in it, like an earthen vessel would do. So these pots, which
   had contained nothing else but water, could not be suspected of having
   any lees of wine concealed therein, or any flavoring material that
   would make the water taste like wine. No, they were genuine stone
   waterpots!

   7. Jesus said unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
   them up to the brim. There was no fear of anything but water being
   there--"They filled them up to the brim." They obeyed Christ to the
   letter. If Christ says to you, "Fill the waterpots with water," fill
   them up to the brim! Never cut down His commandments--carry them out as
   far as the largest interpretation can go. When you are told to believe
   in Him, believe in Him up to the brim! When you are told to love Him,
   love Him up to the brim! When you are commanded to serve Him, serve Him
   up to the brim!

   8. And He said unto them, Draw some out, now, and take it to the
   governor of the feast. And they took it. "Draw some out, now." "Now."
   He had not turned the water into wine by any incantation. He simply
   willed it and it was done! He said, "Draw some out, now." He did not
   need to leave it unnoticed because He had not worked a miracle
   before--and

   He could not really say whether this was one. He was sure it was, so He
   said to the servants, when they had filled the wa-terpots with water,
   "Draw some out, now. Do not bring it to Me for Me to taste it. I know
   what it is. Take it to the chairman of the festival, to Him who sits at
   the head of the table and is the judge of the wine." "And they took
   it." The holy confidence of Christ is admirable. May we be able, by
   faith, so to work, with a calm consciousness of Divine help! But notice
   this. Whenever the Lord fills any of you with a blessing, think that
   you hear Him say, "Draw some out, now." He does not fill these pots
   that they may be kept full. "Draw some out, now." Did you have a good
   time last Monday night at the Prayer Meeting? Some of us had. "Draw
   some out, now." Have you lived near to God of late, and are you very
   happy? "Draw some out, now." If He has filled you up to the brim, draw
   some out, now, for, if you try to store it up, it will become useless.
   Selfishness will poison it all!

   9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,
   and knew not from where it came, (but the servants which drew the water
   knew), the governor of the feast called the bridegroom. There was no
   collusion, for the governor, who tasted it, did not know where it came
   from. And the servants, who knew where it came from, did not taste it,
   so that they did not know what it was like. If anybody objects to the
   Savior making wine, I think that the best reply is that all the wine
   which is made of water will do nobody any hurt--and the more of it the
   better! And this was so made, certainly. They say that there is a devil
   in every grape. There were no grapes, here! And I am afraid that there
   is not much of them in most of the wine that is made, nowadays--there
   is something worse than devil in that.

   10. And said unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good
   wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse, but you
   have kept the good wine until now. That the governor of the feast did
   not understand, but he admired it and here is a picture of what our
   Lord always does. He gives His people the best, last. At first, the
   wine of the Kingdom is mingled with much bitterness--salt tears of
   sorrow flow into it. But it improves as we go on and when we shall
   drink it with Him, in the Kingdom of God, what will it be like? The joy
   of Christ's love on earth is Heaven, but when we get to Heaven and
   drink it fresh from the everlasting spring, what will that joy be? Oh,
   the blessedness laid up for the people of God! We pluck some of the
   fruit from the trees and eat it, but the fruits laid up in the
   fruit-chamber, to get ripe, by-and-by, are the very pick of the fruit
   of the Tree of Life! You who live for the world have already had your
   best, but, as for our feast with Christ, we go from good to better and
   from better to the best!

   11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
   manifested forth His Glory. Moses turned water into blood. Christ
   turned water into wine. One brought a curse upon the common things of
   daily life. The other put an added sweetness and blessing into them.

   11. And His disciples believed on Him. They believed on Him before, but
   now they had an ocular demonstration of His Divine Power and Godhead,
   and they believed as they had not believed before! May you and I often
   make distinct progress in faith, so that it may be said of us, also,
   "His disciples believed on Him"!

God's Pupil, God's Preacher--an Autobiography

   (No. 2318)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 23, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   28, 1889.

   "O God, You ha ve taught me from my youth: and until this time ha ve I
   declared Your wondrous works." Psalm 71:17.

   You notice how much David is at home with God. He talks about Him. He
   does better, he talks to Him. He hears God speaking to him and he keeps
   up a dialog with God. Where did this holy familiarity come from? It
   sprang from long acquaintance! David as a boy had known God. He knew
   Him when he was old and gray-headed and, you know, old friends use
   language to one another which would not be tolerated in occasional
   acquaintances. There are certain things which they who have long known
   the Lord and who abide in Him, may say to God and of God, which might
   not be said by others. It might even verge on blasphemy if others were
   to say the same things. When you read books like Rutherford's Letters,
   or Madame Guyon's Sonnets, or George Herbert's Poems, you must not
   think that everybody may speak so. These were the Johns and the Marys,
   the favorites of Heaven--they had dwelt so long with the King that He
   permitted to them, no, He fostered in them, things that would be
   impertinences in strangers and might not even be seemly to beginners in
   the things of God. Oh, may you and I live long enough and well enough
   to be on very intimate terms with God! May we walk with Him till, one
   of these days, we walk away with Him, and they say of us, "He was not,
   for God took him"!

   David here tells us, no, he tells God, rather than us, that he had been
   God's pupil all his life--"O God, You have taught me from my
   youth"--and then he says that he had been God's pupil-teacher--"and
   until this time have I declared Your wondrous works." When we have
   listened to David on these two points, the preacher will venture, with
   some hesitancy, but still under a sort of compulsion, to use the words,
   himself, and say, "O God, You have taught me from my youth: and until
   this time have I declared Your wondrous works." The preacher using the
   Psalmist's language in the hope that many here will make bold to come
   into the same lot and take a share in the same heritage, that many
   here, especially many young people may say in later days, "O God, You
   have taught me from my youth: and until now have I declared Your
   wondrous works."

   I. First, then, let us think of DAVID AS A PUPIL. God was his Teacher.
   "O God, You have taught me from my

   youth."

   This shows that David had a teachable spirit and if you had asked him
   where it came from, he would have said that God gave him a teachable
   spirit. God is not only the Teacher of our spirit, but he gives us a
   teachable spirit. Have we all received that precious gift? The "genius
   of the age" is against a teachable spirit. You would suppose, now, to
   hear some men preach that Christ said, "Go you into all the world and
   make critics of every creature, and they shall be saved thereby." But
   that is not the Gospel! I do not so much blame the age for its errors,
   as for the fundamental error of not being willing to be taught. Men
   have cast off authority and wherein authority in religious things is
   not of God, it is well cast off, but I fear that in casting off the
   evil, many have gone far towards casting off even Divine Authority. No,
   you are not to think what you like. You are not to believe as you
   please. No man may control you, but God has never given liberty to your
   thought or to your understanding to be free from His government! What
   He reveals, you are to accept--to take it as Infallibly true, to bow
   the knee of your intellect before it, to believe that, "He teaches to
   profit" and to expect the fulfillment of the promise--"All your
   children shall be taught of the Lord."

   A teachable spirit, although it is despised by many, is a happy spirit.
   It is a growing spirit. It is a restful spirit. It is a heavenly spirit
   and whoever has it must ascribe the possession of it to the Spirit of
   God who leads us into all Truths of

   God and makes us willing to be led therein. Oh, that we may have such a
   spirit, that we shall count it an honor to say, "O God, You have taught
   me"! Some would count that as a dishonor. They would say, "O God, even
   You cannot teach us! There is more in our honest doubt than in all the
   faith You can give us," which, being interpreted, is a lie! No, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, let us seek and covet earnestly a teachable
   spirit, that, like David, we may be taught of God.

   In David's acknowledgment, we learn that God took him very early into
   His school. "You have taught me from my youth." What a mercy it is to
   begin to know God before we begin to know anything else! The first
   words of the Bible are very significant--"In the beginning, God." The
   first words of this Book should be the first words of every life-book--
   "In the beginning, God." Happy shall you be if your first intelligible
   thoughts shall be of your Maker, your Benefactor, your Friend. Happy
   shall you be, for, as you shall grow in understanding, you shall also
   grow in acquaintance with your God! And every ripening faculty shall be
   sanctified as it opens, so that your first morning shall have no dew
   but the dew of holiness and of Divine Life resting upon it!

   Where was David taught in his youth? I suppose in the pastures of
   Palestine. When he was keeping his father's flock, he sat down--he
   thought, he meditated, he prayed. Beneath the stars that looked down on
   him like so many eyes of Divine Love, he sat at night and spoke with
   God, and God talked with him. And among the sheep he learned to sing,
   "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want," There he learned of God so
   well that when a lion and a bear came against his flock, and took away
   a lamb, he fell upon the monstrous beasts and, in the strength of God,
   tore them asunder--and he remembered to ascribe the glory of his deeds
   to God and to praise His holy name! He spent his school-days well. He
   passed the highest standards and he carried the certificates in the
   skin of the lion and the paw of the bear. Oh, blessed is the young man,
   who is taught of God as to be equal to the duties of his station and
   able to find God is his strength in carrying them out!

   David's words also mean that God kept him in His school as a youth.
   Generally, boys go to Sunday school till they begin to feel themselves
   young men. You half insulted one just now when you called him a lad! He
   is "a young man" and his companion is not a girl, she is "a young
   woman." She could not go with girls, now that she is a young woman. And
   these young people think they are too big for the Sunday school! And
   very often this is the point where the Church of God loses touch with
   them. It was not so with David. He could say, "O God, You have taught
   me from my youth." He kept on being taught as he grew up to be a young
   man. He still walked with God and so well did he use his early lessons
   that, going to the army to meet his brothers, he saw the giant Goliath
   defying the armies of the living God and he came forward and said to
   Saul, "Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
   uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them." And he puts in
   practice, as a young man, the lessons of his boyish days. Glorifying
   God, he slings his stone and lays the giant low. How well did God teach
   him, by his many struggles, educating his faith and increasing his
   Divine Graces! When he was at the court of Saul, he continued, as a
   young man, to still learn by the songs of those who said, "Saul has
   slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands," and by the sneers of
   envious courtiers, yes, and even by the javelin of the jealous king, he
   kept on learning and being taught of God, so that he behaved himself in
   a simple way in the sight of Israel, being instructed of the Most High.

   When he became a man, even when he became a king, he still continued to
   be taught of God. With a crown on his head, he was still a scholar and
   disciple of the great God. Swaying a scepter, he was still nothing but
   a child before a father when he thought of God. It is beautiful to
   notice, in David's life, how often he says, "Bring here the ephod." He
   would know the will of God! He would listen to Nathan the Prophet--he
   would enquire of the Lord's servants that he might learn more of God!
   David, as a man, was taught of God in his trials, in his crosses, in
   his comforts, by his friends and by his enemies. He was always being
   taught of God. Sometimes, alas, he forgot his lesson, or he blotted his
   book--but he never left the school. He was chastened, but he was never
   cast out--he still continued as God's pupil. We find him, as a
   gray-headed man, still penning his Psalms and being taught of
   God--perhaps in his last days learning most, learning most sorrowfully,
   staining his book with tears, discovering more of himself and more of
   the mercy of God, more of the power of temptation and more of the power
   of the Sacrifice that puts away sin--more of the wanderings of his
   heart and more of that free Spirit who upholds us and makes us walk in
   the ways of God. He was always being educated. A Christian has never
   finished his education till he stands before the golden Throne of God.

   There are many aged men who can say with David, "O God, You have taught
   me from my youth." They find themselves learners, yet, for they are
   "unstable, weak, and apt to slide." O young people, you who are just
   beginning life, I do

   pray that you will begin learning soon enough to be able to say
   afterwards, "O God, You have taught me from my youth." There are some
   here who can never say that. Whatever becomes of them, however much God
   may bless them, they can never say it, for they have reached the middle
   of life, and they have not gone to school to the great Teacher. Well,
   if you cannot say all that you could wish to say, may the Lord take you
   into His school, now, though you are a ten o'clock scholar, and yet
   teach you, so that you shall learn enough music to sing among the
   angels to the praise of the Glory of His Grace, wherein He has made you
   to be accepted in the Beloved!

   Surely, dear Friends, we are so foolish that we need to be taught, and
   we cannot have a better Teacher than the Omniscient God! Let us,
   therefore, pray, tonight, that if we are at God's school, we may stay
   there. And that if we are not there, we may go there at once. May all
   our names be put down in the roll of scholars of the College of Christ,
   the University of Grace, this very night, and God shall have the
   praise!

   II. But now I want you, for a minute or two, to notice DAVID AS A
   PUPIL-TEACHER. While he was a pupil, he was also teaching. He says,
   "Until this time have I declared Your wondrous works."

   Observe, then, that David taught people what he saw. He saw God's works
   all around him. Ah, me, that is a great sight! God is at work
   everywhere and there are none so blind as those who will not see His
   works. But the mass of men do not see God. You see the working of
   machinery. You see the working of the laws of Nature. You see the
   working of the laws of supply and demand. But many of you cannot see
   the working of God! May the Lord open your eyes, poor blind bats, for
   if there is anything that stares in the face of the man who is willing
   to see it, it is God, and God at work in Providence, in Nature, in
   Grace and in all sorts of ways! I read of one, the other day, of whom
   somebody said that when he stayed at his house, he noticed that he
   talked as if he saw God always before him--and truly, that is how every
   Christian should talk, for we should see God always before us! David
   said, "I have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right
   hand, I shall not be moved." We do not see God as we should and we
   shall never teach aright for God until we have a kind of instinctive
   feeling of the Presence of God--till we are conscious that God is in
   us, round about us and at work for us!

   God's work that David saw was very much work in himself, work for
   himself and work in other men's hearts. Being taken into the School of
   God, he was made to observe things--he had object lessons put before
   him and he learned to read God's work. And as he saw it, he wondered.
   "Until this time," he said, "have I declared Your wondrous works." He
   who is a stranger to wonder is a stranger to God, for God is wonderful
   every way, everywhere and always! It is all wonders when you get near
   to God and see what God does. And, you know, no man teaches a thing so
   well as when he is struck with it himself! When it astonishes him, he
   will then tell it to others with gusto and with emphasis. So David made
   a fine pupil-teacher, because, seeing God's work, he wondered at it and
   spoke of it as a wondrous thing.

   We find that David took opportunity to declare God's wondrous work,
   sometimes, with his pen, writing his Psalms. Sometimes with his voice,
   singing those Psalms. Sometimes talking to a few, sometimes speaking to
   many. Now, dear Friends, what I want you all to do is, if you have seen
   God's work and have been struck with it, you should declare it-- tell
   it to others! I know that some of you, at any rate, love God and fear
   Him, but you never speak about Him. Ah, me, have you a dumb devil, or
   are you possessed with a dumb spirit? The Lord cast it out of you!
   There is no way of learning so good as that of teaching! A young man
   who was going to Cambridge, said, I think it was to Archbishop
   Whateley, that he was going to get a "coach," that is, a tutor, to
   coach him through his studies. "Do not do that," said the other, "Take
   a pupil--you will learn better that way." And I believe that it is so.
   To teach is a wonderful way of learning! I know that by experience. To
   read hard all day and then, in the evening, to go and preach what you
   have read, will stamp it indelibly upon your memory and lead you to a
   better knowledge of it than any other method that a philosopher could
   suggest! Therefore, first learn of God and then teach to somebody else
   what you have learned. You will keep it that way. You will never lose
   it. If you keep on only learning and learning, and learning, and
   learning--your hoarding it up will breed mildew and I know not what
   besides. But if you learn it and then teach it, that will keep it sweet
   and you will never forget it. This is David's pupil-teachership--he is
   being taught of God--and he is teaching others.

   And David had this happiness, that he could say, "You have taught me
   from my youth: and until now have I declared Your wondrous works." That
   is, he kept on teaching and he kept on teaching the same thing. What
   must the ministries of some of our ministers be like? The first five
   years are spent in teaching Evangelical Doctrine. The next five years
   are spent in pulling that all to pieces. The next five years are spent
   in teaching some new philosophy--no, not five years--

   they are not so long as that over any one thing. I mean, the first five
   months are spent in teaching some new philosophy, then a month in
   pulling that to pieces, another month in making a new theory and
   another month in pulling that to pieces!

   Oh, what kind of a life must it be? "I never saw," said Poor Richard,
   "an oft-removed tree, nor yet an oft-removed family, that thrived."
   Surely an oft-removed Doctrine, when a man is perpetually shifting the
   soil around it, can never thrive, or do much good. Here the
   great-hearted veteran says, "You have taught me from my youth: and
   until now have I declared Your wondrous works." All this he ascribed to
   God--he gave God the glory of his learning and of his teaching, also.
   May you and I do the same! So far about David.

   III. Now for a few words about myself for the honor and Glory of God. I
   could not help saying something, tonight,

   about what Hugh Miller calls, "MY SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS." "O God,
   You have taught me from my

   youth: and until now have I declared Your wondrous works."

   I went down, last week, to Maidstone in Kent. It is as near as possible
   to the day, 40 years ago, when I left the school called a, "College,"
   there. I thought that I must go down and look at the spot and specially
   at a tree which stands by the Medway River. Under that tree I spent
   many hours and many days, and even many weeks reading all day long. "In
   school-time?" you ask. Yes, my master thought that I should do better
   under that tree than in the classroom. And he was a wise man. He gave
   me my books and left me to myself. And as I stood, last week, under
   that tree, with the smoothly flowing river at my feet, I could thank
   God for His mercy to me for all these 40 years and I could say, "O God,
   You have taught me from my youth: and until now have I declared Your
   wondrous works." There may be some young people here, tonight, just
   come back from school. Some young people who are just finishing their
   school days. I would to God that they would spend some time in holy,
   quiet thought about their future--about whom they will serve, who shall
   be their Teacher, for whom they will become teachers--and how the life
   which has now become more public than before shall be spent.

   As I stood there, last week, I could not help praising God that, not
   long after I left that school, He led me to faith in Christ and to rest
   in Him. He allowed me to find eternal life and I could not but thank
   God that I went to that school for 12 months. It was a Church of
   England school. I had never seen anything of Church of Englandism till
   that time, but there was a turning in my life, through being there, to
   which I owe my being here! The Church of England Catechism has in it,
   as some of you may remember, this question, "What is required of
   persons to be baptized?" And the answer I was taught to give and did
   give, was, "Repentance, whereby they forsake sin. And faith, whereby
   they steadfastly believe the promises of God made to them in that
   sacrament." I looked that answer up in the Bible and I found it to be
   strictly correct as far as repentance and faith are concerned and, of
   course, when I afterwards became a Christian, I also became a
   Baptist--and here I am--and it is due to the Church of England
   Catechism that I am a Baptist! Having been brought up among
   Congregationalists, I had never looked at the matter in my life. I had
   thought myself to have been baptized as an infant and so, when I was
   confronted with the question, "What is required of persons to be
   baptized?" and I found that repentance and faith were required, I said
   to myself, "Then I have not been baptized! That infant sprinkling of
   mine was a mistake! And please, God, if ever I have repentance and
   faith, I will be properly baptized."

   I did not know that there was one other person in the world who held
   the same opinion, for so little do Baptists make any show, or so little
   did they do so, then, that I did not know of their existence! So I feel
   grateful to the Church school and grateful to the Church Catechism, for
   what I learned at Maidstone. I do not know that I have any vivid
   gratitude for any other question in the Catechism, but I am very
   thankful for that particular one, for it led me where it was never
   intended to lead me by those who wrote it. It led me, however, as I
   believe, to follow the Scriptural teaching that repentance and faith
   are required before there can be any true Baptism.

   Well now, what shall be your schools and schoolmasters? Dear young
   people, I long that each of you may be able to say, "O Lord, You have
   taught me from my youth." You must, first of all, be taught by the Holy
   Spirit. He is willing and able to come into your mind and to influence
   it in a very extraordinary but very effectual way. He can teach your
   reason, reason! And cause your understanding to understand aright. He
   can take away from you the bent of prejudice. He can remove from you
   the depraving influence of sin and He can give you to understand those
   things which are essential to your peace and eternal salvation. Seek
   the Spirit of God, then, to begin with.

   Then your next school will be the Inspired Word of God. Believe in this
   Bible from the first word of Genesis to the last line of Revelation. It
   will never mislead you! It has never misled anybody. It will tell you
   the truth as to your conduct, as to your condition before God, as to
   what you are to believe and what you are to do. If you search well the
   Scriptures, if the Law of God instructs you and if the Gospel of God
   teaches you, then God will be teaching you, for this is the school-book
   of the family of love and they who will accept it, and believe it,
   shall be taught of the Spirit of God who indited it!

   Have not all of us, who are in the School of Christ, learned much, in
   the next place, from the means of Grace? "Forsake not the assembling of
   yourselves together." I have to bear my willing witness to the benefit
   received in the congregation of God's people. "What?" you ask, "Why,
   you do not hear any sermons!" No, I hear very few except my own and
   they are not the best. But preaching them is probably of more service
   to me than hearing them is to you, for there is a care of the Word of
   God that is necessary and the searching of it in the preparation of the
   sermon, and the waiting upon God for help in the service--all these
   have been, to me, a means of Grace. Paul so regarded it when he said,
   "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this Grace
   given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
   of Christ." He found that it was a means of Grace to him to be
   permitted to preach. Certainly, you young people must take care that
   you do not neglect the public services of God's House. They will teach
   you from your youth.

   Another method of teaching is that of observation of others. If we
   would be taught of God, we must keep our eyes open to see how He deals
   with others. "Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright." Watch the
   hypocrite. Keep your eye on the prosperous sinner. If you do, you will
   soon find God teaching you wondrous things.

   You will also be taught by conversing with the people of God. Young
   Christian, get much with old Christians--I do not mean with all of
   them--some of them will not help you much. But I mean those who live
   near to God and are real and genuine saints. Speak with them. Tell them
   your difficulties and ask them how they have got through the same
   trials. Compare the footsteps of the flock with your own footsteps.
   Many an old child of God will be a precious mine of instruction to you.
   The first lessons I ever had in theology were from an old cook in the
   school where I was an usher. She was a good old soul and used to read
   The Gospel Standard. She liked something very sweet, indeed--good
   strong Calvinistic Doctrine--but she lived strongly as well as fed
   strongly. Many a time we have gone over the Covenant of Grace together
   and talked of the personal election of the saints, their union to
   Christ, their final perseverance and what vital godliness meant. And I
   do believe that I learned more from her than I would have learned from
   any six doctors of divinity of the sort we have nowadays! There are
   some Christian people who taste, and see, and enjoy religion in their
   own souls--and who get at a deeper knowledge of it than books can ever
   give them though they should search all their days! Get with such
   people of God, the experienced people, the tried people, and you will
   be able to say, "O God, You have taught me from my youth."

   Another schoolmaster is self-examination. A very sour, crabbed
   schoolmaster is this one! Very few like him, especially if you take a
   lesson every night before you go to sleep and look through the actions
   of the day. It is not a very pleasant exercise--there are so many
   faults to find, so many mistakes made, so many good things omitted.
   But, if you cannot have self-examination every day, at any rate have it
   sometimes. You will learn better by your mistakes than if you had never
   made a blunder. Sometimes even a grave fault may save you from 10 grave
   faults, if it is well observed and avoided in the future--and God
   teaches you thereby. You learn nothing by self-examination unless the
   Lord is your Master, but, if He is with you, then your acquaintance
   with yourself will help you to an acquaintance with Him! There are two
   prayers always worth praying, "Lord, show me myself and, "Lord, show me
   Yourself." May both be heard and you will be well taught of God!

   But there is a schoolhouse to which I have gone and to which I expect
   to go again. I cannot commend it to you for its pleasant situation, or
   for the beauty of its architecture. It is called the schoolhouse of
   sore affliction. Whoever does not go to that school, every minister
   whom God blesses to the salvation of souls will have to go there! It is
   an absolute necessity of a true shepherd of God's tried people that he
   should be tried. There may be exceptions, but I do not think that there
   are and, dear Friends, you, each one of you, if you are to be taught of
   God, will have to be afflicted. There are some Truths of God that are
   never learned. I suppose they may be learned, but they never are,
   except in the dark. Today, in the middle of the day, we could not see
   the stars. But if we had gone down a well, we might have seen them. And
   often the dark hole of affliction reveals stars of promise and
   glittering Truths of God which otherwise we never could have seen! I
   will appeal to my experienced Brothers and Sisters here. Have you not
   learned more in trial than anywhere else? Do you

   not owe more to the hammer, the file, the anvil and the forge than to
   all the comforts that you ever received? Here it is that God really
   fashions us. Till He gets us into the fire and the hammer begins to
   ring upon us, there seems to be no shaping us after the method of
   Divine working.

   And, dear Friends, once more I come to a place on which I stood in the
   middle of the sermon. God has taught me, and He has taught many of us,
   by setting us to work to bless others. If any Christians cannot learn
   quickly, let them get to work for Christ and they will soon learn!
   "Oh," says one, "I am so full of doubts and fears." Get to work for the
   Lord! "Oh," says another, "I never have much joy and peace." Get to
   work for the Lord! Another cries, "I am afraid that I am not saved! I
   am often afraid that I am not and yet I do believe in Jesus Christ."
   Tell somebody else about Jesus Christ! Do not think so much about
   yourself. That dog-hole of selfishness can never afford you any
   comfort. While the first and last concern of a man is simply his own
   feelings, or his own enjoyment, he cannot get any good feelings, or any
   enjoyment, either. Remember what the farmer does down in the country on
   a cold winter's day. There stand the boys, with chill blisters on their
   hands and they want to get near the fire. They cry out, "Oh, Father, it
   is so cold!" He says, "You go and do a bit of plowing, Johnny. You go
   and do a little hedging and ditching, William." And they come in with
   rosy cheeks and they say, "The weather is beautiful! It is quite
   bracing and we are all in a glow." And yet it may be that the
   thermometer has gone down while they have been out, but they have been
   warmed by their work!

   I wish I could turn some Christian people out of their pews and get
   them, at this time of night, out into the lodging-houses, or in some
   corner, preaching, or going to some sick persons in the hospital to
   read and pray with them. You may depend upon it, being taught of God is
   best done, all other things being equal, when, with a teachable mind
   towards God, we have a teaching mind towards others! When you will to
   bless your fellow man, you shall get a blessing. "The Lord turned the
   captivity of Job when he prayed"--for himself? No, I have purposely
   made a mistake there. It is not so, just look it up -"The Lord turned
   the captivity of Job when he prayed for his"--well, it says, "friends,"
   but, you know, they were a curious kind of friends! Job called them,
   "miserable comforters," and so they had been. But when he took to
   praying for them, then the Lord turned his captivity.

   Begin to pray for your disagreeable neighbors. Begin to pray for your
   unconverted friends and the Lord will turn your own captivity while you
   are doing that! By blessing others, you shall be blessed yourself. God
   grant that it may be so, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. PSALM77.

   This Psalm is headed, "To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun." He was one
   of the great singers. There is opportunity given in the Psalms for each
   of the singers to take his turn. It does not do for any of us to be
   idle in reference to the praise of God. It is called, "A Psalm of
   Asaph." His Psalms have usually a dark tinge about them. He was a
   meditative man, "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief," but also
   a man of strong faith and of an exulting spirit. You need to do
   business in great waters to understand Asaph--he is one who does not
   wade, but he gets into "waters to swim in." Thus he begins--

   Verse 1. I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
   and He gave ear unto me. The use of the voice in prayer is not
   essential, but usually, when men grow earnest, they use the voice as
   well as the mind. It was because of the intensity of his prayer that
   the Psalmist felt compelled to cry--not to use stilted, stately
   language--but the natural cry of pain. "I cried unto God with my
   voice." You will find it very helpful in private prayer to use the
   voice--many of us do. Some have not the opportunity of doing so, but if
   you can be unheard of men and can use your voice, you will find it
   helpful. Twice says the Psalmist, "I cried unto God with my voice."

   2. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. This is the best place
   to go in the day of your trouble.

   2. My sore ran in the night. A better rendering would be, "My hand was
   stretched out in the night." The Psalmist continued to pray.

   2. And ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. Rightly so, if the
   comfort came from man, if the comfort were doubtful and ineffectual.
   Wrongly so, when right comfort was presented to him, comfort from God.
   I am afraid that in the time of our trouble, we often increase it by
   being unwilling to be comforted.

   3. I remembered God, and was troubled. What? Trouble, even, from
   remembering God? Then this is trouble, indeed! And yet this has been
   the experience of the saints of God many a time. "I remembered
   God"--His holiness, His justice, my offenses against Him--and was
   troubled."

   3. I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Turned over,
   overwhelmed. Without comfort, or hope of comfort.

   3. Selah. Tighten the harp strings--they have gone flat through such
   hard striking. These deep notes have put the strings out of order. The
   man in his grief cannot sing well and he had need to say, "Selah."
   Sursum corda. Lift up the heart! Prepare yourself, again, for song.

   4. You hold my eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. Yet
   he was speaking! But it did not seem to him like speaking. It was
   rather an inarticulate wail than the language of a man.

   5. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. A
   little holy history is good reading for a heavy heart. You will often
   stumble on a record of God's Providential dealings, or a paragraph
   concerning His wonderful love, that will cheer your heart. Yet it did
   not cheer the heart of the Psalmist just then.

   6. I call to remembrance my song in the night. "How I used to sing like
   the nightingale, with the thorn at my breast. I call that to
   remembrance." But we cannot always sing old songs. Old experiences may
   have but little warmth in their ashes, though often in their ashes live
   their routine fires.

   6. I commune with my own heart. A very proper thing to do, but not much
   comfort generally comes of it. It is like stirring water that is
   already muddy--the more you stir it, the more muddy it becomes.

   6. And my spirit made diligent search. When a man can deal with himself
   like this, his trouble will not last long! God save me from a dumb
   sorrow, sorrow that cannot think and cannot judge, and cannot weigh
   itself! Now listen to the Psalmist's questions. Does doubt question
   your faith? Then let faith question your doubts. Here is a Catechism
   for a desponding heart. I commend it to you who are in trouble. Put
   your soul through its paces--ask these questions.

   7. Will the Lord cast off forever? Has He ever done so? He may seem to
   cast off for a little while, but, "Will the Lord cast off forever?"

   7. And will He be favorable no more? It is a long lane that has no
   turning. The Lord may take down the rod, but will He always use it?
   Will He always chide?

   8. Is His mercy clean gone forever? If His favor is gone, yet is His
   mercy gone? Does not the Psalm say, "His mercy endures forever"? If I
   cannot claim favor as a saint, may I not hope for mercy as a sinner?
   "Is His mercy clean gone forever?"

   8. Does His promise fail forevermore? Oh, what a question that is!
   God's promise may tarry, but it never fails, and if it seems to fail
   for the time being, will it fail forevermore?

   9. Has God forgotten to be gracious? What hot shots these are for
   unbelief! I guarantee you that however deep your unbelief may be,
   tonight, if, by earnest prayer, with the help of the Holy Spirit, you
   ply it with these questions, it will have to yield.

   9. Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah. Can it be so? Was
   it ever so to any of God's people? Now comes, "Selah," again. Tighten
   the harp strings once more. We shall have sweeter music from this time
   on!

   10. And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of
   the right hand of the Most High. "But I will remember," is added by the
   translator. Surely it was to the Psalmist an infirmity to be thus in
   trouble. He called it Benoni, son of sorrow, but it was not infirmity
   to God. He called it Benjamin, son of the right hand. There is a sort
   of parallel between Asaph and the woman who named her child Benoni.
   Certainly it is a great infirmity--it is a sin--to doubt God, and to be
   cast down and troubled.

   11. I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember Your
   wonders of old. Think of what God has done for His people. How He has
   delivered them, how He has lifted them from the dunghill and set them
   among the princes, even among the princes of His people! Think of His
   wonders of Grace and be no more discouraged.

   12. I will meditate also of all Your work, and talk of Your doings.
   Those who talk ought to meditate, otherwise they grind wind. Those who
   meditate will talk, otherwise the miller grinds only for himself.

   13. Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary. Or, "in holiness." God's way
   is always a holy way, a righteous way.

   13. Who is so great a God as our God? When we think of the greatness of
   God, if we simply dwell upon His power, we make a mistake. The
   greatness of God lies mainly in His moral attributes, in His
   completeness, His wholeness, His holiness.

   14, 15. You are the God that does wonders: You have declared Your
   strength among the people. You have with Your arm redeemed Your people,
   the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. "Selah," again. In looking back,
   the Psalmist has remembered the history of the whole nation. He thinks
   of what God did for His ancient people. Indeed, he is on the verge of a
   great song! Well may he tune the strings again. He has in thought gone
   back to the Red Sea. He is standing like Miriam, by the waters that
   devoured the foes of Israel, and he must sing as she did! In a high
   poetic strain he writes--

   16. The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You; they were afraid:
   the depths also were troubled. At the very sight of God the sea began
   to flee, to lay bare its depths. "The floods stood upright as an heap,"
   in their fear and dread of the Presence of God, "and the depths were
   congealed in the heart of the sea."

   17. The clouds poured out water. The floods above answered the floods
   below and came to the help of the Lord, "to the help of the Lord
   against the mighty."

   17, 18. The skies sent out a sound: Your arrows also went abroad. The
   voice of Your thunder was in the Heavens: the lightning lightened the
   world: the earth trembled and shook. There was a great storm. Thunder
   and lightning gathered about the sea. When God spoke, the waters rolled
   back and swallowed up all the warriors of Egypt. Heaven and earth
   joined in battle against God's foes--not only did the sea flee, but
   there appears to have also been an earthquake.

   19. Your way is in the sea, and Your path in the great waters, and Your
   footsteps are not known. Not foreknown. Who could have foretold that
   God would lead His people through the sea? His footsteps are not now to
   be found. God's ways we cannot guess and even when we have seen them,
   we cannot understand them. Child of God, does the sea roll before you
   tonight? Are you in extreme distress? Are you crying as the Psalmist
   did? With your voice do you cry unto God? Then expect deliverance from
   Him!

   20. You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
   Moses and Aaron did not lead them--God led His people, "like a flock,
   by the hand of Moses and Aaron." Here the Psalm breaks off with great
   abruptness. Had it been a human composition, it would have been rounded
   off with great discretion, but God knows best where to stop. I
   sometimes wish Brothers and Sisters would do the same in their
   prayers--they need not keep on till they have worn us out-- they may
   break off short if they like. So may we in our sermons! Perhaps they
   would be better remembered if the second half was never spoken.

The Lord's Chosen Ministers

   (No. 2319)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, JULY 30, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE
   23, 1889.

   "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, Ithank You, O Father,
   Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise
   and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so
   it seemed good in Your sight." Luke 10:21.

   THE habitual state of mind of Jesus was, I think, a deep calm. Beyond
   all ordinary men, He possessed His soul in peace. We find Him sleeping
   in the midst of a storm, the very best thing that He could do. He knew
   that, rocked in the cradle of the deep by His great Father, He was
   supremely safe, so, finding a pillow, and going near the stern of the
   ship, He fell asleep.

   But there were times when His spirit ebbed out. He was always a Man of
   Sorrows--the surface of His soul was often disturbed with storms of
   grief--and then we read that "Jesus wept." Sometimes, however, the tide
   was at the flood, and so we here, read, "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in
   spirit." It is very seldom that we read this. So seldom did He show His
   joy that it was recorded at once by the Evangelist. Luke took care to
   note that, even as others had mentioned His tears. Jesus was a man of
   constant grief, a mourner all his days, and yet at times the deep calm
   of His spirit was stirred by something other than the north wind. The
   south wind blew and all was joyous and bright with Him--"In that hour
   Jesus rejoiced in spirit." I thought that this would be a profitable
   theme for meditation for a short time, tonight, in contrast to that of
   this morning. [Sermon #2091, Volume 35--Jesus Wept.] I do not intend to
   go so deeply into this subject as I did into that, but I think that
   there are some matters here which may be instructive to us.

   I. First, let us ask, WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF OUR MASTER'S JOY? "In
   that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit." You may judge a man by his joy--as
   a man rejoices--so is he. What made Christ rejoice? If I were to put
   the question to all of you who are happy, tonight, "What makes you
   rejoice?" some might, perhaps, be ashamed to answer my enquiry, but
   there was no reason why Jesus should blush at that which made Him glad.

   First, I notice that He rejoiced in stirring times. He had sent out the
   70 disciples. They had gone, in 35 pairs, all over the country, telling
   that He was coming and He was reckoning upon going to every city and
   place to which He had sent His heralds. Seeing what was done and what
   was going to be done, the Savior's heart rejoiced. Some people like
   laziness--Christ loved activity. This morning I showed you that there
   was no indolence in Him, for He wept, and that old word, indolence,
   means not grieving, does it not? But He did grieve, so there was no
   indolence in Him in the old and literal classic sense and, certainly,
   no indolence in Him in the sense in which we now use the word. He could
   weep and, therefore, He could work. He could feel and, therefore, He
   could bestir Himself. And in stirring times He felt Himself glad. How
   some of us long to see the Church of God fully astir! We seem to have a
   dreadful calm, nowadays, like that of the "Ancient Mariner" when--

   "The very deep did rot.

   Alas, that ever this should be!"

   We need the wind from Heaven to stir our sails and set the ship in
   motion. We need the breath of the Holy Spirit to speed us to our
   desired haven. It was not thus with Christ, for He rejoiced in times of
   activity!

   He rejoiced, next, when He was surrounded by faithful preachers. There
   were 70 of His disciples--quite a little Conference! He felt Himself in
   good company with the seventy--all faithful preachers of the
   Word--gathered around Him. You say that it was not many. No, but it was
   a good beginning! It was a noble beginning that, out of a few disciples
   (and He had not many, at most), He should be able to pick out 70 who
   were fit to be sent out to preach! They must have been a fine class of
   men, though they were simple-minded fishermen and peasants. And to find
   70 of them who could be sent to preach and declare that the Kingdom of
   Heaven was at hand, who were fit to be trusted with miraculous power,
   might well make Him glad! Brothers, when we see plenty of preachers of
   the Gospel, when we see the Lord calling one and another to go forth
   and proclaim His Word of Grace, then do we, also, rejoice in spirit!

   Jesus also rejoiced because all these 70 had found a welcome. It seemed
   rather an experiment to send out 70 unlettered men to proclaim the
   Kingdom of God. It was like sending lambs into the midst of wolves!
   Would not some of them be stoned to death? When the muster-roll was
   read, would not one or two, at least, be missing? But no, "the seventy
   returned again with joy." They had all been welcomed! Everybody seems
   to have received them and entertained them--and they came back in high
   spirits! And the Savior, seeing them return thus, not as preachers
   without congregations, but itinerant ministers who had been listened
   to, everywhere, with respectful attention, our Master felt, I say, that
   He, also, must rejoice, so, "Jesus rejoiced in spirit."

   It is of no use having ministers if they have nobody to preach to and
   it is very likely that, before long, we shall have more ministers than
   hearers if things go on as they now go! We have so many of our brothers
   with marvelous gifts of dispersion that we have seen magnificent
   congregations that used to gather around earnest Evangelical preachers,
   scattered to the winds! There is nothing in that to rejoice over,
   except for Satan to rejoice! But when you see a people made willing, in
   the day of God's Power, to listen to the heralds of the Cross, then you
   may, indeed, rejoice!

   Jesus rejoiced, further, because He heard that the Power of God had
   rested on them all. The 70 had healed the sick and, to their own
   astonishment, they had cast out devils--and they mentioned it with
   great exultation! "And He said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning
   fall from Heaven." Oh, Brothers and Sisters, we need not rejoice
   because there are many professed preachers! And it might not be a sure
   ground of rejoicing if they all had congregations. But it is a safe
   reason for joy when the Power of God rests upon them! Only give a man
   that old Power of God with him and I am not afraid but what he will
   have a congregation, and I am certain that grand results will come of
   his work! If God is with us, His Word which we preach cannot fail! It
   will not only reach the ear, but it will pierce the heart! It will
   awaken the spiritually dead! It will turn hearts of stone to flesh!
   There is still a Divine Power going with the preaching of the Word of
   God. The Gospel is still the Power of God unto salvation to everyone
   that believes! And when we see that that is the case, and that men and
   women are being converted, then I am sure that, like our Master, we
   shall do well to rejoice in spirit!

   Further than this, our Savior rejoiced in spirit because He saw that
   Satan's kingdom was being shaken. To fetch Satan down from his throne,
   is no small thing--how is it to be done? Well, the philosophers may try
   their magnetism, but the devil is to strong for them. The orators and
   rhetoricians may try their rounded periods and decorate their orations
   with quotations from the poets, but the devil never stirs for them. But
   preach Jesus Christ--say that His Kingdom is at hand, proclaim that He
   is come to save the lost and that whoever believes in Him shall live
   eternally--in a word, preach up Christ, and you soon preach down the
   devil! He does not come down by slow degrees. He falls, like lightning,
   from Heaven! You have seen lightning--you may have seen it in that
   great storm a fortnight ago--it took no time at all to come down from
   Heaven! Just a flash and it was here! So, where the Gospel is preached
   with Divine Power, Satan comes down from his throne in human hearts and
   human minds as rapidly as the lightning flash falls from Heaven! And
   when we see his kingdom shaken, then, like Jesus, we rejoice in spirit.

   Still, I do not think that I have hit the center of the target yet. The
   Lord Jesus deeply rejoiced in spirit because of the men by whom this
   work had been done. What sort of men were they? Upon this I shall have
   to dwell a little further on. But there was this about them--they were
   glad to have been put into the King's commission. "The seventy returned
   again with joy." They had never been so happy before--this doing of the
   Lord's will had been a great delight to them! You could see it by the
   very spring of their feet and the flash of their eyes. They came back
   to their Master, delighted, and Jesus caught the contagion of their joy
   and He rejoiced in spirit! People who serve Christ, willingly, who feel
   a delight in doing His will, are sure to bring delight to Christ's
   heart. Are you, dear Friends, in your holy work, doing it with joy, or
   do you serve the Lord because you cannot help it, like slaves driven to
   their toil by the overseer's lash? Jesus cannot rejoice over you if
   that is the case. But if you can say, "I delight to do Your will," then
   you will make His heart rejoice!

   He rejoiced in these men because, when they came back, having done
   wonders, they ascribed it all to Him. They said, "Lord, even the devils
   are subject unto us through Your name." They did not begin to pilfer
   the Glory and take the

   honor to themselves. Christ is glad to have a people who lay all the
   honor where it ought to be laid, and put the crown on the right head. I
   believe that there is nothing that angers Christ more, in His
   ministers, than to hear them talk about what they have done, without
   duly ascribing all the Glory to Himself. When they do ascribe it to
   Him, then Jesus rejoices in spirit.

   But He rejoiced most of all that, of all these seventy, He could say
   that their names were written in Heaven. It is an easy thing to become
   a preacher, or a teacher, an evangelist, or what not--but are our names
   written in Heaven? As Christ would have us rejoice most over that, no
   doubt He rejoices most over it when He sees that we not only have our
   names written down in the Clergy List, or our denominational Handbook,
   but that our names are really written among the living in Zion--those
   who are quickened by His Grace, washed in His blood and truly made to
   live by His Spirit! "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit." I have
   shown you the occasion of His joy. When you have similar occasions,
   dear Brothers, dear Sisters, mind that you rejoice in spirit, too!

   II. But now, secondly, WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF CHRIST'S JOY? Jesus
   rejoiced in spirit."

   The answer to this question is, first, that it was spiritual joy. There
   is a good deal of joy in the world, even among religious people, that
   could not be called spiritual. I am not certain whether all the
   expressions of joy one hears at some excited meetings are worthy to be
   put on the same heap with this joy of Christ. There is mental joy.
   There is a sort of physical joy, when one gets excited and stirred
   up--this is but bronze or silver--but spiritual joy is the gold of joy
   and the gold of that land is good! If, down deep in his inner life,
   one's spirit can rejoice in God, he is the man who is like his Master
   when He rejoiced in spirit!

   You who have the Revised Version, which often teaches us much, will, I
   dare say, be surprised to read in the margin the following rendering,
   "In that same hour He rejoiced by the Holy Spirit." That is a very
   remarkable rendering, and I think a correct one. That is the kind of
   joy that Jesus had, joy worked in Him by the Holy Spirit. The Holy
   Spirit was poured upon Him without measure and, as part of the fruit of
   the Spirit is joy, the Spirit gave Him much joy, as well as much love.
   Beloved, pray God to give you joy by the Holy Spirit! All the other joy
   in the world, if heaped up together, would be only so much smoke and
   vapor! But joy in the Holy Spirit is solid bliss and lasting pleasure.
   Here you have the great ingots of joy. How ponderous they are, how
   precious they are, how immeasurably valuable, how infinitely
   beneficial! Joy by the Holy Spirit--often very calm and quiet, for, "He
   leads me beside the still waters"--but a very wonderful joy. The joy of
   God, like the peace of God, which passes understanding--this is a joy
   which passes all measure or bound. That was the joy of
   Christ--spiritual joy and joy by the Holy Spirit.

   Notice, also, that it was joy about others, a perfectly unselfish joy.
   Jesus had seen others blessed, healed, prepared, instructed, made ready
   to hear more of the Gospel--and He rejoiced in that. And He had seen
   others made useful. Oh, what a mercy it is when you can rejoice in
   other people's usefulness! Did God ever bless you very largely and did
   there come along somebody whom He blessed more than you? Now, I am sure
   that you rejoiced in that other man's success if he was a hundred miles
   off! But I am not quite so certain that you rejoiced in it if he came
   into your Sunday school and had a class that took some of the scholars
   away from you. I am not quite certain that every minister in the world
   would leap for joy if a Brother settled close beside him and had twice
   as large a congregation as he had, and did 10 times as much good.
   Hearts need a little schooling at such a time as that, for, as the
   stars love to shine, they sometimes like not only to shine out but to
   outshine!

   Now shine out as much as you like, but never mind about outshining, for
   that is emulation of a kind of which Christ will never approve. He
   rejoiced to see the 70 shining. He delighted to see them all useful.
   Pray for your Brothers and Sisters, that God may make them more useful
   than they are and more useful than you are. Did not your Lord say, "He
   that believes on Me, the works that I do shall he do, also, and greater
   works than these shall he do, because I go unto My Father," as if it
   were a delight to the Master that His pupils should, in some respects,
   excel Him? Remember Moses, when they came to him, and said that Eldad
   and Medad were prophesying in the camp? Those two fellows had not been
   properly ordained, yet they were prophesying in the camp! What did
   Moses say? "Stop them directly. They have not, 'Rev.' before either of
   their names and certainly they have not D.D., or any of the other
   letters of the alphabet after their names! Shut those fellows up"? No,
   no! Moses said, "Would God that all the Lord's people were Prophets,
   and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!" And is not that what
   Christ would say and have you say? Oh, let us have joy in our

   hearts when souls are saved, even though we may not be the instruments
   of their salvation, or any of our denomination, but somebody quite
   apart from us! God has blessed him and God be blessed for blessing him!

   Our Savior's joy, again, was quiet and devout joy. "Jesus rejoiced in
   spirit." I do not find that He sang a Psalm, or even a hymn from Moody
   and Sankey, or that He took a timbrel and danced. I think it would have
   been very much out of place for Him to have done that--for Him it would
   have looked very eccentric. But our Savior, when He rejoiced in spirit,
   prayed and thanked God. The same calm which had sustained Him in His
   seasons of sorrow, supported Him in His hour of joy and kept Him sober,
   still, quiet! The Lord give us much of this joy! Still waters, you
   know, run deep. Let me also say that deep waters run without turmoil.
   When the river is very deep, there will not be half as much noise as
   when it is but shallow and, therefore, rattles and raves over the
   stones which it barely covers!

   Christ's was quiet and devout joy and it was also meek and lowly joy.
   Though He rejoiced in spirit, what He said was, "I thank You, O
   Father." There was no assumption, no taking of anything to Himself. Did
   not He send out the seventy? Were they not called by Him? Yes, but He
   said, "I thank Fou, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth." Perhaps God
   would give us more joy if we were more meek when we had it, but,
   sometimes, when our heavenly Father trusts us with a few jewels, we
   hang them in our ears and are as pleased with them as children with new
   toys--and we forget our Father and only remember how pretty we look--as
   we think. Then the Lord takes them away again. Many a child would have
   more sweets to eat if they did not make him sick. Many a preacher of
   the Gospel would have more success if it did not make him proud--and
   many a laborer for the Lord would bring more souls to Christ if there
   were not danger of his losing his own soul if he were much honored in
   that way. Our Master, when He rejoiced in spirit, was as meek and as
   lowly as when He stood before His adversaries and was led as a sheep to
   the slaughter.

   III. But I must not detain you much longer and, therefore, I come to
   the last point which is the special one upon which I want to dwell at
   this time. WHAT WAS THE EXPRESSION OF OUR SAVIOR'S JOY? When Jesus
   rejoiced in spirit, how did He show His joy?

   Well, He showed it, first, by thanks to His Father. He said, "I thank
   You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth." Oh, that our joy might never
   take the form of a foolish song, but might always be in the shape of
   thanksgiving or thanks-living, or both of them together--a happy
   combination-- thanksgiving with the mouth and thanks-living with the
   life! Our Savior, I say, praised God when He felt joyful. Do you not
   think that that should be a lesson to us to try to be joyful before we
   praise God? Do you feel very dull and heavy? Well, sing! Remember that
   the Apostle James said, "Is any merry? Let him sing Psalms." Psalms are
   best sung when the heart is glad, therefore seek to shake off your
   sadness when you come into the House of God! And before you begin to
   praise the Lord, endeavor to be joyful, cheerful, happy. Did I not say,
   the other day--"Do not leave your bedroom until you feel that
   everything is right between you and God"? I would also add to--"Do not
   begin to sing until your heart sings." Try as much as possible to be
   glad. Does God want slaves to Grace His Throne? It is the heathen who
   cut themselves with knives and think that their god is pleased with
   their misery! But our God delights in the joy of His people. Be glad
   before Him. "Let us come before His Presence with thanksgiving, and
   make a joyful noise unto Him with Psalms." Sing unto the Lord all you
   people and rejoice before Him. The singing of God's praises should be
   accompanied with joy--and when there is joy it should be attended with
   the singing of His praises.

   But why does Jesus Christ thank God? What is His special objective in
   thanking Him? Well, He thanks Him for a great Truth of God that some of
   you do not like. I cannot hide it, whether you like it or not. Jesus
   thanks His Father for the Doctrine of Election--"I thank You, O Father,
   Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise
   and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so
   it seemed good in Your sight." With whom does the choice of men lie?
   With God! And in His choice His Son greatly rejoices! So let it be with
   us--let Him do what He wills, and let us rejoice in Him! "Though He
   slay me, yet will I trust in Him." Let Him do whatever He wills, I know
   that it is right. It is not for us to judge God's conduct, but to let
   God's conduct be to us the rule of our life, the rule of right--

   "He sits on no precarious throne, Nor borrows leave to be,"

   nor does He stand at your bar, or mine, to ask us what He shall do, or
   what He shall not do. "He gives not account of any of His matters." And
   over the head of us all there rolls the thunder of this Word of God--"I
   will have mercy on whom I

   will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
   compassion." No claim can be set up by the creature! None have any
   merit whatever before Him and, therefore, with that absolute
   Sovereignty which He claims as God, He distributes His favors according
   to this rule, "Shall I not do as I will with My own?" But many hearts
   cannot bow to that Law of God--the iron sinew of their neck will not
   bend to a God who is God! A nominal god is all very well, but a real
   God of Infinite Power and Divine Sovereignty is rejected by many, but
   not by His dear Son! He says, "I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven
   and earth." We who truly know the Lord, adore the God of electing love!
   He cannot do wrong. He must be right. And if He chooses to let the wise
   and prudent be blinded, while He opens the eyes of babes, we thank Him.
   What we do not understand, we accept with reverent adoration.

   The Savior especially thanks His Father for the chosen ministers round
   about Him. Somebody might have said, "Why, these 70, You are their
   Leader, but they are a precious poor lot! Look at them! Put the whole
   70 together and they would not make one man of the size of a Pharisee,
   either in property, or in propriety, or in power to boast and say that
   they have kept the Commandments from their youth up! Why, they are a
   parcel of sinners, the whole 70 of them! And besides that, look at
   their coats--nothing but working-men's jackets. There is one of them,
   Peter, who has an extra coat, but he is only a fisherman. What a lot
   they are! And these are the men who are to proclaim the religion that
   is to conquer the world? It is certainly not abreast of the times--it
   is not up to the modern thought of this period--very far from it! All
   that it has gathered is a parcel of poor, illiterate persons."

   Well, the Savior thanks God that He has not given Him any wise men. He
   thanks God that He has not saved any of the people who think that they
   have great understanding. He congratulates Himself that, upon the
   whole, He has the people He likes best--"I thank You, that You have hid
   these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them
   unto"--what? Well, He says, "babes." They cannot say anything worse
   than that of the Lord's chosen ministers--just a lot of babies! Jesus
   thanks God that He has revealed the Truth to these babes and so do I!
   Oh, Beloved, what a mercy it is that the Lord does, by His Grace, call
   these babes, while the wise men, and the understanding men are not
   called!

   Suppose the very wise and prudent had been called to go and preach?
   What would they have done? Why, in the first place, they would not have
   gone at all because any prudent man would have said, "He sends us forth
   as lambs in the midst of wolves! That is not prudent, so I shall not
   go." Certainly no wise men would have gone upon such an errand--they
   would have said, "No, thank you." And so you still find the wise and
   prudent. They will not go on Christ's errands. They have errands of
   their own--they have plenty of their own work to do--they are going to
   reform the world by their own inventions! But to go on Christ's errands
   and simply to say what Christ tells them, oh, no, not they! They have
   such a lot to say of what they have made out of their own heads that
   they cannot go out to simply repeat what Christ has said to them.

   Suppose, again, that the 70 had been wise and prudent men? What next
   would they have done? Why, they would have tinkered the message, for
   certain! There is one of them who would have said, "Well, now, I am
   going, you see, to a town of very respectable people--I must tone my
   message down for them." Another would have said, "I am going where they
   are rather a democratic set--I must introduce a little bit of politics
   of a popular kind to suit them." Another would have said, "Well, now,
   these people will not come and hear me preach the Gospel, so I shall
   have an entertainment, a penny reading, or something of that kind." All
   the wise and prudent would have thought that they could do better than
   Christ told them to do--therefore He was very glad that He had not any
   of them to pester Him! He had only these who would do just what He told
   them and say just what He told them--and that was exactly the kind of
   people that He needed--men who would do His bidding without question.

   Then, besides that, if they had been very wise and prudent, they would
   have inevitably clouded the message, for they would have delivered it
   in their own grand style--and you know how wise men talk, do you not?
   Unless you are a very wise man, you cannot understand them. But these
   poor babes, when they went into a town, talked as the people talked,
   and everybody could comprehend them! Nowadays, it is thought to be an
   evidence of lack of education if you talk so that everybody can
   understand you, but, dear Friends, we are not afraid of what anyone
   says on that point. Depend upon it, the best education in the world is
   that which enables you to convey your thoughts to other people's minds
   in a way in which you really get them into their brains! These babes
   went and preached what Christ told them because they did not know
   anything else. They were men of plain speech-they were Galileans! They
   had never learned the scholastic style of speech--Galilee was a notable
   place for spoiling the language! These were rough-hewn men and they
   spoke out their

   message with all their might--and Christ was very thankful that they
   were not other than they were, for they did His work right grandly.

   Besides, I think that if they had been wise and prudent, they would not
   have come back rejoicing--they would have come back with that cold
   propriety which is most consistent with the dignity of cultured
   intelligence! Are you not all aware that it is vulgar to be happy, that
   it betrays the feebleness of your minds if you enjoy anything? The
   proper thing is to pick the Truth of God to pieces and find all the
   fault that you can with it. When the Bread of Heaven is set before you,
   if you are a cultured person, you should not eat it, but try to find
   out who baked it and whether they put as much yeast in it as usual.
   Such people always quarrel with the Truth if they can. Sometimes I take
   up a commentary on some part of the Bible and think that I am going to
   learn something. And so I do. And when I have learned it, I wish that I
   had never seen it! A vain attempt is made to take the juice out of
   God's wheat and to reduce it to dry, useless husks which cannot cheer
   the heart, or comfort the spirit. I thank You, Lord, when I get away
   from these gentlemen, even as You did thank Your Father that there were
   none of them around You. They would have been almost enough to chill
   the very life of Christ, Himself.

   Once more, if they had all been wise and prudent, they would have come
   back, every one of them taking a little of the praise. One wise man
   would have said, "I put that point beautifully down at Chorazin."
   Another would have said, "I drew a wonderful distinction down at
   Bethsaida." "If any good comes of this," another would say, "it was
   that wonderful peroration of my discourse that did it. I must have the
   credit of it." These poor babes could not think or talk like this, for,
   if God did anything by them, they were such nobodies that He must have
   all the Glory!

   Now I have done when I just say to you that I wonder whether this
   brings comfort to you? One poor soul says, "I am not clever. I cannot
   be saved." Why not? Why not, when God has chosen the foolish things of
   this world? I often hear a person say, "But I have not head enough for
   these things." You do not need a head so much as you need a heart, for
   the Grace of God works on the heart, first, and on the head,
   afterwards. When the head drags the heart, it is often slow work, but
   when the heart goes first and the head follows, then it is a blessing,
   indeed! If you love Christ and trust in Him, you have all the head that
   you need for Eternal Life. "O," says one, "but I am a person of such
   small capacity!" Never mind. "Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners" whether they are of large capacity or small capacity.

   Have you a teachable spirit? Are you willing to believe what the Holy
   Spirit reveals? Are you willing to sit at Jesus' feet and learn of Him?
   Are you like the babe that does not doubt its mother, but takes,
   unquestioningly, the nourishment she gives? If that is so, you are of
   the kind that God has chosen! Come at once to Him. You cannot
   understand all mysteries if you need to do so. Give up all your vain
   attempts to sweep the cobwebs from the sky, or to climb up among the
   stars. Oh, the questions that people can ask you when they really do
   not want answers, and if they did, would never receive them! I know
   some who are lost in their thoughts--

   "Of Providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate, Fixed fate, free will,
   foreknowledge absolute" or some other tremendously knotty question. Why
   do you got out of your depths? Be a babe and come--simply believe
   yourself to be a sinner and trust Christ as your Savior--and you will
   know more than all the philosophers can ever teach you! Come and trust
   the Lord Jesus Christ and you will find how true it is that He has
   revealed these things unto babes.

   Are you willing to be what Christ was? He was the childlike Man. He is
   called, "The Holy Child, Jesus." Will you be a child to Him and let Him
   be a Man for you? Will you take His Book and believe it as you read it?
   Will you take Him and trust Him as you find Him? Will you take His
   Cross and rest upon it as your only hope? Then, blessed are you, for
   you are in the election of Grace! You are one of those whom God has
   chosen and for whom Christ thanks Him that He did choose people of that
   quality! And while Christ thanks God, you may thank Him, too, and go
   home tonight rejoicing! If you are too wise, too clever, too critical
   to trust Christ, there is no other way to Heaven--so you see where you
   must go. The Lord change your foolish opinion and teach your reason,
   reason--and your sense a little commonsense, and save you, for His
   mercy's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. LUKE101-22.

   Our Lord was about to send out 70 disciples to preach the Gospel. He
   had already chosen His 12 Apostles. Now there must be 70 disciples,
   something like Moses had 70 elders to serve under him. Some have
   fancifully likened these two sets of men to the 12 wells of water and
   70 palm trees at Elim, and certainly they were for the refreshment of
   the people.

   Verse 1. After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and
   sent them two and two before His face into every city and place, where
   He Himself would come. They were to go before Christ and be His
   heralds. What a mercy it is when the preacher knows that his Master is
   coming after him--when he can hear the sound of his Master's feet
   behind him! What courage it gives him! He knows that, though it is very
   little that he can do, he is the thin end of the wedge preparing the
   way for One who can do everything!

   2. Therefore said He unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the
   laborers are few: pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He
   would send forth laborers into His harvest. The 70 were very few
   compared with the many that were needed. There were many loiterers
   about, then, as there are now, but the laborers were few. There were
   preachers of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, but they were not worth a
   penny a hundred. But the true laborers, who watched for souls, and
   preached Christ with all their hearts, were very few. It is the same,
   today, and, therefore, we are to pray for more laborers. A good
   minister always desires to see more good ministers. In a trade, every
   tradesman would be glad if those of the same trade as himself would
   move to another parish, but in the profession of a Christian minister,
   the more the merrier! "Pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that
   He would send forth laborers into His harvest."

   3. Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
   "Defenseless, harmless, into the midst of those who would devour you if
   I did not send you. It would be foolhardiness to go on your own
   account, but I send you and He who sends His lambs among wolves will
   take care of them." As I have often reminded you, the lambs and the
   sheep are very defenseless and yet, after all, there are more sheep in
   the world than there are wolves. And although it looked as if the
   wolves would soon devour the sheep, the wolves are extirpated in many a
   country and the sheep are still prized--and it will be so till the end.

   4. Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes. This time, when Christ
   sent out the seventy, He bade them take no provision, for they might
   depend upon the kindness of the people. Afterwards, when He was about
   to leave His disciples, He bade them take both purse and scrip, for
   they were going among an unfriendly people. But on this first mission
   He knew that there was a kindly feeling towards them, so He said,
   "Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes."

   4. And salute no man by the way. Eastern salutations by the way took up
   a very long time--the people saying a lot of fine nothings to one
   another. Christian ministers ought to be excused from many of the
   lengthy courtesies of life, but if they are not excused, if they are
   faithful, they will take French leave to be excused. We have not time
   for all those pretty things that some people attend to. If we are to
   win souls, we must go to work like the king's couriers who turn not
   aside to attend to anything else, but devote all their energies to the
   mission on which they are sent.

   5, 6. And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this
   house. And if a son ofpeace is there, your peace shall rest upon it: if
   not, it shall turn to you again. So that it will not be wasted. Wish
   well and your well-wishing will do you good, even if it does nobody
   else good. Our chickens come home to roost. If they are curses, they
   will come upon ourselves. If they are blessings, they will bless
   ourselves as well as others.

   7, 8. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as
   they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to
   house. And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you eat such
   things as are set before you. The Jewish Rabbis, in their
   perambulations, were very particular about food. It is said to have
   been very difficult to find a dish to their taste. This might be
   unclean in one way, and that not up to the mark in another--but here
   the Master exempts His ambassadors from attention to these minor
   matters. They had something better to do than to be always careful
   about what they should eat or what they should drink, so He said to
   them, "Eat such things as are set before you."

   9-11. And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
   Kingdom of God is come near unto you. But into whatever city you enter,
   and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the
   same, and say, Even the very dust of your

   city, which cleaves on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding
   be you sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is come near unto you. We
   are not to stop and argue--that is no business of ours. We have to tell
   our message. If men will receive it, we are glad. If they will not hear
   it, with a heavy heart we turn aside and go elsewhere. Our work is to
   proclaim the glorious message of mercy through a dying Savior,
   salvation through the great Atonement. It is our business to proclaim
   it and leave it--the responsibility of receiving or rejecting it rests
   with our hearers.

   12-14. But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day
   for Sodom, than for that city. Woe unto you, Chorazin! Woe unto you,
   Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
   which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented,
   sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre
   and Sidon at the Judgment, than for you. Hearing and rejecting the
   Gospel is the crowning sin of all. Whatever else men are guilty of, if
   they have not rejected Christ, they have not yet reached the summit of
   iniquity.

   15, 16. And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to Heaven, shall be
   thrust down to Hell. He that hears you hears Me and he that despises
   you despises Me; and he that despises Me despises Him that sent Me. If
   the messenger delivers His message correctly, and as his Master would
   have him deliver it, the rejection of it, when brought by him, has the
   same guilt in it as the rejection of Christ, Himself, and the rejection
   of Christ is the rejection of God! So Jesus tells us here.

   17. And the seventy returned again with joy, Not one of the lambs had
   been eaten by the wolves!

   17. Saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through Your
   name. Christ had not mentioned that in the commission. He sent them to
   heal the sick. The casting out of devils was included, no doubt, but it
   was not specifically mentioned, and this being an extra beyond the
   words of their commission, they were especially delighted with it!
   "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through Your name."

   18-20. And He said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
   Heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
   scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by
   any means hurt you. Notwithstanding in this, rejoice not that the
   spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are
   written in Heaven. That is a higher privilege than to be master over
   demons, or to be able to tread on serpents! That day of miracles is
   past, but the power of the Gospel is a spiritual power the same as
   before. We still cast out devils. Still are men delivered from the
   dominion of Satan.

   21, 22. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank You, O
   Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hid these thingsfrom
   the wise andprudent, and have revealed them unto babes: even so,
   Father; for so it seemed good in Your sight. All things are delivered
   to Me of My Father: and no man knows who the Son is, but the Father.
   You know that He is the Son of God. You know that He is Jesus of
   Nazareth. But you do not know Him, you cannot know Him, as His Father
   knows Him! He is known in His fullness only to the Father.

   22. And who the Father is, but the Son, and He to whom the Son will
   reveal Him. "Can you, by searching, find out God? Can you find out the
   Almighty unto perfection?" No, you cannot. The Son of God must reveal
   His Father to you, or you will never know Him!

The Beloved Pastor's Plea for Unity

   (No. 2320)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 6, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   7, 1889.

   "To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to
   you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." Romans
   1:7.

   IN a few minutes we shall gather together as members of the Church of
   Christ to celebrate the memorial of His death. It is a memorable sight
   to see so many Christian people sitting together with the objective of
   observing this ordinance. Frequently, as I have seen it, I must confess
   that when sitting in the chair at the head of the table, I often feel
   overawed with the remembrance that it is the largest gathering of
   Christians anywhere beneath the sun, and that they have come there with
   one common objective, namely, to show our Lord's death "till He comes."
   The question then rises in our minds whether there is real fellowship
   in all this, for if there is not, it is a great sham, and the more
   numerous we are, if we have not fellowship with Christ and with one
   another, the greater is the deception--it is only having a name to live
   while we are dead. So I want, tonight, not so much to preach to you as
   to exhort you, who are about to gather to this holy festival, to think
   that your thoughts shall go out toward all your Christian Brothers and
   Sisters, and that you shall feel the power of that precious blood which
   makes us nearer akin than even the blood of Adam--that blood of Jesus
   which makes us truly Brothers and Sisters, yes, members of one body,
   and so united by living communion, the one to the other.

   In this first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, you see the spirit
   of communion in the Apostle Paul. He was, he says, anxious to do good
   to others. He longed to see the Roman Christians in order that he might
   impart to them some spiritual gift. While he is writing to them you can
   see that he is anxious that they may have the best things that they can
   have. All his desire is for their good--he is lovingly interested in
   their welfare. That is how we ought to be, the one to the other, not
   only the pastor to the people, but the people to the pastor, and the
   members of the Church to each other, all anxious for the good of the
   rest--no man living unto himself, but each one endeavoring to live for
   the benefit of the entire community in Christ Jesus.

   Not only did the Apostle's heart go out to the church in Rome, but to
   all the Gentiles. He felt himself, he says, a debtor to everybody, to
   the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, to,
   the bond and to the free. Do you not think that our loving sympathies
   should go out towards all mankind? Oh, let them do so! While you have
   the nearest and closest fellowship with the saints, yet desire to
   recognize your kinship with the rest of men, praying to God that He
   would enlighten them and bring them, also, within the bonds of the
   Covenant, that your fellowship with them might be loving, and true, and
   deep.

   However, the Apostle especially expresses his fellowship with the
   saints in Rome and, to prove that fellowship, he calls them by
   endearing names, by the highest titles which they could have, "beloved
   of God, called to be saints." And then he salutes them with good wishes
   of the very sweetest, most tender kind, when he says, "Grace to you and
   peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." While I am
   trying to talk on this text, will our dear Brothers and Sisters' hearts
   be going out, the one towards the other, with a view to the increase of
   real spiritual communion in this Church, and also in every branch of
   the one Church of Christ throughout the world?

   First, notice, concerning these people, their favored
   condition--"beloved of God." Secondly, their sure proof of that favor--
   "called to be saints." And, thirdly, their blessedness through that
   favor. Paul wished them to have what he was

   allowed to wish for them, for it was truly theirs--"Grace to you and
   peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus

   Christ."

   I. First, then, notice concerning these people, THEIR FAVORED
   CONDITION. They are said to be "beloved of

   God."

   I wish that I could hope that this was true of everybody here in the
   fullest and most emphatic sense, that we were all "beloved of God."
   There is a sense in which it is true, for God has a love of
   benevolence, kindness and well-wishing towards all His creatures. He is
   kind to the unthankful and the evil, and makes His rain to fall upon
   the field of the miser as well as on the ground of the gracious. He is
   "not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
   repentance." God is willing that all should come to Him, repent of sin,
   believe in Jesus Christ and find eternal life! We are all, in some
   respects, partakers of the love of God.

   But, dear Friends, there is a love to Peter which is greater than the
   love which Christ had to Judas. There is a love which He has to His own
   which is of peculiar character and differs very greatly from that
   common love which He bestows upon all the works of His hands, for there
   is a love of choice and it is in this sense that Paul calls these Roman
   saints "beloved of God." God had chosen them--His prescient eyes had
   foreseen them and their condition--and He had selected them out of the
   mass of the Roman population that they might be His own. Whatever may
   be said about the Doctrine of Election, it is written in the Word of
   God as with an iron pen and there is no getting rid of it! There it
   stands. To me, it is one of the sweetest and most blessed Truths in the
   whole of Revelation--and those who are afraid of it are so because they
   do not understand it. If they could but know that the Lord had chosen
   them, it would make their hearts dance for joy! The Lord has a people
   in this world whom He has, Himself, chosen and given to His Son, Jesus
   Christ, and whom the Lord Jesus Christ has redeemed from among men, for
   Christ, "loved the Church and gave Himself for it." These are the
   people of whom Paul speaks as beloved of God, those who have been, by
   Divine Grace, chosen out of the great mass of mankind!

   Beware, I pray you, of that desperately evil thing which is everywhere
   now--"the Christian world." There is no mixture that can be so bad as
   that! If it is the world, it is the world--if it is Christian, it is
   not the world--and the two things cannot be bound together! There is a
   divorce proclaimed between the two. Our Lord Jesus proclaimed it when
   He said, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
   And He was never of the world! Nobody ever thought that He was of the
   world and so His followers, if they are true to Him, are not of the
   world. They are of another race. As the Apostle John says, "You know
   that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the Wicked One." It is
   not, as someone said the other day, "a redeemed world"--it is a world
   that lies in the Wicked One, as a child lies in its father's arms!
   There is a redeemed people in it, whom Christ is calling out by His own
   wondrous and Sovereign Grace, but we are not to look upon them as
   tasting of the benefits of His redemption in any saving way until He
   calls them to faith in Himself and brings them to be washed in His
   precious blood! Then may they, indeed, be called, "beloved of God."

   These are, again, beloved with a love of resolve. He determined
   concerning those whom He loved that they should be saved, that they
   should repent, that they should accept the great Sacrifice. He ordained
   them unto eternal life and He resolved so to work upon them that, while
   He did not violate the freedom of their wills, or treat them otherwise
   than as men, yet still He would accomplish His purpose with them, He
   would create in them a new heart and a right spirit! He would turn them
   from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to Himself. These
   are the beloved of the Lord.

   And in consequence they came to be the beloved of God in another sense,
   namely, with a love of complacency. The Lord cannot love a wicked man
   with the love of complacency. He takes no delight in him--He cannot
   even look on him without abhorrence, for he provokes the Lord to anger
   by his iniquity. But there are men and women in the world in whom the
   Holy Spirit has worked principles which delight God. He has given them
   a character which is pleasing to Him. They are His Hephzibahs--His
   delight is in them. There are some of whom He thinks with pleasure,
   though they were once sinful and vile as others. He has transformed
   them into new creatures in Christ Jesus and now He delights in them. I
   do not know a more joyful thought than for a man to be led to believe
   that God takes complacency in Him and looks at him with the eyes of
   loving approval. Such as he are the beloved of the Lord!

   And because of this, dear Friends, there was also a love of unity. God
   joins Himself to the man in whom He takes delight. There is a
   friendship between them more close than that between David and
   Jonathan, so that God speaks with His servant and hears what His
   servant has to say in reply. There are men who are on such intimate
   terms with God that they

   might be called the friends of God, as Abraham was--and God is both
   their shield and their exceedingly great reward. Oh, did some of you
   know what a joy it is to be the beloved of the Lord, you would reckon
   yourselves to be wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked while you
   are without Him! And you would reckon that even if you were poor, blind
   and naked, yet you would not be wretched and miserable if you did but
   know this wondrous love of God which leads to the friendship of God and
   to fellowship with God! There are many men and women, nowadays, thank
   God, who have a place where they are accustomed to meet with God quite
   as regularly as they meet with their fellow tradesmen at their stall or
   at their office. They meet with God and it would be a doleful day to
   them if, on any occasion, they should go to wait upon God and find that
   He had closed the door against them! Yes, we have in London and all
   over the world, a multitude who may truly be called the beloved of the
   Lord!

   This is a very choice privilege. If you possess it, prize it beyond
   everything else! This is a crowning honor. Perhaps if you were invited
   to attend the Queen, you might think something of it, but what would
   that be compared with being beloved of God? To have the love of our
   follow men is very sweet--there are times when it comes with peculiar
   pleasantness--but oh, believe me, all the loves of all relationships,
   all the loves of all friendships heaped together can never be compared
   with the love of God to us! All the goodness that there is in human
   love is derived from the love of God and is, at best, but as a drop
   compared with the boundless ocean! If you are beloved of God, I will
   not stay to ask whether you are rich or poor, or even whether you are
   in good health or in sickness! Neither will I enquire whether you are
   in honor or in disrepute, or whether your life is likely to be long or
   to be suddenly cut short. All these things are but trifles! This is the
   solid fact that makes you a happy and a blessed man, that you can be
   called, "beloved of God."

   Now the sweet thing, here, is that if I am beloved of God, and you are
   beloved of God, here is a ground for us to meet. If you have not yet
   learned to know your Brother, if he is a stranger to you and if,
   because of this, no love has actually sprung up in your heart, yet,
   since Christ loves you--when you hear that Christ loves him--why, you
   will seem at once knit to him! I remember, when I first came to London,
   I used to think a great deal of everybody who came up from Waterbeach.
   I believe that if a dog had come up from Waterbeach, I should have fed
   him and I think that if anybody comes from where Christ is--the Christ
   who loves us--we shall be sure to love him! They who are beloved of God
   will love all others who are beloved of God! "But they are American
   friends." Never mind whether they are American or Dutch--if the Lord
   loves them, we love them!

   "Oh, but they live so many thousands of miles away and they never come
   here." Never mind--what if seas and mountains divide us--yet are we one
   and He who loves us loves them, also! I am sure that I appeal to you
   with no doubt as to what your answer will be. If God has put us within
   the same circle of His infinite affection, may we not safely clasp
   hands feeling that we shall never have to unclasp them, no, not even in
   death? The relationship between a husband and a wife, between a mother
   and her son may be snapped entirely by death, never to be renewed. If
   there is no Divine Grace in the heart of the husband or the child, the
   weeping and the wailing will be useless! They are parted, never to meet
   again! Think of that, you who are still unsaved. But if we are one in
   Christ's love, we may have to bid, "Good-bye," to one another here on
   earth for a time, but it is only for a time! Those bands, of which the
   love of God is the raw material, are everlasting!

   Some of you, tonight, when I break the bread, will have to go upstairs
   or go home. I very often meet with good men who come to join the Church
   and who say, "Nothing decided me till I had to leave my wife behind me,
   or when I stayed in the top gallery and looked down upon her and felt
   that I could not come and eat with her the memorial of the Lord's
   death. Then I felt that I could not hold out any longer." Oh, may you
   have that union in the love of God which never will be broken! Seek it
   tonight! May we all, in these two galleries and this great area, be
   encompassed within the circle of the "beloved of God"!

   II. Now, my second head is, THEIR SURE PROOF OF THAT FAVOR, for they
   were "called to be saints"--

   "beloved of God, called to be saints."

   What were these people to whom Paul wrote? First, they were saints. You
   notice that the words, "to be," are put in by the translators, but
   though they are supplied, they are not really necessary to the sense.
   These Believers in Rome were "called saints." They were not called
   because they were saints, but they became saints through that calling.
   Now, here is a name that belongs to all the people of God--they are
   saints. It is not merely, "St. John," and, "St. James," and so on, as
   some foolish people talk, who cannot call Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
   by their right names, but must always "Saint"

   them! I believe that there is a St. John--I dare say that there are 20
   St. Johns in this Tabernacle tonight! I believe in St. Matthew--I
   expect that there are two or three St. Matthews here tonight! All the
   people of God--all who are really believers in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   are saints! They are, all of them, called saints and we may call them
   so.

   Is not that very wonderful, that these Romans should be called
   saints--for once they were not saints! The Romans were among the worst
   of mankind. This first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans is one of
   the most awful that ever fell from a human pen. It so describes the
   infamous crimes of the Gentiles that we might almost blush to read it
   in the presence of a congregation--and such were some of these
   people--but Divine Grace came and renewed them! And they were called
   saints and really were saints, that is, dedicated persons. A saint is a
   person who is set apart unto God, consecrated to God, sanctified,
   separated--a man who is in the world, but not of it--he belongs to God
   and he lives for God.

   Now, if God loves you in the sense in which we have been speaking, He
   has made a saint of you, a dedicated man. You remember that Jonah was
   asked, "What is your occupation and of what people are you?" and he
   answered, "I am an Hebrew and I fear the Lord." That was his
   occupation--he was a God-fearing man. It is not every man who could
   give such an answer as that. When we feel that our very occupation is
   to serve God, then are we rightly "called saints," sanctified, set
   apart ones.

   But the word "saints" really means, also, holy persons. If we are the
   beloved of the Lord, He will make us holy persons. There is a very wide
   difference between that and being merely moral. Here is a man who calls
   himself a saint and he is not honest--do not call him a saint--he is
   not even a respectable sinner. Here is a man who says he is a child of
   God and yet he is guilty of lewdness. Call him a saint when even common
   morality is absent? Dear Friends, all the charity we can possibly pump
   up will not allow us to call that man a holy man who is not even a
   moral man! What is holiness, then? It rises above morality as much as
   the Heaven rises above the earth! Holiness is a more spiritual, a more
   intense, a more Divine, a more heavenly thing than morality--and he who
   has not morality certainly falls very short of anything like holiness!
   We are called not merely to be moralists, but to be saints!

   If you go, tomorrow, into some place of amusement where there is
   something not quite clean, something full of levity, I should like
   somebody to whisper in your ear, "Called to be saints." Or, if
   tomorrow, in business, you should lose your temper and begin to speak
   rather strongly, I should like something, even if it were only a
   parrot, to say, "Called to be saints." And if, when you go home, you
   begin to be very rough to the children, unkind to the wife and not what
   you should be, even to the servant, I should like you to hear a voice
   saying," Called to be saints." It might make you blush, if you
   can--there are some who cannot--but every man who professes to be a
   child of God should remember that this is what his calling is and he
   cannot prove that he is beloved of God unless he can prove his calling
   to saintship by being really a saint. Oh, that we had a Church made up
   all of saints! Our churches, nowadays, are very respectable
   communities, I do not doubt, and there is a good deal of sainthood in
   them, but, oh, if they were all saints, then, indeed, we should tell
   upon the world and tell upon the age--and the Kingdom of our Lord would
   come! They were saints, then, to whom Paul wrote.

   He also says that they were "called to be saints." They were not
   originally saints--they were "called to be saints." They were not
   saints by their own native growth--they did not grow up into
   saints--they were "called to be saints." They were called of Christ,
   Himself. Read the sixth verse--"Among whom are you also the called of
   Jesus Christ." Being called by Jesus Christ, they were called by a
   Voice which they recognized, a Voice to which they yielded, a Voice
   that spoke effectually, a Voice that spoke transformingly--and they
   were called by Him to be saints. Have you ever had such a call, my dear
   Hearer? Sitting in your pew, tonight, can you remember when that call
   came to you, as real a call as when God called Abraham out of Ur of the
   Chaldees, a call from Heaven--mysterious, Divine--which nobody else
   could hear, but which you heard and obeyed? "Called to be saints."

   Now, then, see a ground of our communion, one with another! If I have
   had a call to be a saint, I should not like to talk much about that to
   some people whom I know, for they would call it fanaticism. If you have
   had a call to be a saint, you have been very much in the same state.
   And when you and I meet together, we are not afraid to talk about it.
   You understand it and I understand it--and on the ground of having had
   a common call, we feel ourselves at home. We are Brothers and Sisters
   at once because we are equally "called to be saints." You cry and you
   sigh for saintship and your friend cries and sighs for saintship, too.
   He is conscious that he comes short of his own idea of it. He
   struggles, he groans. You and he have a secret between you--your
   experience is his experience and you two feel, having equally received
   a call

   from God, and a call for the same purpose--that you should both become
   the same thing, namely, saints unto God! Here is ground for fellowship.

   The lambs can have no fellowship with the wolves--let them stay
   together and have fellowship, one with another. You who love God will
   not find much fellowship up and down these streets. In many of the
   houses, if you were to speak of God, they would ridicule you. Get all
   the fellowship that you can, one with another. Let it be said of you,
   as of those of old, "Then they that feared the Lord spoke often, one to
   another, and the Lord listened, and heard it, and a Book of Remembrance
   was written before Him for them that feared the Lord and that thought
   upon His name." I like to think of this, that as we are one in being,
   the beloved of the Lord, so are we one in the outcome of it! We have
   all been called and we have all been called to the same high attainment
   of saintship. Paul does not say that he alluded to "the upper ten" at
   Rome. No, but he says, "To all that are in Rome, beloved of God." Do
   not go about and pick out a few of the best Christian people and say,
   "I am in sympathy with them." Ah, dear Friends, this is not like
   Christ! He washed His disciples' feet, but you are for looking up at
   their heads!

   Go and begin fellowship with him by washing his dear feet. Where there
   is aliquid Christi, as a good man used to say, anything of Christ,
   there should your love go forth. Where there is any work of Christ upon
   the soul of anyone, however uneducated, however poor, however rough he
   may be, yes, and however bad-tempered he may be, nevertheless endeavor
   to get to maintain and to increase fellowship with him, seeing that you
   and he have one calling--you are both "called to be saints."

   III. Now I come to a close with the third point where I think we shall
   also find some ground for fellowship, THEIR BLESSEDNESS THROUGH THE
   FAVOR OF GOD. This was the same with regard to all to whom Paul
   wrote--"To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace
   to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus

   Christ."

   First, these good people had this blessedness--they all had the same
   Father. Suppose that two persons were to meet here, tonight, who did
   not know each other, and they were to begin to talk to one another, and
   one said, "My father's name is So-and-So," And the other were to look
   at him and say, "And where does he live?" "He lives at such a house, in
   such a city." "Does he? Why, do you know, that is my father?" Those two
   would be surprised that they did not know each other, for they
   evidently had the same father! I can see them backing a bit and looking
   at one another, and saying, "Do you mean to say that his name is really
   John Smith?" "Yes." "And he lives at such a house?" "Yes." "What age is
   he? What kind of a man is he? Have you his picture with you?" "Yes."
   "There, I have a good portrait of him, too, and it is the same man! He
   is father to us both--then what are we two?" "We are brothers." And
   they put their arms about each other's neck and say, "What have we been
   doing, that, having the same father, we did not know each other?"

   Now, there are many Christian people who, if they came right, would be
   in much the same condition. They have the same Father and do not know
   it because they do not quite agree, perhaps, upon some form of
   doctrine, or even upon the rite of Baptism, or something of that sort,
   which is of very great importance, but still, the most important thing
   is-- Have we one Father? If we have, then let us have fellowship, one
   with the other! I want this to be real. When I was very young and first
   joined the church in Cambridge, I sat in a pew at the communion with a
   gentleman, perhaps with two or three, but none of them spoke to me. The
   next time I went to the communion, it was the same--nobody spoke to me.
   I was not anybody to be spoken to, so when I got outside the Chapel, I
   said to one gentleman, "Well, dear Sir, how are you?" He said, "I am
   pretty well, thank you, but you have the advantage on me." "I do not
   think I have, Sir. I do not know you any more than you know me, but I
   came to the Communion Table to profess that I was a Brother of those
   who were there and I meant it--did you not mean it?" He put both his
   hands on me, for he was much older than I was, and he said, "What sweet
   simplicity! You have only acted according to truthfulness. I am glad,"
   he added, "that you did not do it to our deacon!"

   The next thing he said was, "Will you come in and have a cup of tea
   with me?" I said, "Thank you, Sir, I could not do that, tonight,
   because I am expected home at the place where I live." "Will you come
   in next Sunday?" "Yes." I continued to go in every Sunday as long as I
   could and he remained, and does remain, a dear friend of mine to this
   day. Though he is very much older than I am, I established a friendship
   with him which never has been interrupted, and never will be, either in
   time or in eternity! Should it not be thus among all Christians?

   Is the Fatherhood of God a reality among the children of God? If it is,
   let their brotherhood be a reality and let them show that they are true
   Brothers and Sisters by their love, one to another! May the Lord make
   it so! The common talk of the universal fatherhood of God is a flat
   contradiction of the teaching of the Bible. There is certainly, in
   God's Word, such a Doctrine as Adoption. Does God adopt His own
   children, then? There is certainly a Revelation about the new birth.
   What are the regenerated born into, then? Only into the same nature as
   they had before? Is there anything fresh given to them which makes them
   to have the Nature of the children of God? I thought, and I still
   think, that it was meant that, until then, they were heirs of wrath,
   children of disobedience, even as others, and children of the Wicked
   One--but by no means children of the family of the Most High! By Grace
   alone could the saints in Rome call God, "Abba, Father."

   The next point in their blessedness was that they had the same Savior,
   for so says the text, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and
   the Lord Jesus Christ." He who died for Paul died for them. The streams
   of blood that flowed for the Apostle, flowed for them. For them the
   bloody sweat, for all of them! For them the death cry, "It is
   finished," for all of them and, truly, I think that being bought with
   the same price ought to make us feel that we are all one lump! We were
   all passed over to Christ by the one transaction of the paying down of
   His heart's blood to redeem us and we ought to feel, no, Brothers and
   Sisters, I hope that we do feel that we are all one and we will
   endeavor as much as lies in us to show this in our lives.

   And, more than that, they were going to the same Heaven. Beloved, the
   Home of God should be the great goal to which we are always pressing
   forward. You see that the men of the world are coming this way in a
   great crowd, all in a hurry, rushing after their gods--and we, what are
   we doing? Threading our way, as best we can, pushing our way against
   the stream, going in an exactly opposite direction to the rest of
   mankind. Some of you cannot do this! You keep getting carried off your
   legs and you are swept along by the torrent. But the man of God must go
   against the current. He is not to be swept back--but he is always
   pressing forward, always seeking to make an advance, contending for
   every inch--and making up his mind that, come what may, he cannot go
   back! That is not his way--he must go forward, always pressing on
   toward the City that has foundations! Christians are like a live fish
   that goes up the stream, always up the stream. If the fish comes down
   the stream and you see it floating with its white belly on the top of
   the water, you know that it is dead--and we can see plenty of these
   dead fish floating down the stream nowadays. But the live Christian is
   going straight up the stream, straight up, up, up! Whichever way the
   tide may be running, whether it is at the ebb or at the flood, he is
   going straight up the stream and, God helping him, he will proceed in
   that way right to the end. So, Brothers and Sisters, as we are going to
   the same Heaven, let us have Heaven begun below as we live in love, one
   towards another.

   These saints, also, had the same Grace. I cannot stop to say much about
   it, but Paul wished for them all that they might have "Grace." If you
   have Grace and I have Grace, the Grace is the same in us all. It may
   take a different shape as to the fruit that it produces, but Grace is
   one. Whether it is Grace in the babe in Christ, or Grace in the strong
   man in Christ, it is the same Grace. And if we all are debtors to Grace
   and if Grace begins, and Grace carries on, and Grace completes its work
   in us all, let us, by the bonds of that Grace, be knit together in
   mutual affection, the one towards the other.

   And then they all had the same peace. Oh, what a blessed thing is peace
   with God, peace with our own conscience, peace with the past, peace
   with the present, peace with the future--the peace of God which passes
   all understanding! Have you peace, Brothers and Sisters, and have I
   peace? Then let us be as one, for we have the same peace! You must have
   noticed, in times of peril, how men are driven into each other's arms.
   If you are on board ship and the vessel is ready to go down, his
   lordship will be seen at the pumps working as hard as any sweep who may
   be on board! Everybody must share alike when they divide the
   biscuit--and everybody must take his turn at working in the saving of
   the ship. Well, well, if it is so in time of danger, let it be so in
   time of peace! Let us have an equally hearty communion and fellowship,
   the one with the other, in happy times and under sad circumstances as
   well.

   And so have I tried to prepare you to come to this feast. If any of you
   have any ill-will towards the others, have done with it! If there are
   any bickering and jealousies among you, wring the necks of those evil
   birds and have done with them--put them to a speedy death! Now, surely,
   is the time, when we come to the common Table of the Lord's one family,
   to feel that one heart is in us all and that by Him who loved us all
   and through Him whom we all love, we will love each other! God grant
   it! I am not aware that there is any special reason, now, why I should
   urge you to this unity more

   than at any other time, but there is always a reason for it. There is
   never a company of men and women, so large as ours, but what they have
   little jealousies between them. And you may be quite sure that these
   are displeasing to God and should be put away as speedily as possible.
   So let it be and thus may we keep the feast in union with Christ and
   with one another, for our Savior's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. ROMANS11-17

   Verse 1. Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle,
   separated unto the Gospel of God, Paul has many titles and he delights
   to mention them in writing to these Christians at Rome. He puts, first,
   his highest title--"A servant of Jesus Christ." He glories in being a
   servant of the Crucified Christ, a servant of Him who was despised and
   rejected of men! So do we. Paul was called out from among men,
   effectually "called" of God, "to be an Apostle, separated"--set
   apart--"unto the Gospel of God." He believed that he was separated for
   that purpose at his birth, but he was specially "separated unto the
   Gospel of God" on the road to Damascus. It is a happy thing when a
   minister feels that he has nothing to do with anything else but the
   Gospel--that commands all his thoughts, all his talents, all his time.

   2. (Which He had promised afore by His Prophets in the Holy
   Scriptures). All the Gospel is in the Old Testament as well as in the
   New, for the Gospel which Paul was called to preach was promised afore
   by the Prophets in the Holy Scriptures.

   3, 4. Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, which was made of the
   seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to be the Son of God
   with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection
   from the dead. He is as much the Son of God as he was the Son of Man.
   The Humanity is as true as the Divinity, the Divinity as true as the
   Humanity.

   5. By whom we have received Grace and Apostleship, for obedience to the
   faith among all nations, for His name. Paul felt that he was sent to
   preach among all the Gentiles. He had a large bishopric--James might
   keep to the Jews, but Paul's diocese included every land--he was to
   preach "among all nations."

   6, 7. Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ: to all that
   are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and
   peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. The Gospel is
   good news and the man who has to preach it is full of good wishes! He
   wishes the best possible things to everybody with whom he comes in
   contact--"Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
   Jesus Christ."

   8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
   faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. Oh, I would it were so
   with us, that we had faith that could be spoken of throughout the whole
   world! I am afraid that some have none to speak of--these saints in
   Rome had such faith that the noise went abroad everywhere, and all
   people wondered at them.

   9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of
   His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
   prayers. No wonder that they prospered so well when Paul always made
   mention of them in his prayers! Some Churches would prosper better if
   some of you remembered them more in prayer. Of course, you all pray for
   the Church of which you are members, but could you not set aside in
   your heart a little space for some poor Church that is dwindling down
   to nothing? Could you not pray it up again? Who knows what blessing
   would come upon pastor and people if you bore them on your hearts?

   10. Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
   prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. Paul prayed
   about that matter and we may pray about our journeys. I like to hear
   the old-fashioned expression, "Be pleased, O Lord, to grant travel
   mercies," for there are such things, and when the servants of God are
   going about, with a view to spread the Gospel, we ought to pray that
   they may travel in safety.

   11. For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
   gift, to the end you may be established. He wanted to go to Rome
   because he felt that he would take something with him. He was a poor
   man, so he could not take any gifts of gold or silver, but he was a
   chosen man and so he believed that he could impart unto them some
   spiritual gift. Oh, what a largess does a man of God distribute when
   his Lord is with him! I do pray, tonight, that feeble as I am, and
   unqualified as I am to bless you, yet even this night all of you who
   are the people of God may get some spiritual gift. I do not know what
   you need but our heavenly Father does. May every one of you get,
   distinctly from His right hand, some spiritual

   gift to the end that you may be established, that you may get good
   root-hold, that you may be firmly fixed on the sure foundation!

   12, 13. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
   mutual faith both of you and me. Now I would not have you ignorant,
   brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was
   hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you, also, even
   as among other Gentiles. Rome was a sink of iniquity. It was the den of
   the lions, where Nero was, who would speedily devour, like a lion, the
   minister of Christ. Paul needed, somehow, to get into that old city on
   the seven hills, and to pluck some fruit for God even from the vine
   that was planted there. But he was hindered.

   14, 15. I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to
   the wise and to the unwise. So, as much as is in me, I am ready to
   preach the Gospel to you that are at Rome also. I do not suppose that
   Paul guessed that he would be sent there at the government's expense,
   but he was! The Roman Empire had to find a ship for him and a fit
   escort for him, too. And he entered the city as an ambassador in bonds.
   When our hearts are set on a thing and we pray for it, God may grant us
   the blessing, but it may be in a way that we never looked for! You
   shall go to Rome, Paul, but you shall go in chains. He had not thought
   of that plan--still, it was the best way in which he could go! I do not
   know how he could have preached to the Emperor except as a
   prisoner--but when he was brought before him to be tried--then he had
   an opportunity of speaking even to the brutal creature who was called
   the Emperor of Rome!

   16, 17. For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the
   power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes; to the Jew
   first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God
   revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by
   faith. That is the sum and substance of the Gospel--"The just shall
   live by faith." The Law is, "He that does these things shall live by
   them." But the Gospel is, "The just shall live by faith." "Therefore,
   being justified by faith, we have peace with God." The Lord give to us
   all that saving faith, for Christ's sake! Amen.

The Heavenly Singers and Their Song

   (No. 2321)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 13, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   14, 1889.

   "And when He had taken the Book, the four beasts and twenty-four elders
   fell down before the Lamb, having, every one of them, harps and golden
   vials full of odors, which are theprayers of saints. And they sung a
   new song, saying, You are worthy to take the Book, and to open its
   seals: for You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out
   of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and have made us
   unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
   Revelation 5:8-10.

   THIS morning [Sermon #2095, Volume 35--The Lamb in Glory.] we had a
   picture of our Lord Jesus Christ appearing in Heaven in His Sacrificial
   Character, being adored in that Character, looking like a Lamb that had
   been slain, and being worshipped under that aspect in the very center
   of Heaven. I tried, as far as ever I could, to insist upon it that we
   must never hide the Atoning Sacrifice--that Christ, as the Lamb of God
   which takes away the sin of the world--is always to be brought to the
   front, to be put foremost in our preaching and in our practice, too. In
   this verse we go a step further. This blessed Lamb appears in Heaven as
   the Mediator between God and men. At God's right hand was the Book of
   His Eternal Purposes. None dared even to look upon it--it was hopeless
   that any creature should be able to loose its seven seals. But there
   came forward this glorious Lamb who had the marks of His slaughter upon
   Him and He took the Book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the
   Throne of God! Thus He acted as Mediator, Interpreter--taking the will
   of God and translating it--letting us know the meaning of that writing
   of the right hand of God which we could never have deciphered, but
   which, when Christ looses the seals, is made clear to us!

   Jesus Christ, then, is seen as our Sacrifice in the capacity of
   Mediator and, in that capacity, He becomes the object of the adoration,
   first, of the Church, then of all the thousands and ten thousands of
   angels, and then of every creature that God has made! It would be too
   large a subject to take in all those hallelujahs and, therefore, in
   speaking, tonight, I select only these three verses to set forth the
   song of the Church, the adoration of the Church of God, rendered to the
   bleeding Lamb as the Mediator between God and men.

   I shall have only two divisions. First, behold the worshippers. And,
   secondly, listen to their song.

   I. First, BEHOLD THE WORSHIPPERS, for, remember that we must be like
   they if we are to be with them. It is a well-known rule that Heaven
   must be in us before we can be in Heaven! We must be heavenly if we
   hope to sit in the heavenly places. We shall not be taken up to join
   the glorified choir unless we have learned their song and can join
   their sacred harmony. Look, then, at the worshippers. You are not yet
   perfectly like they, but you will be, by-and-by, if you have already
   the main points of likeness worked in you by the Grace of God.

   The first point about the worshippers is this, they are all full of
   life. I must confess that I should not like to dogmatize upon the
   meaning of the four living creatures, but still, they do seem to me to
   be a picture of the Church in its Godward standing, quickened by the
   life of God. At any rate, they are living creatures and the elders,
   themselves, are living persons. Yet alas, alas, that it should be
   necessary to say so true a thing, but the dead cannot praise God! "The
   living, the living, he shall praise You, as I do this day." Yet how
   many dead people there are in this great assembly tonight! If one who
   had sufficient powers of penetration as to be able to detect the
   actions of the spiritual life of man, were to go round this crowd, "Ah,
   me," he would say, "take this one away, take that one away--these are
   dead souls in the midst of the living in Zion."

   I will not dwell upon this very solemn thought, but I wish the
   conscience of some here to dwell upon it when the service is over. You
   are dead people in the midst of life! You joined in the song just now,
   but there was no living praise in your singing. Prayer was offered by
   my dear Brother Hurditch very fervently, but there was no living prayer
   in you. Do you know that it is so? If so, then take your right place
   and God grant you enough life to know the absence of life, lest He
   should say of you, "Bury My dead out of My sight," and you should be
   taken away to the house appointed to the dead, since you cannot be
   allowed to pollute the gathering of living saints! Those in Heaven are
   all full of life! There is no dead worshipper, there, no dull, cold
   heart that does not respond to the praise by which it is surrounded!
   They are all full of

   life.

   And further note, that they are all of one mind. Whether they are 24
   elders, or four living creatures, they all move simultaneously. With
   perfect unanimity they fall on their faces, or touch their harps, or
   lift up their golden vials full of sweet odors. I like unanimity in
   worship here. You remember the lines--

   "At once they sing, at once they pray! They hear of Heaven, and learn
   the way." We used to sing that hymn when we were children, but is there
   always real unanimity in our assembly? While one is praising, is not
   another murmuring? While one is earnest, is not another indifferent?
   While one is believing, is not another an infidel? O God, grant to our
   assemblies, here below, the unanimity that comes of the One Spirit
   working in us the same result, for so we must be in Heaven, and if we
   are not of one mind here below, we are not like the heavenly beings
   above! When little bickerings come in. When sectarian differences
   prevent our joining in the common adoration, it is a great pity. God
   heal His one Church of all her unhappy divisions and any one Church of
   any latent differences that there may be, that our unity on earth may
   be an anticipation of the unanimity of Heaven!

   Note, next, that as the heavenly worshippers are full of life and full
   of unity, so they are all full of holy reverence. "When He had taken
   the Book, the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell down
   before the Lamb," all reverently fell down before the Lamb! And in the
   14th verse, after their song was over and after the angels and the
   whole creation had taken their turn in the celestial music, we read,
   "And the four living creatures said, Amen." It was all that they could
   say--they were overawed with the majestic Presence of God and the Lamb!
   "And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshipped Him that lives
   forever and ever." They did not say anything, then. They simply fell
   down and worshipped. It is a grand thing when, at last, we have broken
   the backs of words with the weight of our feelings--when expressive
   silence must come in to prove the praises which we cannot utter! It is
   glorious to be in this reverent state of mind. We are not always so,
   but they are so in Heaven! They are all ready to fall down before the
   Lord. Do you not think that we often come into our places of worship
   with a great deal of carelessness? And while the service is going on,
   are we not thinking of a thousand things? Or if we are attentive, is
   there enough lowly worship about us? In Heaven, they fall down before
   the Lamb--Brothers and Sisters, would not we serve God better if we did
   more of this falling down to worship the Lamb?

   Note, next, that while they are all full of reverence, they are all in
   a praising condition--"Having, every one of them, harps." They did not
   pass one harp around and take turns in playing it. Nor was there one
   who had to sit still because he had forgotten his harp. They had, every
   one of them, his harp. I am afraid those words do not describe all
   God's people here, tonight. My dear Sister, where is your harp? It is
   gone to be repaired, is it not? My dear Brother, where is your harp?
   You have left it on the willow tree, by the waters of Babylon, so you
   have not one here. I must confess that sometimes I have not a harp--I
   could preach a solemn sermon--but I could not so well render the
   praise. Our dear friend, Hurditch, seemed to have brought his harp with
   him, tonight! I am glad he praised the Lord so many times for so many
   mercies. We do not always have our harps with us, but the living
   creatures and the elders had, all of them, the apparatus for the
   expression of their holy joy, "having, every one of them, harps." Try
   to be like the spirits above.

   But this is not all--they are all ready for prayer. In Heaven there is
   prayer--we must correct the common mistake about that matter--and there
   is something to pray for. Although we do not ask the intercession of
   saints and angels-- that were far from Scriptural-- still, we believe
   that the saints do pray. Are they not crying, "O Lord, how long?" Why
   should they not pray, "Your Kingdom come. Your will be done, in earth,
   as it is in Heaven"? They would understand that prayer better than we
   do. We know how God's will is not done on earth, but they know how it
   is done in Heaven! And they could pray, "Your Kingdom come, for Yours
   is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, forever, Amen."

   How sweetly could their lips move over such words as those! Well, they,
   all of them, had "golden vials full of odors." Are we always furnished
   and prepared for prayer? This ought to be more easy than always to have
   a harp, but I am afraid that we have not always our golden vials full
   of odors. I do not know that they are golden vials at all. I am afraid
   that ours are of the earth, earthy. But in Heaven they have golden
   vials, pure and precious, and they are full of odors. Sometimes, when
   you look into your prayer box, my Brothers and Sisters, you have to
   scrape the bottom to find enough perfume to make even a little incense.
   But to have our vials full of sweet odors, this is the state of mind in
   which we should always be. God bring us to that! We shall be getting
   near Heaven when we can always pray, and certainly near Heaven when we
   can always praise--

   "Prayer and praise, with sins forgiven, Bring to earth the bliss of Hea
   ven," and make us ready to go up and share that bliss.

   Now you see something of what these worshippers were. I do but pause a
   moment to ask whether we are prepared to go there, whether we are like
   those who are there. Remember that there is but one place for us
   besides--if we do not enter Heaven, to praise with those perfect
   spirits--we must be driven from the Divine Presence to suffer with the
   condemned! You are not willing to go to Hell--will you not be in
   earnest to go to Heaven? You recoil at the idea of, "Depart, you
   cursed!" Oh, why not, even now, accept, "Come, you blessed," while
   Jesus repeats His gracious invitation, "Come unto Me, all you that
   labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"? I wish that I
   were able to press this invitation upon you, but I do put it before
   you. In the name of Jesus, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
   the world, I invite you to trust in Him and find your sins forgiven
   and, so doing, you shall be prepared to meet the Lamb who sits upon the
   Throne of God and there, forever, adore His Sacrifice while you enjoy
   the blessings that flow from it! May we all meet in Heaven! It would be
   a dreadful thing if we could know the destiny of everybody here and
   find, among other things, that some here will never see the Gate of
   Pearl except from an awful distance--with a great gulf fixed--of which
   gulf it is said, "They which would pass from here to you, cannot.
   Neither can they pass to us, that would come from there." May we be on
   the right side of that gulf! Be on the right side of it, tonight, for
   Jesus' sake!

   II. Now, having thus spoken of the worshippers, I want you to LISTEN TO
   THEIR SONGS. We must listen our best in the short time that we have
   left. "They sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the Book,
   and to open its seals, for You were slain and have redeemed us to God
   by Your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
   and have made us unto our God, kings and priests: and we shall reign on
   the earth."

   It is rather an unusual thing to take a hymn and treat it doctrinally
   but, for your instruction, I must take away the poetry for a moment and
   just deal with the Doctrines of this heavenly hymn.

   The first Doctrine is Christ is put in the front--the Deity of Christ,
   as I hold it. They sing, "You are worthy, You are worthy." A
   strong-winged angel sped his way over earth and Heaven, and down the
   deep places of the universe, crying with a loud voice, "Who is worthy
   to open the Book?" But no answer came, for no creature was worthy. Then
   came One, of whom the Church cries in its song, "You are worthy, You
   are worthy." Yes, Beloved, He is worthy of all the praise and honor
   that we can bring to Him! He is worthy to be called equal with God. No,
   He is, Himself God, very God of very God, and no man can sing this
   song, or ever will sing it, unless He believes Christ to be Divine and
   accepts Him as his Lord and God.

   Next, the doctrine of this hymn is that the whole Church delights in
   the mediation of Christ. Notice, it was when He had taken the Book that
   they said, "You are worthy to take the Book." To have Christ standing
   between God and man is the joy of every believing heart. We could never
   reach up to God, but Christ has come to bridge the distance between us.
   He places one hand on man and the other upon God--He is the Daysman who
   can lay His hands upon both--and the Church greatly rejoices in this!
   Remember that even the working of Providence is not apart from the
   mediation of Christ. I rejoice in this, that if the thunders are let
   loose, if plagues and deaths around us fly, the child of God is still
   under the Mediator's protection and no harm shall happen to the chosen,
   for Jesus guards us always. All power is given unto Him in Heaven and
   in earth, and the Church rejoices in His mediatorship!

   But now, notice, in the Church's song, what is her reason for believing
   that Christ is worthy to be a Mediator. She says, "You are worthy, for
   You were slain." Ah, Beloved, when Christ undertook to be her Mediator,
   this was the extreme point to which Suretyship would carry Him--to be
   slain! And He has gone to the extreme point and He has paid

   life for life. "In the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die,"
   was the sentence pronounced upon Adam. The Second Adam has died--He has
   bowed His head to the sentence--He has vindicated the Law of God! He
   has gone to the extreme length of all that His mediatorship could
   possibly demand of Him and this makes the redeemed lift up the song
   higher and higher and higher--"You are worthy, for You were slain."
   Jesus is never more glorious than in His death! His Propitiation is the
   culmination of His Glory, after all, as it was the very utmost depth of
   His shame, Beloved, we rejoice in our Mediator because He died!

   Well then, notice, that they sing of the redemption which His death
   effected, but they do not sing of the redemption of the world. No, not
   at all--"You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out
   of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation." I am not going
   into a doctrinal discussion, tonight. I believe in the infinite value
   of the Atoning Sacrifice. I believe that if God had ordained it to be
   effectual for the salvation of many more, it was quite sufficient for
   the Divine purpose--but those whom Christ redeemed unto God by His
   blood are not all mankind. All mankind will not sing this song! All
   mankind will not be made kings and priests unto God! And all mankind
   are not redeemed in the sense in which this song is lifted up to God. I
   want to know, not so much about general redemption, of which you may
   believe what you like, but about Particular Redemption, personal
   redemption--"You have redeemed us." "Christ loved the Church and gave
   Himself for it." "You have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of
   every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."

   My dear Hearer, can you join in this song? It is all very well to say,
   "Oh, yes! We are all sinners. We are all redeemed." Stop, stop! Are you
   a sinner? Do you know it? Sinners are very scarce in London. "Why,
   there are millions of them!" you say. Yes, yes, yes--nominally, they
   will say so--but the bond fide sinner, who knows his guilt, is a scarce
   article--

   "A sinner is a sacred thing, The Holy Spirit has made him so." If there
   is a real sinner in this house, tonight, she will be weeping at my
   Master's feet, washing those blessed feet with her tears! But as for
   you sham sinners--you are sinners, enough, God knows, but you do not
   really believe that you are sinners! You have never done anything very
   wrong, nothing very particular, nothing very important, nothing to
   break your hearts about. Oh, you--why you cannot even claim to come in
   among the sinners--you are a sham even there! But as for redemption,
   that redemption that redeemed everybody will not do you any good, for
   it redeemed Judas, it redeemed the myriads that are now in Hell! A poor
   redemption, that! The redemption that you need is the redemption that
   would fetch you right out from your fellow sinners, so that you would
   be separated unto God, according to that word, "Come out from among
   them, and be you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean
   thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and you
   shall be my sons and daughters."

   A thing that is redeemed belonged, originally, to the person who
   redeems it, and the redeemed of the Lord always were His--"Yours they
   were," says Christ, "and You gave them to Me." They always were God's.
   You cannot go and redeem a thing that does not belong to you! You may
   buy it, but you cannot redeem it. Now, that which belonged originally
   to God came under a mortgage through sin. We, having sinned, came under
   the curse of the Law and though God still held to it that we were His,
   yet we were under this mortgage--sin had a lien upon us. Christ came
   and saw His own and He knew that they were His own. He asked what there
   was to pay to redeem them, to take them out of pawn. It was His heart's
   blood, His life, Himself that was required! He paid the price and
   redeemed them--and we, tonight, sing, "You have redeemed us to God by
   Your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."
   He has, by redeeming us, separated us to Himself and made us a peculiar
   people--bought with blood in a special sense out of all the rest of
   mankind!

   I could tell you a great deal about the universal bearings of Christ's
   redemption in which I believe, and in the infinite value of that
   redemption, in which I believe, but I also say that there was, in the
   design of God, and in the work of Christ, a peculiar form of redemption
   which was only for His own people, even as His intercession is, for He
   says, "I pray for them, I pray not for the world: but for them which
   You have given Me, for they are Yours." Whatever some may think about
   it, there is a specialty and peculiarity about the redemption of
   Christ--and this makes the very highest note of the song of Heaven,
   "You have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every kindred, and
   tongue, and people, and nation."

   So much about the heavenly hymn doctrinally.

   Now about it experimentally--"You have redeemed us to God." I have
   said, dear Friends, that you cannot sing this song unless you know
   something of it now. Have you been redeemed? Has the mortgage that was
   on you through sin been taken off you? Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
   For, every man who believes in Jesus Christ has the evidence of his
   eternal redemption. You have been bought back with a countless price if
   you believe that Jesus is the Christ and you are trusting, alone, in
   Him! That was their experience--"You have redeemed us." They felt free.
   They remembered when they wore their fetters, but they saw them all
   broken by Christ. Have you been set free? Have you had your fetters
   broken? Ask the question and then let us pass on.

   This redemption is the ground of their distinction--"You have redeemed
   us to God by Your blood." I heard one, the other day, say of a certain
   minister, "Oh, we want another minister, we are tired of this man. He
   is always talking so much about the blood." In the Last Great Day, God
   will be tired of the man who made that speech. God never wearies of the
   precious blood, nor will His people who know where their salvation
   lies. They do not, even in Heaven, say that it is a dreadful word to
   mention. "Oh, but I do not like the word!" says some delicate
   gentleman. Your lordship will not be bothered with it, for you will not
   go to Heaven! Do not trouble yourself--you shall not go where they sing
   about the blood. But, mark you, if you ever do go there, you will hear
   it over and over and over again--"You have redeemed us to God by Your
   blood." How they will ring it out! "You, You, You have redeemed us to
   God by Your blood." How they will emphasize that pronoun, "You," and
   address the praise wholly to Jesus, and sound out that word with the
   full music of their harps, "You have redeemed us to God by Your blood."
   They are not ashamed of the blood of Jesus up there!

   It is this redemption that has made them kings. We cannot realize our
   kingship to the fullest here below, though we do in a measure. There is
   a poor man here who has but one room to live in. He has no money in his
   pocket, tonight, yet he is a king in the sight of God! There is one
   here, perhaps, who used to be a drunk. He could not overcome the
   evil--he signed the pledge, wore the blue ribbon and so on--but still
   he went back to the drink. By the Grace of God he has got his foot upon
   it, now, for he has a new heart and a right spirit. That man is a king!
   He is a king over his drunken habits! There is one here who used to
   have a very fierce temper. It was hard to live with him, but Christ has
   made him a changed man and now he is a king, ruling over his temper! It
   is a grand thing to be made a king over yourself. There are some who
   have dominion over millions of others, who have never ruled themselves.
   Poor creatures! Poor creatures! Thank God, if He has given you the
   mastery of your own nature--that is a glorious conquest! Yet this is
   only the beginning of what is in this song of Heaven!

   And then they say, "You have made us priests." Oh, the poor creatures
   we have, nowadays, in the world, who cannot go to Christ except by a
   priest! They must go to a priest to confess their sins and go to a
   priest to get absolution. We have priests not only in the Church of
   Rome, but elsewhere! We are sorry to see this accursed priestcraft
   coming in everywhere. Why, some of you people would like your minister
   to do all your religion for you, would you not? You take a sitting and
   leave your religion to your minister. Christ has made every one of His
   people a priest, and every child of God is as much a priest as I am!
   And I am a priest certainly, a priest unto God to offer the spiritual
   sacrifice of prayer, and praise, and the ministry of the Word. But here
   is the peculiar joy of all Christians--that God has made them priests.
   If they do not use their priesthood, here, I am afraid that they will
   never be able to use their priesthood before the Throne of God with
   their fellow priests. This is the melody of the heavenly song, "Washed
   in the precious blood, redeemed by that matchless price, we are now
   made unto our God kings and priests." Even on earth each saint can
   sing--

   "I would not change my blessed estate, For all that earth calls good or
   great! And while my faith can keep her hold, I envy not the sinner's
   gold."

   Thus have I spoken of the song doctrinally and experimentally. Now let
   me speak of it expectantly.

   There is something to be expected--"And we shall reign on the earth."
   When John heard that song, the Resurrection Day had not yet come. These
   are the spirits before the Throne of God, disembodied--they are
   expecting the Day of the Resurrection. When that day will come, who can
   tell? But when it comes, the dead in Christ shall rise first. Starting
   up at the midnight cry, they shall quit their beds of dust and silent
   clay--and the saints that are alive and remain shall join them. I will
   not go into the details of that time but then shall come a period of
   halcyon bliss. "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
   years were finished." Then shall be a time of the saints' reigning upon
   the earth. Their

   life shall be regal--their delights, their joys and their honors shall
   be equal to those of kings and princes--no, they shall far exceed them!
   Do you and I expect to reign upon the earth? It will seem very odd to
   one who is very poor, obscure, perhaps ignorant, but who knows His
   Lord, to find that Christ has made Him a priest and a king and that he
   shall reign even on the earth with Him, and then reign forever with Him
   in Glory! But it would be more amazing--it would be perfectly monstrous
   if we were to assert of some persons, and of some here present--that
   they would reign on the earth!

   The man who lives for himself shall never reign on the earth! "Blessed
   are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth"--not the men who, in
   their selfishness, trample down everybody else with iron heels! You
   shall not reign on the earth--you have lived here simply to hoard
   money, or to make a name for yourself, or to indulge your passions, or
   to revenge yourselves upon your fellow men. You reign, Sir? You? God's
   prison house is the place for you, not a throne! But when He has made
   us meek, humble, lowly, reverent and pure, then we shall become fit to
   be promoted to this high calling of being priests and kings for Christ
   unto God in Glory and even here on earth in the day that is coming.

   I wish that everybody here would take to searching himself as to
   whether he is likely to be of that blessed number. Do you with joy
   accept Christ as your Mediator? Do you see clearly how worthy He is to
   be the Mediator? Have you been redeemed from among men? Have you been
   taken away from old associations? Have you broken loose from habits
   that held you a slave among the Egyptians? Have you come into a new
   society? Has God brought you into a new Heaven and a new earth? Has He
   given you any measure of reigning power over yourself? Do you live as a
   priest, serving God continually? If you are obliged to keep on saying,
   "No, no, no," to all these questions, then what shall I say but, "Come
   to Christ"? May you come to Him, tonight! May He, tonight, begin in you
   that blessed process that shall make you meet to be partaker of the
   inheritance of the saints in light, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON PSALM136.

   When the chorus was taken up by the whole of the people, accompanied by
   a blast of trumpets, this must have been a magnificent hymn of praise.

   Verse 1. O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy
   endures forever. The Psalm begins with the august name, the
   incommunicable title of the one living and true God, Jah, Jehovah. For
   this name the Jews had a high respect which degenerated into
   superstition, for they would not write it in their Bibles--they put
   another word instead, in which our translators have imitated them, not
   to the improvement of the version. Surely, if it is, "Jehovah," in the
   original, we should have it, "Jehovah," here! The name is a very
   wonderful one," Je-ho-vah." No man knows exactly how it should be
   pronounced. It is said to consist of a succession of breathings,
   therefore is it written, "Let everything that has breath praise the
   Lord," whose name is a breathing and in whom dwells the life of all who
   breathe. Let us take care that we never trifle with the name of God! I
   think that the common use of the word, "Hallelujah," or, "Praise the
   Lord," is simply profane. Surely, this is not a word to be dragged in
   the mire--it should be pronounced with solemn awe and sacred joy.

   2. O give thanks unto the God of gods: for His mercy endures forever.
   If there is any other god, if there can be imagined to be any, our God
   is infinitely above them all! The gods of the heathen are idols, but
   our God made the heavens. If there is any reverence due to magistrates,
   of whom we read in Psalm 82, "I have said, You are gods," yet are they
   nothing at all compared with Jehovah, "the God of gods."

   3. O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for His mercy endures forever.
   Whatever there is of authority, or lordship, or kingship of any kind in
   the world, it is all in subjection to Him who is "the Lord of lords." I
   think I hear the trumpets sounding it out and all the people joining in
   chorus, "O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for His mercy endures
   forever." It is always the same strain, the enduring mercy of God, that
   bore the strain of Israel's sin and Israel's need, and Israel's
   wandering.

   4. To Him who alone does great wonders: for His mercy endures forever.
   Nobody does wonders that can be compared with Jehovah's wonders. Nobody
   helps Him in the doing of His wonders. He asks no aid from any of His
   creatures.

   5. To Him that by wisdom made the heavens: for His mercy endures
   forever. Every time you lift up your eyes to that one great arch which
   spans all mankind, praise the name of the great Builder who made that
   one enormous span, unbut-

   tressed and unpropped! What a work it was! And it was made by mercy as
   well as by wisdom. If we go into the scientific account of the
   atmosphere, of the firmament and of the stellar heavens, we see that
   the hand of mercy was at the back of wisdom in the making of it
   all--"for His mercy endures forever."

   6. To Him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for His mercy
   endures forever. We ought to praise Him for the making of every
   country, especially, I think, we who dwell on these favored islands,
   because He has placed our lot in an island--

   "He bade the waters round you flow. No bars of brass could guard you
   so." We might have been beneath the tyrant's foot if it had not been
   for "the silver streak" that gives us liberty. The whole earth,
   wherever men dwell, will afford some peculiar reason for their praise
   to Jehovah.

   7-9. To Him that made great lights: for His mercy endures forever: the
   sun to rule by day: for His mercy endures forever: the moon and stars
   to rule by night: for His mercy endures forever. Why three verses about
   one thing? Because we are not known to dwell upon God's goodness as we
   should. We are, therefore, told first to remember light in general--and
   then the sun, the moon, the stars--each one in particular. And each
   time we do so, we may say, "His mercy endures forever." We are not left
   in the daytime without the sun and, when the day is over, the darkness
   of the night is cheered either by the moon or by the stars which show
   us that not only day unto day, but night unto night, He thinks of us,
   "for His mercy endures forever." Praise Him, praise Him, whether it is
   high noon or midnight, when the day is renewed or when the curtains of
   your rest are drawn, still praise Him, "for His mercy endures forever."

   10. To Him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for His mercy endures
   forever. It is not a common mercy of which we have to sing, but a
   peculiar theme for thanksgiving. He "smote Egypt in their firstborn."

   11. And brought out Israel from among them: for His mercy endures
   forever. Sing of His goodness to His chosen, even though it involved a
   terrible stroke upon his proud adversary. There are some who cannot
   praise God's left hand, but we can--not only the right hand that helps
   His people out, but the left hand that smites the Egyptians. We praise
   Him, still, with unabated joy in Him. What He does must be right and in
   His vengeance there is justice, and justice is mercy to mankind.

   12. With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for His mercy
   endures forever. In all God's acts there is some peculiarity which
   commands especial attention. "He brought out Israel," praise Him for
   that. He did it "with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm,"
   therefore again praise Him, The ring is precious, but the brilliance in
   the ring is that to which in this verse you are told to look, namely,
   Jehovah's strong hand and stretched out arm.

   13. 14. To Him which divided the Red sea into parts: for His mercy
   endures forever: and made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for
   His mercy endures forever. And when you, too, come to the Red Sea on
   your way to the heavenly Canaan-- when your path is blocked, God will
   divide it for you--and as He gently leads you through the very deeps,
   He will have you sing, "His mercy endures forever." No floods can drown
   His love, nor divide you from it. "Who shall separate us from the love
   of Christ?" Jehovah will split seas in two to make a passage for His
   people, "for His mercy endures forever."

   15. But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea: for His mercy
   endures forever. This is the deep bass of the hymn, He "overthrew
   Pharaoh." "The horse and his rider has He thrown into the sea." We
   cannot give up that verse! We cannot refuse to sing the Song of Moses.
   We must praise and bless God for all that He did at the Red Sea, even
   though terrible were His deeds of righteousness, when the warriors of
   Egypt sank to the bottom of the sea like a stone.

   16. To Him which led His people through the wilderness: for His mercy
   endures forever. Here is another point where you can join with Israel.
   This world is a wilderness to you, but the Lord leads you through it.
   By His fiery-cloudy pillar, He conducts you all your journey through.
   By His manna, gently dropping from Heaven, He still feeds you and He
   will guide you till He brings you over "Jordan's stormy banks"--

   "To Canaan's fair and happy land." 17-20. To Him which smote great
   kings: for His mercy endures forever: and slew famous kings: for His
   mercy endures forever: Sihon king of the Amorites: for His mercy
   endures forever: and Og the king of Bashan: for His mercy endures
   forever. Here you have the repetitions of God. I have sometimes said
   that I like the tunes which allow us to repeat the line of a hymn and,
   certainly, one likes a Psalm which turns over some great mercy of God,
   and makes us see the various facets of

   the wonderful jewel. The Psalmist does not merely say that Jehovah
   smote great kings, but these kings were famous in battle, which
   rendered their greatness or power the more formidable. But whether men
   are great, or whether they are valorous, or both, they cannot prevent
   God's mercy to His people! He will push a way for them against the
   horns of their adversaries and they shall be victorious. As if to show
   the depth of His gratitude, the Psalmist gives the names of these kings
   and of the countries over which they ruled--and He dwells with emphasis
   upon these points of the mercy of God to His people in that He slew
   famous kings--Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan.

   21, 22. And gave their land for an heritage: for His mercy endures
   forever: even an heritage unto Israel His servant: for His mercy
   endures forever. He gave them those countries which were beyond the
   land of promise, because these foes tried to stop their journey. He did
   not limit Palestine but, on the contrary, He stretched the ordained
   bounds of it and enclosed the land of the Amorites and Bashan within
   the territory He gave to His people. Now comes a soft sweet verse--I
   think I hear the harps leading the singing--

   23. Who remembered us in our low estate: for His mercy endures forever.
   Can you not sing this tonight? Some of you, who were very poor, very
   sad, despairing, abhorred of men, slandered, persecuted, very
   low--perhaps some here who once were in the slums of this city, now can
   sing--"Who remembered us in our low estate." Spiritually, our estate
   was low enough. It had ebbed out till we had no comfort nor hope
   left--but the Lord remembered us! That is a blessed prayer, "Lord,
   remember me." That prayer has been answered for many, here! Yes, even
   before we prayed it! He remembered us in our low estate, "for His mercy
   endures forever." Dear Heart, are you in a very low estate tonight? Do
   you feel as if you were at death's dark door and at Hell's dread brink
   by reason of the greatness and blackness of your sin? "His mercy
   endures forever!" Catch at that rope! Drowning men clutch at straws,
   but this is no straw--cling to it--it will bear your weight! It has
   been a means of salvation to myriads before you. Trust God's mercy in
   Christ and you are saved, "for His mercy endures forever." "Who
   remembered us"--what next?

   24. And has redeemed us. This song is climbing up--it begins to ascend
   the heavenly ladder! It has already reached redemption.

   24, 25. From our enemies: for His mercy endures forever. Who gives food
   to all flesh: for His mercy endures forever. God is the great Feeder of
   the world. What a commissariat is that of the universe! One cannot
   think of the needs of the five millions in London without shuddering
   lest, some day, there should not be food enough for them. But there
   always is. I will not trace it to the mere fact that trade and commerce
   supply us. No, there is an over-ruling Power at the back of it all,
   depend upon it! All the world seems eager to supply our markets and to
   make the loaf for the laborer, but it is God who has planned it all!
   Let us praise Him "who gives food to all flesh." As for spiritual meat,
   He will give us that, too! I trust we shall all have a portion of meat
   in due season, tonight. If any shall be hungry at the end of the
   service, it shall be surely from lack of willingness to be fed rather
   than lack of suitability in the Word of God to sustain the spirit and
   bless the soul.

   26. O give thanks unto the God of Heaven: for His mercy endures
   forever.

When Can We Find Comforters?

   (No. 2322)

   INTENDED FOR, READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 20, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JULY
   21, 1889.

   "Where shall I seek comforters for you?" Nahum 3:7.

   IT is the business of the Prophet of God and of the minister of Christ
   to seek comfort for those who are in distress. "Comfort you, comfort
   you My people, says your God." It is a part of our calling to seek,
   under the direction of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, to bring words
   of consolation to those who are heavy in heart. We have other work to
   do, but, still, this is a part of our commission. God would not have
   His people's heads hang down. He would have their hearts full ofjoy and
   peace in believing, so He sends us, with tender, sympathetic words, to
   strive to comfort all that mourn.

   I can truly say that while this is our duty, when we succeed in it, it
   is also our delight. To take the burden from the heavy heart is a great
   joy. Whenever I have comforted any mourners, I think that I have had
   even more comfort than the comforted ones! You cannot impart
   consolation to others without, at the same time, enjoying it, yourself,
   in some measure, at any rate. You put out your hands to open the door
   into the King's banqueting house for another and, lo, your own fingers
   drip with sweet-smelling myrrh, from the handle of the door! Try to
   cheer another heart and you will go the nearest way to cheer your own.
   So then, I am glad that I have a text like this--only the gladness is
   sobered and saddened by the connection in which it stands and by the
   almost hopeless character of the question--"Where shall I seek
   comforters for you?"

   I shall have only two divisions, tonight. First, sometimes, our work is
   very easy. Secondly, at other times, it becomes so hard as even to be
   impossible.

   I. First, SOMETIMES OUR WORK IS VERY EASY, especially to those long
   practiced in it. To a young surgeon, a case of a broken bone may be a
   difficulty, but to one who has long been in his profession, it is a
   simple matter and he soon sets the bone.

   Now, first, it is a comparatively easy thing to find comforts for true
   children of God in the day of their adversity. Dark days come to the
   brightest saints. A Christian may, perhaps, enjoy worldly prosperity
   for a long time and then the tide may turn, and the man may find all
   that he has melt away before his eyes. Nothing that he does may
   succeed. He may be brought very low, even to poverty. In such a case as
   that, it is not hard to comfort the child of God, for the Lord helps
   him to say, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the
   name of the Lord." My Brother, your riches consist not in gold and
   silver--you have in Heaven a more enduring portion and if God, by
   impoverishing you of these grosser things, enriches you with more
   refined treasures, you will be a gainer--your loss will turn to your
   eternal profit. Therefore we comfort you readily enough with words like
   these.

   The same is true with God's people in bereavement. We come to them and
   tell them that it is the Lord who has done it and ask, "Shall He not do
   what seems good to Him?" In many cases we are able to tell them that
   they have not lost their relative or friend. Their beloved ones have
   only crossed the river a little before them and they will soon pass
   over the same stream and be forever joined where they shall part no
   more. Though it is some beloved child, or other dear relative, or even
   the partner of one's bosom, or a much-beloved friend, yet to find
   consolation for mourners of that kind is not the hardest work that the
   pastor has to do. Refrain your eyes from weeping, especially keep back
   your heart from tears. They shall come again from the land of their
   captivity. They die but to live forever and you shall meet them before
   long!

   And, dear Friends, it is not so very difficult to find comfort for
   children of God who are under the trial of persecution. There are still
   many of God's people who endure the trial of cruel mockings and
   something worse than that. Some of you

   have to suffer in many ways for Christ's sake. "Rejoice, and be
   exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted
   they the Prophets which were before you." Let not this trouble
   you--Christ has provided abundant consolation for all who suffer with
   Him, for they shall reign with Him forever and ever. They shall be--

   "Brightest of the saints in light,

   'Midst the bright ones doubly bright." They shall receive larger palms
   and brighter crowns than others who have suffered less for His dear
   name's sake. We do not say about these dear Christians, "Where shall I
   seek comforters for you?" for we know where to point them to most
   effectual consolation!

   Sometimes, we have to deal with fainting Christians, yet when we meet
   with them we do not find their case one of superlative difficulty.
   Every now and then, I suppose, almost all of us get into a condition in
   which our joy and comfort have to be looked for and can scarcely be
   found. Partly through ill-health, partly from the strain of high
   excitement, which is followed by a reaction, we got to be like Elijah,
   when he said, "Now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than
   my fathers." There are times when the pulse scarcely beats and the
   blood begins to cool and the heart is faint. Beloved, whenever we meet
   with you in that condition, we tell you that we have been in that
   state, ourselves. No, we remind you that our Lord, Himself, was in an
   agony and was greatly depressed in spirit. We have to assure you that
   the condition of your frames and feelings does not affect your safety
   in Christ. We have to remind you that, though you are changed, God is
   not changed. The promise, the Old Covenant, stands just as fast when
   you are down in distress as when you are on the high places of
   exultation. You are saved by faith, not by feeling--and when feeling
   ebbs out to the very last degree, still hold on to Jesus--sink or swim,
   still trust in Him! When you see no trace of His actual Presence with
   you, rely upon Him, all the same, and be of good cheer. This is not
   hard to say--and when the Spirit of God is with us, we find no lack of
   consolation for fainting saints.

   Nor do we find ourselves much embarrassed by cases of disappointed
   workers. We hear them say, "Surely we have labored in vain and spent
   our strength for nothing. Who has believed our report? To whom is the
   arm of the Lord revealed?" But we tell them of many of God's saints who
   labored long without seeing any immediate results and yet they were
   accepted of God. Jeremiah, the plaintive, Weeping Prophet, saw the
   people reject everything that he said, yet he was not rejected, but
   accepted of God! And among honorable men, there is none more excellent
   than the Prophet Jeremiah. Beloved, you may be sent to warn a people
   who never will be saved and yet you will be blessed. When Isaiah saw
   the seraphim, and in answer to God's call, "Whom shall I send?" said,
   "Here am I; send me," remember what his commission was--he was sent,
   not to bring the people to God, but to go and say to them, "Hear you,
   indeed, but understand not; and see you, indeed, but perceive not. Make
   the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their
   eyes."

   He obeyed his commission as it was given to him and his Lord rewarded
   him. That may be your case. Besides, you are no judge of your own
   success! I think that it has been noticed by ministers, very often--so
   often as to be like a Baconian induction--that when we think that we
   preach worst, God usually blesses the people most, and that when we
   appear to have had the least power, God displays His ability more
   clearly than at other times! Therefore, when you go home weeping, while
   you have only sown in tears, you shall doubtless come again rejoicing,
   bringing your sheaves with you! But you are no judge of what you do,
   yourself, and you cannot tell what the results of your work may be. If
   you see them not, the angels may have seen them and while you are
   weeping, they are rejoicing! At any rate, you are not responsible for
   the harvest--you are responsible for plowing and sowing. If you have
   done your work well, in the fear of God, what comes of it rests with
   God--not with you!

   Sometimes, beloved Friends, we have the task of comforting dying
   Believers, and that is no very difficult thing. There is one whom I
   could mention to you who, not long ago, spent all that he had in taking
   a new business which he needed for his growing family. And he hoped to
   prosper in it. He had scarcely been in the house many weeks before his
   daughter was brought home to him and, when taken upstairs, she was
   found to be raving with madness! She was watched over carefully but, to
   the breaking of his heart, she had to be put away. Not long after,
   another, dear to his heart, was suddenly taken away. By-and-by, he,
   himself, fell ill and, at last, going to a physician, he was told that
   his case was a very serious one--he had better see a specialist. He saw
   the specialist, who told him that he had an internal cancer, that he
   might be operated upon, but that, in all probability, he would die
   under the operation. And he would advise him to live as long as he
   could.

   That happened not long ago. If I were to introduce him to you, what
   kind of a man would you expect him to be, with his bereavements and
   with his prospect of soon dying probably a very painful death? You
   would suppose that he would look very dull, haggard, and so forth.
   There is not a more cheerful person beneath the cover of Heaven! And
   when he crawled up to London, the other day, to do some business, and
   some persons wondered that he did it, he said, "While I can, I will do
   my best in the place where God has put me. When I can get out no more,
   I will sit still and praise God. And when the time comes, I will die
   with my face towards the New Jerusalem." That is how Christians live
   and that is how Christians die! We do not find, when we have to deal
   with a believer in Christ, that it is at all a difficult thing to cheer
   the heart either in the near or the distant prospect of death.

   Nor, dear Friends, do we find ourselves much troubled in seeking to
   comfort repenting backsliders. It is grievous that any should
   backslide. It is horrible that the Church of God should have her name
   disgraced, that the Christ of God should have His religion spattered by
   the iniquities of professing Christians. But when the Lord touches the
   wandering heart and it breaks under a sense of guilt--and the man turns
   back to his God, we find it easy to say, "The Lord delights in mercy.
   Return, you backsliding children! God is willing to receive you, He is
   waiting to bless you." The Word of God is full of consolation to
   backsliders who are seeking His face. Guilty as you are, the Lord says,
   "Return unto Me, for I am married to you." He might well divorce you,
   but the Lord, the God of Jacob, says that He hates putting away. He
   will not cast off the people of His choice! He is glad to receive them
   back after all their uncleanness and filthiness. Yes, there is much
   comfort for returning backsliders and if there are any such here,
   tonight, I would put out my hand and say, "Come back, my Brother, my
   Sister--come and welcome to the Savior."

   And certainly there is no difficulty in trying to comfort seeking
   sinners. If any man is seeking the Savior, the Savior is seeking him--

   "Your seeking His face Is all of His Grace""

   He has begun with you, or else you would not have begun with Him, and
   now, if you will simply trust Him, only trust Him, you shall have
   immediate peace! "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life."
   That is a glorious passage. "He that believes on Him is not condemned,"
   is another blessed phase of the same comforting Truth of God. If you
   have received Christ, to you He gives the power to become one of the
   sons of God, "even to them that believe on His name." There is a whole
   hive full of real honey for a soul that comes to Christ! You may even
   dip your hand in it, if you will, and eat as much sweetness as you
   please, for you will never exhaust it.

   Thus I have explained how, sometimes, in seeking comforters, our work
   is easy.

   II. But, dear Friends, AT OTHER TIMES IT BECOMES SO HARD AS TO BE
   IMPOSSIBLE. Nahum says, concerning Nineveh, "Where shall I seek
   comforters for you?"

   Assyria, of which Nineveh was the capital, was an empire which existed
   entirely for itself. No Assyrian monarch ever thought of what would be
   for the good of the nations that he conquered. I should think that if
   anybody ever mentioned such a thing, he would have laughed at him, or
   he would have put out his eyes, or cut off his head! There was no idea
   that anybody else had any rights at all except the king of Assyria, for
   even his subjects were simply his puppets, destroyed by his will and
   pleasure. And Assyria was thus the incarnation of pure, or rather of
   impure selfishness. Well, when a selfish man goes down as Nineveh did,
   who comforts him? He never did anybody any good and he may say, if he
   likes, "I care for nobody, and nobody cares for me." It is very hard,
   indeed, to say anything by way of comfort to a man who is broken down
   and who never cared for other people. Do not get into that state of
   mind, I pray you, dear Friends. I believe that selfishness is the
   front-door key of despair, for it never did any good to anybody. So,
   when it gets into trouble, nobody brings it comfort and everybody says,
   Who will bemoan you? "Where shall I seek comforters for you?"

   The Assyrians also dealt very cruelly with others. On the great stones
   that Mr. Layard brought home, there are awful pictures of what was
   being done with the captives, heaps of heads cut off from men who had
   been taken in war, eyes gouged out, and all sorts of dreadful things
   with which I will not horrify you. And, consequently, when that cruel
   power was put down, who would wish to seek comfort for it? Oh, that we
   may be prevented from ever being cruel to others! If we are cruel to
   others, when our turn comes, there will be no comfort for us. These
   people plundered every nation wherever they went. They took away
   everything that they could and left them penniless. They devoured the
   fruits of the

   ground and cared nothing what desolation they left behind. And when the
   time came for them to be robbed and their capital to be despoiled,
   nobody thought of comforting them. They were left to reap what they had
   sown.

   Besides that, they were famous for their pride, and that pride rose up
   into blasphemy. Remember how the Assyrian messenger, Rabshakeh, defied
   Jehovah? He said, "Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arphad? Who are
   they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their
   country out of my hands that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of
   my hand?" So, when their corpses were all piled up in the streets, no
   nation wept for them, nobody cared for them. Oh, dear Friends, conduct
   your business in such a way that you do not crush the poor! Manage
   everything in such a way that you rob nobody. Be straight. Be just. Be
   kind. "Live and let live," or else, if your turn to fall should come,
   one of these days, nobody will bemoan you, or be sorry for you! If you
   lift up your hand in proud blasphemy against God and He brings you down
   to the dust, you will be quoted as an instance of how the Justice of
   God overtakes the proud. The Lord keep us from all this! I cannot help
   mentioning it because it is in the chapter and has to do with the text.
   It is much better that you and I should go humbly on in laborious
   poverty and find our way to Heaven with good repute, than that we
   should become, even, kings of the earth and lords of all her
   wealth--and after all should be found to have lived only for self and
   to have cared for none besides--for then our downfall will be terrible
   in the day of the Lord's vengeance.

   But, besides this, there are other people whom we cannot comfort. There
   is a man in a good deal of trouble about his soul, so he says. He comes
   to me and, on talking with him, and probing him a bit, I find that he
   is living in the commission of a known sin. He says that he cannot
   believe. He cannot pray. He cannot get comfort. Of course he cannot
   while he indulges any known sin! "Where shall we find comforters for
   you?" God will not forgive you while you continue in that sin! Christ
   will not cleanse you from the guilt of it while you continue in the
   practice of it! You must part with sin, or we cannot comfort you. We
   will not even try to do so!

   And, next, there are some who do not get any comfort, though they have
   left off sin, because they have never made restitution. If you have
   robbed or wronged anybody, when you come to Christ, do what Zaccheus
   did, who said that if he had taken anything from any man by false
   pretense, he would restore him four-fold. There was a minister in this
   city, a dear friend of mine, who preached a sermon upon the necessity
   of restitution when wrong had been done, and some of his friends told
   him that if he preached in that way he would drive the people away.
   But, during the week, he met in the street a man of about his own age,
   who said to him, "Were you not in Messrs. So-and-So's warehouse once?"
   "Yes, I was." Did you not lose a watch while you were there?" "Yes, I
   did." Well, I was there at the same time. Do you remember me?" "What is
   your name? Oh, yes, I remember your name!" "I stole your watch. I came
   to hear you last Sunday night and I cannot rest till I have given you
   ten pounds to make restitution for that watch." "No," said my friend,
   "I do not want money." "But I must make restitution," said the other.

   At last my friend explained that the watch was not worth ten pounds,
   though it might have been worth four. So the man gave him the four
   pounds--and he came back to his critics, and said--"I have made four
   pounds profit by that sermon, whatever you may have thought of it. I
   had forgotten all about my lost watch, but my sermon has brought me
   back the money for it." The man who thus made restitution is now, I
   believe, an honorable Christian man. I do not see how he could have
   been so with that watch on his conscience, and I do not believe that,
   do what we may, we can give comfort to people who have wronged others
   till, to their very utmost, they have made restitution! How shall I
   comfort you, if you repent not of your robbery, but keep the proceeds
   of it?

   Again, there is another sort of people whom we cannot comfort, people
   who seem very concerned to get pardon, but when you come to understand
   them, you discover that they are living in enmity against somebody--a
   brother, a mother-in-law, a cousin, or a friend whom they will not
   forgive. They keep on harboring hatred in their minds. I am grieved to
   say that it is not altogether an unusual thing to find fathers who will
   not forgive a daughter, or a son. They did not happen to marry the
   person you would have liked to choose for them and, of course, you have
   a perfect right, have you not, to make the selection for them? You
   thought you had a right to pick for yourself, but you will not give
   that right to your children--so you have a grudge against them on that
   account--and then you go whining to God to forgive you and yet you will
   not forgive your daughter! Here you are on your knees, crying, "Lord
   have mercy upon me," yet you will not have mercy upon that friend who
   once did you wrong and whom you ought to have forgiven long ago! Now,
   remember, that it is of no use for you to pray, or do anything else if
   you will not, from your heart forgive those who have offended you--for
   neither will God, even for Christ's sake--forgive you! There must be a
   clean sweep of everything like enmity

   out of your heart, or else you cannot be at peace with God. Enmity
   cannot lie down with love! Darkness cannot weld with light! You cannot
   enter into the peace of God till you are willing to forgive others.
   There are many people who get hung up on that nail--I wish they could
   get released from it, by God's Grace.

   We meet with some also who profess to be very anxious to be saved.
   Perhaps I have some such here, tonight, and yet they do not pray. You
   rise in the morning and you go to bed at night without a prayer! And
   all day long God is not at all in your thoughts. Do you expect, then,
   to be saved by accident? Do you really reckon that, one of these days,
   as you walk down the street, salvation will drop on you, whether you
   will or not? Beloved, if you desire this great Gift of God, ask for it!
   "He that asks, receives." If you want to find this treasure, look for
   it! "He that seeks, finds." If you would get Heaven's door opened, I
   pray you, use the knocker! "To him that knocks, it shall be opened." No
   prayer, no Bible-reading, no going to hear the Word of God with the
   earnest intent to find out what the way of salvation is, why, dear me,
   how can you escape if you neglect so great a salvation? You are
   evidently living in constant neglect! Nobody ever prospers in business
   who does not pay attention to it and no man can expect to enter into
   peace with God when he goes on in a sort of slipshod way, going
   sometimes to a place of worship, occasionally feeling a little earnest,
   but never seeking the Lord with his whole heart! You will have to be
   awakened out of this fatal lethargy! May the Spirit of God awaken you
   this very night! Resolve that you will not let the Angel go unless He
   bless you. May the great Master bring you to that state of mind at
   once!

   There are others, and these are the people we have so often to deal
   with, who feel their sin and who really wish to be saved--and they do a
   great deal in the hope of being saved--but there is one thing they will
   not do. They will not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. They try to be
   saved by their prayers, as if there was any promise that God would save
   us for our praying. They try Bible-reading, for in the Scriptures they
   think they have eternal life--but they forget that eternal life is not
   in the Bible except as the Bible testifies of Christ and points to
   Christ--Christ is eternal life! They have been christened, they have
   been confirmed, they are members of churches and so on, and there they
   rest! No, they do not "rest." They feel that there is still something
   needed which they have not yet obtained. That which is needed, my
   Friend, is that you should come and--

   "Cast your deadly doing down, Down at Jesus' feet,"

   and trust in what He has done and then are you saved. That is the whole
   philosophy of salvation!

   There are two ways of salvation. The one is self-salvation, and it is a
   dream, an empty thing, an awful disappointment. The other is Christ's
   salvation--come, and put yourself wholly into His hands and say, "Save
   me, Lord. By profession, You are a Savior. Execute Your holy craft upon
   me and save me. Save me from my sin, the guilt of it. Save me from
   sinning, the practice of it. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
   purify me from the love of evil and make me clean. You can do it, and
   You, alone, can do it." Now, if you trust the Savior, you are saved. I
   will repeat again that declaration of Christ, "He that believes on the
   Son has everlasting life." But if you will not believe, I know of
   nothing whereby I can comfort you. If you will not have Christ, there
   remains nothing but condemnation for you! There can be no other
   Sacrifice for sin. You have insulted God by rejecting His Son and you
   must go before your God unsaved and unforgiven. Beware of such a doom
   as that!

   Sometimes we have to feel what an awful thing it would be if we had to
   deal with a soul that was eternally lost. Then, indeed, we might say,
   in the language of our text, each word dripping with tears of blood,
   "Where shall I seek comforters for you?" Will any of my Hearers be
   lost? Will any here die without Christ? Will any here refuse the great
   salvation to the last? If so, what comfort could I administer to such?
   I shall have, on the contrary, to put it thus--"You know the way of
   salvation, but you chose the other road, yes, chose it deliberately.
   And if you have come into the place of wrath and death, who shall
   bemoan you? Who shall comfort you?" You made your choice and you must
   have your choice forever. All that you will suffer in the next world
   will be the fruit of your own sin. Hell is sin fully ripe. Drunkenness,
   lechery, dishonesty, lying, enmity--when these come to seed, they make
   Hell! They pain men enough in this world. And if the softening
   influences of Christianity were taken away and men were just left in
   the world to act according to their own passions and their own lusts,
   that would be all the Hell they would need!

   You will have to feel forever, in every pang that you endure, "This is
   nothing but my old sin." Whenever you are overwhelmed with woe in the
   next world, and look your own woe in the face, you will say to
   yourself, "Why, that is what

   I used to call, 'pleasure,' and it has come to me here in this shape!
   And I was told that I would say that. I was warned and yet I perished,
   despite the warning." If you are lost, my Hearers, you will have
   refused the great Sacrifice of which you know, for to the best of my
   power, in the simplest words that I could find, I have set forth Christ
   among you evidently crucified--and I have said, "There is your only
   hope of salvation. Look to Jesus and live." If you will not have God's
   Gift. If you put far from you the Christ who alone has life eternal,
   you need not wonder when He leaves you to yourselves!

   Besides, in that day some of you will especially have to remember how
   you stifled conscience. You have gone into some worldly pleasure on
   purpose to silence the voice of conscience. Sometimes, sitting in this
   House, you have been almost brought to decision. You have said, "Please
   God, when I get home, I will seek my chamber, and fall upon my knees
   before Him in prayer." How often have you been brought very near the
   Kingdom of God and how terrible is it to be so near and then
   deliberately to turn back! Your blood will be upon your own heads and,
   truly, if it is so, "where shall I seek comforters for you?" Some of
   you would not be persuaded. You have had a mother's tearful admonition.
   Teachers have pleaded with and for you in the most earnest way. You
   have had judgments, too, from God--sicknesses that have shaken every
   bone of your body! You have been brought to feel that there is a God
   and that He would deal with you. Remember that solemn prophecy, "He
   that being often reproved hardens his neck, shall suddenly be
   destroyed, and that without remedy."

   I sometimes start in my sleep at the thought of one of my Hearers being
   in Hell. Ah, Sirs, if you do not care about your own souls, we, at
   least, will care about them for you! How can I be clear of the blood of
   you all, so many of you, and so often addressed? Do you wonder that I
   am often distressed beyond measure at my own position? It were better
   for me to have broken stones on the road than to have preached to you
   if I have been unfaithful to your souls! For then, in the next world,
   you will curse me and it shall be my Hell to bear the reproaches that
   you shall justly fling at me. But I beseech you, by the living God, and
   as you believe yourselves to be immortal beings, accept, tonight, His
   way of salvation, so simple and so easy!

   "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
   and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him, and
   to our God, for He will abundantly pardon." "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and you shall be saved." "He that believes and is
   baptized"--which is the Christian method, the Biblical method of
   confessing your faith--"He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved; but he that believes not shall be damned."

   I leave you all in God's hands. Pray, dear Christian people, that
   everyone who has heard me, tonight, may be saved, and that this rainy
   night may be, indeed, memorable as the night in which many a sinner
   cried--

   "I do believe, I will believe,

   That Jesus died for me!

   That on the Cross

   He shed His blood,

   For sin to set me free."

   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. NAHUM 2:11-13,3.

   This is a prophecy of the destruction of Nineveh. Remember that Assyria
   had been one of the great powers that swayed the world--a cruel,
   tyrannical empire--and God at last determined to destroy Nineveh which
   was its seat of government. In a high poetical strain, the Prophet
   cries out,

   Nahum 2:11. Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place
   of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the
   lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? You will remember how Mr.
   Layard took out of the ruins at Nineveh those immense lions that now
   stand in the British Museum. They were the very type of this great
   empire that boasted itself in its lion-like strength and ferocity. So
   the Prophet cries, "Where is the lair of the lion?"

   12. The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled
   for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with
   ravin. They were always destroying and plundering, and carrying home
   the spoil, so that everybody was fattened with the plunder of the
   nations.

   13. Behold, I am against you, says the LORD of Hosts. And whenever that
   is the case, a man does not need any other adversary! If God is against
   you, O my dear Hearer, what will become of you? Though you should have
   all the power of the world and possess robust health, abundant riches
   and keen wit, what can you do against God? "I am against you, says
   Jehovah of Hosts." He throws down the gauntlet to Nineveh.

   13. And I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall
   devour your young lions: and I will cut off your prey from the earth,
   and the voice of your messengers shall no more be heard. It is time
   that they were stopped. You remember in what foul-mouthed language
   Rabshakeh addressed King Hezekiah and God now declares that there shall
   be no more such letters as his. God may allow evil to lord it over His
   people for a while, but He puts a hook in the mouth of the leviathan,
   by-and-by. He that restrains the sea and the waves thereof, Jehovah is
   His name, and He restrains the wickedness of men!

   Nahum 3:1. Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery;
   the prey departs not. Assyria became a great empire through violence,
   falsehood and robbery. The soldiers had no respect for justice. They
   trod out the last spark of liberty and crushed all nations under their
   feet.

   2, 3. The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels,
   and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots. The horseman
   lifts up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a
   multitude of slain, and a great number of carcasses; and there is no
   end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses. When the
   Medo-Babylonian army came against the great city, it inflicted a
   terrible slaughter, killing the inhabitants without mercy, making a
   very holocaust of human bodies. But, inasmuch as it was a den of
   criminals, this horrible execution was well deserved. Yet is the story
   dreadful.

   4, 5. Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well favored
   harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that sells nations through her
   whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. Behold, I am against
   you, says the LORD of Hosts. These people had been steeped in sin of
   the worst kind. They had led other nations into it and had practiced
   the witchcrafts which God abhors. Therefore, again, Jehovah says, "I am
   against you." When God is in arms against a triumphant nation, He soon
   makes an end of it.

   5, 6. And I will discover your skirts upon your face, and I will show
   the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame. And I will
   cast abominable filth upon you, and make you vile, and will set you as
   a gazing stock. See what God can do! They were the proudest of the
   proud and now He makes them the scorn of the scorner, and sets them as
   a gazing stock. May God never deal in that way with any proud man,
   here! He can easily do it--when we set ourselves up to be little gods,
   He can soon make us utterly mean and contemptible--and bring us down to
   nothing at all. It is His way to deal thus with the proud.

   7. And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon you shall
   flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?
   Where shall I seek comforters for you? If you could go, today, and see
   the vast heaps of Kouyunjik, and of the great monuments of that mighty
   city all destroyed and crumbling into powder, you would know something
   of what God can do! It does not look likely to you that London can ever
   become a heap of ruins and yet it may be, for its sins reek up to
   Heaven as the sins of Nineveh did! The Lord can strike this city as He
   smote that.

   8. Are you better than populous No Amon, that was situated among the
   rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea,
   and her wall was from the sea? The Prophet quotes the destruction of
   the city called No Amon, probably Thebes, as an instance of what God
   can do.

   9. Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite. There
   seemed to be no measure to her strength. If she needed assistance from
   other nations, she had only to call them in and the mercenary tribes
   were ready to defend her.

   9, 10. Put and Lubim were your helpers. Yet was she carried away, she
   went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at
   the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honorable men,
   and all her great men were bound in chains. So one city is a warning to
   another. No Amon in Egypt is a warning to Nineveh in Assyria, and both
   of these a warning to our city, and a warning to every man who is
   proud, haughty, domineering and oppressive to the poor--great in his
   own wisdom and careless for the comfort of others!

   11. You also shall be drunken: you shall be hid, you also shall seek
   strength because of the enemy. Nineveh never dreamed of doing that! She
   said, "I am a queen, I shall see no sorrow! I am the greatest of all
   cities."

   12. All your strongholds shall be like fig trees with the first-ripe
   figs: if they are shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the
   eater. As figs do when they are ripe. These castles, towers,
   fortresses, built to stand the siege, would be no sooner attacked than
   they would fall into the hands of the enemy!

   13. Behold, your people in the midst of you are women. You see, on
   those great Assyrian stones, the strong men that are sculptured, there,
   with their enormous muscles, telling of gigantic force. When God came
   to deal with them, they became weak and cowardly.

   13, 14. The gates of your land shall be set wide open unto your
   enemies: the fire shall devour your bars. Draw you waters for the
   siege. The Prophet challenges them to defend themselves.

   14. Fortify your strongholds: go into clay, and tread the mortar, make
   strong the brick kiln. That was to mend the walls whenever they were
   broken. They did this with great industry. "Do it," says God, "yet you
   shall not be able to stand."

   15-17. There shall the fire devour you; the sword shall cut you off, it
   shall eat you up like the cankerworm: make yourself many as the
   cankerworm, make yourself many as the locusts. You have multiplied your
   merchants above the stars of Heaven: the cankerworm spoils, and flees
   away. Your crowned are as the locusts, and your captains as the great
   grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the
   sun arises they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
   What marvelous poetry is this! How terrible! Their soldiers, their
   rulers, their captains, were as many as the locusts and the
   grasshoppers, but when they were needed, all these hosts would flee
   away. What cannot God do when He comes out to fight with men? "The Lord
   is a man of war; the Lord is His name." He brings confusion to His
   enemies. Oh, fight not against Him! Beloved, let us be at peace with
   Him, the strong and mighty God. Let us confess our faults to Him,
   acquaint ourselves with Him and be at peace.

   18. Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria. They who should have
   taken care of the people, the chief governors, neglected them. They who
   should have defended the people were out of the way when they were
   needed--"Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria."

   18. Your nobles shall dwell in the dust: your people are scattered upon
   the mountains, and no man gathers them. Let not the same be said of
   London. Are there any who can say, "No man cares for my soul"? Let them
   not be without a helper--

   "Oh, come, let us go and find them!

   In the paths of death they roam.

   At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say,

   'I have brought some lost one home.'"

   Brothers and Sisters, awaken yourselves--be shepherds to the people of
   this modem Nineveh and seek to gather the scattered flock of Christ!

   19. There is no healing of your bruise; your wound is grievous. Thank
   God we have not come to that point--yet there is still healing for the
   bruised sinner! Though the wounds of our people are grievous, there is
   a balm for them! We know where it is and what it is--let us not be slow
   to tell them about it.

   19. All that hear bruit of you shall clap the hands over you. I think
   that is the old Norman-French word, "bruit," signifying noise or
   tumult, that has been left in our Bible.

   19. For upon whom has not your wickedness passed continually? Nineveh
   had been so wicked and had done so much evil that when men heard that
   it was destroyed, they would even clap their hands for very joy that
   such an evil-doer was out of the way! I know not to what purpose I was
   moved to read this passage, but it is specially meant for someone, to
   whom may God apply it by his Spirit!

Obedience Rewarded

   (No. 2323)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, AUGUST 27, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   1, 1889.

   "And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy;
   and did run to bringHis disciples word. And as they went to tell His
   disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and
   held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him. Then said Jesus unto them, Be
   not afraid: go tell My brethren to go into Galilee, and there shall
   they see Me." Matthew 28:8-10.

   THESE holy women, these consecrated Maries, shall be our instructors
   tonight. They were highly-favored to be the first witnesses for our
   risen Lord! Do you wonder why He chose them? Was it because their
   hearts were tender and they were very sad at His death, more sad than
   the men? And is He not known to come, first, to those who need Him most
   and to pour in oil and wine where the wound gapes widest? It may be so.
   Was it because they had been the more faithful of the two and, while
   some men had denied Him and all had forsaken Him, the women were last
   at Golgotha, as they were now, first, at the sepulcher? Did their Lord
   reward them by dealing with them as they had dealt with Him? That is
   but His pattern. "If you will walk contrary unto Me, then will I also
   walk contrary unto you," said the Lord to Israel. And He also said, "I
   love them that love Me; and those that seek Me early shall find Me."
   These holy women did seek their Lord early on the morning of His
   Resurrection and they found Him to a certainty before all others! Was
   this because Jesus had found the women more spiritual than the
   Apostles? Certainly, I think that was the case. They had attained the
   very climax of love, washing His feet with their tears. They had
   reached the very center of discipleship--one of them had chosen the
   good part, and sat at His feet. Sometimes, where there is less power of
   understanding, Jesus does give keener powers of perception, and though
   Mary Magdalene and the other Mary would never have become Pauls, yet
   they were of quick eye, like John, and were, therefore, the most fit to
   see the Savior in the dawning of the morning--and so they were
   permitted to have the first glimpse of Him.

   At any rate, be it how it may, they were the first to see their risen
   Lord--and we will try to learn something from them, tonight. It should
   be an encouragement to those members of the Church of Christ who are
   neither pastors nor teachers that, if they live very near to God, they
   may yet teach pastors and teachers! Get clear views of your Lord, as
   did these holy women who had no office in the Church, and yet taught
   the officers, for they were sent to bear to the Apostles the tidings
   that Jesus Christ had risen from the dead! Not first to them who were
   the heads of the Church, as it were, but first of all to lowly women
   did the Lord appear--and the Apostles, themselves, had to go to school
   to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to learn that great Truth of God,
   "The Lord is risen, indeed." We will go to school with the Apostles,
   tonight, and may the Lord grant that while we learn from these holy
   women, He who taught them may come and teach us! May He who met them
   meet with us in this House of Prayer tonight!

   First, I ask you to look at these women in the way of obedience active.
   They ran to bring the disciples word. Secondly, look at them in the way
   of obedience rewarded, for, as they went to tell His disciples, Jesus
   met them. And then, thirdly, we will go back to the point where we
   started and see these women in the way of obedience refreshed, for,
   after they had seen the Lord, they persevered in their heavenly errand
   and still went to tell His disciples that He would go before them into
   Galilee--and that there they should see Him.

   I. First, then, notice these women IN THE WAY OF ODEDIENCE ACTIVE.

   They had gone to the sepulcher to see and also to embalm the body of
   Christ, but while they were there, an angel appeared to them and
   committed to them this charge, "Go quickly, and tell His disciples that
   He is risen from the dead."

   And they went upon their errand with most commendable alacrity. Now,
   you and I, dear Friends, must try to imitate them. What you have seen,
   you must tell! What you have been taught, you must teach! To you,
   Believer, has been committed the Oracle of God. See that you keep it!
   Hold it fast and hold it forth. You have not this Light of God for
   yourself, alone, but that it may shine before men. See to this. Perhaps
   these women may help you in so doing.

   Observe first, then, that they went about their errand not doubting the
   Revelation. The angel said to them, "Tell His disciples that He is
   risen from the dead and, behold, He goes before you into Galilee." They
   did not stop to ask any question, to make any objections, to utter any
   critical doubts--they believed. Now, it is to be thus with you--you
   cannot be a messenger from God unless you believe. If you do not
   believe the Gospel, do not pretend to preach it! Go home, my dear
   Friends, and bury your head in your doubts, twist your brains about,
   tie them up into knots and amuse yourself as you like--but do not
   pretend to go and tell that of which you are not, yourself, sure!
   Otherwise, you will lack the accent of confidence and, consequently,
   you will lack the power of persuasion. He that is not firm, himself,
   cannot move others. If there is no fulcrum for your lever, where is
   your power? "I believed; therefore have I spoken," said the Psalmist,
   and he did well, for there must first be the believing and then the
   speaking. Leave the message to another if you are not sure of it--let
   another who is sure of it tell it until you, too, are sure of it--then
   may you also run with good tidings from your Lord! These godly women
   leaped at once into the full conviction that Christ was risen and,
   therefore, they hastened to tell the tidings to the disciples.

   And, again, they obeyed, not discussing their authority to go and
   proclaim this news. What use is it if I believe the Truth of God and
   yet am not empowered to teach it? According to some, I can only be
   authorized by some special cere-mony--I must undergo certain processes
   before I may be permitted to preach. But the angel said to these women,
   "Go and tell," and they went to tell. They did not hesitate. They asked
   no question about Apostolic succession, or Episcopal ordination, or
   anything of the kind! They were told to go and they went. Have you
   heard Jesus speak to you? Do you know His love? Have you an inward
   persuasion that you have to tell your friends what great things He has
   done for you? Then go in this, your might! If you have any hesitancy
   about your right to labor for your Lord. If you doubt that passage,
   "Let him that hears say, Come," then do not go, for, if you do not
   believe that you have a right to go, your going will be with an inward
   weakness--and you will be taken up rather with yourself than with your
   message--and with the heart of Him to whom you carry it.

   I love to hear men say that they must do this and that, for only that
   which is done under the imperious necessity of a Divine impulse will
   ever be followed by any great result. If you can live without preaching
   the Gospel, live without preaching it, for if God has sent you, you
   will say with Paul, "Woe is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel!" And
   you, my Sister, if you are sent to do any work for God and have a
   yearning to win souls and a fire in your bones which cannot be
   restrained--you could no more be stayed from speaking of Jesus than the
   sun can be stayed from shining in mid Heaven! May God grant that we may
   have among us many who, in going forth to work for Christ, are sure
   about what they have to tell and sure about their authority to tell it!

   This being so with these women, we notice, next, that they went on
   their errand not declining on account of weakness. They might have
   said, "Oh, we are not the people to go to the Apostles!" Mary Magdalene
   might have said, "You know what I used to be. Would you have me go and
   talk to John, and James, and Peter?" Indeed, the holy women might at
   once have refused the commission and said, "We do not feel ourselves
   qualified. We have a natural timidity and modesty which put it out of
   the question that we should go on such a service as this." But not a
   word of that kind did they utter--and, dear Brothers and Sisters, while
   souls are dying, dare we hesitate on account of weakness? Do you not
   think that it is the man who is most conscious of weakness who is
   usually the chosen man for the Lord's service? Did not Moses wish to
   decline the office of leader of Israel because he was slow of speech?
   Did not Isaiah cry, "Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
   unclean lips"?

   And if you are conscious of weakness as great as that of these godly
   women, or greater, even, than theirs, yet I still say that the pressure
   of human necessity and the pressure of the Divine message should be so
   heavy upon you that you should say, "I will go even as did the lepers
   of old, when they had found out the plenty that there was in the camp
   of the Syrians and knew of the sore famine in Samaria." They could not
   sit still, but all over with leprosy as they were, they must go to the
   king's household and tell them that there was bread enough and to
   spare--and that the people need not die of hunger! Oh, yes, we must go!
   Even we must go! The time may have been when only the choice and pick
   of the

   Church were needed for holy service, but these times are not now. When
   sin abounds, when error rages, when the faithful are but few, then
   every man--and every woman and even every babe in Grace, must speak, or
   lisp, or prattle the good news that Christ is risen from the dead and
   is able to save and bless!

   Then, dear Friends, as these women were not detained from this work by
   a sense of weakness, so they obeyed not held back by curiosity. They
   might have stayed to look at the sepulcher. They were invited to come
   and see the place where the Lord lay and, like the two disciples, they
   might have gone in and observed how the napkin was laid by itself, and
   the linen cloths were folded. I think that if you and I had had the
   opportunity of looking into that wonderful sepulcher where the Lord
   lay, we would have liked to linger there all through that day, to
   worship and adore! But no curiosity-- no, no devotion--kept them at the
   sepulcher when they once had the command to go and tell the disciples
   that Christ was risen from the dead! Now, these days are full of
   temptation. We have a thousand fields for curiosity to wander in. How
   shall we settle this debate? How shall we answer that criticism? Every
   day brings to light some fresh objection, some new theory. Shall we
   stop till we have answered every objection, till we have destroyed
   every theory? No, my Brothers, we cannot afford to stop. Let others
   debate--we must declare! Let others discuss--we must proclaim that
   Jesus Christ has come into the world to save sinners! Sinners, look to
   Him and, looking, you shall live! We must make this the burden of our
   daily conversation, the constant theme of our talk-- "Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners, even the very chief of them." We must
   keep to this! As these women were not turned aside to make any curious
   observation, so must not we be--we must keep to our one work of telling
   His disciples where to look for Him and bidding them follow

   Him.

   And, dear Friends, again, I want you to notice that they were not
   hampered by their emotions. It is a very blessed thing, sometimes, to
   have an opportunity of indulging your emotions. These women were
   subject to the influences of two opposite currents, "fear and great
   joy." Fear put wings to their heels and great joy seemed to lend them
   extra speed. By the two, together, they ran to bring the disciples
   word. It may be very pleasant to get alone and spend much time in close
   communion with Christ--the more of it the better. It may be well to
   practice introspection until you see the evil of your heart and are
   filled with fear. It may be well to look up and see the beauties of
   your Lord and the glories of His Advent until you are filled with great
   joy. But neither of these must be allowed to keep you away from actual
   service and the continual telling out of the Gospel of Christ! I have
   known it to be the case.

   I remember a good man who was a great authority on the Book of
   Revelation. I am sorry to say that, great as he was on the Revelation,
   his influence was very bad on his children at home. He knew all about
   the seven trumpets, but he did not know much about the seven boys and
   girls he had at home--so they grew up very badly. Never break the
   balance of holy emotions and sacred duties! Let us have our fear and
   our great joy but, at the same time, we must not sit down because we
   have great joy--we must run on the Lord's errand--joy and all. Let us
   run as fast as we can, whether we fear or whether we rejoice. Learn
   that lesson from these godly women. You feel very dull--go to your
   Bible-class. You feel as if you had done no good for a long time--go on
   in the Lord's work. But God has greatly blessed you and you are getting
   rather old and you need rest--go on with your work--run to bring the
   disciples word whether you feel fear or joy. Stand over your work, be
   in-stant--standing over it, in season and out of season, constant and
   instant in the service of your blessed Lord and Master! If you are not,
   these holy women will put you to shame and I must send you to this
   dames' school, old as you are, to learn a little lesson from these
   godly dames as to how you ought to serve God.

   Once more, notwithstanding all that might have been said to make their
   footsteps slow, we find that they were not hindered by propriety or
   indifference. They traveled to their work as quickly as they
   could--"and did run to bring His disciples word." Now, one hardly likes
   to think of Mary Magdalene and that other Mary running! My good Sisters
   here are, many of them, very diligent in their service, but they do not
   forget that there is a kind of reputable pace for ladies-- yet these
   holy women ran! They will get out of breath by running! Never mind.
   Never mind! "They did run to bring His disciples word." We are great
   slaves to propriety, are we not, the most of us? The other day a
   Brother called out in the middle of a sermon. And on another morning, a
   Sister exclaimed while I was preaching--and some of you thought that it
   was very improper, did you not?

   Well, I suppose that it was, but I was very glad of it and I did not
   see the slightest objection to the impropriety when I felt that the
   Truth of God that was being preached was enough to make the stones
   speak! Why should not those persons cry out? When you are about the
   Lord's work, you know that it is well to be very quiet and calm and
   take things steadily.

   That is well. But sometimes we can do better than well. We have the
   steam up and we cannot help it--and we have to go ahead and we must go.
   Thus these godly women were running along. They will put their garments
   out of shape! They will spoil the look of their faces! I do not know
   what will not happen, but they do not care about that. "They did run to
   bring His disciples word." How often have I seen it, in the country,
   when somebody has stepped into a cottage--perhaps it has been the
   minister, or some dear Christian friend, and the good woman has
   said--"I must run and fetch in my neighbor," and she has rushed out of
   the door, down the front garden, across the street and she has brought
   her sister or her friend to come and hear the good Word of God! And she
   has never thought that it was at all improper for her to do

   it!

   Dear Friends, in the service of God, impropriety is often piety. It was
   said that Mr. Rowland Hill, "rode upon the back of Order and Decorum."
   "Well," he said, "I will try to make that true," so he called his two
   horses, Order and Decorum and thus, if he did not ride on their backs,
   he made them pull him to and from Surrey Chapel! Order and decorum are
   hardly worth more than to be used as horses! They are very respectable
   animals, but sometimes disorder and the lack of decorum may be
   predicated of an earnest, zealous heart--and may be very much to the
   credit of that heart. "They did run to bring His disciples word."
   Brothers and Sisters, some of us ought to run, for we have not much
   time! We are getting gray, years are telling upon us, so let us run! We
   may not have many more opportunities--we may be kept to our bed, or
   tied to the house--let us run while we can! Sometimes we are warned not
   to do too much. Let us try to do too much! Let us be indiscreetly
   loving to our Lord! Let us run to bring the disciples word, even at the
   cost of putting ourselves out of breath!

   I think that we have now learned all that we need to learn from these
   good women about their being in the way of obedience, that is to say,
   if we have learned it--but have we learned it? Are all of you Christian
   people who are here, tonight, running on your Master's errands? Have
   all of you received a commission from Christ? Have you all had a
   message from Him? Are you carrying it? Some of you are strangers, here,
   this evening. Let me beg you not to live a single week without having
   something to do for your Lord, knowing what it is, and getting to it in
   the spirit of these holy women.

   II. But now, secondly, observe these holy women IN THE WAY OF OBEDIENCE
   REWARDED.

   First, they were rewarded by a most delightful visitation--"As they
   went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them." He has ways of
   meeting His disciples, now, in the power of His Spirit, manifesting
   Himself to them. There are some of His disciples who never get these
   visitations and I think that it is because they are not running to
   bring His disciples word. Nobody fidgets a busy person like an idle
   body. Have you ever had a servant doing some work for you and crawling
   about in such a way that you could hardly stand it? Well now, the Lord
   Jesus Christ does not feel at home with lazy Christians and I believe
   that He reserves His fellowship for the sufferers and the workers. When
   you are in the way of service, He will meet you. So you have not seen
   His face for a long time? Have you a class in the Sunday school? Are
   you a tract-distributor? Are you a preacher in the villages?

   "No, dear Sir, I do nothing of the sort." Well, then, I do not think
   that you will meet Him just yet, but I think that if you had a call to
   some of these good works, and you obeyed it, it is highly probable that
   you would then say, "Being in the way, the Lord met with me." Oh, yes,
   when you have love, joy and light in your heart, it will often happen
   that while you are talking about Christ to others, you will have a
   blessing come to your own soul! Many times has it occurred to the
   preacher that if he has not edified anybody else, he has preached
   himself into a right state of heart--and he is sure that he has had one
   hearer who was the better for the sermon! Beloved Christian Brothers
   and Sisters, especially Sisters, for the text, you see, comes from the
   Sisters and ought to go back to the Sisters--get into the path of duty
   if you world win this reward of a delightful visitation! You sometimes
   sing--

   "When will You come to me, Lord?" You can answer your own prayer, to a
   large, extent, by running upon your Lord's errands.

   The next reward these women received was a very cheering
   salutation--"Jesus met them, saying, All hail." I do not know whether
   it was in the Hebrew that He spoke. If so, I suppose that He uttered
   the usual salutation, "Peace be unto you!" As we get it in the Greek,
   one is inclined to think that He used the Greek language and spoke the
   word which signifies, "Rejoice! Joy be unto you!" Our translators very
   properly thought that the best thing they could do was to give you the
   old Saxon expression, "All hail! Health be to you! May you be in good
   health, may you be hale!" "All hail!" You know that we use the
   expression, "Hail fellow, well met!" Well, that indicates great
   sociability and, therefore, you can

   see the wrong of a Christian saying it to an ungodly man, but Christ
   comes to His people, and says, "All hail!" I often wonder that He ever
   used that word, since by it He was betrayed when the traitor said,
   "Hail, Master!" But yet it was His mother's word. Did not the angel
   Gabriel say to Mary, "Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is
   with you: blessed are you among women"? And He used it here, "All
   hail!" Well, when Jesus Christ comes to us with words of such
   endearment, such brotherhood, it ought to make us glad!

   Last Tuesday night I saw a Brother who, I trust, has just been
   converted to God. He may be here, tonight. If so, he must excuse my
   telling you this. He cannot read well, but he is teaching himself to
   read, and he said to me something that touched me very much. He said,
   "Do you know, I read this week the most wonderful thing I ever heard! I
   dare say you know all about it, Sir, but it was a very wonderful thing
   to me." I asked, "What was it?" "Well," he replied, "you know, I was
   spelling it over and I found that Christ said, 'I call you not
   servants; but I have called you friends.' That knocked me over," he
   said, "me a friend of His, me a friend of His? And He calls me so! I
   was obliged to think that I must have made a mistake and I had to read
   it over to see if it could be so, that He really called me a friend.
   And further down He said, 'These things have I spoken unto you, that
   you should not be offended.' There, I thought, what difference would it
   make to Him if I were offended? And to think of my being offended with
   Him! It is much more likely that He will be offended with me. It is all
   very amazing."

   That is a most blessed way of reading the Bible for the first time--to
   see these wonders as they break upon you! Well, now, it is just as my
   friend found it to be--the Lord comes to us with very sweet
   familiarity--He uses what the French call "tutoyage." In speaking to
   us, He utters the familiar, "you" and, "you"--and He sits down to eat
   in company with us--calls us to His table and there bids us eat and
   drink with Him. It is wonderful, as my friend said, but it is thus that
   Jesus deals with those who love and serve Him! And what a reward it is
   for the Lord's servants when He says to them, "All hail! I am your
   Companion. I have done well to meet you. I am glad to see you. All
   health be to you! Every blessing rest upon you!" Something more than,
   "Salem," the "peace" of the Old Covenant, is this, "All hail!" of the
   New Covenant, of which the Incarnate God is the great Expositor! That
   was the cheering salutation with which the risen Savior rewarded the
   obedience of these godly women.

   They also had an assuring satisfaction as another reward of their
   obedience, for they were permitted to prove that their Lord was really
   risen from the dead. Before Thomas had done it, they did it! "They came
   and held Him by the feet." He was no specter, no phantom! It was no
   dream that deceived them. Christ was really risen! There He stood in
   solid flesh and blood--and they held Him by the feet! I believe that
   when we are at work for the Lord with all our heart, He sometimes
   enables us to get grips of Truths of God that we do not have, at other
   times, and we lay hold on them with unrelax-ing grasp. People talk
   about "honest doubt" and ask me to doubt. I cannot doubt! I live in the
   enjoyment of the eternal facts. I could sooner doubt my own existence
   than doubt the Doctrines of Christ, they have become such substantial
   Truths of God to me. I have tasted and handled them! I cannot have a
   doubt about them. It was so with these godly women--they knew that
   Christ was risen, for they came and held Him by the feet.

   But, at the same time, they had, mixed with this experience, a
   rapturous adoration. "They held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him."
   It is of no use to be persuaded of a Doctrine--that is, to hold it
   mentally--unless there is the spirit of worship going with it, so that
   you adore your Lord while you hold to Him and His Truth. These women
   not merely felt that Jesus was there as a Man, but they knew that He
   was also God, they were sure of it and, therefore, they worshipped Him.
   It takes a lot of faith, while you are holding a man, to worship Him at
   the same time, because your grip of the human body is a proof of its
   materialism--and you say to yourself--"This is a man." And, therefore,
   you do not worship him. But these women knew that Jesus was God as well
   as Man, so they could mingle the holding of His feet with the worship
   due to His Godhead. In a natural sense, none of us can exactly imitate
   these worshipping women, but those who are taught of God, the Holy
   Spirit, and who know how to be familiar and yet to be devout, will draw
   near to Christ and hold Him by the feet and, at the same time, worship
   Him with solemn awe and sacred joy.

   Now, this is the reward that I want my dear Friends here to have. I
   know that the most of you have some work on hand for the Master. If you
   are getting at all dull and heavy, I beg you not to give it up. Stick
   to it, but pray the Lord to meet with you. May He meet you here,
   tonight! If not, may He meet you on the way home, or in your bedroom!
   Nothing is so sweet as the sight of our Lord risen from the dead--to
   know because He lives that we, also, shall live--and to get a

   sight of Him as alive and living for us! This puts nerve into us and
   sends us back to our service greatly refreshed. That is to be my last
   point and upon it I will speak very briefly.

   III. Thirdly, notice these holy women IN THE WAY OF OBEDIENCE
   REFRESHED, for, having seen and touched their Lord, they were now sent
   away to His brethren.

   Before they went forth the second time, they were perfectly calm and
   happy in the Lord. I think that it is almost essential to any great
   success in serving the Lord that we should be on the best of terms with
   Him and not be fluttered, frightened, worried, perturbed, questioning.
   Having worshipped and held Him and heard Him say, "All hail," you will
   then feel that, by the power of His love and the authority of His
   Divinity, He sends you forth as His messenger.

   Notice, next, that the angel said to the women, "Go quickly, and tell
   His disciples." But Jesus said, "Go tell My brethren." Thus, their
   commission was sweetened. And if it is with you as it was with them,
   you will get to be more tender in the delivery of your message. You
   will begin to feel nearer of kin to those to whom you speak. You will
   perceive more of the love of Christ to them. You will not merely be
   talking in your Sunday school class to "boys and girls out of the
   street," you will feel that you are speaking to those of whom Jesus
   said, "Suffer the little children to come unto Me." I shall not be
   preaching to mere "men and women of our fallen race," but to those in
   whom I hope to find the Brothers and Sisters of my Lord! In seeking to
   do good, there is nothing like the plan of getting close to the people!
   Up in Scotland I have often seen the fishermen standing right in the
   middle of the river--that is a good place to fish--it is better than
   being on the bank. Get among the fish and you will catch them! Get to
   feel your relationship to the soul you deal with and your Lord's
   relationship to him, and you will preach or teach much better than you
   have ever done in the past. Thus these women went with their commission
   sweetened by their Lord's loving words, "Go tell My brethren."

   Notice, again, that their confidence in their message was increased.
   They believed it when the angel uttered it, but they believed it still
   more emphatically when their Master repeated it to them! Besides, His
   telling it to them was the best proof that it was true. He could not
   have told them that He was risen from the dead if He had not been risen
   from the dead! So the Truth of God, when it comes to us in Christ, is
   its own proof. You may doubt it while it is simply preached by men, but
   you surely will never doubt it when Jesus, Himself, in His own Person,
   comes to you and says, Himself, "This is the Truth of God. Open your
   heart and soul and receive it." May the Lord do this for many here!

   And then, these women went on their way with increased joy. They had no
   great fear, no, not even a little fear, for their great joy had
   swallowed up their fear. I should have liked to have seen them go in
   among the Apostles, exclaiming, "The Lord is risen, indeed!" They might
   say, "But Mary, we saw you last night looking as miserable as
   possible." "Ah!" she would answer, "but Christ is risen! I have seen
   Him and He said to me, 'Be not afraid,' and I am not afraid, either of
   the Jews or of anybody else, for He is risen! He said to me, 'All
   hail,' and it is all hail! All is well, for the Lord is risen!"
   Testifying of their Lord in this spirit, they expected to be believed
   and they were believed! May the Lord put you, also, into such a
   condition, tonight, that you may say, "I now know more than I ever did
   about the Truth of my Lord's Gospel, and I will tell it as though I
   could not think that anybody would doubt it. I will tell it expecting
   that they must believe it!" And they will believe it, for, according to
   your faith so shall it be unto you.

   As for you, my dear Hearers, who do not know my Lord, how I wish that
   you did! He is a living Christ! He is no lifeless picture on the walls,
   not a dead character in a book. He is the living Lord! He has come to
   us and given us eternal life--and if you come to Him, He will in no
   wise cast you out. If you only look to Him, you shall live! If you take
   His yoke upon you and learn of Him, you shall find rest unto your
   souls! I would that you might do so this very night! May the Lord bless
   you in so doing!

   Thus I have preached to you and now there are some Believers to be
   baptized. That is the second part of our work. At the end of this
   chapter we read, "Go you, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:
   teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you." We
   will at another time go on with the teaching that follows this
   evening's meditation, if the Lord wills.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. MATTHEW 28:1-15.

   Verses 1, 2. In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
   first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see
   the sepulcher. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel
   of the Lord descended from Heaven, and came and rolled back the stone
   from the door, and sat upon it. See what concern angels have about our
   Lord. Are they here tonight? Do they make a habit of coming where the
   saints meet together? I think they do. We have intimations in Scripture
   that that is the case. Let us behave ourselves aright, tonight,
   "because of the angels." And as they worship and count it their highest
   honor to serve the Son of Man, let us also worship Jesus and adore Him!
   What a picture this scene would make!

   3, 4. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
   snow; and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
   men. He said nothing as he rolled back the stone. He did not shake a
   sword at them, or over them, to fill them with terror. The presence of
   perfect purity, the presence of heavenly things, is a terror to ungodly
   men! May you and I be such that our very presence in company will cast
   a hush over it! "It was even as though an angel shook his wings," they
   said of one good man when he spoke in common conversation. May there be
   about us enough of the heavenly to make the powers of evil quail before
   us!

   5. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear you not. But I
   notice that they did fear, although the angel said, "Fear not." Neither
   men nor angels can so speak as to silence fears in trembling hearts,
   but Jesus can, as we shall see farther on. One word from His lips has
   infinitely more power than all the words of angels or of saints!

   5. For I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified. And if you and
   I, tonight, can truly say that we are on the side of Jesus--that we
   seek Him who was crucified--then we can bear all the shame with which
   philosophy would gladly cover the Cross and we have no cause for fear.
   Ridicule and all that it brings from this ungodly generation will not
   hurt you.

   6. He is not here: for He is risen, as He said. "As He said." A few
   words, but what a world of meaning! "As He said." He always does "as He
   said." He always gives "as He said." He always reveals Himself "as He
   said," not otherwise. He never fails to fulfill a promise, or forgets
   even the mode of promising. Not only does He do what He said, but as He
   said. "He is risen, as He said."

   6. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. For even the place where He
   lay is hallowed to you. And, Beloved, if there is a place where you
   have ever had communion with Christ, you will remember it. You might
   bless the spot of ground where Jesus met with you. Here, tonight, I
   hope that some of you can see the place where the Lord appeared to you.

   7. And go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the
   dead. Such good news ought to be spread quickly! "Go and tell His
   disciples." They are trembling, they have fled--"that He is risen from
   the dead."

   7. And, behold, He goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see
   Him: lo, I have told you. Brethren, this is good news for us, tonight,
   though all may not, perhaps, feel the power of it. "He is risen." We
   have no dead Christ! We serve a living Savior! He is risen and,
   therefore, He can come to us, tonight, in the power of His
   Resurrection-life, and He can make us glad. "Behold, He goes before you
   into Galilee." There is a great deal about Galilee in Matthew's Gospel.
   It is the Gospel of the Kingdom and yet it often talks about Galilee,
   that border-land which touches Gentiles, as well as the chosen seed of
   Abraham. There is the place where Jesus will meet His people, in the
   border-land between Jew and Gentile--there the risen Christ will hold
   the first general assembly of His Church!

   8. And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great
   joy. What a mixture--fear and joy! But notice that the fear was not
   great, but the joy was--"Fear and great joy." Observe the proportions
   of the mixture and if, tonight, you have some fear, yet I hope you will
   have great joy--and then the bitterness of the fear will pass away. A
   holy fear, mixed with great joy, is one of the sweetest compounds we
   can bring to God's altar! Some of us have brought those spices with us,
   tonight. These holy women brought other spices to the sepulcher--but
   these were the spices that they took away from it--"Fear and great
   joy."

   8, 9. And did run to bring His disciples word. And as they went to tell
   His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came
   and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him. He would not let Mary
   Magdalene do that when they were alone, for He said to her, "Touch Me
   not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father: it is more necessary for
   you to go, now, and tell My disciples that I have risen from the dead.
   There will be time, by-and-by, for further fellowship with Me." But now
   Jesus permits these godly women to hold Him by the feet! It was an act
   of humility, worshipping and holding, and holding not His hands, but
   His feet. They must have seen the nail-prints before Thomas did, as
   they held Him by

   the feet and worshipped Him. I do not find that these women ran to the
   angels--they rather shrank back from them-- but they came to Jesus, for
   we are told that they came and held Him by the feet. I think that there
   must have been a new attraction about Christ after He had risen from
   the dead, something more sweet about the tones of His voice, something
   more charming about the Countenance that had been so maimed at
   Gethsemane, and Gabbatha, and Golgotha.

   10. Then said Jesus unto them. As He saw their palpitating hearts and
   perceived that they were still all in a flurry, for the angel had not
   dispelled their fears.

   10. Be not afraid: go tell My brethren to go into Galilee, and there
   shall they see Me. The angel talked of "disciples." Christ talks of
   "brethren." He always has the sweeter word.

   11. Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the
   city, and told unto the chiefpriests all the things that were done.
   While good people were active, bad people were active, too. It is
   amazing to think of how much good and evil is being done at the same
   time. While we are thankful that holy women are running with holy
   messages for Christ, here come the soldiers of the watch--and they are
   going in to those vile priests.

   12. And when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel.
   They ought at once to have repented when the watch came and told them
   that Jesus was risen! Ought they not to have gone and fallen at His
   feet, and begged for mercy? But instead of that--

   12. They gave a large amount of money unto the soldiers. Money,
   wherever it comes in, seems to do mischief. For money Christ was
   betrayed and, for money, the Truth about His Resurrection was kept back
   as far as it could be. Money has had a hardening effect on some of the
   highest servants of God--and all who have to touch the filthy lucre
   have need to pray for Grace to keep them from being harmed by being
   brought into contact with it.

   13. Saying, Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole Him away
   while we slept. If they were asleep, how did they know what happened?
   How could they know it if they were asleep? Evidence which is borne by
   men who were asleep at the time is evidently not worth regarding. But
   when you have to tell a lie, I suppose that, as any stick is good
   enough to beat a dog with, any lie will do to slander one whom you
   hate.

   14. 15. And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
   and secure you. So they took the money, and did as they were
   instructed. No doubt you have heard of the man who said that he did not
   believe all the articles of his church because his salary was so small
   that he could not be expected to believe them all for the little money
   he was paid. Oh, the depraving and debasing power of the whole system
   of bribery and falsehood! May none of us ever be affected by
   considerations of profit and loss in matters of doctrine, matters of
   duty and matters of right and wrong!

   15. And this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
   You may start a lie, but you cannot stop it. There is no telling how
   long it will live. Let us never teach even the least error to a little
   child, for it may live on and become a great heresy long after we are
   dead. There is scarcely any limit to its life and to its power.

The Followers of the Lamb

   (No. 2324)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 4, 1889.

   "These are they which follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were
   redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to the
   Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault
   before the Throne of God." Revelation 14:4,5.

   WHATEVER the saints are in Heaven, they began to be on earth. There is,
   no doubt, a perfection of character in the world to come, but the
   character must be formed here. In the next world there will be no real
   change--where the tree falls, there it will lie. He that is filthy will
   be filthy, still. He that is holy will be holy, still. I am going to
   talk to you, tonight, about those who surround the Lamb and are with
   Him in the blaze of His Glory, singing to His honor. I say that what
   they are in Heaven they were, in a measure, on earth. The life of Glory
   is the life of Grace. That life which men have in Heaven comes to them
   in regeneration on earth. When they are born again, they are born for
   Heaven--then it is that they receive the life which lives on throughout
   the eternal ages. If you do not have that life, here, you will never
   have it. If you die dead in sin, there is nothing for you, forever, but
   the abode of the dead, "where their worm dies not and their fire is not
   quenched." Today is the only time which we have for forming our
   character. Earth is the great place for making instruments of
   music--here they are tuned and prepared. Up there, they play them! But
   they will never play them, there, unless they have had them made and
   tuned here.

   The subject of my discourse will be, first, a survey of the outline of
   character of those who are to be with Christ hereafter. And then,
   secondly, a contemplation of the perfect picture of the saints with
   Christ in Glory, where I trust we, too, shall be, in the Lord's good
   time.

   I do not know whether these verses describe all the saints in Heaven.
   If they do, then you must be like they, or you can never be among them.
   If, however, they describe the elect of the elect, the innermost circle
   of Heaven. If they describe the bodyguard of Christ, the immortals that
   perpetually surround Him, nearest to His Person, the most divinely like
   He. If they describe a kind of aristocracy of the skies, the nobility
   of Heaven--and it seems to me that they do, for they are the first
   fruits and the rest of the righteous may be regarded as the harvest
   afterwards reaped. If these words describe some special saints, then we
   should seek to be like they. I would cultivate a holy ambition to be
   among the brightest stars of God! Why should we not reach to the
   highest prize of our high calling? If there is any specialty among the
   redeemed above, should it not be our earnest desire to attain to that
   standard?

   I. So, first, here is AN OUTLINE OF THE CHARACTER OF THOSE BLESSED ONES
   WHILE THEY ARE

   HERE.

   And, first, notice their adherence to the Doctrine of Sacrifice while
   they are here--"These are they which follow the Lamb." There are some
   professing Christians who talk much about the example of Christ, but
   deny the efficacy of His atoning blood--they are not of those who will
   be in Heaven. There are some who magnify the philosophy of Christ--all
   His ethical teaching is greatly to their taste--but, as to His being a
   Substitute offered up as a Sacrifice on account of human guilt, they
   cannot agree with it. Very well--they cannot enter Heaven, for, "these
   are they which follow the Lamb." Not Christ, only, mark you, but Christ
   as the Lamb of God's Passover! Christ as the Lamb of God slain before
   the foundation of the world, Christ as the Lamb of God which takes away
   the sin of the world. You cannot be of that blessed number if you
   reject Christ as a Sacrifice.

   As for me, and I trust for you, also, "God forbid that I should glory,
   save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ!" Christianity without the
   blood of Christ is a dead Christianity--it has nothing to give life to
   it--"for the blood is the life thereof." If you take away the Doctrine
   of Sacrifice, you have taken away the core, the heart, the pith, the
   marrow of all Christianity. You have left bones for dogs, but you have
   not left food for immortal spirits. Whoever will be saved, before all
   things, it is necessary that he should believe in Jesus Christ, the
   Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! "For God so loved the
   world, that He gave His only begotten Son: that whoever believes in
   Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life." Look, look, look
   unto Him and be you saved, all you ends of the earth, for He is God,
   even the bleeding Savior! He is God and beside Him there is none else.
   May it be said of you all, dear Friends, that you followed the Lamb by
   your adherence to His atoning Sacrifice!

   Many have thus followed the Lamb in spite of fierce persecution.
   Remember that brave woman, Ann Askew? When they had racked her and
   pulled every limb out of its place, so that she ached all over in her
   exquisitely delicate frame, yet she sat on the stone floor of her cell
   and still defended the Sacrifice of Christ. When she had an opportunity
   to write her thoughts, she penned that quaint verse--

   "I am not she that list,

   My anchor to let fall,

   For every drizzling mist

   My ship's substantial."

   She thought that being vexed by Popish priests and torn to pieces on
   the rack was only a drizzling mist, for which it was not worth while to
   cast her anchor! She was more than a match for 50 priests. God raise us
   up a race of such men and women! The devil seems to have taken the
   backbone out of most people. May we begin to know what we know and to
   believe what we believe, and to put our foot down and say, "God helping
   me, I will not forsake my God, nor turn away from His Truth." You
   remember how Martin Luther, when he stood at the Diet of Worms, closed
   what he had to say when they bade him recant, and he would not? He
   said, "Here I stand; I can do no other, so help me God," and thus,
   invoking the help of his Divine Lord, he committed his body to the
   flames, if need be, sooner than he would renounce a single Word of the
   Most High, or sin against the Light of God which he had received!

   And, next, it is clear of these people that they followed the Lamb by
   practically imitating Christ's example, for it is written, "These are
   they which follow the Lamb wherever He goes." They so believed in Him
   that--

   "They marked the footsteps that He trod,

   His zeal inspired their breast,

   And following their Incarnate God,

   Possess the promised rest."

   You cannot be with Christ unless you are like Christ. If you have
   really trusted in Jesus, He will transform you, He will take away from
   you those evil tendencies and vile propensities which are contrary to
   holiness. He will work in you to will and to do of His own good
   pleasure. And the highest holiness for you is to be like Christ! The
   very noblest character to which you could ever reach is to follow the
   Lamb wherever He goes, in obedience to God, in love to man, in
   self-sacrifice, in humility, in gentleness, in love! You must follow
   Him wherever He goes and do what He did, so far as your position makes
   it fit for you to do it. I mean that you cannot do as He did as God,
   but you can do what He did as Man. Try to put your feet down in the
   footprints that He has left you. Aim at complete conformity to Christ
   and wherein you fail to reach it, mark that you come so far short of
   what you ought to be. To be like Christ is that which God intends for
   you and unless you have some measure of it now, you will never be with
   Him, for all they who are with Christ above are the people who were
   made like to Christ here below. Note that very distinctly, "These are
   they which follow the Lamb wherever He goes."

   Will you, dear Friends, labor to take Christ for your pattern? Do not
   come and take His name and then dishonor His Character. There are among
   you some who are very much like your Master--you are the joy of the
   Church. There are among all the Churches some who bear Christ's name
   but are not like He. My venerable predecessor, Dr. Rippon, used to say
   of His Church, that he had in it some of the best people in
   England--and then he used to add in a low voice, "and some of the
   worst." I am afraid that I have to say the same, but I am very sorry
   that I should have to say it. The worst people in the world are those
   who profess most and do least. Do not be among that unhappy number, but
   do, I pray you,

   by the blessing of God, and the help of His Spirit, be among those who
   at least endeavor to "follow the Lamb wherever He goes."

   Now, notice in the sketch of these people, that they recognized a
   special redemption--"These were redeemed from among men." Christ had
   done something for them that He had not done for others. They were not
   redeemed, "among men," but, "from among men." They recognized the
   specialty of Christ's Sacrifice. They could read, for instance, a
   passage like this and understand its meaning, "Christ loved the church,
   and gave Himself for it," for His Church, for His body. "These were
   redeemed from among men." Come, Beloved, do you belong to this company
   of persons who have been fetched out from the rest of mankind by the
   power of the Spirit of God, and also by the merit of the precious
   blood? Do you feel that you are marked with the blood as others are
   not? Do you belong to a people who are not of the world, even as He
   that bought them was not of the world? Are you henceforth not of the
   common multitude, but one who has been bought and paid for by that
   redemptive price which was found in the veins and the heart of the
   Redeemer? And are you so redeemed as no longer to be one of the great
   mass of mankind, but fetched out, called out, chosen, "not your own,
   but bought with a price"? These are they that will be with Christ
   hereafter, as specially redeemed ones.

   And as they recognized a special redemption, you will observe that they
   made a full surrender of themselves to God and to the Lamb--"These were
   redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to the
   Lamb." On a certain day, when the harvest was getting ripe, a man went
   down to the fields and plucked an ear here, a handful there, and
   another handful further on. And he passed along the field and gathered
   ears here and ears there. And when he had collected enough for sheaves,
   he tied them up and took them to the Temple of God and presented them
   to the Lord as an offering, to signify that he owed all the harvest to
   God--and he brought Him the first ripe ears as a sacrifice to Him.

   Now, Beloved, has the Grace of God plucked you out from among the rest
   of mankind and do you feel that you now belong to Christ, that you
   belong to God, that you are not to be gathered with the mass of men for
   the great condemnation, but that you are presented unto God and belong
   to Him altogether? It is a very easy thing for me to talk about this,
   but, believe me, it is by no means an easy thing to carry it out. I see
   numbers of people who profess to belong to God, but they live as much
   for making money as anybody else! They live quite as much for
   self-seeking as the world does and it would be difficult, even if you
   had microscopes on both your eyes, to see any difference between them
   and worldlings. This will never do. "Come out from among them, and be
   you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing." If you
   are the first fruits unto God, be so. If you belong to yourself, serve
   yourself. But if, by the redemption of Christ, you are not your own,
   but bought with a price, then live as those who are the King's own, who
   must serve God, and cannot be content unless their every action shall
   tend to the Divine Glory, and to the magnifying of Christ Jesus. Now
   this is what all of us who are truly the Lord's have in outline. Oh,
   that the sketch might be properly filled up, that we might become more
   and more the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb!

   I must take you a little further. These people who are to be with
   Christ, the nearest to Him, are a people free from falsehood. "In their
   mouth was found no guile." Brothers and Sisters, if we profess to be
   Christians, we must have done with all craft, policy, double-dealing
   and the like. The Christian man should be a plain man who says what he
   means and means what he says. I know of no worse suspicion against any
   man who professes to be a Christian than the suspicion of not being
   transparent. It were better for us to be simple as fools than to be
   cunning as hypocrites, even though our cunning should place us in the
   front rank of the governors of mankind! The Christian man should scorn
   to tell a lie! Exaggeration and equivocation should be strangers to his
   lips. "In their mouth was found no guile." The Lord Jesus Christ was a
   great Speaker of the plain Truth of God and those whom He chooses to be
   near Him, to be His personal attendants in Heaven, must also be free
   from guile. With many a mistake, with many a weakness, yet, Beloved,
   the saints are free from falsehood! They are true, whatever may be
   their mistakes. Look to yourselves and see whether it is so. As I would
   look to my own soul, I charge you to look to yours.

   And then, once more, it is said that they are free from blemish. "They
   are without fault before the Throne of God." "Oh," says one, "I am not
   without fault!" No, but there is the outline of that character in you
   if you are, indeed, one of the Lord's people. You have already got rid
   of many faults and you are getting rid of more. You grieve over what
   remains and you will never rest till every sin is conquered. Is it not
   so, Beloved? Saints are not only men of honor, but men of holiness! We
   would not tolerate any known sin in ourselves. Whenever we are carried
   into a fault by temptation or by inbred sin, we feel unhappy. We bow
   low in the dust and we cry to God for Grace, that we may not commit the
   same sin

   again. But God's people are a blameless people, after all. If you are
   to find pure and right characters, where will you find them but among
   the followers of the Lamb? You know and I know many believers in Christ
   whose lives are blameless-- we would not say that they are absolutely
   without fault, but still, the Grace of God so works in them that we may
   safely take them for examples and do as they have done.

   It was so in the olden time and it is so now! And unless your character
   is such that your children may safely imitate it, and your servants may
   tread in your footsteps, and your neighbors may act as you do without
   going wrong, how can you hope to be where Jesus is? Jesus Christ
   receives sinners, but He makes them saints! The Gospel opens a great
   hospital, not for sick men to lie in it and remain sick, but that there
   they may recover health and may be made strong! He that believes in
   Christ is saved--saved in this sense among others, that He is saved
   from the power of sin, and turned from an unholy and godless life into
   a life of purity, honesty, and uprightness! "Be not deceived," any of
   you, tonight, "God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows that shall he
   also reap." If there is not about you a likeness to Christ. If there is
   not at least the sketch which I have tried to depict, then, surely, you
   are not among those who will be forever where Jesus is!

   I have seen an artist make his crayon drawing. He takes a piece of
   charcoal and marks out what he is going to draw. I am afraid that is
   about all that is done with us, here. There is an outline made with the
   charcoal--all the lines of beauty and all the glory of character are
   yet to be laid on as we grow in Grace and in likeness to Christ. But,
   at least, there must be that sketch. If you have not that, come humbly
   to the feet of Jesus and pray that He would begin in you His good work
   which He will carry on and perfect in the day of His appearing.

   Thus much upon the outline of the character of saints while they are
   upon the earth.

   II. Now indulge me for just a few minutes while I try to give you A
   GLIMPSE OF THE PERFECT PICTURE IN

   HEAVEN. I cannot really show you the picture--that is in the upper
   gallery in Glory and you must go up there to see it. I can only tell
   you my idea of what that picture is like when it is finished.

   Well, first, those who are with Christ enjoy perfect fellowship with
   Him. Up there they "follow the Lamb wherever He goes." They are always
   with Him. There were certain young princes chosen in certain courts to
   attend upon the king. Wherever the king went, they went. Where the
   court was, there was their abode. Their one business was to behold the
   king's face and to abide near him. That is the business of the
   glorified ones of whom I am speaking. When will the day arrive that you
   and I shall enjoy this perfect fellowship with our glorious King, never
   absent from Him, never doubting His love, never cold in our affection
   towards Him, but being--

   "Forever with the Lord"?

   Shall I go on with the verse?

   "Amen! So let it be!

   Life from the dead is in that word,

   'Tis immortality!"

   Some of you have dear children who have outstripped their mother and
   are enjoying this felicity even now. Others of us have mothers,
   brothers, friends who were very dear to us, who follow the Lamb in
   Glory. How many who once sat among us, here, are now up there,
   following the Lamb, and He leads them unto living fountains of waters
   and all tears are wiped away from their eyes! Oh, to think that
   wherever my Lord shall go I shall go! When He shall descend from Heaven
   with a shout, we shall come with Him! When He shall sit upon His Throne
   to judge the world, His saints shall sit with Him! When He shall reign
   gloriously among His ancients for a thousand years, we shall reign with
   Him on the earth! When He shall return to the Father's Throne--

   "All His work and warfare done," we shall partake of His triumph,
   following the Lamb wherever He goes. I vote to cast in my lot with my
   Lord in life and in death. What say you? My Master, where You dwell, I
   will dwell. If men put You to shame, I will be put to shame with You.
   If You die, I will die with You, that I may forever live with You in
   Your Glory above. Say you not the same, Beloved? Say it deep down in
   your heart, tonight!

   Well, now, notice in this complete picture, next, that up there they
   are perfectly accepted with God--"These were redeemed from among men,
   being the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb." God always accepts
   them. He always looks upon them as His first fruits, bought with His
   Son's blood, and brought by His Son into His heavenly Temple, to be His
   forever! Sometimes, here, we mar our service, but they never mar it
   there! Our songs get out of tune, but theirs never know a discord. We
   praise the Lord and yet groan, being burdened. But in Heaven there
   are--

   "No groans to mingle with the songs Which warble from immortal
   tongues."

   We doubt. We fear. We grieve the Holy Spirit. Sometimes we get very
   sadly out of gear with God. It is never so there-- fully redeemed from
   sin--they are accepted in the Beloved and to the very top of their bent
   they know it, and enjoy it. Happy day, happy day, when you and I shall
   be of them and among them!

   Observe, also, that they have perfect truth, there, in heart and
   soul--"In their mouth was found no guile." "No lie," says the Revised
   Version. Here, dear Friends, we inadvertently fall into error and,
   sometimes, I fear, negligently. We say, not knowingly, more than the
   Truth of God. How often we say much less than the Truth and almost
   necessarily so when we speak of Divine things--but up there they are
   not only free from willful guile and deceit, but they are free from all
   error and mistake. Happy day! Happy day! Do you not long to be there to
   be rid of every false doctrine, every wrong opinion, every error, every
   mistake, so that in your mouth there shall never again be guile? This
   is what they are above-- made perfect. He who washed their hearts,
   here, has washed their tongues, there! As they loved the Truth of God,
   here, they know the Truth there! As they sought it here, they have
   found it there! As they were willing to die for it here, they live in
   the enjoyment of it there and shall do so forever!

   One more feature of that perfect picture is this, they enjoy perfect
   sinlessness before God--"They are without fault before the Throne of
   God." That text brings back to my recollection the second sermon I
   preached to this Church, one Sabbath evening, when we were but
   few--"They are without fault before the Throne of God." I had great
   joy, as a youth, in expatiating upon the perfect blessing of being
   altogether, "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." If there
   were any fault in them, there, they are where it would be seen, for
   they are before the Throne of the all-seeing God! But even there, in
   that matchless place of light in which there is no darkness at all,
   they are declared to be without fault, without blemish. Can you think
   that you will be of that happy number one day? I had to put it very
   mildly just now when I spoke of saints being without blame, here, but
   you may put it as strongly as you please when you speak of their being
   without sin there!

   They were once, perhaps, before conversion, the very chief of sinners,
   but in Heaven there shall be no trace of their sin. They will bless the
   Grace that came to them when they were up to their neck in the filth of
   sin, but there will be no trace of their filthiness left. There is no
   blood stain on Manasseh, there is no brand of blasphemy on Saul of
   Tarsus, now--they have washed their robes and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb. Some of these men were by nature and by practice,
   too, so depraved that it looked as if they could never escape from
   their evil habits. We might have said of them, "Can the Ethiopian
   change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may these men, who are
   accustomed to do evil, learn to do well." Yet so has the Grace of God
   changed them that there is no trace of any evil tendency, no propensity
   to lust, or lewdness, or blasphemy, or any kind of fault!

   What a wonderful change it will be for those who were once great
   sinners to be found without fault--not only without great crime, not
   only without gross vice, but without fault and that, too, as I have
   said, before the Throne of God, where, if there were a fault, it would
   be seen! They are cleansed from all the guilt of sin and from all the
   depravity which the addiction of sin brings to men. "They are without
   fault before the Throne of God." Truly, if you had never heard this
   before, it might make you laugh for joy to think that it should ever be
   possible that the very chief of sinners, through faith in Christ, might
   be made so clean as one day to be without fault before the Throne of
   God! I think that when we get there, part of the joy of Heaven will be
   a long surprise, an endless wonder--and if we are permitted to remember
   what we used to be, some of you will recall a night of sin, and say,
   "And yet I am here!" You will recall, perhaps, some dreadful passion,
   some atrocious outburst of foul language, or some terrible occasion of
   sin and you will say, "Yet here I am, clean as the driven snow, washed
   in the blood of Jesus and renewed by the Spirit of God."

   Although they always praise God, I think that they must, every now and
   then, have a fresh outburst of hallelujahs when they begin to review
   the past. One says, "I, even after conversion, was a poor, limping
   Christian. And I was thrown back once or twice with terrible
   backslidings. My Christian friends despaired of my ever holding on--and
   yet here I am, by God's Grace, without fault before the Throne of God.
   Hallelujah!" Will not a man be obliged to break out like that and do
   you not think that all the saints around Him will take up the
   Hallelujah, too, till it goes in swelling chorus all round the choirs
   of Heaven, "Hallelujah to God and the Lamb"? And another one will say,
   "And I, after I had long known the Lord, fell, oh, so sadly, so
   grievously! But He would not give me up! He followed me and, by His
   mighty

   Grace, I was restored, my broken bones were set again and I was made to
   sing of Free Grace and forgiving love. He created in me a new heart and
   renewed a right spirit within me! And now I, even I, am here without
   fault, without a single fault." You can hardly imagine it, can you? You
   begin to think, "Well, surely that cannot be," for, if you look within,
   you see so many faults over which you groan, but you will look without
   and look within, when you once get there, and neither without nor
   within, in any respect whatever, will you have any kind of fault, for,
   "they are without blemish before the Throne of God."

   I do not feel inclined to preach any more, but just to shout,
   "Hallelujah," again and again, at the very thought that I shall be
   there! Oh, it is hard to go to Heaven from such a place as that which I
   occupy! Your eyes sometimes startle me in my dreams, these thousands of
   eyes fixed upon one poor mortal man, who has to try to lead you to
   Christ and lead you to Heaven. Your eyes, at times, seem to pierce me
   like so many daggers. I think, sometimes, "What if I am not faithful,
   if I do not preach plainly, if I do not warn them, if I do not invite
   them earnestly, if I do not, with all my heart cry, 'Come to Christ'?
   What shall I do in eternity if 6,000 pairs of eyes are forever seeming
   to stick, like daggers, into my heart?" Oh, but it will not be so! I
   believe in Him that justifies the ungodly and I have fully preached Him
   to you, and all my great congregation!

   My hope is in the precious blood that cleanses from all sin and I have
   pointed all my hearers to that precious blood! And the day will come
   when I, with all who believe in Jesus, shall be without fault before
   the Throne of God! The very thought of it makes me cry, "Hallelujah!"
   And with that I finish. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Say "Hallelujah," all
   of you! ["Hallelujah" from the congregation.] Hallelujah! Hallelujah to
   God and the Lamb! The Lord bless you, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. REVELATION 14.

   Verse 1. And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb--John always writes of Jesus as
   the "Lamb." His Lord is to him in His sacrificial Character, always,
   "the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world" by the shedding
   of His blood. "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb"--

   1. Stood on the mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four
   thousand, having His Father's name written in their foreheads. The
   Revised Version has it, "having His name, and the name of His Father,
   written on their foreheads." Now they are known to be the Lord's--on
   earth that fact was questioned, but His name is now written on their
   foreheads. Sometimes they, themselves, had to question it, but now it
   is apparent to all, the distinguishing mark is stamped upon their
   brow--"having His Father's name written on their foreheads."

   2. And I heard a voice from Heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as
   the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping
   with their harps. It was very loud, but very sweet. It is not easy, in
   earthly music, to blend the two, but in Heaven, all the energies of
   living men shall be thrown into the song and yet it shall be sweet as
   the touch of a minstrel when he lays his fingers gently among the
   strings of the harp.

   3. And they sung, as it were, a new song before the Throne. They could
   not sing any old song there. The songs of earth, sweet as some of them
   are, are not good enough to be sung in Heaven. With a new experience,
   new delights and a clearer vision of their Lord, they must have a new
   song.

   3. And before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
   that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were
   redeemed from the earth. Heaven is not the place to learn that song--it
   must be learned on the earth. You must learn, here, the notes of Free
   Grace and dying love. And when you have mastered their melody, you will
   be able to offer to the Lord the tribute of a grateful heart, even in
   Heaven, and blend it with the eternal harmonies. Suppose, for a moment,
   that you could go there and that you were unprepared to sing the new
   song? You would have to say, "I cannot join in the chorus, for I do not
   know the tune." You must learn the song, now, the new song of praise
   unto our God, or you cannot be admitted there. I would not expect, if I
   went down to the Handel Festival, for the conductor to permit me to
   take a place in the choir. He would ask me, "Can you sing? Have you
   ever rehearsed the matchless music of Handel?" And when I answered,
   "No," he would tell me to stand aside! So you must learn the music of
   Calvary, you must learn the music of the name of Jesus, or you cannot
   sing in Heaven. No man could learn the song but the redeemed from

   the earth--not redeemed, you see, by a general redemption, of which
   some so loudly talk--but redeemed from among men by a special
   redemption which took them out from the rest of mankind, by a price
   paid for them, so that they were bought as others were not bought, by
   the precious blood of Jesus, as of a Lamb without blemish and without
   spot.

   4. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
   virgins. They were pure and chaste in the sight of

   God.

   4. These are they which follow the Lamb wherever He goes. His choice
   attendants, His bodyguard.

   4, 5. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto
   God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile. "No lie."
   They were truthful, they were truth-speakers.

   5. For they are without fault--Or, blemish.

   5. Before the Throne of God. Like He with whom they associated, the
   Lamb of God, they were without blemish and without spot.

   6. And I saw--What wonderful sights John saw! I do not wonder that he
   saw them. He had leaned his head on Christ's bosom and that qualified
   him to see what you and I cannot see. Near communion to Christ is the
   best qualification for a vision of mystery. Get into the very heart of
   Christ and you shall see wonderful things--"I saw"--

   6, 7. Another angel fly in the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting
   Gospel to preach, unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every
   nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice,
   Fear God, and give glory to Him. Is this the Gospel? It is one version,
   evidently, of the Everlasting Gospel. "The fear of God is the beginning
   of wisdom." Truly, to worship Him as He reveals Himself, is true
   godliness and in it lies all the Gospel--"Having the Everlasting Gospel
   to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation, and
   kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and
   give glory to Him."

   7, 8. For the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made
   Heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there
   followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen. This will
   not happen till the Gospel is fully preached. Superstition does not
   come down unless true religion is set up. One angel proclaims the
   Everlasting Gospel--the next declares that the great system of error is
   fallen--"Babylon is fallen."

   8, That great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of
   the wrath of her fornication. You know that gigantic system of error
   which professes to come from God and to be the only true church--it
   must fall.

   9, 10. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
   any man worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his
   forehead, or on his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath
   of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His
   indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
   presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. They
   sometimes say that we talk very terribly about the world to come. Do we
   say more than the Scripture says? Do we use more terrible emblems than
   the Holy Spirit uses when He speaks after this fashion? This is a
   generation that is not to be pleased, neither do we seek to please it!
   God's wrath is terrible and our language cannot be too strong to
   express the overwhelming power of it.

   11. And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever: and
   they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image,
   and whoever receives the mark of his name. Keep true to Christ! Wear
   His name on your forehead. Follow no system of error. Do not be deluded
   either by Ritualism or Rationalism, by superstition or by unbelief.
   Keep close to the Word of God and ask to be taught of the Spirit of
   God.

   12, 13. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
   Commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from
   Heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the
   Lord from henceforth. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from
   their labors; and their works do follow them. Accursed were they who
   carried the mark of the beast and went after falsehood. But blessed are
   they who follow Christ, even though they die. Dying in the Lord, their
   works survive them and they, themselves, live forever with Him.

   14. And I looked, and behold a white cloud. One of these days, every
   eye will look and see what is described here. A little time may elapse,
   but it will soon be past. How quickly years fly away! Think where you
   will be in the day when you, too, will say, "I looked and behold, a
   white cloud."

   14-16. And upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of Man, having on
   His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. And another
   angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to Him that sat
   on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle, and reap: for the time is come for
   You to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And He that sat on
   the cloud

   thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. This is
   the gathering in of the godly, who are Christ's wheat. He Himself reaps
   them! No angel, mark you, but Himself, with His own sharp sickle and
   with His own dear hands. These are His sheaves. He sowed for wheat, He,
   Himself, was that wheat which fell into the ground and died, and
   brought forth much fruit. So He, into His own bosom, gathers His own
   sheaves with His own hands. "May I be among them!" Make that your
   prayer tonight. May I be one golden ear in Christ's great harvest!"

   17. And another angel came out of the Temple which is in Heaven, he,
   also, having a sharp sickle. Not this time the King, but an angel. Not
   the Son of Man that sat on the cloud, but an angel, the servant of God,
   deputized to execute vengeance.

   18. 19. And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
   fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,
   saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the
   vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust
   in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth. This
   is the gathering together of the ungodly, those wicked clusters that
   ripen in sin, and that become red with iniquity. Christ does not gather
   them, you see. That is left to an angel to do--he thrust in his sickle
   and gathered the grapes of the earth.

   19. And cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. Can you
   see the clusters flung into the winepress? Will you be there? God grant
   that neither you nor I may, in that terrible day, be among the clusters
   of the wicked!

   20. And the winepress was trod outside the city, and blood came out of
   the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand
   and six hundred furlongs. So terrible will be even the preliminary
   destruction of the ungodly! Though they grow in clusters, yet shall
   they perish. "Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be
   unpunished." "He that has ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit
   says" unto each one of us. Amen.

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 11, 1889.

   "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the
   King, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem, saying,
   Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His
   star in the East, and have come to worship Him. When Herod the king had
   heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And
   when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people
   together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born." Matthew
   2:1-4.

   I AM not going to expound the whole passage that I have read as a text,
   but I desire to help you to gather some lessons from this familiar
   narrative.

   "When Jesus was born." A stir begins as soon as Christ is born. He has
   not spoken a word. He has not worked a miracle. He has not proclaimed a
   single doctrine, but, "when Jesus was born," at the very first, while
   as yet you hear nothing but infant cries and can see nothing but infant
   weakness, still His influence upon the world is manifest. "When Jesus
   was born, there came wise men from the East," and so on. There is
   Infinite Power even in an Infant Savior! When Jesus is born in the
   heart and there are only the feeblest impulses towards righteousness
   and repentance with regard to sin, He makes a stir in our whole nature.
   The most distant faculty feels that something wonderful has happened.
   When Christ is formed in us, the hope of Glory, a sacred revolution
   commences within us! When Christ is born in a village, a town, a
   city--the first sinner converted, the first open-air sermon
   preached--the first giving away of sacred literature makes a stir! It
   is wonderful how soon it begins to manifest itself. Somebody or other
   is affected by the fact that Christ has come! He cannot be hid! The
   first match struck makes a great blaze. Jesus of Nazareth is so potent
   a factor in the world of mind that, no sooner is He there in His utmost
   weakness, a new-born King, than He begins to reign!

   Before He mounts the Throne, friends bring Him presents and His enemies
   plan His death. Oh, that the Lord Jesus might be here, tonight, if it
   is but as new born, in some few hearts! There will be a result from
   Christ's coming, even though I preach Him very feebly--though you may
   say that I can only bring to you an Infant Christ--though my power of
   speech may fail me and I may but set Him forth in His littleness rather
   than in His greatness. When Christ is born, when Christ is only feebly
   preached, when Christ is but stammered out, a great result comes of it
   and His name is made glorious! [AMEN!]

   There were two results from Christ's coming, as there always will be,
   for this Child is not only a Savior to some, but also a stumbling block
   to others. His Gospel is either, "a savor of life unto life," or else,
   "a savor of death unto death." I want you, first, to notice the note of
   exclamation that we have in the first verse. "When Jesus was born,
   behold.''" Ecce! Behold! There is something to look at, something good
   that is worth gazing upon. Behold it! Here are far-off persons who come
   very near. Wise men from the East come and worship the Infant Christ!
   But there is something to which there is no "behold" put, yet it is
   sorrowfully worth considering. Here are near ones who are
   far-off--Herod, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
   scribes. They are as far from Christ as if He had been born in the
   distant East, while they who lived in the far country came as near to
   Him as if they, themselves, had dwelt at Bethlehem! So I have these two
   things to talk about, tonight--first, the extraordinary fact that many
   far-off ones are brought near, and the sad but almost equally
   extraordinary fact that many who are apparently very near never really
   come near to Jesus.

   I. To begin, then, at the beginning. THERE ARE FAR-OFF ONES BROUGHT
   NEAR. God saves whom He wills to save. His Grace is most sovereign. You
   cannot see, as I do, so many persons brought to Christ without often
   wondering why they were brought. I have often seen the last first and
   the first last--people of whose conversion I would hardly have dreamed
   become converted, while other persons, for whom I have hoped and over
   whom I have prayed, remain unconverted! It is very delightful, as well
   as very amazing, to notice the strange way in which the Grace of God
   singles out men, and the marvelous measures which the God of Grace uses
   to bring these men to the feet of Jesus.

   Well now, first, these people were wise men, magi, students of
   astronomy, learned in the lore of the ancients. Their philosophy was
   not a very true one--it was about as true as modern philosophy--which
   is not saying much. They believed very absurd things, these magi,
   almost as absurd as the scientists of the present day, perhaps not
   quite as ridiculous, for science has grown in absurdity, especially of
   late--but these men were professors of the philosophy of the period.
   They were the wise men. If they came from Media, they were probably
   fire-worshippers, or worshippers of the elements of nature. Theirs was
   a refined form of idolatry which is not to be excused, but still, if
   there can be any choice where all is bad, it is perhaps a little better
   than some others. They were very great students so far as their light
   went-- they sought after knowledge and wisdom.

   Well now, truth to tell, it is not many of this sort of people who come
   to Christ! His Doctrine is too simple for them. He lays the axe too
   near the root of the tree. His teaching is too plain. They are so wise
   that His wisdom baffles them! They know so much, as they think, yet His
   better and higher knowledge overshadows theirs and they cannot stand it
   and will not yield to Him. "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many
   mighty, not many noble, are called." But here the Infinite Sovereignty
   of God calls these wise men first! No, I must not say first, for the
   shepherds came first--but next to the shepherds, the Lord calls these
   wise men from the distant East. It has been truly remarked that the
   shepherds did not miss their way--they came to Christ at once, while
   the wise men, even with a star to guide them, yet missed their way and
   went to Jerusalem instead of to Bethlehem--and enquired at the palace
   of Herod instead of at the stable where the Christ was born. However,
   they did come to Christ, even if they did come in a roundabout way and
   make a blunder or two!

   Here was the wonder, that they did come, and if I address myself,
   tonight, as I would do most respectfully, to any here who excel in
   human wisdom, how I wish they would join Divinity to their humanities!
   And if they know much, yet I long that with all their knowledge they
   would know Christ--and with all their getting that they would get
   understanding, for the science of Christ Crucified is the most
   excellent of all the sciences! It is the central one round which every
   true science will revolve in its proper place. And happy is the man
   whose solar system of knowledge has Christ in the very center of it.
   Still, if it is so, I shall not cease to wonder and bless God that He
   has, again, brought wise men, like Saul of Tarsus, and like these wise
   men from the East, to worship this new-born Savior!

   Notice, also, that these men were not only wise men, which is one cause
   of our wonder that they sought Christ, but they lived far away in the
   East. We do not know the distance they had traveled, but it does not
   matter--it was a long way and probably a very difficult journey--in
   those days, at any rate. It did not seem likely, when this Child was
   born at Bethlehem, that worshippers should come outside of Judea, or
   that they should come from distant regions unknown to the Jews,
   themselves, yet God, in His mercy, called these men from the farthest
   East. Oh, that His love would light on some, tonight, who are strangers
   and foreigners, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, perhaps without
   God and without hope in the world! May His Grace call such! What a mass
   of people we are, and what odd people there must be here, whom none of
   us could describe!

   After this morning's sermon, [Sermon #2099, Volume 35--Concerning the
   Consolations of God.] somebody told me that, had I known the story of
   one of my hearers, I would not have dared to describe him as correctly
   as I did. Happily I did not know that hearer--I am glad that I did
   not--my message should come all the more distinctly as a voice from God
   to him because it did so accurately describe him! But I will breathe
   this prayer, that somebody here, who is a stranger, even, to the very
   form of religion, someone who has never been in this house before, or
   in any other place of Christian worship, may be called by the mighty
   voice of God, attracted by the irresistible charms of Christ and may
   come and believe in the Incarnate God who took our flesh at Bethlehem,
   that He might bear our sin and bear us up to the Throne of God with
   Himself! Here was the double wonder, then, about the magi coming to
   Christ--they were unlikely men from an unlikely place. As we think of
   them, we are constrained to say, as we have often sung--

   "How sweet and awful is the place, With Christ within the doors, While
   everlasting love displays The choicest of her stores.

   Pity the nations, O our God! Constrain the earth to come! Send Your
   victorious Word abroad, And bring the strangers home."

   And they were singularly guided, were they not? They were watching the
   midnight skies and they spied a strange star. According to astronomers,
   there was probably a conjunction of two planets about that date. When
   two planets were in conjunction in 1640, or about that date, it was
   said that such a conjunction must have taken place at about the time
   when Christ was born and that the wise men may have thought it was a
   new star. I do not, however, think that that can have been the case. It
   was probably not simply a star, but a marked appearance which moved
   through the heavens. Well now, it was a strange thing that they should
   see this star and more strange, still, that seeing it, they should put
   this and that together, and by their astrology, for, perhaps, it was
   nothing better, infer that some wondrous personage was born away there
   in Judea and they must needs go forth to find Him. They may have heard
   of the famous prophecy of Balaam; there might have been traditions in
   their country that the Coming Man was to be born in Judea. All that may
   have been, I do not know, but this I know--God miraculously sent this
   star. If men are not to be reached in any ordinary way, God's elect
   shall be brought to Him in an extraordinary way! If they are given to
   the study of the stars, God will write in that illuminated book which
   they are accustomed to read and they shall there see a new letter and
   learn something fresh concerning His will!

   I have known the Lord meet with men in the midst of evil, in the very
   act of sin. We have known men struck down by the most amazing accidents
   and the most extraordinary chain of circumstances, men whom it seemed
   impossible to reach. Beloved, no man is beyond the reach of God! He has
   ways and means of enlightening the understanding, awakening the
   conscience and renewing the heart, of which we know but little.
   "Remember that Omnipotence has servants every-where"--in the Heaven
   above and in the earth beneath--and in the waters under the earth! He
   has means of getting at the hearts of men and He will do it. If it
   cannot be done anyway else, He will make new stars. I was about to say,
   He will make new heavens and a new earth, but He will call His own.
   When Christ is born, the wise men from the East must come, and a star
   shall be sent to guide them. Perhaps, by some remarkable circumstances,
   you, my Friend, are here tonight. It was very unlikely that you should
   be here, but you have come into the Tabernacle that the Grace of God
   may arrest you, that the hand of Eternal Love may be laid upon your
   shoulder and that you may be taken prisoner for Christ, henceforth to
   be His servant and His, alone!

   It is worth noticing, again, that these men earnestly enquired. Having
   once seen the star, they hurried off, no matter how long the journey,
   to find the new-born King, and they asked everybody to tell them the
   way to Him. They even went to the court of Herod to ask the way to find
   Christ! A man must have a deal of curiosity when he puts his head
   between the jaws of such a lion as Herod in order to find what he wants
   to know! I wish that God would stir up that kind of curiosity and
   enquiry in many men's minds. The general way, now, is to put off the
   Truth of God with a huff, to suppose that it is not worth looking into.
   But the claims of the eternal Son of God, the claims of His Grace and
   of His Throne ought not to be treated so. May God give back to the
   people a spirit of enquiry into the things of God, so that they may not
   be as indifferent as the masses of our fellow citizens now are! May
   they begin to question and say, "Which is the way to Heaven? Who is
   this Christ? What is the plan of salvation?" If it is so, we shall soon
   have cause enough for joy and we shall praise the Sovereign Grace of
   God!

   Being enquirers, these men were singularly unprejudiced. They said,
   "Where is He that is born King of the Jews?" "Jews?" Who cared for
   Jews? Even in those days, Jews were the subject of contempt, for they
   had aforetime been carried captive into the East. Although they are the
   very aristocracy of God, His chosen people, yet the nations looked down
   upon the Jews. Judah was a little paltry territory, insignificant and
   small, and many asked with Sanballat, "What are these feeble Jews?" But
   here are men from a great empire, like Persia or Media, asking about
   the King of the Jews! Surely there are still some candid men about,
   some who will enquire after Christ, even though they have to ask of
   Methodists, and Baptists, and the like! Oh, that men could break
   through the foolish shell of prejudice to enquire if these things are,
   indeed, so! The time was when the very word, "Evangelical," had a kind
   of contempt affixed to it. I am not sure that that time has quite yet
   passed. Yet, whatever others may say or do, let none of us be swayed by
   prejudice or disdain, but let us search and see whether these things
   are so.

   And note again, that these men, being candid enquirers, were
   wonderfully prompt--"When Jesus was born, there came wise men from the
   East." Well now, I think that it would naturally strike you that if a
   man were born a king, there would be time enough to pay him homage when
   he grew up! To bring gold and frankincense, and myrrh, to a baby, does
   not always commend itself to wise men! Let us see the child become a
   youth and the youth become a man--then we may take this long journey to
   find His Royal Highness. But, no, when the King was born, the wise men
   came to Him! They must have started to find Him long before. I would
   that the Lord might put into the hearts of men, today, something like
   this energy and promptness about Divine things! If God was really
   Incarnate. If He did come here in human form, oh, come, let us go and
   find Him! Let us bow at His shrine and worship at His feet! Did He
   really die and die for guilty men? Did He, in their place, bear the
   penalty of their sin? Come, let us seek this "Lamb of God, which takes
   away the sin of the world," and let us seek Him before another sun has
   risen!

   And then see, dear Friends, how supremely obedient they were, how
   entirely surrendered to the Divine impulse that moved them, for they
   hastened to do what they were told to do and rejoiced as they bowed low
   before the new-born Child, worshipping and adoring Him. They were also
   abundantly generous with their offerings. They brought the best that
   they could find--gold, and frankincense, and myrrh--and they spread the
   royal gifts before the royal Child. Lord, send us converts like these
   wise men! Send us men and women, in great multitudes, who will
   cheerfully obey, who will find a delight in worshipping Christ, in
   paying Him homage, giving to His service and in giving themselves to
   Him!

   Thus I have tried to show you what the Sovereign Grace of God did when
   Christ was born. May the Lord, in His mercy, do the same to many here!
   Oh, how often has it happened that when I least know it, I was
   preaching to one who would become, afterwards, one of our best helpers,
   one of our most earnest Brothers, one of our most fervent Sisters! I
   hope that I am speaking to some such tonight--utter strangers as yet,
   who will be brought into this Church, or into some other Church of
   Jesus Christ--and become not a whit behind the very chief of the
   Apostles, though as yet they are not numbered with the household of
   faith!

   II. But now, in the second place, I have a sad task. The other was a
   glad task, but now I have the sad task of noticing THE NEAR ONES FAR
   OFF.

   Here, first, we read that many were troubled about Christ. He was but
   newly born and yet He troubled them. Herod was troubled and all
   Jerusalem was troubled with him. It is an unusual thing to hear of a
   king troubled by a baby! Proud Herod, the fire-eater, troubled by a
   Babe in swaddling bands, lying in a manger? Ah me! How little is the
   real greatness of wickedness--and how small a power of goodness may
   bring it grief! Herod was troubled and all Jerusalem with Him. So, when
   some people hear the Gospel, and find that it has power in it, they are
   troubled. Herod was troubled because he feared that he should lose his
   throne. He thought that the house of David, in the Person of the
   newborn Child, would take possession of his throne, so he trembled and
   was troubled. How many there are who think that if religion is true,
   they will lose by it! Business will suffer. There are some businesses
   that ought to suffer and as true godliness spreads, they will suffer. I
   need not indicate them, but those who are engaged in them usually feel
   that they had better cry out, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians," for
   they get their living by making and selling her shrines--and if their
   shrines are in danger and their craft is in danger--then they are
   troubled. There are such. I have known men who have been leaders in
   sin, ringleaders in sin, and they have thought that they would lose
   some of their followers through Christ's coming, so they have been
   troubled.

   But all Jerusalem was troubled with Herod. Why was that? It was most
   probably because they thought there would be contention. If there was a
   new King born, there would be a fight between Him and Herod, and there
   would be trouble for Jerusalem. So there are some men who say, "Do not
   bring that religion here! It makes such contention. One believes this,
   and one believes that, and another believes nothing at all. We shall
   have trouble in the family if we get religion into it." Yes, you
   will--that is acknowledged in the Scriptures--for our Lord came to
   bring fire on the earth. He has come with a sword in His hand, on
   purpose, to fight against everything that is evil--and there will be
   contention. I do not wonder that the great lovers of ease are troubled!

   But the fact is that many are troubled because the Gospel interferes
   with their sin. "If I become a Christian, I cannot live as I have been
   accustomed to live," says one, "so I will not believe the Gospel." The
   great argument against the Bible is an ungodly life. If you probe to
   the bottom of the matter, some sinful pleasure is the reason of many a
   man's infidelity. There is a practical reason against his repenting--he
   cannot give up his darling sin--he will not give it up, so he is trou-

   bled when Christ comes near. It is a terrible thing to cling to sin.
   That Spartan boy who caught a young fox and carried it in his bosom and
   then, lest the schoolmaster should see it, and chastise him, allowed
   the fox to go on eating into his flesh till it ate into his heart, is
   like you. You are hugging this fox, this wolf, this asp to your bosom
   all the while we are preaching to you! What comfort can we give you?
   Quit your sin, or quit all hope! Will you have your sin and go to Hell,
   or will you leave your sin and go to Heaven? You cannot have Christ and
   sin--the two are diametrically opposed. I will not mention what your
   sin may be. Let your own conscience tell you that. You cannot continue
   in the practice of any known sin, willfully and deliberately, and yet
   find any comfort from the Word of God, or from the Gospel! There must
   be, in your heart's intent and resolve, the quitting of sin, or there
   cannot be the finding of the Savior!

   I have told you, before, of the two Highlanders who wanted to row
   across a certain inlet on one occasion. They had been largely helping
   themselves to whisky before they got into the boat, but they began to
   row and they kept on rowing, but they made no progress. They could not
   understand how it was that, with all their rowing, they stayed in the
   same position till one said, "Sandy, did you pull the anchor up?" No,
   he had never pulled the anchor up, so there they were, with the anchor
   down and pulling away to no purpose! You must have that anchor up,
   young man, whether it is drink, or lust, or gambling, or pilfering. You
   are a fool if you pretend to row when you know that the anchor is still
   sticking in the mud!

   Oftentimes, when a man is troubled about religion, he says, "If I
   become a Christian, I shall have to give up my pleasure." Not that true
   religion requires us to give up anything which is real pleasure or, if
   it makes us give up what affords us pleasure, now, it changes our
   tastes so that it would no longer be a pleasure we could indulge. True
   religion gives us new pleasures--it takes away our halfpence and it
   gives us golden coin instead! It does better than that, but I cannot
   employ a figure good enough to describe the change! True religion never
   was designed to make our pleasures less and it does not make them less.
   But still some think that it will do so and, hence their trouble. You
   would be astonished if you knew why some men oppose true religion. The
   wife will not go to a place of worship. There shall not be a Bible in
   the house. They will not have their boy attending a Chapel where there
   is a Prayer Meeting, or they will not allow the master where he is
   apprenticed, to take the boy with him to the House of God. Men say and
   do all sorts of strange things when they are troubled by Christ--and it
   is not because they have any real ground for their perplexity. They are
   troubled about Christ very much for the same reason that Herod and
   Jerusalem were troubled about Him, certainly for no better reason.

   Well now, this is very sad, that the Gospel, which is meant to be good
   news to men, should trouble them! That the heavenly offer of Free Grace
   should trouble them. That to have Heaven's gate widely open before them
   should trouble them. That to be asked to wash themselves or to be
   washed in the blood of Christ should trouble them. Troubled by Infinite
   Mercy! Troubled by Almighty Love! Yet such is the depravity of human
   nature that to many who hear the Gospel every day, it is still nothing
   but a trouble to them.

   Now there is another case here. It is the same man in another
   character. There is one who plays the hypocrite. "Yes," he says, "there
   is one who is born King of the Jews. Will you wise men kindly tell me
   all about it? You say you saw a star? When did the star appear? Be very
   particular. Did you take note of its movements? You say you saw it, and
   you saw it, and you saw it? What time in the evening was it first
   visible? What day of the month did it appear?" Herod is very particular
   in getting all the information that he can about that star. And now he
   sends for the doctors of divinity, and the scribes, and the priests,
   and he says, "When ought this Messiah that you talk about to be born,
   and where ought He to be born? Tell me." Herod, you see, is a wonderful
   disciple, is he not? He is sitting at the feet of the doctors. He is
   willing to be instructed by the magi and then he finishes up by saying
   to the wise men, "Go now. You go and worship the newborn King. You are
   quite right to have come all this distance to worship this Child. Be
   particular, too, to take notes as to where you find Him and then come
   and tell me about Him, that I, also, may go and worship Him."

   So we always find that where Christ is, there is a Judas somewhere
   about. If the Gospel comes to any place, there is a certain number of
   persons who say, "Oh, yes, yes, yes, we shall attend that place!" I
   know a certain town where there is one true preacher of the Gospel, who
   has won many to Christ--but there are a great many who go there who
   know nothing at all about Christ. Of course they go to what is called,
   "The Tabernacle," in that place, because it is the right place to
   attend! I know a town where there is one Church in which Evangelical
   Doctrine is preached, and the good people all used to go to, "St.
   Peter's." It was a kind of patent of respectability to have a pew at
   St. Peter's because good Evangeli-

   cal Doctrine was preached there! Well now, that is just how it is with
   some persons nowadays. A certain number of people would think that all
   was wrong with them if they did not hear sound Doctrine, but all the
   while they have made up their minds that sound Doctrine shall never
   change their lives and shall never affect their inward character! They
   are hypocrites--just as this man, Herod, was! They will not have Christ
   to reign over them! They do not mind hearing about Him. They do not
   mind acknowledging, to a certain extent, His rights, but they will not
   yield allegiance to Him--they will not practically submit to His rule
   and become believers in Him. Am I not speaking to some such, tonight? I
   know that I am! Dear Friends, do not stay in that state, I pray you!
   You do not wish to be called a hypocrite--well then, if you cannot bear
   to be called by that name, do not be such a character. Be true! Come to
   Christ, bow at His feet, accept Him as your Lord, trust Him to save you
   and then rejoice in Him as your Savior and King!

   But there were other characters beside the hypocrite who were troubled
   and they wore the men who displayed their learning. These were the
   scribes and the chief priests who looked in their Bibles and turned up
   that passage of the Prophet which said where Jesus was to be born. Now,
   I like these people for looking up their Bibles and studying the
   Scriptures--but what I do not like in them is that while they told
   Herod that Christ was to be born at Bethlehem, none of them said that
   they would go to Bethlehem and worship Him! Not a living soul of them,
   not a scribe or a chief priest said, "If this is the Messiah, who was
   to be born at Bethlehem--and this remarkable star makes us believe that
   it is even so--we will go with the wise men and worship Him." No, not
   they! They were quite content to have the Sacred Roll and read it and
   know all about the Truth of God, and yet to leave it there!

   I used to know, in my youth, certain very sound Calvinistic Brothers. I
   fancy that they were a little too sound, certainly sixteen ounces to
   the pound with an ounce or two of bone thrown in and, after they had
   had a glass or two of beer, they could talk over Scripture better than
   they could before. I think that the most of those people sleep in the
   dust. I hope that the whole tribe will--I mean those who live only upon
   talking sound Doctrine without feeling the power of it. But nowadays I
   meet people "mighty in the Scriptures," yes, and very keen, too, upon
   Doctrine, who--

   "Could a hair divide

   Betwixt the west and northwest side," as regards points of Divinity,
   but as to charity to the poor, as to visiting the needy, as to caring
   for the souls of men, as to holy living and as to prevalence in prayer
   with God, they are nowhere at all! I pray you to dread a religion which
   is all in the Book! You must have it in the heart--you must have it in
   the life--or else this Child that was born at Bethlehem will only
   affect you so far that you turn over the Books of Scripture, and that
   is an end of the matter so far as you are concerned. Yes, yes, yes,
   know your Bible, that is good! But practice what your Bible tells you,
   for that is better! Yes, yes, yes, understand the Doctrines of Grace,
   be clear upon them--but love them, live them--for that is far better.
   Yes, yes, yes, be a sound Divine, but let us see a holy humanity about
   you as well. God grant that it may be so! Otherwise, I tell you, your
   book-learning will still leave you an enemy of Christ!

   The saddest point is that none of these people sought Christ--not Herod
   with his hypocrisy, nor Jerusalem with its troubles, nor the scribes
   and priests with their ancient knowledge--none of them sought Christ!
   May God grant that no hearer of mine may be on that black list! Oh, may
   we all seek Jesus! May we all find Him! May we find Him tonight! We
   shall seek and find Him if we really felt in our hearts that hymn that
   we sang just before the sermon--

   "I need You, precious Jesus!

   For I am full of sin.

   My soul is dark and guilty,

   My heart is dead within.

   I need the cleansing fountain,

   Where I can always flee,

   The blood of Christ most precious,

   The sinner's perfect plea."

   There are two prayers with which I wish to close my discourse. One is,
   "Lord, bring the far-off ones near tonight!" May I beg the thousands of
   Israel present, tonight, to pray that prayer? You cannot tell for whom
   you are praying, but you need not know. There may be persons here who
   are as far from God as they can be. To them I give this text, the word
   of our exalted Savior and Lord, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all
   the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else." Look,
   look, look, look! Sinner, look unto Him and be saved!--

   "There is life for a look at the crucified One, There is life at this
   moment for you." "For you." "For you." Then look! Look now and find it
   to be so!--

   "There is life at this moment for you."

   The other prayer, and I ask my Brothers and Sisters here who have power
   in prayer to pray it, is, "Lord, bring the near ones really near--these
   many who are always in this House and yet not in Christ!" No, I must
   not say these "many"--I mean these few--for there are now few who are
   in that condition. Lord, bring them in! One came the other Monday and
   said, "I am one of the few. I have been attending the Tabernacle for
   many years and yet I have never told you that I have found the Savior."
   And he came to confess his Master. There are still some few of that
   sort. Lord, bring them all in! You who are always hearers only,
   remember that text, "Many shall come from the east and west, and shall
   sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven.
   But the children of the Kingdom"--that is, you people who have heard
   the Gospel ever since you were children--"the children of the Kingdom
   shall be cast out." Pushed aside--"cast out into outer darkness. There
   shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Pray that it may not be so
   with one single hearer of mine tonight, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON. MATTHEW 2:1-12.

   Verses 1, 2. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
   of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the East to
   Jerusalem, saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For
   we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him.
   Observe here that when the Son of God was born into the world, it was
   in a very lowly village, the village of Bethlehem. Very naturally, the
   wise men supposed that "the King of the Jews" would be born in the
   palace, in the metropolis of the country, at Jerusalem. But it pleased
   the Lord that everything about Christ's birth should have the stamp of
   lowliness, that the poorest and humblest of men might understand that
   Christ took not upon Him the nature of princes, but the nature of
   men--not of the great ones of the earth, but of our common humanity.
   Hence Jesus was born of a lowly virgin and was but roughly cradled in a
   manger, and the village chosen as the place of His birth was Bethlehem,
   well-named the, "house of bread," for it is there that the Bread of our
   souls is found.

   The Holy Child Jesus was born "in the days of Herod the king." The last
   spark of sovereignty was just dying out. Herod, an alien, held the
   kingdom under the Roman Empire. Did not old Jacob's prophecy say, "The
   scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his
   feet, until Shiloh comes"? Therefore is it expressly mentioned that
   Jesus was born "in the days of Herod the king." We must also remember
   that although our Lord's birth is full of every circumstance of
   humiliation, it has a wondrous glory about it. The Magi, probably from
   Persia--"wise men," philosophers and theologians--heard in far-off
   lands of His fame and a star led them to His feet. "There came wise men
   from the East." They supposed that the birth of Christ would be well
   known among the Jews and be a common theme of conversation. So, when
   they reached Jerusalem, they enquired, "Where is He who has been born
   King of the Jews?" Ah, when the heart is awakened to the love of
   Christ, it often dreams that everybody else feels an equal interest in
   Him, but it is not so! The world is dead and cold to Christ and men
   look astonished when we ask the question, "Where is He? We have seen
   His star in the East and have come to worship Him." These wise men were
   not Unitarians who disbelieved the Deity of Christ. It has been said by
   some that they only meant that they came to pay Him the homage of a
   king. Then why did they not worship Herod, and why did Herod say that
   he wished to worship Him? It will not do, the thought is not to be
   endured for a single moment! The magi believed that He who was born
   King of the Jews was more than a human being-- and they had come to
   worship him.

   3. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all
   Jerusalem with him. The wise men brought the best news that ever was
   told and yet it troubled people! Does the Gospel trouble you, my
   Friend? Then I am afraid you must be of Herod's kith and kin. It is an
   ill sign of a man's heart when that which is for the good of all men
   becomes a trouble to him! It is an ill stomach that turns good meat to
   poison. I suppose "all Jerusalem" was troubled with Herod because they
   knew that whenever this gloomy tyrant had a fit upon him, he was sure
   to draw blood somewhere-- therefore they were troubled with him.

   4. And when he had gathered all the chiefpriests and scribes of the
   people together, he inquired of them where Christ was to be born. Think
   of this vile wretch taking to studying his Bible! Yet there are some
   who still do the same. Reckoning that gain is godliness and, therefore,
   turning godliness into gain for sinister motives, they would be
   religious and wish to be instructed in the Truths of the Bible. Such
   was Herod--so he gathered all the chief priests and scribes together
   and inquired of them where Christ was to be born.

   5, 6. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is
   written by the Prophet, And you Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are
   not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of you shall come a
   Governor that shall rule My people Israel. Now, you see, what Herod did
   with an ill design was overruled for good, for thus we know on the
   highest authority that Christ was born at Bethlehem! The chief priests
   and scribes, great students of the Law of God, when they were assembled
   in the presence of Herod, declared that, according to prophecy, Christ
   was to be born in Bethlehem.

   7, 8. Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, enquired
   of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to
   Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young Child; and
   when you have found Him, bring me word, again, that I may come and
   worship Him also. Covering his bloody design with the pretense of
   reverence. There is never a worse sin in the world than that which a
   man covers over with the cloak of religion! Let us always beware of
   falling into this evil.

   9, 10. When they had heard the king, they departed and, lo, the star,
   which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood
   over where the young Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced
   with exceedingly great joy. You see, the light of the star was taken
   from them for a time, just as sometimes the delightful Presence of God
   is withdrawn from His people. Then, Beloved, you walk by faith, alone,
   and not by sight, as these men did. But oh, when the Light of God comes
   back, again--when, after hearing all the chattering of false priests
   and scribes, and all the talk of Herod the great one, they see the star
   again--how glad they are! When God sends to His people clear shinings
   after rain--the brightness of His Presence, after a time of gloom--then
   is it with them its it was with the wise men, "they rejoiced with
   exceedingly great joy."

   11. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young Child
   with Mary, His mother, and fell down and worshipped Him. The old
   Reformers used to say, "Here is a bone that sticks in the throat of the
   Romanists and they can neither get it up nor down, for it does not say,
   'They saw Mary and the young Child.' The young Child is put first--they
   came to see Him--and it does not say that 'they fell down and
   worshipped them.' If ever there was an opportunity for Mariolatry,
   surely this was the one--when the Child was, as yet, newly-born and
   depended so much upon His mother. Why did not the magi say, 'Ave
   Maria!' and commence at once their Mariolatry?" Yes, but these were
   wise men--they were not priests from Rome, otherwise they might have
   done it.

   11. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him
   gifts of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. The best they had! Presents
   fit for a King--offered as the tribute of the country from which they
   came--gold, and frankincense, and myrrh being found in the East. It is
   well to bring to Christ the best we have, and the best of the
   best--"gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."

   12. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
   Herod, they departed to their own country another

   way.

Satan Departing, Angels Ministering

   (No. 2326)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   15, 1889.

   "And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from Him
   for a season." Luke 4:13.

   "Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto
   Him."

   Matthew 4:11.

   BELOVED Friends, we have very much to learn from our Lord's temptation.
   He was tempted in all points, like as we are. If you will study the
   temptation of Christ, you will not be ignorant of Satan's devices. If
   you see how He worsted the enemy, you will learn what weapons to use
   against your great adversary. If you see how our Lord conquers
   throughout the whole battle, you will learn that, as you keep close to
   Him, you will be more than conqueror through Him that loved you. From
   our Lord's temptation we learn, especially, to pray, "Lead us not into
   temptation." Let us never mistake the meaning of that petition! We are
   to pray that we may not be tempted, for we are poor flesh and blood and
   very frail. It is for us to cry to God, "Lead us not into temptation."
   But we also learn a great deal from the close of our Lord's great
   threefold trial. We find Him, afterwards, peaceful--ministered unto by
   angels--and rejoicing. That should teach us to pray, "But, if we must
   be tempted, deliver us from the evil," or, as some render it, and very
   correctly, too, "Deliver us from the Evil One." First, we pray that we
   may not be tempted at all and then, as a supplement to that prayer,
   yielding the whole matter to Divine Wisdom, "If it is necessary for our
   manhood, for our growth in Grace, for the verification of our Graces
   and for God's Glory, that we should be tempted, Lord, deliver us from
   the evil, and especially deliver us from the impersonation of evil, the
   Evil One!"

   With that as an introduction, for a short time, tonight, let me call
   upon you to notice in our text, first, the devil leaving the tempted
   One--"Then the devil left Him." Secondly, we shall keep to Matthew's
   Gospel and notice the angels ministering to the tempted One after the
   fallen angel had left Him. And then, thirdly, the limitation of the
   rest which we may expect--the limitation of the time in which Satan
   will be gone--for Luke puts it, "When the devil had ended all the
   temptation, he departed from Him for a season," or, as some put it,
   "until a fit opportunity," when he would, again, return, and our great
   Lord and Master would once more be tried by his wicked wiles.

   I. First, we have as the subject for our happy consideration, THE DEVIL
   LEAVING THE TEMPTED ONE.

   When did the devil leave our Lord? When he had finished the temptation.
   It must have been a great relief to our Divine Master when Satan left
   Him. The very air must have been more pure and fit to be breathed. His
   soul must have felt a great relief when the evil spirit had gone
   away--but he went not, we are told, until he had finished all the
   temptation. So Luke puts it--"When the devil had ended all the
   temptation, he departed from Him for a season." Satan will not go till
   he has shot the last arrow from his quiver. Such is his malice that as
   long as he can tempt, he will tempt. His will desires our total
   destruction, but his power is not equal to his will. God does not give
   him power such as he would like to possess--there is always a limit set
   to his assaults. When Satan has tempted you throughout and ended all
   his temptation, then he will leave you. You have not yet undergone all
   forms of temptation, so you may not expect absolutely and altogether to
   be left by the arch-enemy.

   It may be a long time, when you are suffering from his attacks, before
   he will hold his hand, for he will try all that he possibly can to lead
   you into evil and to destroy the Grace that is in you. Still, he does
   come to an end with his temptations sooner than he desires, for, as God
   has said to the mighty sea, "Until this time shall you come, but no
   further; and

   here shall your proud waves be stayed"--and so says He to the devil.
   When He permitted Satan to try the Graces of Job and to prove his
   sincerity, He let him go just so far, but no farther. And when he asked
   for a further stretch of power, still there was a limit. There is
   always a limit to Satan's power and when he reaches that point, he will
   be pulled up short--he can do no more. You are never so in the hands of
   Satan as to be out of the hands of God. You are never so tempted, if
   you are a Believer, that there is not a way of escape for you! God
   permits you to be tried for many reasons which, perhaps, you could not
   altogether understand, but which His infinite wisdom understands for
   you. But He will not suffer the rod of the wicked to rest upon the lot
   of the righteous. It may fall there, but it shall not rest there. The
   Lord may let you be put into the fire, but the fire shall be heated no
   hotter than you are able to bear. "When the devil had ended all the
   temptation, he departed from Him."

   Satan did not depart from Christ, however, until he had also failed in
   every temptation. When the Lord had foiled him at every point--had met
   every temptation with a text of Holy Scripture and had proved His own
   determination to hold fast His integrity and not let it go--it was not
   till then that the enemy departed. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, if you can
   hold out, if you can stand against this and then, against, that. If you
   are protected against frowns and protected against flatteries. If you
   are protected against prosperity and against adversity. If you are
   protected against sly insinuations and open attacks--when you have won
   the day, as by God's Grace you will do, even as your Master did--then
   the enemy will depart from you! "Well," says one, "I wish that he would
   depart from me, for I have been sorely troubled by him," to which I say
   most heartily, "Amen."

   Let us think, for a minute or two, about when Satan will depart from
   the child of God, as he did from the great Son

   of God.

   I have no doubt that he will do that when he finds that it is necessary
   for him to be somewhere else. Satan is not everywhere and cannot be,
   for he is not Divine. He is not Omnipresent, but, as one has said,
   although he is not everywhere present, it would be hard to say where he
   is not, for he moves so swiftly, he is such an agile spirit, that he
   seems to be here and there and everywhere. And where he is not in
   person, he is represented by that vast host--the legions of fallen
   spirits who are under his control. And even where they are not, he
   carries out his evil devices so that he leaves the leaven to work, the
   evil seeds to grow when he, himself, has gone elsewhere. Yet it is,
   probably, not many times in one's life that any man is actually called
   into conflict with Satan, himself, personally. There are too many of
   us, now, for him to give all his time and strength to one--he has to be
   somewhere else. Oh, I long to be the means of multiplying the number of
   God's people by the preaching of the Word of God, that the Gospel of
   the Grace of God may fly abroad and bring in myriads--that the devil
   may have more to do and, therefore, not be able to give so much of his
   furious attention, as he does in one direction and another, to the
   children of God!

   He also leaves God's people very quickly when he sees that they are
   sustained by superior Grace. He hopes to catch them when Grace is at a
   low ebb. If he can come upon them when faith is very weak, when hope's
   eyes are dim, when love has grown cold--then he thinks that he will
   make an easy capture. But when we are filled with the Spirit as the
   Master was, (God grant that we may be), he looks us up and down and he
   presently leaves. Like an old pirate who hangs about on the lookout for
   merchant vessels, but if he meets with ships that have plenty of guns
   on board and hardy hands to give him a warm reception, he goes after
   some other craft not quite so well able to resist his assaults. Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, be not merely Christians, only barely Christians,
   with just enough Grace to let you see your imperfections, but pray to
   God to give you mighty Grace, that you may "be strong in the Lord, and
   in the power of His might," so that, after the devil has tested you and
   found that the Lord is with you, that God dwells in you, then you may
   expect that, as it was with your Master, so it will be with you--Satan
   will leave you.

   Sometimes I think, however, that Satan personally leaves us because he
   knows that not to be tempted is, to some men, a greater danger than to
   be tempted! "Oh," you say, "how can that be?" Brothers, Sisters, do you
   know nothing of carnal security, of being left, as you think, to grow
   in Grace and to be very calm, very happy and, as you hope, very useful
   and to find beneath you a sea of glass with not a ripple on the wave?
   "Yes," you say, "I do know that experience and I have been thankful for
   it." Have you never found creeping over you, at the same time, the idea
   that you are somebody, that you are getting wonderfully experienced,
   that you are an eminent child of God, rich and increased in goods? And
   have you not said, like David, "I shall never be moved"?

   Possibly you have looked askance on some of your friends who have been
   trembling and timid and crying to God, from day to day, to keep them.
   You have been Sir Mighty--you have been Lord Great-One and everybody
   must bow down before you! Ah, yes, you have now fallen into a worse
   condition than even those are in who are tempted of Satan! A calm in
   the tropics is more to be dreaded than a tempest! In such a calm
   everything gets to be still and stagnant, the ship scarcely moves. It
   is like a painted ship on a painted sea and it gets to be in something
   like the state described by Coleridge's Ancient Mariner--

   "The very deep did rot-- Alas, that ever this should be! And slimy
   things with legs did crawl Over the slimy sea."

   "Oh," you say, "that is horrible!" Yes, and that is the tendency of a
   soul that is at peace with itself and is not emptied from vessel to
   vessel. I fear that is often the case with those who believe themselves
   to be supernaturally holy. A curious fact can be proven by abundant
   evidence, namely, that the boast of human perfection is closely
   followed by obscenity and licentiousness! The most unclean sects that
   have ever defaced the page of history have been founded by those who
   had the notion that they were beyond temptation, that they had ceased
   to sin and could never transgress again. "Ah," says Satan, "this notion
   does my work a great deal better than tempting a man! When I tempt him,
   then he stands up to resist me. He has his eyes open, he grasps his
   sword and puts on his helmet. He cries to God, "Lord, help me!' And he
   watches night and day--and the more tempted he is--the more he looks to
   God for strength. But if I leave him quite alone and he goes to sleep,
   well, then, he is not in the battle! And if he begins to feel quite
   secure, then I can steal in upon him unawares and make a speedy end of
   him." This is one reason why Satan leaves some men untempted. A roaring
   devil is better than a sleeping devil--and there is no temptation much
   worse than that of never being tempted at all.

   Again, I doubt not that Satan leaves us--no, I know that he does--when
   the Lord says to him what He said in the wilderness, "Get you hence,
   Satan." And He does say that when He sees one of His poor children
   dragged about, tortured, wounded, bleeding. He says, "Get you hence,
   Satan. I permit you to fetch in My stray sheep; but not to worry them
   to death. Get you hence, Satan." The old Hell-dog knows his Master and
   he flies at once.

   This voice of God will come when the Lord sees that we cast ourselves
   wholly upon Him. In my Brother's prayer, he suggested to us, if you
   remember, that in casting our burden upon the Lord, we might not be
   able to get rid of it. The way was to cast ourselves and our burden,
   both, upon the Lord. The best way of all is to get rid of the burden
   entirely, to cast yourself, but without your burden, upon the Lord! Let
   me remind you of a story that I once told you, of a gentleman who,
   riding along in his coach, saw a packman carrying a heavy pack, and
   asked him if he would like a ride. "Yes, and thank you, Sir." But he
   kept his pack on his back while riding. "Oh," said the friend, "why do
   you not take your pack off and put it down in front?" "Why, Sir," he
   said, "it is so kind of you to give me a ride that I do not like to
   impose upon your good nature, and I thought that I would carry the pack
   myself!" "Well," said the other, "but, you see, it makes no difference
   to me whether you carry it or do not carry it--I have to carry you and
   your pack--so you had better unstrap it and put it down in front."

   So, Friend, when you cast your burden upon God, unstrap it! Why should
   you bear it yourself when God is prepared to bear it? Beloved, there
   are times when we forget that, but when we can come and absolutely
   yield ourselves right up, saying, "Lord, here I am, tempted, poor and
   weak. But I come and rest in You. I know not what to ask at Your hands,
   but Your servant has said, 'Cast your burden upon the Lord, and He
   shall sustain you: He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.' I
   lie at your feet, my Lord. Here I am, here would I be. Do with me as
   seems good in Your sight--only deal in tender mercy with Your servant."
   Then will the Lord rebuke the enemy! The waves of the sea shall be
   still and there shall be a great calm.

   So much for the devil leaving the tempted One. He does so, he must do
   so, when God commands it.

   II. But now, secondly, let us think Of THE ANGELS MINISTERING TO THE
   TEMPTED ONE.

   The angels came and ministered to our Lord after Satan was gone. Notice
   that they did not come while our Lord was in the battle. Why not? Why,
   because it was necessary that He should tread the winepress alone, and
   because it was more glorious for Him that of the people there should be
   none with Him! Had there been any angels there to help Him in the duel
   with the adversary, they might have shared the honor of the victory,
   but they must stay away till the fight is over. But when the foe is
   gone, then the angels come. It has been noted that it does not say that
   the angels came very often and

   ministered to Jesus, as much as to make us think that they were always
   near, that they hovered within earshot, watching, and ready to
   interpose if they might. They were a bodyguard round about our Lord,
   even as they are, today, about His people, for, "are they not all
   ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs
   of salvation?" But the moment that the fight was over, then the angels
   came and ministered to Christ. Why was that?

   I suppose, first, because, as Man, He was especially exhausted. He was
   hungry, we are told, and that proves exhaustion. But, besides that, the
   strain offorty days' temptation must have been immense! Men can bear up
   under a strain, but when it is eased, then they fall. Elijah can do
   marvels. He can strike the priests of Baal and behave like a hero, but,
   after it is all over, Elijah fails! As Man, our Lord was subject to the
   sinless infirmities of our flesh, and it was necessary that angels
   should come and minister to Him, even as the angel did in the Garden,
   after the agony and bloody sweat.

   But it was also because, being Man, He was to partake of the ministry
   which God had allotted to man. He has appointed angels to watch over
   His own people and, inasmuch as Jesus is our Brother, as the children
   were partakers of the ministry of angels, He, Himself, also took part
   with the same that He might show how He took our weakness upon Him and,
   therefore, needed and received that succor which the Father has
   promised to all His children.

   Was it not, again, because He was so beloved of the angels and they
   were so loyal to Him? They must have been amazed when they saw Him born
   on earth and living here in poverty! And when they saw Him tempted of
   the enemy, they must have loathed the adversary. How could Satan be
   permitted to come so near their pure and holy Master? I think that
   Milton could have pictured this scene and that he would have drawn
   every seraph there as longing to let his sword of flame find a scabbard
   in the heart of the foul fiend that dared to come so near to the Prince
   of purity! But they must not interfere. Yet, as soon as they might,
   then they joyfully came and ministered to Him.

   And does it not also go to show that His was a Nature very sensitive to
   the angelic touch? You and I are coarse, hardhearted--

   "Myriads of spirits throng the air-- They are about us now."

   Women are to cover their heads in worship "because of the angels."
   There are many acts of decorum in holy worship that are to be kept up
   "because of the angels." They are innumerable. They are sent to
   minister to us, but we are not aware of them--often we do not perceive
   them. But Jesus was all tenderness and sensitiveness--and He knew that
   the angels were there, so it was easy for them to come and minister to
   Him. What they did in ministering to Him, we cannot tell. I should
   certainly think that they sustained His bodily Nature, for He was
   hungry and they readily brought food to Him. But they also sustained
   His mental and His spiritual Nature with words of comfort. The sight of
   them reminded Him of His Father's house, reminded Him of the Glory
   which He had laid aside. The sight of them proved that the Father did
   not forget Him. He had sent the household troops of Heaven to succor
   and support Him. The sight of them must have made Him anticipate the
   day of which the poet sings--

   "They brought His chariot from above, To bear Him to His Throne--
   Clapped their triumphant wings and cried, 'The glorious work is done!'"

   Well now, Brothers and Sisters, if we are tempted, shall we have any
   angels to succor us? Well, we shall certainly have the equivalent of
   angels! Oftentimes, after a temptation, God sends His human messengers.
   Many of you can tell how, when you have been hearing the Word after a
   bad time of temptation, the Gospel message has been wonderfully sweet
   to you. You have sat in your pew and said, "God sent that sermon on
   purpose for me." Or, if you have not had a sermon, you have read the
   Bible and the Words have seemed to burn and glow on the page! And you
   have warmed your soul by their heat. Has it not been so with you often?
   Are not all the holy things more sweet after trial than they were
   before? Have you not found them so? I bear my willing witness that
   never does Christ seem so precious, never do the promises seem so rich
   and rare, never does Evangelical Doctrine cling so closely to my heart,
   and my heart to it, as after a time of painful trial when I have been
   laid aside from holy service and racked with anguish! Oh, then the
   angels come and minister to us, in the form of men who preach the Word,
   or in the form of the living page of God's written Word!

   I have noticed, too, that God sometimes cheers His tempted people with
   clear sunshine after rain, by some very gracious Providences. Something
   happens that they could not have looked for--so pleasant, so altogether
   helpful--that they have had to burst into singing, though just before
   they had been sighing! The cage door was set wide open and

   God's bird has had such a flight and sung so sweetly, as it mounted up
   to Heaven, that the soul seemed transformed into a holy lark in its
   ascending music! Have you not found the Lord very gracious to you after
   some severe trial, or some strong temptation? I believe that this will
   be the testimony of many experienced Christians.

   And, as these choice Providences come, so, I do not doubt, there also
   come actual angels ministering to us, though we are unaware of their
   presence. They can suggest holy thoughts, I doubt not, to bring us
   comfort. But, above the angels, far superior to angelic help, is the
   Holy Spirit, the Comforter! How sweetly can He close up every wound and
   make it even sing as it heals! He makes the bones that God had broken
   to rejoice and fills us with a deeper experience of delight than we
   have ever known before!

   Well now, I suppose that some of you here, tonight, are in this
   condition--that Satan has left you and angels are ministering to you.
   If so, you are very happy. Bless your God for it! There is a great
   calm. Thank God for the calm after the storm. I hope, my Brothers and
   Sisters, that you are the stronger for what you have endured, and that
   the conflict has matured you, and prepared you for something better.
   Now, what did our Lord do after the devil had left Him and the angels
   had come to minister to Him? Did He go home and stay there and begin to
   sing of His delightful experiences? No, we find Him preaching directly
   afterwards, full of the Spirit of God. He went everywhere, proclaiming
   the Kingdom of God. He was found in the synagogue, or on the hillside.
   Just in proportion as the Spirit of God had enabled Him to overcome the
   enemy, we find Him going forth to spend that strength in the service of
   His Lord!

   O tempted one, have you a respite? Spend that respite for Him who gave
   it to you! Is it calm, now, after a storm? Go, now, and sow your fields
   with the good Seed! Have you wiped your eyes and are the salt tears
   gone? Go sing a Psalm, then--sing unto your Well-Beloved--and go down
   into His vineyard and take the foxes, and prune the vines, and dig
   about them--and do necessary work for Him who has done so much for you!
   Listen! You have been set free! There are many under bondage to
   Satan--not as you are, fighting against him--but his willing slaves.
   Oh, come, my Brothers and Sisters--your God has set you free--go after
   them! Go after the fallen woman and the drunken man. Go, seek and find
   the most debauched, the most depraved. Specially look after any of your
   own house who have played the prodigal--

   "Oh, come, let us go and find them! In the paths of death they roam--
   At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say, 'I have brought some
   lost one home!'" And it will be right to say it, if the Lord has dealt
   so well with you.

   III. Now, I have to close by reminding you of the third point, which is
   a searching truth, namely, THE LIMITATION OF OUR REST. Satan left
   Christ "for a season," or until a fit occasion.

   Did the devil assail our Lord again? I am not sure that he personally
   did, but he did so in many ways by others. I notice that, before long,
   he tried to entangle Him in His speech. That is a very easy thing to do
   with us. Somebody, tonight, can take up something that I have said,
   twist it from its connection, and make it sound and seem totally
   different from what was meant by it. You know how the Herodians, the
   Sadducees, and the Pharisees did this with our Lord--they tried to
   entangle Him in His speech. In all of that, Satan led them on. Satan
   also actively opposed Christ's ministry and Christ opposed Satan--but
   Jesus won the day, for He saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven!

   A more artful plan, still, was that by which the devil's servants, the
   demons that were cast out of possessed persons, called Jesus the Son of
   God. He rebuked them because He did not want any testimony from them.
   No doubt the devil thought it a very cunning thing to praise the
   Savior--then the Savior's friends would begin to be suspicious of Him
   if He was praised by the devil. This was a deep trick, but the Master
   made him hold his peace. You remember how He said on one occasion,
   "Hold your peace, and come out of him"? It was something like this,
   "Down dog! Come out!" Christ is never very polite with Satan--a few
   words and very strong ones are all that are necessary for this
   arch-prince of wickedness!

   Satan tempted our Lord through Peter. That is a plan that he has often
   tried with us, setting a friend of ours to do his dirty work. Peter
   took his Lord and rebuked Him, when He spoke about being spit upon and
   put to death. And then the Lord said, "Get you behind Me, Satan!" He
   could see the devil using Peter's tenderness to try to take Him off
   from His Self-sacrifice. Oh, how often has Satan tempted us that way,
   entangling us in our speech, opposing us in our work, praising us out
   of wicked motives to try to deceive us and then setting up some friend
   to try to take us off from holy self-denial!

   There were also occasional heart-sinking in our Lord. Thus we read in
   John 12:27, "Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father,
   save Me from this hour?" He seems to have been very heavy in heart at
   that time. But the deepest soul-sinking was when, in the Garden, His
   soul was "exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death." Satan had a hand in
   that sore trial, for the Lord had said, "The Prince of this world
   comes," and He said to those who came to arrest Him, "This is your hour
   and the power of darkness." It was a dreadful season. Our Lord's
   ministry began and ended with a fierce onslaught from Satan. He left
   Him after the temptation, but only for a season.

   Well now, dear Friends, if we have peace and quietness tonight, and are
   not tempted, do not let us become self-secure. The devil will come to
   us, again, at a fit opportunity. And when will that be? There are a
   great many fit opportunities with you and with me. One is when we have
   nothing to do. You know Dr. Watts' lines--

   "Satan finds some mischief stiil, For idle hands to do."

   He will come and attack us when we are alone. I mean, when we are sad
   and lonely, and are sitting still, and moping by ourselves.

   But Satan also finds a very fit occasion when we are in company,
   especially when it is very mixed company--a company of persons,
   perhaps, who are superior to ourselves in education and in station--but
   who do not fear God. We may easily be overawed and led astray by them.
   Satan will come then.

   I have known him frequently come and find an occasion against the
   children of God when we are sick and ill, the old coward! He knows that
   we would not mind him when we are in good health, but sometimes when we
   are down in the dumps through sickness and pain--then it is that he
   begins to tempt us to despair.

   So will he do with us when we are very poor. When a man has had a great
   loss in business, down comes Satan and insinuates, "Is this how God
   treats His children? God's people are no better off than other people."

   Then, if we are getting on in the world, he turns it the other way, and
   he says, "Does Job fear God for nothing? He gets on by his religion."
   You cannot please the devil and you need not want to please him! He can
   make a temptation for you out of anything!

   I am going to say something that will surprise you. One time of great
   temptation is when we are very spiritual. As to myself, I have never
   been in such supreme danger as when I have led some holy meeting with
   sacred fervor and have felt carried away with delight in God. You know
   that it is easy to be on the Mount of Transfiguration and then to meet
   Satan at the foot, as our Lord did when He came down from that hill.

   Another time of temptation is when we have already done wrong. "Now he
   begins to slip," says Satan. "I saw him trip. Now I will have him
   down!" Oh, for speedy repentance and an earnest flight to Christ
   whenever there has been a grave fault, yes, and before the grave fault
   comes, that we may be preserved from falling!

   And Satan finds a good occasion for tempting us when we have not
   sinned. After we have been tempted and we have won the day and stood
   fast, then he comes and says, "Now, that was well done on your part,
   you are a splendid saint!" And he who thinks himself a splendid saint
   is next door to a shameful sinner, depend upon it! And Satan soon gets
   the advantage over him.

   If you are successful in business or successful in holy work, then
   Satan will tempt you. If you are not successful and have had a bad
   time, then Satan will tempt you. When you have a heavy load to carry,
   he will tempt you. When that load is taken off, then he will tempt you
   worse than ever! He will tempt you when you have obtained some blessing
   that you have been thinking was such a great gift, just as, in the
   wilderness, when they would cry for flesh and said that they must have
   flesh, God gave them their heart's desire--but sent leanness into their
   soul. Just as you have secured the thing that you are seeking, then
   comes a temptation--to which all I have to say is this--"Watch."

   "What I say unto you, I say unto all," said Christ, "Watch. Watch and
   pray, that you enter not into temptation." And by the conflict and the
   victory of your Master, go into the conflict bravely and expect to
   conquer by faith in Him, even as He overcame!

   But what shall I say to those who are the slaves and the friends of
   Satan? The Lord have mercy upon you! If you desire to escape, there is
   only one way! There is the Cross and Christ hangs upon it. Look to
   Jesus! He can set you free. He came on purpose to proclaim liberty to
   the captives. Look and live! Look, now, and live, now! I implore you,
   do it for His dear sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 4:1-15.

   Verse 1. And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit returned from Jordan,
   and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness. "Full of the Holy
   Spirit." And then, led "into the wilderness" to be tempted. You would
   not expect that. Yet it is a sadder thing to be led into a wilderness
   when you are not filled with the Spirit, and a sadder thing to be
   tempted when the Spirit of God is not resting upon you. The temptation
   of our Lord was not one to which He wantonly exposed Himself. He "was
   led by the Spirit into the wilderness." The Spirit of God may lead us
   where we shall have to endure trial. If He does so, we are safe, and we
   shall come away conquerors even as our Master did.

   2. Being forty days tempted of the devil. Six weeks of temptation! We
   read the story of the temptation, perhaps, in six minutes, but it
   lasted for nearly six weeks. "Forty days tempted of the devil."

   2. And in those days He did eat nothing: and when they were ended, He
   afterward was hungry. It does not appear, therefore, that Jesus was
   hungry while He was fasting. He was miraculously sustained during that
   period. After fasting, one looks for deeper spiritual feeling and more
   holy joy. But the most prominent fact, here, is that, "He afterward was
   hungry," Think not that you have lost the benefit of your devout
   exercises when you do not at once feel it. Perhaps the very best thing
   that can happen to you, after much prayer, is a holy hunger. I mean not
   a natural hunger, as it was with our Lord, but a blessed hungering
   after Divine things. "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
   righteousness, for they shall be filled."

   3. And the devil said unto Him, If You are the Son of God, command this
   stone that it be made bread. Satan met the hungry Man and suited the
   temptation to His present pangs, to His special weakness at that
   moment--"If You are the Son of God, command this stone that it be made
   bread." The devil suspected and I think he knew that Jesus was the Son
   of God, but he began the temptation with an, "if." He hissed into the
   Savior's ear--"If You are the Son of God." If you, Believer, can be led
   to doubt your sonship and to fear that you are not a son of God, Satan
   will have begun to win the battle. So he begins to storm the royal fort
   of faith--"If You are the Son of God." Our Lord is the Son of God, but
   then He was suffering as our Substitute--and in that condition He was a
   lone and humble Man. What if I call Him, "a common soldier in the
   ranks"? Satan invites Him to work a miracle of an improper kind on His
   own behalf, but Jesus worked no miracle for Himself. Now, it may be
   that the devil is trying some of you, tonight. You are very poor, or
   business is going very awkwardly, and Satan suggests that you should
   help yourself in an improper manner. He tells you that you can get out
   of your trouble very easily by some action which, although it may not
   be strictly right, may not be so very wrong after all. He said to
   Jesus, "If You are the Son of God, command this stone that it be made
   bread."

   4. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written. That is Christ's
   sword. Look how swiftly He drew it out of its sheath! What a sharp
   two-edged sword is this to be used against Satan! You also, Believer,
   have this powerful weapon in your hand--let no man take it from you.
   Believe in the Inspiration of Scripture. Just now there is a fierce
   attack upon the Book of Deuteronomy. It is a very curious thing that
   all the texts Christ used during the temptation were taken out of
   Deuteronomy, as if that was to be the very armory out of which He would
   select this true Jerusalem blade with which He should overcome the
   tempter, "It is written," "It is written," "It is said."

   4. That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word of God.
   "God can sustain Me without My turning the stone into bread. God can
   bring Me through my trouble without My saying or doing anything wrong.
   I am not dependent upon the outward and visible." If you can feel like
   that. If you can appropriate the promise of God and quote it to Satan,
   saying, "It is written," using it as Christ did, you will come off
   conqueror in the time of temptation even as He

   did!

   5. And the devil. Now he tries Him again. There is wave upon wave
   trying to wash the Son of Man off His feet.

   5. Taking Him up into an high mountain, showed unto Him all the
   kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. Skeptics have asked how that
   could be done. Well, they had better ask him who did it! He knows more
   about them and they know more about him than I do! But he did it. I am
   sure, for here it is written, that he "showed unto Him all the kingdoms
   of the world in a moment of time."

   6. And the devil said unto Him, All this power will I give You, and the
   glory of them: for that is delivered unto and to whomever I will I give
   it. Does not he talk proudly in the presence of his Lord and Master?
   What an audacious dog he must

   have been to howl, thus, in the Presence of Him who could have
   destroyed him by a look or a word, if He had wished to do so!

   7, 8. If You therefore, will worship me, all shall be Yours. And Jesus
   answered and said unto him, Get you behind Me, Satan. The temptation
   annoyed Him--it was so foreign to His holy Nature it vexed His gracious
   spirit--so He cried out indignantly to the tempter, "Get you behind Me,
   Satan."

   8. For it is written. Here flashed forth the sword again.

   8. You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.
   Then let us pay no reverence, no worship to any but God! Consciences
   and minds are made for God, alone--before Him let us bow--and if all
   the world were offered to us for a moment's idolatry, let us not fall
   into the snare of the tempter!

   9. And he brought Him to Jerusalem. Satan now takes Christ to holy
   ground. Temptations are generally more severe there.

   9. And set Him on a pinnacle of the Temple. The highest point of all.
   Elevated high above the earth.

   9-11. And said unto Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down
   from here, for it is written, He shall give His angels charge over You,
   to keep You: and in their hands they shall bear You up, lest at any
   time You dash Your foot against a stone. Now Satan tries to quote
   Scripture, as he can do when it answers his purpose, but he never
   quotes it correctly. You young Brothers who go out preaching, mind that
   you do not imitate the devil by quoting part of a text, or quoting
   Scripture incorrectly! He did it, however, with a purpose--not by
   misadventure or from forgetfulness--he left out the very necessary
   words, "In all Your ways." "He shall give His angels charge over You,
   to keep You in all Your ways." Satan left out those last four words,
   for it was not the way of a child of God to come down from a pinnacle
   of the Temple headlong into the gulf beneath!

   12. And Jesus answering, said unto him, It is said, You shall not tempt
   the Lord your God. Do nothing presumptuously. Do nothing which would
   lead the Lord to act otherwise than according to His settled Laws which
   are always right and good.

   13, 14. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
   from Him for a season. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit
   into Galilee. He had not lost anything by the temptation, "the power of
   the Spirit" was still upon Him.

   14,15. And there went out a fame of Him through all the region round
   about. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. He
   became popular. The people resorted to Him and were glad to hear Him.
   He who has had secret temptation and private conflict is prepared to
   bear open success without being elevated by it. Have you stood foot to
   foot with Satan? You will think little of the applause or of the
   attacks of your fellow men!

The Whole Machinery of Salvation

   (No. 2327)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 18, 1889.

   "How then shall they call on Him in whom they ha ve not believed? And
   ho w shall they believe in Him of whom they ha ve not heard? And how
   shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except
   they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them
   that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good
   things!" Romans 10:14,15.

   PLEASE notice, dear Friends, that in the 13th verse we have the way of
   salvation set before us in the plainest terms-- "Whoever shall call
   upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." I remember well when I lived
   on that verse for many months. I longed for salvation. I could not see
   that there was any way of hope for me. I thought that I must be left
   out, that I was too sinful, or too hard, or too something or other, so
   that others might be saved, but I could not be. But when I read this
   verse, I did what I ask you to do, I caught at it--it seemed like a
   life-line thrown to a sinking man! I clung to it and it became a life
   buoy to me--"Whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
   saved." "Ah," I thought, "I do call on that blessed name. I will call
   on that glorious name! If I perish, I will never cease to invoke that
   sacred name." An invocation of the name of God, a trusting in God and a
   consequent calling upon God and acknowledgment of God-- this it is that
   saves the soul!

   But I must get you to notice these words a little more in detail. There
   is here, first, a wide word, a very wide word-- "Whoever shall call
   upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. "Whoever.''" I have heard
   that, when a person is making his will, if he wishes to leave all he
   has to one person, say to his wife, if he just says so, that is the
   best thing he can do. But he had better not go into details and begin
   making a list of what he is leaving because he will probably leave
   something or other out! Now, in order to make this will of God very
   distinct, He does not go into any detail, but He just says, "Whoever."
   That means the black man, the red man, the brown man, the yellow man
   and the white man. It means the rich man, the poor man and the man who
   is not a man! It means everybody of every sort and those who are of no
   sort at all--or of all sorts put together. "Whoever." That includes me,
   I am sure. But I am equally certain that it includes you, you in the
   aisles who were never here, before. You who are quite unknown in
   London. You who are a stranger and a foreigner-- whoever you may be! It
   is much better to have it put so, without going into detail, because
   otherwise somebody might be left out.

   I have often thought that if I had read in Scripture, "If Charles
   Haddon Spurgeon shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be
   saved," I would not have felt half as sure of salvation as I do now,
   because I would have concluded that there might have been somebody else
   of that name! And it is very likely there is and I would have said,
   "Surely it did not mean me." But when the Lord says, "Whoever," I
   cannot get out of that circle! It is a big net that seems to entangle
   all men in its meshes. "Whoever." If I call upon the name of the Lord,
   if you call upon the name of the Lord, if the man who lies upstairs
   dying calls upon the name of the Lord, we shall be saved! What a wide
   word that, "whoever," is!

   And then, next, what an easy word we have here! "Whoever shall call
   upon the name of the Lord." Anybody can call upon the name of the Lord!
   Everybody understands what it is to call--"Hi there!" Have you not
   often used such a call as that? And if you have been in distress or
   danger, have you never called, "Help, help, help"? Very well, he who
   can thus call, let him call upon God, invoke His help, clamor for His
   mercy, crave His pity! If he does that in a believing way, as we shall
   have to show you, trusting that God will hear him, he shall be saved!
   So there is no difficulty here that needs a doctor of divinity to
   explain--the Truth of God is put mainly in monosyllabic words--"Whoever
   shall call upon the

   name of the Lord shall be saved." It is as plain as a pikestaff! Oh,
   that you might see it and begin to call upon the name of the Lord by
   earnest prayer!

   But here is another word, a sure word--"Whoever shall call upon the
   name of the Lord shall be saved." There is no, "if," here! No, "maybe,"
   here! But a glorious, "shall!" Our shalls and wills are poor, puny
   things, but God's "shall" is firm as the eternal mountains. "Whoever
   shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," as surely as
   there is a God. The Lord has made no mistake--He will not revoke his
   declaration by changing His mind--"Whoever shall call upon the name of
   the Lord shall be saved." Oh, that many would call upon His name,
   tonight, and find immediate salvation which will last them throughout
   life and throughout eternity, for, "shall be saved," reaches a very
   long way--even throughout the eternal ages that are yet to come!

   Now here, you see, Friends, we have a wonderful remedy for the disease
   of sin, very simple and very abundant. But the difficulty is to get it
   to the people who need it! I am going to talk about that matter in very
   plain language because I want to be very practical--and I pray that
   God's Spirit may make my whole discourse to be so.

   In our text there are four necessities upon which Paul insists. Praying
   to God, calling upon His name, will save a man. But first, there is no
   praying aright without believing. "How, then, shall they call on Him in
   whom they have not believed?" But, secondly, there is no believing
   without hearing. "How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not
   heard?" Thirdly, there is no hearing without a preacher. "How shall
   they hear without a preacher?" And fourthly, and lastly, there is no
   effective preaching without being sent. "How shall they preach except
   they are sent?"

   I. First, then, THERE IS NO PRAYING ARIGHT WITHOUT BELIEVING, from
   which I gather this moral--then let us believe. Since we must pray and
   only by prayer can find salvation--and there is no praying without
   believing-- may the Lord help us to believe, for how shall we pray
   aright unless we believe?

   I think that I have persons here, tonight, who have commenced to pray,
   who have begun pleading with God. I hope, dear Friends, no, I feel sure
   of it, that if that prayer is sincere, there is a measure of faith in
   it, for would you ask God to save you if you did not believe that you
   needed to be saved? There is a measure of faith in that. Would you ask
   God to save you if you did not think that there is a way of salvation
   by which He can save you? There is a measure of faith in believing
   that. I think that you believe that there is a Savior. There is a
   measure of faith in that and, I hope, a measure of saving faith, too,
   in your believing that, notwithstanding all your sins and sinfulness,
   there is a Savior provided who is able to save to the uttermost them
   that come unto God by Him. You may not have much faith, but you must
   have some faith if you are really praying to God from your heart and
   entreating Him to save you!

   I think, too, that you must have a little faith that the Savior will
   save you. You have been praying to Him to do it. Would you have
   expressed that desire and have come to Him in prayer about it unless
   there was some kind of sediment of faith in your heart? I want to put
   it very gently to you, yet very plainly. Remember, faith is not
   measured by the quantity, but by the quality. A man of strong faith is
   happier, but he is not more truly saved than a man of weak faith, so
   long as he has any faith at all. If yours is only feeble faith, the
   Lord will say to you, "Your faith has saved you. go in peace." The
   faith that comes behind Christ and touches the hem of His garment is a
   saving faith! And I think that is what you are doing when you say,
   "Lord Jesus, save me." If this is a real prayer and not a sham one. If
   it comes from your heart there is, at any rate, a tint, a shade, if not
   an actual color of faith already upon your soul! How could you call on
   Him in whom you have not believed? Would we call for help from a person
   who we did not think would help us or could help us? No! The mere fact
   of calling upon anyone for help proves that we have some measure of
   confidence in that person, that he can and will help us. Well, if you
   believe as much as that concerning Christ, and if you will cast
   yourself upon Him, believing that you shall be saved, I would that you
   had more faith, but even that little faith will bear you into Heaven.

   You believe, also, that Christ can and does hear you. Ah, you would not
   have been upstairs, alone, this afternoon, crying for mercy, if you had
   thought that there was nobody to hear you! Rational beings do not go
   and ask of nobody. You believe that Christ is able to hear you and you
   have some faith that He does hear you, for which I am very thankful,
   indeed.

   I think that I may add that you are measurably trusting to Christ.
   Certainly, you are not trusting to anybody else. The fact that you
   often pray to Him for mercy, for the pardon of sin, for the renewal of
   your nature, proves that you have some degree, at least--some faint
   measure of faith in Him. Now, let me exhort you, while you keep on
   praying, to mix more faith with your praying. "With all your offerings
   you shall offer salt," and with all your praying you shall offer

   faith. When you ask anything of God, believe, and you shall receive.
   When you appeal to His mercy, believe in the mercy! When you are
   pleading for His help, believe in the help, for there is much power in
   faith. "According to your faith, be it unto you."

   You all know, surely, what believing is. You say, "I shall go home to
   pray." No, no, no! Believe and pray as much as you like--and a
   believing prayer will save you. Whoever shall call upon the name of the
   Lord shall be saved but, "how, then, shall they call on Him in whom
   they have not believed?" Faith comes first. Believe, then, before you
   do anything else. May God, in His great mercy, enable some poor sinner
   to have done with doings and with feelings--and to trust-- just to
   trust Jesus! There you are, hanging up there in a tree. You are afraid
   of falling down, so you cling with all your might. Suppose that a
   strong man comes underneath and says, "Here, drop into my arms. I will
   catch you. I am able to bear your weight." If you trust him, you will
   drop into his arms. That is what you have to do with Christ, tonight--
   trust Him and let go of every other confidence! Just drop into His arms
   and you shall be saved! Remember, then, this first lesson, that there
   is no praying aright without believing.

   II. Now we go another step and come to the second necessity. THERE IS
   NO BELIEVING WITHOUT HEARING--"How shall they believe in Him of whom
   they have not heard?"

   The word, "heard," is to be understood in a wide sense. Reading is a
   kind of hearing. It is not merely listening with the ear, but you must,
   by some means or other, come to a knowledge of the Truth of God, and
   you cannot know what you do not hear, or read, or learn. The Truth must
   come under your notice so that you are aware of it, or else there can
   be no faith in you concerning it. I hope that none of you ever believe
   with the faith of the man who, when he was asked what he believed, said
   that he believed what the church believed. "Well," asks one, "what does
   the church believe?" "Oh," he replied, "the church believes what I
   believe." "Well, then, please tell me, what do you and the church
   believe?" "We both believe the same thing," he answered. And he would
   explain no farther.

   Now, there is no faith in that at all--it is simple ignorance and
   nothing more. "How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not
   heard?" Why, to believe a thing is to know the ins and outs of it! To
   get at it by reading it or hearing it, are only different forms of the
   same thing. Well, now, if any man here desires faith, what should he do
   to obtain it? Sit still and say, "I will try to believe"? Certainly
   not! Suppose that I were to announce to you, tonight, that the Czar of
   all the Russias is dead and you said that you wished to believe it? You
   could not believe it by an effort of your mind--you would enquire for
   evidence of the truth of my statement, or you would wait till you saw
   the telegrams tomorrow--and so you would learn whether it was true or
   not. It is not a distinct act of the will, alone, that brings
   faith--"Faith comes by hearing."

   Listen, then! The more often you hear the Gospel, the better--I mean
   you who have not yet believed it. As you are hearing it, you may come
   to believe it. It may insensibly, as it were, steal over you. Having
   heard it, and heard it, and heard it, again and again, you may, at
   last, find yourself believing that Jesus suffered on the Cross for you!
   I recommend all seekers after Christ to hear the Word often.

   Take another piece of advice. Hear better. Hear with both your ears at
   once. Listen as you would listen if the preacher were telling you how
   you could make a fortune in ten minutes! How everybody would
   listen--how everyone would want to have a front seat so as to make no
   mistake! How the pencils would go to work to take down the
   instructions! Hear that way, for there is more at stake than a
   fortune--even your immortal soul! Heaven and Hell hang upon the hearing
   or not hearing of the Word. Hear often and hear well.

   But so hear as to try to understand it and if you cannot meet with the
   preacher who seems to proclaim an all-round Gospel, do what is better,
   go to the Bible, itself! Read this blessed Book through, studiously,
   with such helps as good men can give you. Yes, try and understand the
   Truth of God and prove it by experience. Come to this Book and come to
   the House of Prayer with this thought on your mind, "There is a
   something that I have to believe and I am going to know what it is. I
   am going to know the top of it and the bottom of it, the head and the
   front and the heart of it and, at any rate, I will, if I can, know what
   it is and what are the grounds and reasons for it." Hearing thus, you
   will believe it.

   There let me leave that point, then. Hear the Gospel, only mind that
   what you hear is the Gospel. You can hear some very smart sermons and
   very clever sermons and, as a rule, I may say that the cleverer they
   are, the worse they are! Where you see so much of the man, you will see
   very little of his Master. When everything seems yielded up to the
   turning of the phrases, putting the thing very grandly and carrying you
   away with wonderful eloquence, the Gospel, itself, gets put out

   of sight. Let the eloquent men have a shop for themselves on a Monday,
   but let us have the Lord's-Day given up to plain dealing with the souls
   of men! We want none of this word-daubing! Men are going to Heaven or
   to Hell and it is time that we came to close grips with them about this
   all-important matter. God help us to do so! Hear that which is really
   aimed at your heart and conscience! Hear that which tells of Christ,
   Heaven and the way there! Hearing that, you are on the way to believing
   it!

   III. Thirdly, THERE IS NO HEARING WITHOUT A PREACHER--"And how shall
   they hear without a

   preacher?" Therefore, let us preach.

   Someone must make the Truths of God known to men. They will not find
   out about the Savior unless they are told of Him. The Gospel will not
   be revealed to men by any supernatural agency--we must go with it. They
   cannot learn it without being taught it. No man will know the Gospel
   unless somebody shall tell it to Him, by word of mouth, or by the gift
   of a book or a tract, or by a letter, or by the open preaching of the
   Word. Somebody must make it known to the man, for how can he believe in
   Him of whom he has not heard, and how can he hear without a preacher?

   Who ought to preach, then? Everyone who can preach should do so. The
   gift of preaching is the responsibility for preaching. I often wonder
   at some Christian men who can fire away so grandly on the platform, but
   who never speak for Christ--they will have to account for those
   prostituted tongues! If a man can speak upon the temperance question,
   he can speak upon the salvation question--let him take care that he
   does so. I do not wish him to be silent on the one, but I do earnestly
   entreat him not to be silent on the other! There are a great many
   persons who ought to preach the Gospel, but who do not. Every man who
   knows the Gospel ought to make it known. "Let him that hears say,
   Come." When you hear the Gospel, tell it to somebody else--you
   Christian people are all bound, in proportion to your gifts and your
   opportunity--to make the Gospel known. "Why," says one, "I thought that
   work was for priests." Just so, it is only for priests! But then, all
   Believers are priests. By His mighty Grace, our Lord Jesus Christ has
   made us kings and priests unto God! And it is our duty, as well as our
   privilege, to exercise this blessed priestly function of telling to the
   sons of men the way whereby they may be saved. Each man, then, in this
   place, who knows Christ, and each woman and each young person, too, are
   bound to tell of Christ in some way or other to all who are round about
   them.

   For this work, a high degree of gifts is not required. It does not say,
   "How shall they hear without a doctor of divinity?" It does not say,
   "How shall they hear without a popular preacher?" Oh, dear, some of us
   would have been lost if we could not have been saved without hearing a
   man of great abilities! I thank God that I owe my conversion to Christ
   to an unknown person who certainly was no minister in the ordinary
   acceptation of the term, but who could say this much-- "Look unto
   Christ, and be saved, all you ends of the earth." I learned my
   theology, from which I have never swerved, from an old woman who was a
   cook in the house where I was an usher. She could talk about the deep
   things of God and as I sat and heard what she had to say, as an aged
   Christian, of what the Lord had done for her, I learned more from her
   instruction than from anybody I have ever met with since! It does not
   require a college training to enable you to tell about Christ--some of
   the best workers in this Church have little enough of education, but
   they bring many to Christ. Go on, my dear Brothers and Sisters, telling
   of Christ's love to you, even if you have very few gifts.

   Remember that when you have told out the story of the Cross to men, you
   are rid of one responsibility. At any rate, if they perish, it will not
   be because they did not know. And if they perish through ignorance, it
   will not be that their ignorance was through your neglect in teaching
   them. Now, tonight, I wish that I could stir up everyone here to become
   a preacher, women and all--not that I care much for women preaching,
   but I want them to preach in the sense in which I have laid the matter
   down--that is, to make known to somebody the wondrous story of the
   Cross! Speak to an individual, if you can. If you cannot do that,
   write. If you cannot write, send a sermon, or give a tract. Only keep
   on making Christ known! I suppose that there are two or three thousand
   Believers here, tonight, out of these 6,000 people. If every one of you
   Christians would, every day, make Christ known to somebody, what a
   missionary organization we should be! How can they hear without a
   preacher? Now, let every one of you become, in the sense in which the
   text means it, a preacher, by telling out, in some form or other, and
   making known in some way or other, the wondrous doctrine of salvation
   by faith in Jesus Christ!

   It is pitiable that anybody should live and die without knowing the
   Gospel. You can have no idea, unless you go into the houses in many of
   our streets, what absolute ignorance there is in this city of London
   about the simple elements of the Gospel of Christ. City missionaries
   have often told me stories that have amazed and appalled me. You think,
   because so

   many come to some of our Houses of Prayer, that the people of London go
   into the House of God. There is at least a million people and, perhaps,
   two million, who never attend any place of worship at all. There could
   be three million, I suppose, out of our five million, who only
   occasionally go to any place of worship at all. Why speak of
   "heathendom?" We have it at our doors!

   The more earnest a man is to win souls, the more he is shocked, amazed
   and appalled by the necessity there is to keep on making known the
   Gospel of Christ. And now they are starting new theologies, inventing
   falsehoods. Up with you, men and Christians! Publish Christ again! The
   only way to put this false fire out is with the old fire of the
   Gospel--men fear that fire! Put down the new heresy with the old
   orthodoxy! Bring out Christ Crucified! Cry again, with Luther's
   earnestness, "Believe and live!" Cry again, with Calvinistic
   determination, "Salvation is all of Grace, of Grace, alone, through
   faith in Jesus Christ!" I would to God that we might all preach that.
   If we had but all our Church members resolved to testify the Gospel of
   the Grace of God, then would we see men hearing! Then would we find men
   believing! And men believing are men saved!

   IV. So I come to the fourth necessity, with which I shall close. THERE
   IS NO EFFECTIVE PRAEACHING WITHOUT BEING SENT--"And how shall they
   preach, except they are sent?"

   "Ah!" says one, "now we have you in a corner. We must not all go and
   preach if we are not sent." If you are not sent, do not go! But what
   does it mean, "How shall they preach, except they are sent?" A man who
   goes to tell others about Christ must feel that he is sent to do it, or
   he will never do it properly and effectively.

   The man who is sent, first of all, has a message given to him. You do
   not say to your servant, "You go north, south, east, west and that is
   all." No, if you send him, you give him a message--"Go and say to Mr.
   So-and-So, this and that." Or you write it down and you say, "Deliver
   this letter to such a person." You do not leave him to go and say
   whatever he likes--"John, I want you to call on Mr. So-and-So, tomorrow
   morning, and to say whatever first comes into your head." You do not
   act like that, do you? Yet that is the notion some people have,
   nowadays, of what a preacher is--he is a man who makes his message up
   as he goes along! He is a "thinker." He excogitates the Gospel out of
   his own brains. I have heard of a German who is said to have
   constructed a camel out of his own consciousness. Very likely. But I am
   sure that nobody will construct the Gospel that way! He must receive it
   by the Revelation of God. The other plan is not Paul's notion, for he
   asks, "How shall they preach, except they are sent?" First, then, get
   your message. Be determined to know nothing among men but what the
   Lord, Himself, has revealed to you in His Word, by the teaching of His
   Spirit. Get it well into you. Say to yourself, "What I am going to say
   is nothing of my own, otherwise it would fall flat and powerless. But I
   am going with, 'Thus says the Lord.' This is God's message." Then, if
   you are sent, you will preach and you will so preach that men will
   hear--and they will so hear that they will believe! And they will so
   believe that they will be saved! But you must go as a God-sent man,
   having received your message from the mouth of your Master.

   Next, I think that, even if we get a message from God, we need
   something more than that--there must be an impulse felt within that
   shall compel us to speak of Christ. If you merely go and flippantly
   talk about Jesus Christ to people, you may as well talk about anything
   else. But if you pity them, if you love them, if you feel that they
   must not be lost, that you cannot bear the thought of it--if it is in
   your mind so that you cannot sleep while you are thinking of such an
   one because he is going down to Hell--if it gets such a burden that it
   oppresses you and weighs you down so that you must speak to somebody
   about his soul, ah, then you will speak, for you will feel that you are
   sent! Now, my impression is that if we are in a right state of heart,
   we shall always feel like that. If a Christian man were in a right
   condition of heart, whether he found himself on a train, or along a
   country road, or at the railway station, or in the police court, or
   waiting in the lobby of a house, or anywhere, he would begin at once to
   deal with the person with whom he came into contact, about his soul. I
   wish that it were your habit to be always looking out for souls. Up,
   then, you Christian men, and seek as God shall help you, by every means
   in your power, to make Christ known to the dying all around you! But
   you will not do it unless you are sent, driven, impelled, forced--you
   will not win souls for Christ till the Gospel is like a fire in your
   bones and you feel that woe is unto you if you do not preach it!

   Well now, before you go to try to do that, there is one thing more. You
   cannot do it effectively unless you are sent-- and to be sent means to
   have power given you with which to do the work. Can that power be had?
   If you feel impelled to cry to God to give you the power to preach, the
   spiritual power, the power of the Holy Spirit. If you are impelled to
   teach in the Sunday school--and it is not worth doing unless you feel
   that you are impelled to it and sent to it--then pray for the

   power to win the souls of those dear children for Christ! If you feel
   called upon to write a letter to a friend, tomorrow, about his soul or
   her soul, do it because you feel called to do it--but pray to God to
   show you how to do it. Pray to Him to put the power into the words that
   you utter, that you may say the right words and put even the right tone
   into those words. There is a good deal, even, in the tone of the
   preacher. "How shall they preach, except they are sent?" They must be
   clothed with Divine Power! And the Lord can clothe even a child with
   that power--He has often done it! He can clothe a humble Christian
   woman who never spoke in public, with the power to win souls! He has
   often done it. And you, Brother, who have been quite satisfied to be a
   Church member and to do nothing for Christ--a most unsatisfactory state
   of things, indeed--should begin to be doing something for Him who has
   done so much for you! First tarry at Jerusalem till you are endued with
   power from on high and then go forth as Christ's witnesses--for how
   shall you preach, except you are sent? But the power being obtained,
   you must go forth and tell out the message that your Lord has given
   you.

   But you have not done it all till you have given a report to your
   Master. If you have been sent, you will go back to your Lord after you
   have delivered His message and you will tell Him what they have to say
   about it. Every man who is sent on an errand gives an answer,
   by-and-by, as to the reply of the person to whom he was sent. I am
   afraid that some teachers and preachers forget this. We ought to go,
   like Isaiah, back to the Master and say, "Who has believed our report,
   and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" You have tried hard with
   Mary to bring her to Christ--did you ever tell the Master about Mary?
   Mother, you have tried hard with your boy to bring him to the
   Savior--have you ever told Jesus about your boy?

   Last Tuesday night there were a mother and father who had a son about
   whom they had once been very hopeful, but he had left home and gone
   away for weeks, though he promised to return. He had gone off and they
   had not heard a word about him. They came to a company of Christian
   people, last Tuesday night, broken-hearted. They had done their best to
   find their son, but they could not find him. It was to Haddon Hall that
   they came--and the people of God, there, prayed for his father and
   mother. The father, himself, prayed and broke down with emotion about
   his lost son. He went home and there was a letter from his son to say
   that the Savior had found him! He had given up the drink and he hoped
   to be a comfort to his father and mother all the rest of their days. He
   was many miles away and knew nothing of his father's prayer. Often,
   when you do not get on with people, go and tell the Lord Jesus Christ
   about it! Say, "Lord, I have preached to them, I have prayed for them,
   I have talked to them, I have wept over them, I bear them on my heart
   as a burden. Their very name seems to burn itself with letters of fire
   into my soul. Lord, save them! Lord, save them and they will be saved!"
   That is the way to win souls. If God works, He first of all makes us
   travail in birth for the souls of others--and then are they born into
   the Kingdom!

   The rest of the text is a kind of vision. The Prophet sees persons
   coming down the mountain side. He looks at them and perceives that they
   are not men of war, otherwise the armor upon their legs would be
   terrible to the peaceful inhabitants of the plain. Yet here they come,
   a great company from the mountain tops, descending into the valleys.
   Who are they? As he looks, he says, "How beautiful upon the mountains
   are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace and bring glad
   tidings of good things!" They are coming bearing the white flag,
   servants of the great King with whom you have been at war. They bear
   the banner that speaks of peace with God!

   We, to whom the text alludes, who are the preachers of this Gospel of
   peace, say to you, tonight, "Sinner, throw down your weapons of
   rebellion! Guilty one, fight no longer against God! Come and be at
   peace with Him. His peace is proclaimed to you through Jesus Christ. He
   will freely forgive your every transgression and iniquity. He is ready
   to forget and blot it all out! God invites you to be reconciled to Him,
   to have done with warring against Him. We preach peace to you and, if
   you hear us, we then tell you glad tidings of good things, full pardon
   for all the past, a change of heart to be given to you to make you a
   new creature in Christ Jesus--yes, to be given you, tonight, before you
   leave the Tabernacle--help for the future to strive against sin,
   strength to conquer and tread the dragon beneath your feet, power to
   become a child of God, to become an heir of Heaven, to be taken under
   the guardian wing of Providence, to be directed by the infinite wisdom
   of the Holy Spirit!"

   These glad tidings of good things are published to all of you, even you
   that are farthest off from Christ and hope, and peace! Believe in
   Jesus! Trust Him! Trust God in human flesh, trust Him who bled to death
   upon the Cross and paid down the ransom for your soul and trust Him,
   now! He will do all for you that you need to have done for you--and He
   will save you and bring you to His right hand in Glory!

   Now I have talked all in vain unless the Lord shall apply the Truth to
   you and you believe it. Do not wait for somebody to believe for you!
   Trust Christ for yourself! Believe in Jesus even now! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS10.

   Verse 1. Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is
   that they might be saved. Desire is the mother and the soul of prayer.
   "My heart's desire and prayer." These Israelites had hunted Paul and
   sought to kill him. They were his deadly enemies, but the only return
   he made them was to pray that they might be saved! I hope you will
   never have a worse wish for your worst foe!

   2. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
   according to knowledge. Always see all the good that is to be seen and,
   when you have to reprove and rebuke, begin by admitting what is good.
   "They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."

   3. For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God. They were very zealous, but it was blind
   zeal. They were very energetic, but they used their energy in going the
   wrong way. God has a righteousness and our wisest course is to submit
   to it. Our righteousness, if we set it up in opposition to God's way of
   salvation, will only increase our sin. You can be ruined by your
   righteousness as surely as by your unrighteousness, if you set it in
   the place of salvation by Grace through faith in Jesus Christ. "They,
   being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish
   their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
   righteousness of God."

   4. For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to everyone that
   believes. If we get Christ by believing, we have the righteousness of
   the Law. All that ever could come to us by the highest and most perfect
   obedience to the Law of God, we get by faith in Christ Jesus.

   5. For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the Law. And being
   the one through whom the Law was given, he knew how to describe it. And
   we may be sure that he made no mistake. This is his description of
   legal righteousness--

   5. That the man which does those things shall live by them. That is
   it--"Do and live." That is the Law and a very just Law, too. Leave
   anything undone, or break the command in any respect and you die--that
   is the Law.

   6. But the righteousness which is of faith--This is quite another
   thing. It--

   6. Speaks on this wise. And it is Moses who speaks, here, as in the
   previous verse. This is what the righteousness of faith says--

   6-9. Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? (That is, to
   bring Christ down from above). Or, Who shall descend into the deep?
   (That is, to bring up Christ, again, from the dead). But what says it?
   The Word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart, that is,
   the Word offaith which we preach, that if you shall confess with your
   mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has
   raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. God's way of salvation,
   then, is, "Believe and live." Believe in Christ--Christ dying, Christ
   raised from the dead. If you so believe, you are saved! You need not
   mount to Heaven in rapture, nor dive to Hell in remorse. As you are,
   believe and live. This is the way of the righteousness of God!

   10. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation. True faith must be accompanied
   by an open confession. Come forward and outwardly acknowledge what you
   inwardly believe. Remember those words of the Lord Jesus, "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." Here, as there, the
   confession is put after the faith, as indeed it must be. First, the
   reality, the thing signified, faith. Afterwards, the outward and
   visible sign in the confession of that faith.

   11. For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on Him shall not be
   ashamed. He need never be ashamed of his faith. It will bear him up. It
   will bear him through. It will bear him up to Heaven.

   12. 13. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
   the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For whoever
   shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. That is a
   wonderful sentence! Catch at it. Doubting, troubled spirits, catch at
   it! Believe it! Practice it and you shall find it true.

   14, 15. How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed
   and how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how
   shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except
   they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them
   that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
   See here the whole machinery of salvation! God provides salvation in
   Christ Jesus. He sends the preacher to tell of it, men hear, they
   believe and salvation is theirs! You have not to make a righteousness,
   you have to accept the one that is made for you! It is not what you
   shall do that shall save you--it is what Christ has done! You are to
   get out of self-confidence into confidence in Him and, as soon as you
   do so, you are saved.

   16. But they have not all obeyed the Gospel. Oh, no! All who have heard
   it have not obeyed it! There are many here who have heard it from their
   childhood and yet they have not obeyed it. Notice the word, "obeyed,"
   for the Gospel comes to you with the force of a Divine command. If you
   reject it, you sin against it, for it is your duty to accept it-- "but
   they have not all obeyed the Gospel."

   16, For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report? So few were the
   obedient that he asked where they were!

   17, 18. So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
   But I say, Have they not heard? Oh, may they hear, indeed!

   18, 19. Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth and their words
   unto the ends of the world. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses
   says, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by
   a foolish nation I will anger you. Has He not done it? Israel is
   rejected and remains without Christ, while many out of "a foolish
   nation" of Anglo-Saxons, who were idolaters, have accepted Christ!
   People who were regarded as dogs by God's chosen nation Israel have
   come into the House of the Lord, and still Israel refuses to come!

   20. But Isaiah is very bold and says, I was found of them that sought
   Me not. Hear, then, you who have never had any religion, you who seldom
   go to the House of God. Even you may be saved, for it is written, "I
   was found of them that sought Me not."

   20. I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me. Here is the
   manifestation of Sovereign Grace--God choosing and saving whom He
   wills, irrespective of their condition--exercising the sovereignty of
   His mercy in saving the most undeserving.

   21. But to Israel He says, All day long I have stretched forth My
   hands--In the attitude of invitation and entreaty, and readiness to
   receive--

   21. Unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. And that is what He has
   done to you! O, then, careless child of pious parents! O, then,
   unregenerate hearer of the Word! All day long has He stood and
   stretched forth His hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. The
   Lord forgive all such, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

Micah's Message for Today

   (No. 2328)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 1, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   22, 1889.

   "Walk humbly with your God." Micah 6:8.

   THIS is the essence of the Law of God, the spiritual side of it--its
   Ten Commandments are an enlargement of this verse. The Law is spiritual
   and touches the thoughts, the intents, the emotions, the words, the
   actions--but especially God demands the heart. Now it is our great joy
   that what the Law requires, the Gospel gives. "Christ is the end of the
   Law for righteousness to everyone that believes." In Him we meet the
   requirements of the Law, first, by what He has done for us and next, by
   what He works in us. He conforms us to the Law of God. He makes us, by
   His Spirit, not for our righteousness, but for His Glory, to render to
   the Law the obedience which we could not present of ourselves. We are
   weak through the flesh, but when Christ strengthens us, the
   righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us who walk not after the
   flesh, but after the Spirit.

   Only through faith in Christ does a man learn to do righteously, to
   love mercy and to walk humbly with God--and only by the power of the
   Holy Spirit sanctifying us to that end do we fulfill these three Divine
   requirements. These we fulfill perfectly in our desire--we would be
   holy as God is holy if we could live as our heart aspires to live--we
   would always do righteously, we would always love mercy and we would
   always walk humbly with God. This, the Holy Spirit daily aids us to do
   by working in us to will and to do of God's good pleasure. And the day
   will come and we are pining for it, when, being entirely free from this
   hampering body, we shall serve Him day and night in His Temple and
   shall render to Him an absolutely perfect obedience, for, "they are
   without fault before the Throne of God."

   Tonight I shall have a task quite sufficient if I dwell only upon the
   third requirement, "Walk humbly with your God," asking first, What is
   the nature of this humility? And secondly, Where does this humility
   show itself.

   I. First, WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS HUMILITY? The text is very full of
   teaching in that respect.

   And, first, this humility belongs to the highest form of character.
   Observe what precedes our text, "to do justly and to love mercy."
   Suppose a man has done that? Suppose that in both these things he has
   come up to the Divine standard, what then? Why, then he must walk
   humbly with God! If we walk in the Light of God, as God is in the
   light, and have fellowship with Him, we still need to walk before God
   very humbly, always looking to the blood, for even then, the blood of
   Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses and continues to cleanse us from all
   sin. If we have done both these things, we shall still have to say that
   we are unprofitable servants and we must walk humbly with God. We have
   not reached that consummation yet, always doing justly and loving
   mercy, though we are approximating to it by Christ's gracious help. But
   if we did attain to the ideal that is set before us and every act was
   right towards man--and more, every act was delightfully saturated with
   a love to our neighbor as strong as our love to ourselves--even then
   there would come in this precept, "Walk humbly with your God."

   Dear Friends, if ever you should think that you have reached the
   highest point of Christian Grace--I almost hope that you never will
   think so--but suppose that you should ever think so, do not, I pray
   you, say anything that verges upon boasting, or exhibit any kind of
   spirit that looks like glorying in your own attainments, but walk
   humbly with your God! I believe that the more Grace a man has, the more
   he feels his deficiency of Grace. All the people that I have ever
   thought might have been called perfect before God, have been notable
   for a denial of anything of the sort--they have always disclaimed
   anything like perfection! They have always laid low before God and if
   one has been constrained to admire them, they have blushed at his
   admiration. If they have thought that they were, at all, the objects of
   reverence

   among their fellow Christians, I have noticed how zealously they have
   put that aside with self-depreciatory remarks, telling us that we did
   not know all, or we should not think so of them. And therein I admire
   them yet more. The praise that they put from them returns to them with
   interest!

   Oh, let us be of that mind! The best of men are but men at the best,
   and the brightest saints are still sinners, for whom there is still the
   Fountain open, but not opened, mark you, in Sodom and Gomorrah, but
   opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
   that even they may still continue, with all their lofty privileges, to
   wash, therein, and to be clean. This is the kind of humility, then,
   which is consistent with the highest moral and spiritual character. No,
   it is the very clothing of such a character, as Peter puts it, "Be
   clothed with humility," as if, after we had put on the whole armor of
   God, we put this over all to cover it all up! We do not want the helmet
   to glitter in the sun, nor the armor of brass upon the knees to shine
   before men, but clothing ourselves like officers in civilian clothes,
   we conceal the beauties which will eventually the more reveal
   themselves.

   The second remark is this, the humility here prescribed involves
   constant communion with God. Observe that we are told to walk humbly
   with God. It is of no use walking humbly away from God. I have seen
   some people very proudly humble, very boastful of their humility. They
   have been so humble that they were proud enough to doubt God! They
   could not accept the mercy of Christ, they said. They were so humble.
   In truth, theirs was a devilish humility, not the humility that comes
   from the Spirit of God. Oh, no! This humility makes us walk with God
   and, Beloved, can you conceive a higher and truer humility than that
   which must come of walking with God? Remember what Job said, "I have
   heard of You by the hearing of the ear: but now my eyes see You.
   Therefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes."

   Remember how Abraham, when he communed with God and pleaded with him
   for Sodom, said, "I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am
   but dust and ashes." "Dust"--that set forth the frailty of his nature.
   "Ashes"--as if he were like the refuse of the altar which could not be
   burnt up--which God would not have. He felt himself to be, by sin, like
   the sweeping of a furnace, the ashes, refuse of no value whatever--and
   that was not because he was away from God, but because he was near to
   God. You can get to be as big as you like if you get away from God, but
   coming near to the Lord you rightly sing--

   "The more Your glories strike my eyes, The humbler I shall lie."

   Depend upon it that it is so. It might be a kind of weather gauge as to
   your communion--whether you are proud or humble. If you are going up,
   God is going down in your esteem. "He must increase," said John the
   Baptist of the Lord Jesus, "but I must decrease." The two things go
   together--if this scale rises, that scale must go down. "Walk humbly
   with your God."

   Dare to stay with God! Dare to have Him as your daily Friend! Be bold
   enough to come to Him who is within the veil! Talk with Him, walk with
   Him as a man walks with his familiar friend--but walk humbly with Him.
   You will do so if you walk truly. I cannot conceive such a thing--it is
   impossible--a man walking proudly with God! He takes his fellow by the
   arm and feels that he is as good as his neighbor, perhaps superior to
   him, but he cannot walk with God in such a frame of mind as that! The
   finite with the Infinite! That alone suggests humility, but the sinful
   with the Thrice-Holy? This throws us down into the dust.

   But, next, this humility implies constant activity. "Walk humbly with
   your God." Walking is an active exercise. These people had proposed to
   bow before God, as you notice in the sixth verse, "Wherewith shall I
   come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God?" But the
   answer is not, "Bow humbly before God," but, " Walk humbly with God."
   Now, Beloved, when we are very actively engaged, pressed with business,
   one thing after another coming in, if the great Master employs us in
   some large concern--large, of course, only to us--if we have work after
   work, we are too apt to forget that we are only servants, we are doing
   all the business for our Master, we are only commission agents for Him.
   We are apt to think that we are the head of the firm. We would not
   think so if we thought steadily, for a moment, for we would know our
   right position. But in the midst of activity we get cumbered with much
   serving and we are too apt to get off our proper level.

   We have, perhaps, to rule others, and we forget that we also are men
   under authority. It is easy to play the little king over the little
   folk, but it must not be so. You must learn not only to be humble in
   the closet of communion--and to be humble with your Bible before
   you--but to be humble in preaching, to be humble in teaching, to be
   humble in ruling, to

   be humble in everything that you do when you have as much as ever you
   can do! When, from morning to night, you are still pressed with this
   and that service, still keep your proper place. That is where Martha
   went wrong, you know--not in having much serving, but by getting to be
   mistress. She was, "Mrs. Martha," and the housewife is a queen! But
   Mary sat in the servant's place at Jesus' feet. If Martha's heart could
   have been where Mary's body was, then had she served aright. The Lord
   make us Martha-Marys, or Mary-Marthas, whenever we are busy, that we
   may walk humbly with God!

   Next, I do not think that it is far-fetched if I say that this humility
   denotes progress. The man is to walk--and that is progress--advancing.
   "Walk humbly." I am not to be so humble that I feel that I cannot do
   any more, or enjoy any more, or be any better--they call that
   humility--but it begins with an "S" in English and the full word is
   SLOTH. "I cannot be as believing, as bold, as useful as such a man is."
   You are not told to be humble and sit still, but to be humble and walk
   with God! Go forward! Advance! Not with a proud desire to excel your
   fellow Christians--not even with the latent expectation of being more
   respected because you have more Grace--but still walk, go on, advance,
   grow! Be enriched with all the precious things of God. Be filled with
   all the fullness of God. Walk on, always walk. Lie not down in despair!
   Roll not in the dust with desperation because you think high things
   impossible for you. Walk, but walk humbly.

   You will soon find out, if you make any progress, that you have need to
   be humble. I believe that when a man goes back he gets proud. And I am
   persuaded that when a man advances, he gets humbler--and that it is a
   part of the advance to walk more and more and more humbly. For this the
   Lord tries many of us. For this He visits us in the night and chastens
   us, that we may be qualified to have more Grace and get to higher
   attainments, by being more humble, "for God resists the proud, and
   gives Grace to the humble." If you will climb the mountainside, you
   shall be thirsty among the barren crags. But if you will descend into
   the valleys, where the red deer wander and the brooks flow among the
   meadows, you shall drink to your full! Does not the hart pant for the
   water brooks? Do you pant for them? They flow in the Valley of
   Humiliation! The Lord bring us all there!

   Next, the humility here prescribed implies constancy--"Walk humbly with
   your God." Not sometimes be humble, but always walk humbly with your
   God. If we were always what we are sometimes, what Christians we would
   be! I have heard you say, I think, and I have said the same, myself, "I
   felt very broken down and lay very low at my Master's feet." Were you
   so the next day? And the day after--did you continue so? Is it not very
   possible for us to be one day, because of our great debt to our Master,
   begging that He would not be hard with us and is it not possible,
   tomorrow, to be taking our brother by the throat? I do not say that
   God's people would do that, but I do feel that the spirit that is in
   them may lead them to think of doing it--one day acknowledging your
   Father's authority and doing His will--and another day standing outside
   the door and refusing to go in because the prodigal son has come home.
   "You never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. I
   have been a consistent Believer, yet I never have any high joys, but as
   soon as this, your son, was come, which has devoured your living with
   harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf. Here is a wretched
   sinner only just saved and he is in an ecstasy of delight! How can this
   be right?"

   O elder son, O elder brother, walk humbly with your Father! Always be
   so under any circumstances. It is all very fine to have a lot of
   humility packed away in a box with which to perfume your prayers and
   then to come out and to be, "My Lord," and some very great one in the
   midst of the Church and in the world. This will never do! It is not
   said, "Bow humbly before God now and then." But as a regular, constant
   thing, "Walk humbly with your God." It is not, "Bow your head like the
   bulrush under some conscious fault which you cannot deny," but, in the
   brightness of your purity and the clearness of your holiness, still
   keep your heart in lowly reverence bowing before the Throne of God!

   Once more, only, and then we will quit this part of the subject--the
   humility that is here prescribed includes delightful confidence. Let me
   read the text to you, "Walk humbly with God." No, no, we must not maul
   the passage that way! "Walk humbly with your God." Do not think that it
   is humility to doubt your interest in Christ--that is unbelief! Do not
   think that it is humility to think that He is another man's God and not
   yours--"Walk humbly with your God." Know that He is your God! Be sure
   of it--come up from the wilderness leaning upon your Beloved. Have no
   doubt, nor even the shadow of a doubt, that you are your Beloved's and
   that He is yours! Rest not for a moment if there is any question upon
   this blessed subject. He gives Himself to you--take Him to be yours by
   a Covenant of salt that never shall be broken--and give yourself to
   Him, saying, "I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine." "Walk humbly
   with your

   God."

   Let not anything draw you away from that confidence. But then, in comes
   the humility. This is all of Grace! This is all the result of Divine
   Election! Therefore, be humble. You have not chosen Christ, but He has
   chosen you! This is all the effect of redeeming love--therefore, be
   humble. You are not your own, you are bought with a price, so you can
   have no room to glory. This is all the work of the Spirit--

   "Then give all the glory to His holy name, To Him all the glory
   belongs."

   "Walk humbly with your God." I lie at His feet as one unworthy and cry,
   "Why did this come to me? I am not worthy of the least of the mercies
   that You have made to pass before me." I think this is the humility
   prescribed in the text. May the Spirit of God work it in us!

   II. And now, secondly, with great brevity upon many points, I have to
   answer the question, WHERE DOES THIS HUMILITY SHOW ITSELF? I have what
   might be a long task--a Puritan would want an hour and a half more for
   the second part of the subject. Our Puritan forefathers preached, you
   know, by a glass, an hourglass which stood by them, and sometimes, when
   they had let one glass run out at the end of the hour, they would say
   to the people, "Let us have another glass," and they turned it over,
   again, and went on for another hour! But I am not going to do that. I
   do not wish to weary you and I would rather send you away longing than
   loathing. Where, then, does this humility show itself? It ought to show
   itself in every act of life. I would not advise any of you to try to be
   humble, but to be humble. As to acting humbly, when a man forces
   himself to it, that is poor stuff. When a man talks a great deal about
   his humility--when he is very humble to everybody--he is generally a
   canting hypocrite. Humility must be in the heart and then it will come
   out spontaneously as the outflow of life in every act that a man
   performs.

   But now, especially, walk humbly with God when your Graces are strong
   and vigorous, when there has been a very clear display of them, when
   you have been very patient, when you have been very bold, when you have
   been very prayerful, when the Scriptures have opened themselves up to
   you, when you have enjoyed a grand season of searching the Word and,
   especially, when the Lord gives you success in His service, when there
   are more souls than usual brought to Christ, when God has made you a
   leader among His people and has laid His hand upon you, and said, "Go
   in this, your might." Then, "Walk humbly with your God." The devil will
   tell you when you have preached a good sermon--perhaps you will not
   have preached a good one when he tells you that you have, for he is a
   great liar--but you may go home wonderfully pleased with a sermon with
   which God is not pleased, and you may go home wonderfully humble about
   a sermon that God means to bless. But when there really does seem to be
   something that the Evil One tempts you to glory in, then hear this
   word, "Walk humbly with your God."

   Next, when you have a great deal of work to do and the Lord is calling
   you to it, then, before you go to it, walk humbly with your God. Do you
   ask, "How?" By feeling that you are quite unfit for it, for you are
   unfit in yourself--and by feeling that you have no strength, for you
   have not any! When you are weak, by acknowledging your weakness, you
   will grow strong. Lean hard upon your God, cry to Him in prayer. Do not
   open your own mouth, but from your heart pray, "Open, You, my lips, and
   my mouth shall speak forth Your praise." Be intensely subservient to
   the Spirit of God. Yield yourself up to be worked upon by Him that you
   may work upon others. Oh, there is such a difference between a sermon
   preached by our own power and a sermon preached in the power of the
   Holy Spirit! If you do not feel the difference, my Brother, your people
   will soon find it out--

   "Oh, to be nothing, nothing! Only to lie at His feet!"

   Then it is, when walking humbly with our God in service, that He will
   fill us and make us strong.

   Next, walk humbly with God in all your aims. When you are seeking after
   anything, mind what your motive is. Even if it is the best thing, seek
   it only for God. If any man, or any woman, tries to work in the Sunday
   school, or if anyone preaches in the open-air, or in the House of God
   with a view of being somebody, with the idea of being thought to be a
   very admirable, zealous Brother or Sister, then let this word come into
   your ears--"Walk humbly with your God." There is a word which Jeremiah
   spoke to Baruch which we need to have said to ourselves
   sometimes--"Seek you great things for yourself? Seek them not." You
   young men of the College, do not always be hunting up big places. Be
   willing to go to small places to preach the Gospel to poor people.
   Never mind if the Lord sends you right down to the lowest slum--go and
   let your aim always be this--"I do not desire for myself anything great
   except the greatest thing of all, that I may glorify God!" "Walk humbly
   with your God." You are the kind of man who will be promoted in due
   time if

   you are willing to go down. In the true Church of Christ, the way to
   the top is downstairs! Sink yourself into the highest place. I say not
   this that even in sinking you may think of the rising--think only of
   your Lord's glory. "Walk humbly with your God."

   Walk humbly with God, also, in studying His Word, and in believing His
   Truth. We have a number of men, nowadays, who are critics of the Bible.
   The Bible stands bound at their bar, no, worse than that, it lies on
   their table to be dissected and they have no feeling of decency towards
   it. They will cut out its very heart. They will rend asunder its most
   tender parts, even the precious Song of Solomon, or the Beloved
   Apostle's Gospel, or the Book of Revelation is not sacred in their
   eyes. They shrink from nothing--their scalpel, their knife--cuts
   through everything. They are the judges of what the Bible ought to be
   and it is deposed from its throne. God save us from that evil spirit! I
   desire to always sit at the feet of God in the Scriptures. I do not
   believe that, from one cover to the other, there is any mistake in it
   of any sort whatever, either upon natural or physical science, or upon
   history or anything whatever! I am prepared to believe whatever it says
   and to take it, believing it to be the Word of God, for if it is not
   all true, it is not worth one solitary penny to me. It may be to the
   man who is so wise that he can pick out the true from the false, but I
   am such a fool that I could not do that. If I do not have a Guide,
   here, that is Infallible, I would as soon guide myself, for I shall
   have to do so, after all. I shall have to be correcting the blunders of
   my guide, perpetually--but I am not qualified to do that and so I am
   worse off than if I had not any guide at all.

   Sit down, Reason, and let Faith rise up! If the Lord has said it, let
   God be true and every man a liar! If science contradicts Scripture, so
   much the worse for science--the Scripture is true, whatever the
   theories of men may be. "Ah," you say, "you are an old-fashioned
   fogey." Yes, I am. I will not disclaim any compliment which you choose
   to pass upon me and I will stand or fall by this blessed Book! This was
   the mighty weapon of the Reformation--it smote the Papacy-- and I shall
   not throw it down, whoever does. Stand still, my Brother, and listen to
   the voice of the Lord, and "walk humbly with your God" as to His Truth.

   Walk humbly with God, next, as to mercies received. You were ill a
   short while ago and now you are getting well. Do not let pride come in
   because you feel that you can lift so many pounds. You are getting on
   in business. You wear a much better coat than you used to come here in,
   but do not begin to think yourself a mighty fine gentleman! Now you get
   into very good society, you say, but do not be ashamed to come to the
   Prayer Meeting along with the Lord's poor--and to sit next to one who
   has not had a new coat for many a day. "Walk humbly with your God," or
   else it may be that He will take you down a notch or two and bring you
   back to your old poverty--and then what will you say to yourself for
   your

   folly?

   Next, walk humbly with God under great trials. When you are brought
   very low, do not kick against the pricks. When wave after wave comes,
   do not begin to complain. That is pride--murmur not, but bow low. Say,
   "Lord, if You strike me, I deserve more than You lay upon me. You have
   not dealt with me according to my sin. I accept the chastisement." Let
   not the rebellious spirit rise when a child is taken away, or when the
   wife is taken from your bosom, or the husband from the head of the
   house. Oh, no--say, "It is the Lord. Let Him do what seems good to
   Him."

   And next, walk humbly with God in your devotions, as between yourself
   and God in your chamber. Do you read? Read humbly. Do you pray? Pray
   humbly. Do you sing? Sing joyfully, but sing humbly. Take care, when
   your God and yourself are together, and no one else--that when you show
   Him your humble heart with deep humility--that it is no more humble
   than it is.

   And then, next, walk humbly as between yourself and your brethren. Ask
   not to be head choir master. Desire not to be the principal man in the
   Church. Be lowly. The best man in the Church is the man who is willing
   to be a doormat for all to wipe their boots on--the Brother who does
   not mind what happens to him at all so long as God is glorified. I have
   heard Brothers say, "Well, but you must stand up for your dignity." I
   lost mine a long time ago and I never thought it was worth while to
   look for it! As to the dignity of the pastor, the dignity of the
   minister, if we have no dignity of character, the other is a piece of
   rag. We must try to earn our position in the Church of God by being
   willing to take the lowest place--and if we will do so, our Brethren
   will take care that, before long, they will say to us, "Go up higher."
   In your dealings with weak Christians, with feeble Christians, do not
   always scold. Remember that if you are strong, now, you may very soon
   be as weak as your Brethren are.

   And in dealing with sinners, "walk humbly with your God." Do not stand
   a long way off, as if you loved them so much that distance lent
   enchantment to the view! Do you not think that, sometimes, we deal with
   sinners as if we would like to pluck them from the burning if there
   were a pair of tongs handy, but we do not care to do it if our own
   dainty fingers would be smutted by the brands? Ah, Beloved, we must
   come down from all lofty places and feel a deep and tender pity towards
   the lost, and so walk humbly with God!

   Now, I have not time to go through all this subject as to your
   circumstances. If you are poor, if you are obscure, do not be pining
   after a higher place--"walk humbly with your God." Take what He gives
   you. In looking back, rejoice in all His mercy and walk humbly at the
   recollection of all your stumbling. In looking forward, anticipate the
   future with delight, but do not be proudly imagining how great you will
   yet be made. "Walk humbly with your God." In all your thoughts of holy
   things, be humble. Thoughts of God should lay you low. Thoughts of
   Christ should bring you to His feet. Thoughts of the Holy Spirit should
   make you grieve for having vexed Him. Thoughts of every Covenant
   blessing should make you wonder that such privileges ever came to you.
   Thoughts of Heaven should make you marvel that you should ever be found
   among the seraphim. Thoughts of Hell should make you humble--

   "For were it not for Grace Divine, That fate so dreadful had been
   mine."

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, may the Lord help us to walk humbly with God!
   This will keep us right. True humility is thinking rightly of yourself,
   not meanly. When you have found out what you really are, you will be
   humble, for you are nothing to boast of. To be humble will make you
   safe. To be humble will make you happy. To be humble will make music in
   your heart when you go to bed. To be humble, here, will make you wake
   up in the likeness of your Master, by-and-by. The Lord bless this word,
   for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MICAH6.

   Verse 1. Hear you now what the LORD says. And yet some doubt the
   Infallible Inspiration of Scripture! I would commence every reading of
   the Scripture with such a word of admonition as this--"Hear you now
   what the Lord says." That is what the Prophet said, but God spoke by
   the Prophet--"Hear you now what the Lord says."

   1. Arise, contend you before the mountains, and let the hills hear your
   voice. As men were hardened and turned away their ears, the Prophet was
   told to speak to the mountains, those mountains which had been
   disfigured with the shrines of idols, with altars on every high hill,
   or, perhaps, those higher hills that were never cultivated and that
   remained untouched by the defiling hands of men. God makes an appeal to
   these ancient things.

   2. Hear you, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and you strong
   foundations of the earth: for the LORD has a controversy with His
   people, and He will plead with Israel. It was amazing condescension on
   God's part that He should deign to come as a Defendant before the
   august court of the mountains and in the presence of the deep
   foundations of the earth. It is a noble conception--in poetry, most
   excellent--in grandeur, worthy of God. He made His appeal to the
   ancient hills to hear His pleading while He condescended to argue and
   ask His people why they had rejected their God and turned aside to
   idols. Then He pleaded with Israel.

   3. O My people, what have I done unto you? "What but good, what but
   mercy, have I done unto you?"

   3. And wherein have I wearied you? Testify against Me. He asks them to
   give any reason whatever why they had turned away from Him. Beloved
   Friends, have any of you, who are the people of God, grown cold in your
   love to Him? Are you neglecting the service of the Most High? Are you
   beginning to trust in an arm of flesh? Are you seeking your pleasures
   in the world? Have you lost the love of your espousal, your first love
   to your Blessed Lord? Then hear Him plead with you! Be not as Israel
   was, but let the Lord speak to you rather than to the hills--"What have
   I done unto you? And wherein have I wearied you? Testify against Me." O
   Lord, we have nothing to testify against You! We have very much to
   testify for You and we blush to think that we have not done so more
   often. Oh, that we had felt more love to You and had borne a bolder and
   more consistent testimony to Your love, Your Grace, Your faithfulness!

   4. For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out
   of the house of servants; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and
   Miriam. God constantly refers to Israel's coming out of Egypt--on every
   great occasion He begins, "I

   am the Lord your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt,
   out of the house of bondage." And to His people, the Lord still says,
   "I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the
   house of slavery." Is it not so? Do we not still delight in His
   redeeming work, in the sprinkling of the blood of the Paschal Lamb and
   in the high hand and outstretched arm with which the Lord delivered us
   from the bondage of our sin? Remember that you, also, were a slave!
   Forget not who bought you and with what price! Remember who delivered
   you and led you out with mighty power! Remember this and let your cold
   love burn, again, and let your indifference turn to enthusiasm! O Lord,
   revive Your people! The Lord further says to His people, "I sent before
   you Moses (the Lawgiver), Aaron (the priest) and Miriam (the
   prophetess)." One to teach you, another to plead for you and to
   sacrifice for you, and the third to sing for you, to sing your song of
   gladness at the Red Sea. God has given to His people many ministries in
   many forms--and they are all concentrated in His Son who is everything
   to us. Oh, by the greatness of His gifts to us, let us come back to our
   former love to Him and to something more than that!

   5. O my people, remember now what Balak, king of Moab, consulted, and
   what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that
   you may know the righteousness of the LORD. Balak endeavored to get
   Balaam to curse the people of God, but they could not be overcome by
   human power. He sought to destroy them by superhuman agency, but
   Balaam's curses turned to blessings. God would not permit the false
   prophet to curse Israel and He has in our case turned the curse of the
   great adversary into a blessing. He has delivered us and our trials
   have strengthened us and taught us more of God. Will we not remember
   this? Shittim was the last encampment on the far side of Jordan. Gilgal
   was the first in the Promised Land--therefore they are united, here,
   with God's righteousnesses to His people, for the word is in the
   plural. It is a remarkable idiom--"That you may know the
   righteousnesses of the Lord." He is always righteous, in every way,
   towards everything and under every aspect! I wish we knew this, for
   sometimes we begin to think that He deals harshly with us. When we are
   severely tried, we begin to doubt the righteousness of the Lord.
   Remember all that He has done to you from the first day to the last,
   "that you may know the righteousness of the Lord." Now the plaintiff
   takes up the case, but he, too, turns defendant, and asks what he can
   do to bring about a reconciliation.

   6, 7. Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the
   high God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves of
   a year old? Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with
   ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my
   transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? The people
   will give God everything but what He wants. They begin, you see, by
   saying that they will bring burnt offerings--they are ready to do that.
   The axe shall fall upon the head of numberless young bullocks, such as
   God demanded under the Law. The people are ready enough for that
   sacrifice--and as for rams, they will shed their blood by thousands! If
   oil is needed for the meat offering, rivers of it shall flow! When they
   have offered what God would have, they offer what He would not
   have--what God abhorred and loathed--for they offered to give their
   first-born for their transgressions! They insulted Jehovah with the
   sacrifices of Moloch, with human slaughter, offering their children to
   obtain atonement for their sins! They were willing to go, even, to that
   length, and to do anything but what God wants. And men will still give
   to God anything but what He asks for, majestic edifices, gorgeous
   services, ecstatic music, gold and silver--anything but what the Lord
   demands! Here is God's answer:

   8. He has showed you, O man, what is good and what does the LORD
   require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
   with your God? It was a spiritual worship that the Lord required--not
   externals, not outward gifts-- but the HEART! If you will bring an
   offering, bring yourself--there is no other gift that the Lord so much
   desires. The Prophet mentions three things that the Lord required of
   His people--"To do justly"--here are the equities of life. "To love
   mercy"--here are the kindnesses of life which are to be rendered
   cheerfully. The Prophet does not say, "to do mercy," but to "love" it,
   to take a delight in it, to find great pleasure in the forgiveness of
   injuries, in the helping of the poor, in the cheering of the sick, in
   the teaching of the ignorant, in the winning back of sinners to the
   ways of God. "And to walk humbly with your God." These are the things
   which please Him. And when we are in Christ and He becomes our
   righteousness, these are the sacrifices with which God is well-pleased.
   They make an offering of a sweet smell, a holy incense which we may
   present before Him. Talk no more of your outward ordinances, your
   will-worship with abundance of music, or human eloquence and learning
   and what-not. These things do not delight the Lord--no offering is
   acceptable unless the outward conduct shows that the heart is right
   with Him.

   9. The LORD'S voice cries unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall
   see Your name: hear you the rod, and who has appointed it. God's voice
   to His people is often uttered by means of their affliction--"Hear you
   the rod." He wishes us to understand that judgments and calamities are
   His voice crying to the city. Oh, that we were men of wisdom, that we
   would hear what God has to say! Alas, Israel did not hear and Judah
   would not listen, even, to God's own voice!

   10. Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
   wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? Here He comes to
   practical details. In Micah's day, men had grown rich by oppression, by
   a lack ofjustice--they had wronged their fellow men--and God asked them
   whether they expected to be pleasing to Him when their houses were full
   of treasure which they had virtually stolen by giving scant measure and
   short weight. God condescends even to point out these minute
   particulars of moral conduct and so should His servants. It is not for
   us, His ministers, to be soaring into the clouds, to astonish you with
   the grandeur of our thoughts and words--but to come to your shops, to
   look at your bushel-measures and your pecks, your yardsticks and your
   weights!

   11. 12. Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the
   bag of deceitful weights? For the rich men thereof are full of violence
   and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is
   deceitful in their mouths. They were, I suppose, very much what
   Orientals still are. You cannot trade with them without having need of
   more than two eyes. Their price has to be beaten down and their
   quantities must be counted. God would not have His people like this. He
   says nothing about the Moabites or the Babylonians doing this, but for
   His people to do it was very grievous to Him.

   13. Therefore also will I make you sick in smiting you, in making you
   desolate because of your sins. They lied and they cheated--so God would
   give them a sorry tongue, betokening their ill health. He would make
   their present distress to get worse and worse till they should be sick
   through their wounds.

   14. You shall eat, but not be satisfied. The satisfaction that comes to
   us through eating is of His mercy and when He wills, He can say, "You
   shall eat, but not be satisfied."

   14. And your casting down shall be in the midst of you. "You shall feel
   an inward sinking--even when you have eaten, you shall be faint--as a
   man who has eaten nothing."

   14. And you shall take hold, but shall not deliver; and that which you
   deliver will I give up to the sword. So that in every project they
   would be disappointed--in every design they would be frustrated because
   God would be against them.

   15. You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives,
   but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not
   drink wine. God can let men have every form of outward prosperity and
   yet make nothing of it. I fear that some, perhaps some present, have
   every outward religious blessing yet nothing comes of it. You hear
   sermons, you come to meetings, you tread the olives, but you are not
   anointed with the oil. The grapes are in the wine vat, but you drink
   not the wine. God save us from that sad condition!

   16. For the statutes of Omri are kept. They would not keep the statutes
   of God, but they kept the foul statutes of Omri, which appear to have
   been especially objectionable to God.

   16. And all the works of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their
   counsels. He was an arch rebel against God. Remember his murder of
   Naboth to get his vineyard? And these people followed his evil example.

   16. That I should make you a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an
   hissing: therefore you shall bear the reproach of My people. Very hard
   was it to bear that reproach when there would be none of the comforts
   of the Spirit to go with it. There are some professors who bear the
   reproach of Christ, but will never share His crown--that is a fearful
   state of things. Gladly enough would we take up that reproach that we
   may be truly His. But if we profess to be God's people and act
   inconsistently, we shall bear all the reproach, but have nothing to
   sustain us under it. O Lord, in Your mercy, save us from this!

The Lamb Of God In Scripture

   (No. 2329)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 8, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 25, 1889.

   "Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. And looking
   at Jesus as He walked, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!" John 1:35,36.

   You all know the old, old story. The world was lost. God must punish
   sin. He sent His Son to take our sin upon Him that He might honor the
   Law of God and establish God's government by being obedient to the Law
   of God and yielding Himself up to the death penalty. He whom Jehovah
   loves beyond all else came to earth, became a Man and, as a Man, was
   obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. It is He who is
   called, in our text, "the Lamb of God," the one Sacrifice for man's
   sin. There is no putting away of sin without sacrifice--there is only
   one Sacrifice that can put away sin--and that is Jesus Christ, the
   Righteous. He is Divine, yet Human--Son of God, yet Son of Mary. He
   yielded up His life, "the Just for the unjust," the Sinless for the
   sinful, "that He might bring us to God," and reconcile us to the great
   Father. That is the story and whoever believes in Him shall live. Any
   man, the world over, who will trust himself to Christ, God's great
   Sacrifice, shall be saved, for this is our continual witness, "He that
   believes on the Son has everlasting life." "For God so loved the world,
   that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish but have everlasting life."

   Tonight I do not intend so much to preach a sermon as to urge those who
   have seen the Lamb of God to look at Him more intently, to study Him
   more and especially to plead for the power of the Holy Spirit to reveal
   Him to them. I want to entreat men who have looked elsewhere, to now
   turn their eyes away from the fruitless search after peace and life,
   and to come and, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of
   the world." May the Spirit of God open their eyes and incline their
   hearts that, tonight, even tonight, they may look unto Him and live!

   When John saw Jesus Christ on that memorable day, he, first of all,
   beheld Him, himself, and then he said to others, "Behold the Lamb of
   God." "Looking at Jesus as He walked," steadfastly beholding Him,
   watching Him, gazing with humble admiration at Him, he said, "Behold
   the Lamb of God!" Brethren, we cannot preach what we have not
   practiced! If these eyes have never looked to Jesus, how can I bid your
   eyes look at Him? Beholding Him, I found peace to my soul. I, who was
   disposed, even, to despair, rose from the depths of anguish to the
   heights of joy by looking unto Him! And I, therefore, dare to say to
   you, "Behold the Lamb of God!" Oh, that each one of you might believe
   our testimony concerning Jesus and look to Him and live!

   What did John mean by saying, "Behold the Lamb of God"? Behold, in the
   Latin, "ecce," is a note of admiration, of wonderment, of exclamation.
   "Behold the Lamb of God!" There was nothing of greater wonder ever seen
   than that God, Himself, should provide the Lamb for the Burnt Offering,
   that He should provide His only Son out of His very bosom, that He
   should give the delight of His heart to die for us! Well may we behold
   this great wonder! Angels admire and marvel at this mystery of
   godliness--God manifest in the flesh! They have never left off
   wondering and adoring the Grace of God that gave Jesus to be the
   Sacrifice for guilty men. Behold and wonder, never leave off
   wondering--tell it as a wonder, think of it as a wonder, sing of it as
   a wonder! Even in Heaven you will not cease to wonder at this glorious
   Lamb of

   God!

   I think that John also meant his disciples to consider, when he said to
   them, "Behold the Lamb of God!" So we say to you, "Think of Him, study
   Him, know all that you can about Him, look Him up and down. He is
   God--do you understand that He stood in the sinner's place? He is
   Man--do you know how near akin He is to you, how sympathetic He

   is--a Brother born for your adversity? The Person of Christ is a great
   marvel--how can God and man be in one Person? It is impossible for us
   to tell. We believe what we cannot comprehend and we rejoice in what we
   cannot understand! He whom God has provided to be your Savior is both
   God and Man--He can lay His hand upon both parties. He can touch your
   manhood in its weakness and touch the Godhead in its All-Sufficiency!
   Study Christ! The most excellent of all the sciences is the knowledge
   of a crucified Savior. He is most learned in the university of Heaven
   who knows most of Christ. He who has known most of Him still says that
   His love surpasses knowledge. Behold Him, then, with wonder! And behold
   Him with thankfulness.

   But when John says, "Behold the Lamb of God!" he means more than
   wondering or considering. "Looking" is used in Scripture for
   faith--"Look unto Me and be you saved." Therefore we sing--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One, There is life at this
   moment for you!" Beholding is a steady kind of looking. Believe then,
   in Christ with a solid, abiding confidence. Come, you sinners, come,
   and trust your Savior, not for tonight, only, but forever! Believe that
   He is able and willing to save you and trust Him to do so--

   "Venture on Him, venture wholly Let no other trust intrude."

   Take your eyes off everything else and behold the Lamb of God! You need
   not see anything else, nothing else is worth seeing, but behold Him.
   See how He takes your guilt, see how He bears it, see how He sinks
   under it and yet rises from it, crying, "It is finished!" He gives up
   the ghost. He is buried. He rises again from the dead because He is
   accepted of God and His redeeming work is done. Trust Him, trust Him,
   trust Him! "Look and live," is now our message--not, "do and live,"
   but, "live and do!" If you ask how you are to live, our answer is look,
   trust, believe, confide, rest in Christ--and the moment you do so, you
   are saved!

   But, once more, when John said to His disciples, "Behold the Lamb of
   God!" it was a hint that they should leave off looking at John and turn
   their attention wholly to Jesus and follow Him. Hence we find that
   John's two disciples left him and became the disciples of Christ.
   Beloved, we who preach long to have your attention, but when you give
   your attention to us, our longing, then, is to pass it on to Christ our
   Lord. Look on Him and follow Him, not us! What can we do, poor
   creatures that we are? Look unto Him! Mark His footsteps! Walk in them.
   Do as He bids you! Take Him for your Lord, become His disciples, His
   servants. Behold the Lamb of God and always behold Him! Look to Him,
   look up to Him and follow where He leads the way.

   Thus I have put the text before you pretty simply. Now I want to talk
   to you a little about beholding this Lamb of God, taking a hasty run
   through various Scripture references to the lamb. And I will ask you,
   first, to Behold the Lamb of God in His connections with men. And
   secondly to Behold the Lamb of God in His benedictions to men.

   I. Let us, first, BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD IN HIS CONNECTIONS WITH MEN.

   How was the Lamb of God first seen in the world? It was the case of the
   lamb for one man, brought by one man for himself, and on his own
   behalf. You all know that I refer to Abel, who was a shepherd, and
   brought of the firstlings of his flock, that is, a lamb, and he brought
   this lamb for himself, and on his own account, that he might be
   accepted of God, and that he might present to God an offering
   well-pleasing in His sight. Cain brought of the fruit of the ground as
   an offering to God. I think that there was a difference in the
   sacrifice, as well as in the man bringing it, for the Holy Spirit says
   little about the difference of the man, but He says, "By faith Abel
   offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain," and he was
   accepted because he brought a more excellent sacrifice. The one
   sacrifice was bloodless, the fruit of the ground--the other was typical
   of Christ, the Lamb of God and was, therefore, accepted. "And the Lord
   had respect unto Abel and to his offering."

   Now, Beloved, our first view of Christ usually is here, to know Him for
   ourselves. I am a sinner and I want to have communion with my God--how
   shall I obtain it? I am guilty, I am sinful--how shall I draw near to
   the holy God? Here is the answer. Take the Lord Jesus Christ to be
   yours by faith and bring Him to God! You must be accepted if you bring
   Christ with you! The Father never repelled the Son, nor one who was
   clothed with the Son's righteousness, or who pleaded the Son's merit.
   Come you, as Abel came, not with fruits of your own growing, but with
   the sacrifice of blood-- with Christ, the Holy Victim, the spotless
   Lamb of God--and so coming, whoever you may be, you shall be acceptable
   before God by faith. Now, behold Him, each one of you for yourself!

   I know what someone will say, "I hope to do that, by-and-by." I hope
   you do not so deceive yourself! I have heard that there was once a
   great meeting in the den of the arch-enemy and he was stirring up his
   lackeys to seek the destruction of men. One of them said, "I have gone
   forth and I have told men that there is no God, and no hereafter, and
   no difference between sin and righteousness, and that they may live as
   they like!" And there was considerable approbation among the evil
   spirits. But Satan, himself, said, "You have done small service, for
   man has a conscience, and his conscience teaches him better. He knows
   that there is a God. He knows that there is a difference between sin
   and righteousness. He knows that there must be future punishment. You
   have done but little." Then another stood up, and said, "I have done
   better, I think, most Mighty Chieftain, for I have told them that the
   Bible is a worn-out book, that it was a fable at the first, and that
   they need not believe it." There was a round of cheers, for they said
   that he had done splendid service for the cause of darkness.

   But Satan said, "It is in vain that you meddle with the old Book! It
   has taken care of itself and it can still do so. There is no shaking
   it, it is like a rock. You have done service for a time, but it will
   soon pass away." And scarcely did any of the fallen spirits, after
   that, venture to bring forward his boasting in the presence of the
   terrible master who sat in the midst of them. But, at last, one said,
   "I have told men that they have souls, and that there is a God, and
   that the Bible is true. I have left them to believe as they will, but I
   have whispered in their ears that there is plenty of time to consider
   all this." Then there was a hush--and the great master of demons said,
   "You have done best of all. This is my great net in which I take more
   souls than with any other, this net of procrastination or delay."

   Therefore say I to you, my Hearers, disappoint the fiend! Fly to Jesus.
   Fly to Jesus at once! Behold, not tomorrow, but tonight! Behold the
   Lamb of God, each man for himself!

   Now turn over the pages of this grand old Book and you will find the
   Lamb, next, in another connection. Israel was in Egypt and there they
   had the lamb for the family--"In the tenth day of this month they shall
   take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers,
   a lamb for an house." Oh, I wish that you would all go on to behold the
   Lamb of God for your households! "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
   you shall be saved." Why do you stop before you finish the verse? What
   said the Apostle to the trembling jailor? Not merely all that I have
   quoted, but more-- "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be
   saved, and your house." Are there not many Believers who do not believe
   for their house? Come, now, and believe in this provision of the Lamb
   for the house! Trust the Grace of God for that little girl, the last
   born, and for that boy who is still at school, who does not think much
   of these things as yet--and for that son of yours who has left home and
   gone out as an apprentice. Oh, that the Lamb of God might be for him!
   Pray for him, tonight, and you older parents, pray for your sons who
   are married, and your daughters who have taken to themselves husbands
   and are away from you! The Lamb is for the house, pray for the whole
   household, tonight--take in your grandchildren, all you old folks--all
   of them who are in your house. Pray that the Lamb may be for the house!

   I bless God that I can look upon all my household and rejoice that they
   are converted to Christ! My father has this joy, too! And my
   grandfather also had that joy! Oh, it is a great bliss to have
   families, generation after generation, all brought to Christ without
   exception! Why should it not be so? Let us cry for it! Surely we may
   expect the same blessing that God gave to His chosen people under the
   Law and expect it more largely. Grace does not run in the blood, but
   Grace often runs side by side with it, so that Abraham is loved, and
   Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, and Ephraim, and Ma-nasseh. Thus the
   Covenant blessing goes on from one to another. Plead with God, tonight,
   that all in your house may be beneath the sprinkled blood of the Lamb
   and be saved from the destroying angel--and that all with you may go
   out of Egypt to have a possession in the land of the promise!

   A little further on, following the Scripture, and asking you to still
   behold the Lamb, in the 29th chapter of that famous Book of Exodus, at
   the 38th and 39th verses, we come across God's command for the lamb for
   the people--"Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar; two
   lambs of the first year, day by day, continually. The one lamb you
   shall offer in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at even."
   Here is the lamb for all the chosen people, the lamb for Israel! It
   began with the unit, it went on to the family and here the Lord, who
   "loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob," makes
   His Tabernacle to be the central place where a lamb shall be offered
   for the whole nation! Think of it with delight, tonight, that Christ
   died for all His chosen people! He has redeemed them from among men.
   Though they are as many as the stars for number, or as the sand on the
   seashore, innumerable, yet that one Sacrifice has redeemed them all!
   Glory be to God for the blood of the Lamb by which the whole of
   Christ's people are redeemed!

   Then let your mind take wing right out of the Old Testament into the
   New, for I have not time to trace all the successive steps. Come now to
   John, saying, in the 29th verse of this chapter, "Behold the Lamb of
   God, which takes away the sin of the world." Now you have gone beyond
   the bounds of Israel, and have come to the Lamb for the world. You have
   come to the Lamb of God who dies for Gentiles as well as for Jews, for
   men in the isles of the sea, for men in the wilds of Africa, for men of
   every color and every race, and every time, and every clime! Oh, glory
   be to God, wherever there are men, we may go and tell them of Christ!
   Wherever there are men born of Adam's race, we may tell them of the
   Second Adam, to whom looking, they who look shall live--and in Him they
   shall find eternal life! I love to think of the breaking down of the
   boundaries that shut in the flow of Grace to one nation! Behold, it
   flows over all Asia Minor, at first, and then over all Greece, and then
   to Rome, and Paul talks of going to Spain and the Gospel is borne
   across the sea to England, and from this country it has gone out unto
   the utmost ends of the earth!

   Well now, take your flight, if you can get beyond that, away to Heaven,
   itself, and there you will see the Lamb for all Heaven! Look at
   Revelation, the seventh chapter, and the 14th verse. No, you need not
   look it up, for you know it. All the saints in Heaven are standing in
   their glittering ranks, white-robed, pure as the driven snow. They sing
   and praise one glorious name, when one of the elders first asked the
   question, "What are these which are arrayed in white robes, and from
   where did they come?" He, himself, gave the answer, "These are they
   which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
   made them white in the blood of the Lamb."--

   "Round the altar priests confess, If their robes are white as snow,
   'Twas the Savior's righteousness, And His blood that made them so." The
   blood of the Lamb has whitened all the saints who are in Heaven! They
   sing of Him who loved them and laved [washed] them from their sins in
   His own blood! I have often wondered why that second word was not
   brought into our translation, for it so beautifully fits the language
   of the beloved Apostle John--"Unto Him that loved us, and laved us from
   our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and priests unto God
   and His Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
   There is no whiteness in Heaven but what the Lamb has worked, no
   brightness there but what the Lamb has bought! Everything there shows
   the wondrous power and surpassing merit of the Lamb of God!

   If it is possible to think of something more glorious than I have
   already described, I think you will find it in the fifth chapter of
   Revelation, at the 13th verse--"And every creature which is in Heaven,
   and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and
   all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory,
   and power be unto Him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb
   forever and ever." The day shall come when, from every place that God
   has made, there shall be heard the voice of praise unto the Lamb--there
   shall be found everywhere men and women redeemed by blood, angels and
   glorious spirits, rejoicing to adore Him who was, and is, and is to
   come, the Almighty Lamb of God!

   I think I have given you something to consider if you turn over the
   pages of Scripture and follow the track of the bleeding Lamb.

   II. But now, taking you again over the same road a little, I want you,
   in the second place, to BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD IN HIS BENEDICTIONS TO
   MEN.

   The first blessing of all is that of Abel. He was accepted of God. He
   offered a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain. Well now, let anybody
   here who does not know it, try to learn this lesson tonight. You can
   only be "accepted in the Beloved." God loves His Son with such an
   overflowing love that He has love enough for you, love enough for
   me--if we are in Christ Jesus. He is the great conduit or channel of
   God's love and that love flows through all the pipes to every soul that
   believes in Jesus. Hide behind your Lord and you are safe! Trust His
   name, living and dying, and nothing can harm you. How many dear hearts,
   when passing through the Valley of the Shadow of Death--when grim
   thoughts have clustered about them--have been cheered and comforted by
   the thought of Christ! Remember the monk who, as he died, put away the
   priest, the crucifix and everything else, and cried, "Tua vulnera,
   Jesu! Tua vulnera, Jesu!" "Your wounds, Jesus! Your wounds, Jesus!" I
   am not saved by what I can do, but by what He has done--not by what I
   have suffered, but by what He has endured. There hangs our everlasting
   hope--we trust to Christ in life and in death and we are accepted for
   His sake! Come, every sinner, bring the Lamb of God! Put Him on the
   altar and you shall be accepted at once, and you may at once begin to
   praise the name of the Lord!

   But then, as we go on, we find this Lamb of God useful, not only for
   acceptance, but also for rescue and deliverance. It is a dark and
   dreadful night. Egypt shivers and stands aghast. And just at midnight
   flies forth an angel, armed with the sword of death. In every house of
   Egypt there is heard a wail, for the firstborn is dead, from the
   firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the woman who turns the mill
   to grind the daily corn. Death is in every house! No, stop--there are
   houses wherein there is no death! What has secured those habitations?
   The father took a lamb, shed its blood, dipped a bunch of hyssop in it
   and smeared the lintel and the two side posts--and then all sat down
   and feasted, undisturbed, on the lamb--calm and happy. They rejoiced to
   have for food that lamb whose blood was the ensign of their safety.
   There was no crying, there, no dying there! Death could not touch the
   inhabitants of the house that was marked with the blood of the paschal
   lamb. Beloved, you and I are perfectly safe if we are sheltered beneath
   the blood of the Lamb of God! Nothing can harm us, everything must
   bless us--and we may go to our beds, tonight, singing--

   "Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood,

   I lay me down to rest,

   As in the embraces of my God,

   Or on my Sa vior's breast."

   We may rise tomorrow morning, if we are spared, and go into this busy
   world without any fear. The broad arrow of the King is set upon us in
   the blood-mark of the atoning Sacrifice, and we are safe, and safe
   forever. Glory be to the name of the Lord for this!

   Nor was that all. As I have told you, the blood of the paschal lamb was
   not only sprinkled for the protection of the house, but its flesh was
   the food of the inhabitants. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, we do not, at
   first, know what it is to feed on Christ! We are satisfied to be
   sprinkled with His blood, but the Believer, afterwards, finds that
   Christ is the food of his soul. His blood is drink, indeed, and His
   flesh is meat, indeed. Oh, what a festival have we kept over the Person
   of our Lord! Sometimes, when faint and hungry, we have begun to think
   of the Incarnate God, the bleeding Lamb, the full Atonement paid, and
   we have said, "My soul is full, satisfied with favor, full of the
   blessing of the Lord." I do not know what there is in the Gospel if you
   take away the Atoning Sacrifice. It seems to me that there would be
   nothing left but chaff which might suit asses and horses, but would not
   be fit for men. Look to Jesus Christ dying in our place and here is
   something for the soul to feed upon, yes, and to be satisfied with, as
   with marrow and fatness!

   I pointed you, a little further on, to the lamb in the wilderness, the
   lamb offered up every day. That brings us to another point in our
   Lord's work. We have had Christ for acceptance, Christ for safety, and
   Christ for food, now we have Christ for perpetual resort. The Lamb of
   God in the morning! Oh, blessed be God for a Savior in the morning! If
   the night has gathered anything of evil, He does then disperse it, as
   the sun dispels the darkness. But oh, what a precious thing to also
   have the Lamb of God in the evening! If in the day we have soiled our
   feet in traversing this busy world, here we come to the Fountain and we
   are made clean through the blood of the Lamb! Perpetual merit,
   perpetual intercession, perpetual life-giving, perpetual salvation flow
   from Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God! He is not slain twice. His one
   wonderful offering has finished transgression and made an end of sin,
   but its efficacy continues as though He were sacrificed often, always
   supplying us with merit, so that, in effect, His wounds continually
   bleed. He is always a new Savior for me every morning, always a new
   Savior every night and yet always the same Savior, the same Christ!
   There is no getting weary of Him, there is nothing "stale" in Him. They
   may talk about "a new view of the Atonement." I have no view of the
   Atonement but this--"Who loved me, and gave Himself for me." "Who His
   own Self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." And that old view
   of the Atonement is always fresh and always new to the heart and
   conscience!

   Well now, Beloved, when we again come to John, following our former run
   of thought, we find the Lamb of God useful for guidance, for when John
   said, "Behold the Lamb of God," the two disciples followed Jesus and we
   read of some, "These are they which follow the Lamb wherever He goes."
   The Lamb is our Guide. The Lord is a Shepherd as well as a Lamb, and
   the flock following in His footsteps is safely led. My Soul, when you
   need to know which way to go, behold the Lamb of God! Ask, "What would
   Jesus do?" Then do what Jesus would have done in such a case and you
   can not do amiss.

   Further on we find such a passage as this, telling us of victory
   through the Lamb of God--"They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb."
   The Lamb is a great Warrior--there is none like He. Is He not the Lion
   of the tribe of Judah? Though He is gentle as a lamb, yet against sin
   and iniquity He is fiercer than a young lion when it roars on its prey.
   If we

   follow Him, hold fast His Truth, believe in His Atonement and
   perpetually proclaim His Gospel, we shall overcome all error, all sin
   and all evil!

   Well now, this blessed Lamb--it is not easy to leave off talking about
   Him when one once begins--one is so blessed that you may well behold
   Him, for all happiness comes through Him. In Heaven you will see
   nothing without Him. "Nothing," you ask? No, nothing--here is a proof
   of my words. "The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
   shine in it, for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the
   light thereof." All the light, the knowledge, the joy, the bliss of
   Heaven come through the Atoning Sacrifice of Christ! Not Jesus only,
   but Jesus slain, Jesus the Lamb of God is the very Light of Heaven!

   And what do you think is the joy-day of Heaven, the time for the
   highest exultation? Why, the joyous day when all the golden bells shall
   peal out their glorious melodies, and all the silver trumpets shall
   ring out their jubilant notes will be the day of the marriage of the
   Lamb! It is the Heaven of Heaven, the climax of ineffable delight!! And
   the voice of the great multitude, as the voice of many waters and as
   the voice of mighty thunder, sings, "Alleluia: for the Lord God
   Omnipotent reigns. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to Him:
   for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself
   ready." So that, at the topmost round of the ladder of eternal bliss,
   there you find the Lamb! You cannot get beyond Him. He gives you all He
   has, even Himself. Behold Him, then, and go on beholding Him throughout
   the countless ages of eternity!

   I would to God that you had all beheld Him, and I pray you to behold
   Him tonight. It is but a little while and the death-film will gather
   about your eyes--and if you have not seen the Lamb while yet you have
   mortal eyes, you will see Him, you will certainly see Him--but your
   vision will be like that of Balaam. "I shall see Him, but not now: I
   shall behold Him, but not near." If it is with you, "not now," it may
   be, "not near." It will be an awful thing to see the Lamb with a gulf
   between yourself and Him, for there is a great, impassable gulf fixed
   in the next world--and when you see Him across that gulf, how will you
   feel? Then shall you cry to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us, and
   hide us from the face of Him that sits on the Throne, and from the
   wrath of the Lamb!" Jesus will still be a Lamb, even to the lost--it is
   "the wrath of the Lamb" that they will dread! The Lamb is always
   conspicuous. He may be neglected, rejected, refused tonight, but He
   will be beheld in eternity and beheld to your everlasting confusion and
   unutterable dismay if you refuse to behold Him now. Let it not be so
   with any of you--

   "You sinners, seek His face,

   Whose wrath you cannot bear!

   Fly to the shelter of His Cross,

   And find salvation there."

   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 1:1-37.

   John is the majestic Evangelist. He is the high-soaring eagle with
   piercing eyes. His is the Gospel of the Son of God!

   Verses 1-3. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
   and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All
   things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was
   made. We cannot describe the Deity of Christ in clearer language than
   John uses. He was with God. He was God. He did the works of God, for He
   was the Creator. If any doubt His Deity, they must do so in distinct
   defiance of the language of Holy Scripture!

   4, 5. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
   shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. Christ is
   still not understood. Jesus is still not known. How should darkness
   understand the Light of God? It opposes the Light of God--it has to
   flee before light, but it does not, it cannot understand the Light of
   God! O God, work a miracle in our dark hearts and fill them with the
   Light of Christ!

   6, 7. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came
   for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through Him
   might believe. That is our business, too. We who are ministers sent
   from God bear witness of the Light, that all men through Him may
   believe. Oh, how often we go home and cry, "Who has believed our
   report?" We do not ask you to believe in us--no, but in our Master,
   whose heralds we are. If we can lead you to faith in Him, we shall be
   glad, indeed! But, if not, we will sorrow because we have missed our
   mark and failed in our purpose.

   8, 9. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
   Light. That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into
   the world. If any man has saving Light, true Light, he gets it through
   Christ. There is no other Light--all other light is but darkness
   visible. The Light in which we see God comes from Jesus.

   10. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world
   knew Him not. Strange was it that the Creator came to His own earth and
   yet He was unknown. Men mistook Him, they hated Him, they crucified Him
   whom they ought to have entertained with sacred hospitality and
   worshipped with holy loyalty.

   11, 12. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many
   as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even
   to them that believe on His name. All men are not the sons of God! The
   doctrine of the universal Fatherhood is utterly untrue! They only
   become the sons of God who receive Christ and believe on His name.
   Otherwise they are heirs of wrath, even as others--

   "To them ga ve He power to become the sons of God."

   13. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
   the will of man, but of God. There is another birth beside the natural
   one--never does the birth of the flesh make us Christians! If our
   ancestry should be a line of saints, yet are we born sinners--we must
   be born again if we are to become saints. If we could trace our
   pedigree to a perfect man, if such there is, yet the birth by the flesh
   would not avail us. Sons of God are, "born, not of blood, nor of the
   will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."

   14. And the Word was made flesh. Here was the Incarnation of Him who
   made all things. He that is God, "was made

   flesh."

   14. And dwelt among us, (and we--The Apostles

   14. Beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father),
   full of Grace and truth. Oh, all you who would know Christ, learn that
   He is worth the knowing! He is full of Grace for your sinnership and
   full of truth for your ignorance! He can cleanse and He can teach.
   There is everything in Him that you need. You shall not be deceived,
   for He is full of the Truth of God--you shall not be rejected, for He
   is full of Grace.

   15-18. John bore witness of Him and cried, saying, This was He of whom
   I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for He was
   before me. And of His fullness have all we received, and Grace for
   Grace. For the Law was given by Moses, but Grace and truth came by
   Jesus Christ. No man has seen God at any time. He is too high, too
   spiritual to be perceived by human senses.

   18. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He has
   declared Him. What of God we need to know, we may see in Christ--enough
   to save us, enough to sanctify us, enough to make us all like the
   only-begotten Son of the Father.

   19, 20. And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
   Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? And he confessed, and
   denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. With indignation he
   must have repelled the idea that he was the Messiah--

   "I am not the Christ."

   21-23. And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am
   not. Are you that Prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they unto
   him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What
   say you of yourself? He said, I am the voice--Humbly he reduces himself
   to a voice, but he was not "a voice and nothing more." There was much
   that was mighty and wise in that voice.

   23-27. Of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
   Lord, as said the Prophet Isaiah. And they which were sent were of the
   Pharisees. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you,
   then, if you are not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that Prophet?
   John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands One
   among you, whom you know not; He it is, who coming after me is
   preferred before me, whose shoelaces I am not worthy to unloose. How
   John hides himself behind his Master! He was a most worthy man, a truly
   great man, but he counted himself unworthy of the most menial service
   for Christ and felt honored by filling the office of a slave to
   unloosen His Master's shoelaces. It is better to be the slave of Christ
   than to rule vast empires! He who truly serves Him is glorified
   thereby.

   28, 29. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
   was baptizing. The next day John saw Jesus coming unto Him, and says,
   Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world. Now is
   he bringing out his message! Now is he pointing out his Master.

   30, 31. This is He of whom I said, After me comes a Man which is
   preferred before me: for He was before me. And I knew Him not. John
   knew Jesus very well, but he did not know Him as the Sent One of God,
   the Messiah, till after he had received the sign and token at His
   baptism. "I knew Him not."

   31-34. But that He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore have I
   come, baptizing with water. And John bore record, saying, I saw the
   Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I
   knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
   unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining
   on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. And I saw
   and bare record that this is the Son of God. Jesus and John must have
   been well acquainted with one another--they were closely related--but
   John was not to know anybody as the Messiah till he received the token
   from God. When he saw that token, then he officially knew and he bore
   instant witness-- "This is the Son of God."

   35, 36. Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. And
   looking at Jesus as He walked. With holy reverence, with loving awe,
   gazing upon this extraordinary Person--"as He walked"--

   36, 37. He said," Behold the Lamb of God!" And the two disciples heard
   him speak, and they followed Jesus. This is our one business tonight,
   to cry, "Behold the Lamb of God!"

Witnessing Better Than Knowing the Future

   (No. 2330)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 15, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST
   29, 1889.

   "When they therefore were come together, they asked of Him, saying,
   Lord, willyou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And He
   said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons
   which the Father has put in His own power. But you shall receive power
   when the Holy Spirit has come upon you: andyou shall be witnesses unto
   Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the
   uttermost part of the earth." Acts 1:6-8.

   THESE are among the last words of our Lord. We greatly prize the last
   words of good men. Let us set high store by these words of our
   ascending Lord. It is very curious to my mind that Jesus should make
   mention of John the Baptist and of John's Baptism in these last words.
   Read the fifth verse--"John truly baptized with water; but you shall be
   baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence." It is very usual
   for good men's memories, in their last hours, to go back to their first
   hours. I trust that some of us will think of our Baptism even when we
   are dying--

   High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear-- Till in life's latest hour I bow, And bless in death a bond so
   dear."

   Our Lord began in such a way that He could afford to look back on His
   beginning. Some do not commence so-- their beginning is so undecided,
   so imperfect, so hesitating, that they may well wish to have it
   forgotten. But our Lord, at the close of His sojourn on earth, thinks
   of John the Baptist and pays him a dying word of respect just before He
   is taken up into Glory. I like to notice that interesting fact.

   But, now, to come more to the text, a question was put to our Lord.
   Many questions were asked of Him by His disciples, some of them not
   very wise ones. We are very glad that they asked them, for they have
   extracted from the Savior a great amount of instruction and, although
   this question about restoring the Kingdom to Israel may have been a
   mistaken one, and they may have meant a more material and carnal
   kingdom than our Savior intended to establish (of that I am not sure),
   yet the question brought to us a reply which we may well store up in
   our memories and hearts--"It is not for you to know the times or the
   seasons which the Father has put in His own power. But you shall
   receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you: and you shall be
   witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria,
   and unto the uttermost part of the earth."

   We have three things to talk about, tonight. First, some things which
   are not for us. Secondly, some things for us to receive. And thirdly,
   something for us to be.

   I. First, then, let us consider SOME THINGS WHICH ARE NOT FOR US. It is
   not for us to know the times and the seasons, or to be able to make a
   map of the future. There are some great events of the future very
   clearly revealed. The Prophecy is not at all indistinct about the facts
   that will occur, but as to when they will occur, we have no data. Some
   think that they have, but our Lord, here, seems to say that we do not
   know the times and the seasons--and that it is not for us to know them.
   I pass no censure upon brethren who think that, by elaborate
   calculations, they find out what is to be in the future. I say that I
   pass no censure, but time has passed censure of the strongest kind upon
   all their predecessors! I forget how many miles of books interpreting
   prophecy there are in the British Museum, but I believe it amounts to
   miles, all of which have been disproved by the lapse of time. Some of
   the writers were wonderfully definite--they knew within half-an-hour
   when the Lord would come! Some of them were very distinct about all the
   events--they had mapped

   them all within a few years. The men who wrote the books, happily for
   themselves, had mostly died before the appointed time came. It is
   always wise to pitch on a long period of prophecy, that you may be out
   of the way if the thing does not come off--and they mostly did so.
   There were very few of them who lived to suffer the disappointment
   which would certainly have come to them through having fixed the wrong
   date. I let time censure their mistake. God forgave it, for they did it
   with a desire for His Glory. The bulk of them were most sincere
   students of the Word of God and, herein, are a lesson to us, even
   though they were mistaken in their calculations. But, Beloved, it is
   not for you to know the times and the seasons.

   First, it is not proper for you. It is not your work. You are not sent
   into the world to be prophets--you are sent into the world to be
   witnesses. You do not come here to be prognosticators of the events of
   tomorrow about yourself, or about your children, or about your friends,
   or about the nations of the earth. A veil hangs between you and the
   future. Your prayer is to be, "Your Kingdom come. Your will be done in
   earth, as it is in Heaven." You are told to look for the coming of your
   Lord and to stand in perpetual expectation of His return, but to know
   the time when He will come is no part of your office. You are servants
   who are to look for your Lord, who may come at cock-crowing, or at
   midday, or at midnight. Always stay on your tiptoes of expectation. It
   would be wrong for you to profess that you need not watch until
   such-and-such a time, for you know that He will not come until that
   date arrived.

   As it is not proper for you, so it is not profitable for you. What
   would you be the better if you could make a map of all that is yet to
   be? Suppose it were revealed to you, tonight, by an angel--in what
   respect would it alter your conduct for tomorrow? In what way would it
   help you to perform the duties which your Master has enjoined upon you?
   I believe that it would be a very dangerous gift--you would be tempted
   to set yourself up as an interpreter of the future. If men believed in
   you, you would become eminent and notable, and you would be looked upon
   with awe. The temptation would be to become a prophet on your own
   account, to head a new sect, to lead a new company of men to believe in
   yourself. I say that that would be the temptation. For my part, I would
   rather not know any more than my Lord pleases to reveal to me--and if
   He revealed all the future to me, I would feel like the Prophets who
   spoke of "the burden of the Lord." Neither would it ensure your
   salvation to be able to foretell the future, for Balaam was a great
   prophet, but he was a great sinner--he was an arch-rebel although he
   was an arch-divine.

   Nor do I know that by foretelling the future you would convince your
   fellow men, for Noah told them that the world would be destroyed by the
   Flood. He could give them a very accurate account of the time when the
   rain would descend and yet they were not converted by his preaching,
   neither did they come into the ark. Those Truths which God has revealed
   you must accept for yourselves and proclaim to others--they are
   profitable for all purposes and sufficient for your work--but the
   future is known only to God!

   And as it is not proper or profitable, so it is not possible for you to
   know the times and the seasons. You may study as you will and pray as
   you please, but the times and the seasons are not committed to you. Our
   Lord, as Man, spoke of one great event of which He did not know the
   time--"Of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which
   are in Heaven, neither the Son, but the Father." He does not say that,
   now that He has risen from the dead, but He seems to hint that He did
   not know so as to tell His disciples--He must keep it secret, even from
   them, that "which the Father has put in His own power."

   Notice, next, dear Friends, that it is not good for you to know the
   times and the seasons. That is what the Savior means when He says, "It
   is not for you to know." For, first, it would distract your attention
   from the great things of which you have to think. It is enough for your
   mind to dwell upon the Cross and the coming Glory of your Lord. Keep
   these two things distinctly before you and you need not puzzle your
   brains about the future. If you knew that something important was going
   to happen very speedily, you might be full of consternation and do your
   work in a great hurry. You might be worked up into a frenzy that would
   spoil all your service. Or, if there was a long time to elapse before
   the great event, you might feel the indifference of distance. If our
   Lord were not to come for another hundred years, and He may not, we
   cannot tell--then we might say, "My Lord delays His coming," and so we
   might begin to sleep, or to play the wanton. It is for our good to
   always stand in this condition--knowing that He is coming, knowing that
   He will reign, knowing that certain great events will certainly
   transpire--but not knowing the exact times and seasons when those
   events are to be expected.

   But there is something better than knowing the times or the seasons--it
   is good for us to know that they are in the Father's power--"which the
   Father has put in His own power." The events will come to pass, then,
   in due time. The future is all in God's hands. No prophecy will lack
   its mate. No Word of God will fall unfulfilled to the ground. Possess
   your souls in patience--the things that are foretold are sure to
   happen. "Though the vision tarry, wait for it; because it will surely
   come, it will not tarry." I am persuaded that God never is before His
   time, but He is never late. He never failed to keep appointments with
   His people to the tick of the clock. The future is in the Father's
   power.

   And especially let it be remembered that it is in His power as our
   Father. He must arrange it rightly. He must arrange it in infinite love
   to us. It cannot be that, in some dark hour yet to come, He will forget
   us. He is our Father--will He forget His children? If the times could
   be in my hands, how earnestly would I pray that Christ would take them
   into His hands, or that the Father would take away from me the
   dangerous power and wield it all Himself! Did we not sing just now--

   "All my times are in Your hands, All events at Your command"?

   The time of birth, the time of the new birth, the time of a sore trial,
   the time of the death of your beloved one, the time of your sickness,
   and how long it shall last--all these times must come and last, and end
   as shall please your Father. It is for you to know that your Father is
   at the helm of the ship and, therefore, it cannot be wrecked! It may
   rock and reel to and fro, but, since He rules the waves, the vessel
   will not have one more tossing than His infinite love permits! Let us,
   then, not seek to unroll the map of the future, but calmly say--

   "My God, I would not long to see

   My fate with curious eyes,

   What gloomy lines are writ for me,

   Or what bright scenes arise,"

   but just leave it all with God. The Father has it in His hands and
   there we wish it to be. So much concerning some things which are not
   for us.

   II. And now, secondly, there are SOME THINGS FOR US TO RECEIVE. The
   Savior said to the 11 that they were to wait at Jerusalem till they had
   received power by the Holy Spirit coming upon them. This is what we
   need--we need the Holy Spirit! We often speak about this, but, in
   truth, it is unspeakable--the power of the Holy Spirit--mysterious,
   Divine. When it comes upon a man, he is bathed in the very essence of
   the Deity. The atmosphere about him becomes the life and power of God.
   There is an old proverb that knowledge is power--Christ has taken away
   the knowledge that is not power. He said, "It is not for you, child; it
   is not for you." But He gives you the knowledge that is power, or,
   rather, that power which is better than all knowledge, the power of the
   Holy Spirit! Gotthold, in his parables, speaks of his little child who
   wanted to come into his room, but he was doing something there which he
   did not wish the child to see, and so he went on with his work, when,
   to his horror and surprise, he found that his child had, in some way,
   climbed up outside the window and was standing on the sill trying to
   look in to see what his father was doing--hazarding his life in the
   attempt. You may guess that it was not long before that child was taken
   down with a pat and something more, to teach him not to pry into his
   father's secrets! It is so with some of us--we need just a little pat
   and perhaps more than that, to keep us from looking into things that do
   not belong to us. We may be comforted, even, if we do not know the
   times and the seasons, for we may get something vastly better, namely,
   the Holy Spirit to give us real power for our life-work!

   The Holy Spirit gives to His people power which may be looked at from
   different points. He gave to some of them, in the olden times,
   miraculous power, and they went forth, having received the Spirit of
   God, to do great signs and wonders in the name of Christ. If you have
   not that, you may hope to have mental power. The Holy Spirit does not
   educate us, or give us culture after the common method of men, and yet
   there is an inner education and a higher culture which is much more to
   be desired, which comes from Him. He leads us into all the Truths of
   God! He makes us feel the force of the Truth of God. He gives us a grip
   of the Truth of God. He writes the Truth of God upon the heart. He
   applies it to the understanding. Many a man has become quick of
   understanding in the fear of the Lord who was very slow of
   understanding in other respects. The Holy Spirit takes the fool and
   makes him know the wonders of redeeming love. It is amazing how persons
   of very scanty gifts and very small attainments, have, nevertheless,
   become wise toward God--their mental faculties being quickened with
   regard to heavenly things in a very remarkable manner!

   The power of the Spirit is also, in part, moral power. He gives to men
   qualities that make them strong and influential over their fellow men.
   He imparts dauntless courage, calm confidence, intense affection,
   burning zeal, deep patience, much-enduring perseverance. Many other
   hallowed influences besides these are Graces of the Spirit of God which
   form in men a moral power exceedingly useful and exceedingly forcible.
   I have known men who have been slow of speech and who have exhibited
   very few gifts, who have, nevertheless, been very strong men in our
   assemblies, true pillars of the Church, for piety is power--and Grace
   is power.

   Besides that, there is a more secret, subtle power still, spiritual
   power, wherein, in the spiritual world, a man is made a prince with
   God, has power with God and, learning how to prevail with God for men,
   he catches the art of prevailing with men for God. He is first a
   wrestler, alone, by Jabbok. Then he becomes a wrestler in the midst of
   the host of sinners, conquering them for Christ, taking them captive in
   the name of the Most High! Power in prayer is the highest form of
   power. Communion with God is power. And holiness, above all things, is
   a great power among the sons of men!

   This spiritual power makes a man influential in a sense very different
   from that in which the world uses the word, "influential"--a
   disgraceful use of the word. We need men who have influence in the most
   Divine sense--men who, somehow or other, cast a spell over their fellow
   men. In their presence, men cannot do what they are accustomed to do
   elsewhere. When these men are in any company, they check sin without a
   word, they incite to righteousness almost without a sentence! They
   carry everything before them, not by might, nor by power, but by the
   Spirit of the Lord who dwells in them! Have I not seen some, decrepit
   and bedridden, yet ruling a house and influencing a parish? Have I not
   seen some tottering old woman who, nevertheless, has been a very queen
   in the circle in which she moved? Have I not seen some poor, humble
   rustic from the plow who, nevertheless, has worn a coronet in the midst
   of his fellow men by the holiness of his life and the spiritual power
   that God the Holy Spirit had imparted to him?

   Now, Beloved, I have not time to fully describe this endowment. I have
   only mentioned one or two points in which it is seen, but this
   endowment is what we need before we can do anything for Christ. Do you
   always think enough of this? The teacher prepares her lesson, but does
   she also prepare herself by seeking the power of the Holy Spirit? The
   minister studies his text, but does he ask for a Baptism of the Holy
   Spirit? I am afraid that this spiritual qualification, the most
   essential of all, is frequently overlooked. Then, the Lord have mercy
   upon us! The soldier had better go to battle without sword or
   rifle--the artilleryman had better wheel up his gun without powder or
   shot, than that we should attempt to win a soul until--first of all,
   the Holy Spirit has given us power! Power must go with the Word that is
   preached or taught if any large result is to follow and that power must
   first be in the man who speaks that Word.

   For this power the disciples were to wait. The world was dying, Hell
   was raging, yet they must tarry at Jerusalem till they had that Power.
   Impetuous Peter must hold His tongue and loving John must be quiet and
   must commune in secret with his Master. None of them must go out into
   the street or stand in the Temple to proclaim the Words of this life.
   They must stop till God should see fit to pour out his Spirit upon
   them--and I would to God that sometimes we could be quiet, too! It were
   better to be dumb than to speak only in the power of our own spirit! It
   were better to lay the finger on the lip than to begin to talk before
   our message has been burnt into us by the Holy Spirit. Wait for the
   live coal from off the altar to blister your lips, for only then can
   you speak with power when you, yourself, have felt the fire of the
   Spirit!

   III. Now we pass on to the third point, which is a very important
   practical one, SOMETHING FOR US TO BE. If you are a disciple of Christ,
   you are not to look into the times and the seasons which the Father has
   put in His own power. You are to receive the Spirit of God and then
   there is something for you to be. Did you expect me to say that then
   there is something for you to do? Well, there is a great deal for you
   to do, but the text says, You shall be witnesses," not, "You shall act
   as witnesses" only, but, "You shall be witnesses." Every true Christian
   should, in his own proper person, be a witness for his Lord. "Here I
   stand," he says, "myself a proof of what my Lord can do. I, His
   servant, saved by Him, and renewed by Him, washed in His blood, it is I
   who, while I live, whether I speak or not, am a monument of His love, a
   trophy of His Grace." "You shall be witnesses unto Me."

   Dear Friends, we are to be witnesses of what Christ has done. If we
   have seen Christ. If we believe in Christ, let us tell it honestly.
   These Apostles had a great deal to tell. They had been with Christ in
   private. They had seen His miracles. They had heard His choice and more
   secret words. They had to go and bear witness to it all. And you, who
   have been let into the secrets of Christ. You who have communed with
   Him more closely than others, you have much to tell. Tell it all,

   for whatever He has said to you in the closet, you are to proclaim upon
   the housetop. You are to witness what you have seen, tasted and handled
   concerning your Lord.

   You are to witness to what He has revealed, to make known to others the
   Doctrine that He preached, or taught by His Apostles. Mind that you do
   not tell any other! You are not sent to be "an original thinker," to
   make up a Gospel as you go along--you are a witness, that is all, a
   retailer of Christ's Truth--and you miss the end of your life unless
   you perpetually witness, and witness, and witness to what you know of
   Him, and to what you have learned from Him. Let this be your prayer and
   your resolve--

   "Give me Your strength, O God of power! Then let winds blow, or
   thunders roar, Your faithful witness will I be-- 'Tis fixed--I can do
   all through You."

   You are to witness to what you have experienced concerning Christ. Now,
   what is that? I will just run over this witness, feeling that there are
   many hundreds of dear friends here, tonight, who could bear the same
   testimony and who will do so as they have opportunity.

   First, I beg to say to all present here, tonight, that the Lord Jesus
   Christ can remove despair and every form of spiritual distress. He did
   so for me. I was full of darkness. The shadow of death was upon me and
   I found no comfort till I heard that blessed text, "Look unto Me, and
   be you saved, all the ends of the earth." I looked unto Him and was
   lightened and my face was not ashamed--and I am here, tonight, to bear
   witness that a load was thus taken from me which I could not get rid of
   in any other way--and my midnight was, in a single moment, turned into
   the blaze of midday! Neither have I ever gone back to that darkness,
   nor have I again had reason to cry, "Woe is me that ever I was born."
   No, there is, in the name of Jesus, a balm for every mental wound, a
   relief for all the agony of a tortured spirit! I am sure of it. I am
   not saying to you what I have merely heard from other people, but what
   I have, myself, felt, and there are many here who can endorse my
   testimony that there is no relief to a sinner's aching heart like that
   which Jesus brings! I wish that you would all prove this Truth of God
   for yourselves, but, at any rate, we are witnesses that it is so.

   And, next, our Lord Jesus is a great transformer of character. I do not
   like to speak of myself, but I will speak of many a man whom I know. He
   came into this Tabernacle a drunk, a swearer, a lover of unholy
   pleasures and, while the Word was preached, the Lord broke him down and
   melted his heart. Now he hates what once he loved and, as to those
   pursuits which were once distasteful to him, so that he cursed and
   swore at the very mention of them, or at least poured ridicule upon
   others who loved them, he now loves them, himself, and it is a wonder
   to himself to find himself where he now is! He never dreamed of being
   what he is. Ask his wife whether there is a change in him. Ask his
   little children whether there is a change in him. Ask his workmates.
   Ask his employer--ask anybody, and they will all say--"He is not the
   same man."

   The Lord Jesus Christ has turned everything upside down with him. It
   was the wrong way up before and so He has put it all right. He can turn
   the lion into a lamb, the raven into a dove and He has done so to many
   of our friends who are sitting in this house, tonight, as they would
   willingly bear witness! Oh, if there are any here, tonight, who would
   learn the way of righteousness and quit the paths of sin, let them
   believe my testimony which comes not out of feigned lips! "I speak the
   truth in Christ and lie not." The Lord is able to transform character
   in a very amazing way! He has done it for many of us and if you believe
   in Him, He will do it for you, also!

   Next, we should like to bear witness to the sustaining power of Christ
   under temptation. After being saved, we have been tempted and we are
   men of like passions with others. I speak for my Sisters as well as for
   my Brothers here. We have all been tempted and we have been well near
   thrown back to our old condition--but when we have fled to Christ and
   trusted in Him, our feet have stood firm, even upon the brink of the
   precipice! We have passed through fire and water by way of trial and
   temptation and yet we stand, for Christ is able to guard us, even, from
   stumbling, and to present us faultless before the Presence of His Glory
   with exceeding joy. We are not talking to you of things that we have
   dreamt. O Sirs, we would not like to tell some of you how we have been
   tempted, how hard it has gone with us, how we have been saved by the
   skin of our teeth, but saved we have been, to the praise of God's
   mighty Grace! Let His name be praised forever and ever! That is our
   witness. If you would be kept from temptation, come and trust Him!

   We wish, also, to say that the Spirit of God coming from Christ moves
   men to high and noble thoughts. Selfishness no longer rules the man who
   believes in Christ--he loves his fellow men, he desires their good--he
   can forgive them if

   they persecute him, he can lay down his life for them. Have we not had
   many who have gone forth among the heathen and laid down their lives
   for Christ? I was speaking with a Brother from the Congo on Monday and
   I spoke of the many deaths there, and he said, "Yes, it looks a sad
   thing that so many missionaries should die, but, Sir," he added, "that
   is the first thing that we have done in Africa that is really hopeful.
   I have often heard the natives say to me, 'These men must believe a
   true religion or else they would not come here to die for us poor black
   men.' Men begin to believe this new kind of evidence. The blood of the
   missionary becomes the seed of the Church." I do not doubt that it is
   so and, Beloved, if you and I can live wholly and only for Christ. If
   we can live nobly. If we can get out of ourselves. If we can rise
   superior to worldly advantages and prove that we believe all we say, we
   shall convince our fellow men of the truth of our religion! This is
   what the Holy Spirit would have us to be and we desire to obey His
   promptings more and more--

   "Holy Spirit, dwell in me!

   I, myself, would holy be."

   I will not detain you many minutes more, but I must bear my testimony
   to the supporting power of Christ in the time of trouble. There are
   many here who would have been in the asylum, in their time of trial, if
   it had not been that they could carry their grief to Christ. There are
   some of us who are not strangers to very acute pain and to a long
   continuance of it, too--and we have found no comfort in the world like
   going to our Lord when racked with pain, and torn with anguish. There
   is a power about Him to charm us into joy when everything would drive
   us to distress--and almost to despair.

   And, specially, I want to bear my witness, not, of course, a personal
   one, but that of an observer, as to the power of our holy religion in
   the hour of death. I have been at many deathbeds. I have seen many
   Christians just about to die. There it is that the power of our holy
   religion comes in. How calm, how resigned--sometimes how triumphant,
   how ecstatic--is the frame of mind of the departing Believer! I never
   heard one of them regret that he was a Christian. In times when men
   sift what they have done and believed--and when they tell no lies, for
   the naked truth comes up before them--I have heard them glory in
   belonging to Christ and in resting in Him! But I have never heard them
   regret that they did so. Our religion is not all of the future--it is
   not a thing that dreams concerning the world to come. It gives us
   present joy, present strength, present comfort and we commend it to you
   most heartily, for this is our duty, to be witnesses for Christ! There
   are some who can give their evidence-in-chief, but the pity is that
   when they come to be cross-examined, when they get among the ungodly in
   the world, they make a mess of it. The Lord have mercy upon some who
   come in among us and profess to know Christ and do not--it is their lie
   that taints the testimony of the true in the judgment of mankind! Be
   you the more zealous to overbear their treachery by your consistency.
   Be you the more full of integrity and stern truthfulness, and boundless
   love, to make up for these wounds which your Lord receives so often in
   the house of His friends!

   May the Spirit of God rest upon you, Beloved in the Lord, and may you
   hear your Master say to you, "You shall be witnesses unto Me." Amen.

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 4:16-30; 9:57-62 AND MATTHEW
   28:16-20.

   We will read three short passages of Scripture, all relating to
   Christ's service. The first concerns the ministry of the Lord Jesus,
   Himself.

   Luke 4:16-19. And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up:
   and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day,
   and stood up to read. And there was delivered unto Him the book of the
   Prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place
   where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has
   anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal
   the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
   recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
   bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. What a glorious
   passage! This was the text of Christ's whole ministry not only of that
   day at Nazareth, but of all His life ever after.

   20. And He closed the book. Rolled up the sacred writing--

   20. And He gave it again to the minister, and sat down. Their practice
   was to sit down to speak, while the people usually stood to hear--a
   very good custom, indeed. If we did the same, perhaps we should have
   fewer of our hearers going to sleep.

   20, 21. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
   fastened on Him. And He began to say unto them, This day is this
   Scripture fulfilled in your ears. That is the way to preach--bring home
   the Scripture to the present time, show its application to everyday
   life, especially point out its connection with Christ--and prove how it
   is fulfilled and verified in His sacred Person. Doubtless, Jesus said a
   great deal besides what is here recorded, but there were no shorthand
   writers, there, to take down every word He uttered.

   22. And all bore Him witness and wondered at the gracious words which
   proceeded out of His month. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
   There! Did it matter whose son Jesus was? Yet, in order to abate the
   force and even the blessedness of Divine Truth, men turn their thoughts
   to the Speaker rather than to what He says. How foolish!

   23. And He said unto them, You will surely say unto Me this proverb,
   Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do
   also here in Your country. "Begin at home, work miracles here! You are
   the Son of the carpenter who lives here--now, do some wonderful work
   among us."

   24-26. And He said, Verily I say unto you, No Prophet is accepted in
   his own country. But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel
   in the days of Elijah, when the Heaven was shut up three years and six
   months, when great famine was throughout all the land; but unto none of
   them was Elijah sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman
   that was a widow. Elijah did not feel bound to labor always among the
   Jews, but he went right to Sidon, to a heathen woman, and he sojourned
   with the widow in the faraway country. God is Sovereign. He can save
   whom He wills and He will exercise that Sovereignty and bless some of
   those who appear to be most hopeless--and to have the least signs of
   good about them, and to be the farthest removed from the means of
   Grace!

   27. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the Prophet;
   and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. Only the
   stranger and foreigner was cured of the disease of leprosy--another
   instance of Divine Sovereignty. Men do not like this Doctrine of
   Sovereignty--they are willing to have a god if he is not God--they do
   not mind believing in a god who is not King and who does not do as He
   wills with His own. They believe in free will, they say. Yes, yes, free
   will for everybody but God! Man is to be the god of man and of God,
   too, according to the talk of some! But this is the thunder from the
   Divine Throne of God--"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and
   I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion." Blessed is he
   who humbly bows his head and says, "Be it so, My Lord!" Absolute power
   cannot be in better hands than in those of the God of Love!

   28. And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were
   filled with wrath. They were at first very pleased to have a promising
   young Preacher out of their own town and they said, one to another,
   "Did not He speak well?" Now they have changed their note--He has been
   too faithful for them! He has exalted God instead of man! And now they
   are filled with wrath.

   29. 30. And rose up and thrust Him out of the city, and led Him unto
   the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast
   Him down, headlong. But He, passing through the midst of them, went His
   way. With that holy calm in which He always dwelt--with wondrous
   Self-possession--He passed through the midst of them and escaped their
   malice. Now let us read what Christ says to those who would be His
   followers. Turn to--

   Luke 9:57. And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a
   certain man said unto Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go. He
   was a volunteer, but his zeal was too hot to hold out long. He had
   never fully known what following Christ meant, so he came forward
   without a thought.

   58. And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
   have nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay His head. He did
   not reckon on such hard fare as that, to lie hard, and live hard, so we
   hear no more of him. That is would-be follower number one.

   59. And He said unto another, Follow Me. Not a volunteer, this time,
   but one actually called by Christ and commanded to come--a conscript,
   as it were.

   59. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. We do
   not even know that his father was dead. He would like to stay at home
   until the old man was ready to be buried.

   60. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go you and
   preach the Kingdom of God. When Christ wants men to go upon His
   errands, they must make no excuses. The King's business requires haste.
   The King's commands are peremptory. Other people could bury the
   dead--let them do it. They were not alive unto this holy ministry--they
   would, therefore, be doing right in stopping to bury the dead. When
   Christ says to a man, "Follow Me," he must not let even the most tender
   relationship detain him, or the most proper duties stand in the way of
   the highest duty. That is would-be follower number two. We hear no more
   of him, either.

   61. And another also said, Lord, I will follow You; but let me first go
   bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. "Lord, I will follow
   You, but I must have time. I need a little allowance and a permit to
   leave home. I will follow You, but let me first go and bid them
   farewell who are at home at my house." It might be a long distance and
   as it was now Christ's time to send out the seventy, they must go at
   once, or not at all. This man intends to wait till he has gone,
   perhaps, 50 miles home and back again.

   62. And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow
   and, looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God. You must go at once
   when you have orders to go--and not even the courtesies of life, or the
   fondnesses of affection, may make you disobey the command of the
   Captain. It would be a pretty thing, in the day of battle, if the
   soldiers came to the general and one said, "I must go back to bury my
   father," and another said, "I cannot fight, for I need to go and bid
   farewell to my mother." The country would soon be in a desperate state
   for lack of soldiers and the great King, whose war is more important
   than any other, will not have for soldiers those who talk in this
   fashion! So, you see, there are three would-be followers gone, but
   there are at least 70 faithful followers left, as the next chapter
   shows. Our third reading will be at the end of the Gospel according to
   Matthew.

   Matthew 28:16. Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
   mountain where Jesus had appointed them. Away from the haunts of men,
   where He had been known to be, in a country familiar to them, and with
   which He was familiar, in a despised country, "Galilee of the
   Gentiles."

   17. And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him. Probably this was the
   occasion referred to by Paul, when the risen Savior "was seen of above
   five hundred brethren at once."

   17. But some doubted. There were some honest doubters, then. The breed
   has been kept up ever since, only there are more dishonest doubters by
   a great deal than there are of honest ones, now. We can never expect to
   be quite free from doubters in the Church, since even in the presence
   of the newly-risen Christ, "some doubted."

   18. And Jesus came and spoke unto them. These words to imply that He
   came nearer to them than He was at first-- unveiling Himself still more
   and revealing Himself more clearly.

   18, 19. Saying, All power is given unto Me in Heaven and in earth. Go
   you, therefore, and teach all nations. "Teach," that is, disciple, make
   disciples of "all nations."

   19, 20. Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
   of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatever I have
   commanded you. There is teaching, again! It is as much the duty of the
   Christian to teach after Baptism as to teach before Baptism. He must be
   always teaching. Therefore, Believers are always to be learners, since
   Christ would have His servants always to be teachers--"Teaching them to
   observe all things whatever I have commanded you." We are not to invent
   a Gospel. We are not to change, shift, cut and shape it to meet the
   advancement of the age! Christ's command is plain--"Teaching them to
   observe all things whatever I have commanded you."

   20, And, lo, I am with you, always, even unto the end of the world.
   Amen. They have their commission. Here is the seal to it. Here is the
   source of their power. Here is the society in which they are to
   work--"Lo, I am with you always." God grant that you and I, going forth
   to teach for Christ, may always have the sound of our Master's feet
   with us, even to the end of the world! Amen.

Christ's Pastoral Prayer for His People

   (No. 2331)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 22, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 1, 1889.

   "I pray for them: Ipray not for the world, but for them which You have
   given Me; for they are Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are
   Mine; and I am glorified in them." John 17:9,10.

   To begin with, I remark that our Lord Jesus pleads for His own people.
   When He puts on His priestly breastplate, it is for the tribes whose
   names are there. When He presents the atoning Sacrifice, it is for
   Israel whom God has chosen, and He utters this great Truth of God,
   which some regard as narrow, but which we adore, "I pray for them: I
   pray not for the world." The point to which I want to call attention is
   this--the reason why Christ prays not for the world, but for His
   people. He puts it, "For they are Yours," as if they were all the
   dearer to Him because they were the Father's--"I pray for them: I pray
   not for the world, but for them which You have given Me, for they are
   Yours." We might have half thought that Jesus would have said, "They
   are Mine and, therefore, I pray for them." It would have been true, but
   there would not have been the beauty of Truth about it which we have
   here. He loves us all the better and He prays for us all the more
   fervently because we are the Father's. Such is His love to His Father,
   that our being the Father's sheds upon us an extra halo of beauty!
   Because we belong to the Father, therefore does the Savior plead for us
   with all the greater earnestness at the Throne of the heavenly Grace.

   But this leads us on to remember that our Lord had undertaken
   suretyship engagements on account of His people-- He undertook to
   preserve the Father's gift--"Those that You gave Me, I have kept, and
   none of them is lost." He looked upon the sheep of His pasture as
   belonging to His Father and the Father had put them into His charge,
   saying to Him, "Of Your hand will I require them." As Jacob kept his
   uncle's flocks--by day the heat devoured him and at night the
   frost--but he was more careful over them because they were Laban's than
   if they had been his own. He was to give an account of all the sheep
   committed to him and he did so--and he lost none of Laban's sheep. His
   care over them was partly accounted for by the fact that they did not
   belong to himself, but belonged to his uncle, Laban.

   Understand this twofold reason, then, for Christ's pastoral prayer for
   His people. He first prays for them because they belong to the Father
   and, therefore, have a peculiar value in His eyes. And next, because
   they belong to the Father, He is under suretyship engagements to
   deliver them all to the Father in that Last Great Day when the sheep
   shall pass under the rod of Him that counts them. Now you see where I
   am bringing you, tonight. I am not going to preach, at this time, to
   the world any more than Christ, upon this occasion, prayed for the
   world, but I am going to preach to His own people as He, in this
   intercessory prayer, pleaded for them. I trust that they will all
   follow me, step by step, through this great theme, and I pray the Lord
   that, in these deep central Truths of the Gospel, we may find real
   refreshment for our souls tonight.

   I. In calling your attention to my text, I want you to notice, first,
   THE INTENSITY OF THE SENSE OF PROPERTY WHICH CHRIST HAS IN HIS PEOPLE.

   Here are six words setting forth Christ's property in those who are
   saved--"Them which You have given Me"--(that is one), "for they are
   Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I am glorified
   in them." There are certain persons so precious to Christ that they are
   marked all over with special tokens that they belong to Him, as I have
   known a man write his name in a book which he has greatly valued and
   then he has turned over some pages and written his name again, and, as
   we have sometimes known persons, when they have highly valued a thing,
   to put their mark, their seal, their stamp here, there and almost
   everywhere upon it! So, notice in my text how the Lord seems to have
   the seal in His

   hand and He stamps it all over His peculiar possession! "They are
   Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine." It is all
   possessive pronouns, to show that God looks upon His people as His
   portion, His possession, His property. "They shall be Mine, says the
   Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels." Every man has
   something or other which he values above the rest of his estate and
   here the Lord, by so often reiterating the words which signify
   possession, proves that He values His people above everything! Let us
   show that we appreciate this privilege of being set apart unto God and
   let us each one say to Him--

   "Take my poor heart, and let it be

   Forever closed to all but Thee!

   Seal You my breast and let me wear

   That pledge of love forever there." I call your attention, next, to the
   fact that, while there are these six expressions here, they are all
   applied to the Lord's own people. "My," (that is, the saints), are
   Yours, (that is, the saints), "and Yours," (that is, the saints), are
   Mine, (that is, the saints). These broad arrows of the King of Kings
   are all stamped upon His people! While the marks of possession are
   numerous, they are all set upon one object. What? Does not God care for
   anything else? I answer, No. As compared with His own people, He cares
   for nothing else. "The Lord's portion is His people: Jacob is the lot
   of His inheritance." Has not God other things? Ah, what is there that
   He has not? The silver and the gold are His and the cattle on a
   thousand hills. All things are of God--of Him, and by Him, and through
   Him, and to Him are all things--yet He reckons them not in comparison
   with His people! You know how you, dearly Beloved, value your children
   much more than you do anything else. If there were a fire in your
   house, tonight, and you could only carry one thing out of it, Mother,
   would you hesitate a moment as to what that one thing would be? You
   would carry your baby and let everything else be consumed in the
   flames! And it is so with God. He cares for His people beyond
   everything else. He is the Lord God of Israel, and in Israel He has set
   His name, and there He takes His delight. There does He rest in His
   love and over her does He rejoice with singing!

   I want you to notice these different points, not because I can fully
   explain them all to you, but if I can only give you some of these great
   Truths to think about and to help you to communion with Christ,
   tonight, I shall have done well. I want you to note, yet further,
   concerning these notes of possession, that they occur in the private
   communion between the Father and the Son. It is in our Lord's prayer,
   when He is in the inner sanctuary speaking with the Father, that we
   have these words, "All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine." It is not
   to you and to me that He is talking, now. The Son of God is speaking
   with the Father when They are in very near communion, One with the
   Other. Now, what does this say to me but that the Father and the Son
   greatly value Believers? What people talk about when they are
   alone--not what they say in the market, not what they talk of in the
   midst of the confused mob, but what they say when they are in private--
   that lays bare their heart! Here is the Son speaking to the Father, not
   about thrones and royalties, nor cherubim and seraphim, but about poor
   men and women--in those days mostly fishermen and peasant folk--who
   believed on Him!

   They are talking about these people and the Son is taking His own
   solace with the Father in Their secret privacy by talking about these
   precious jewels, these dear ones that are Their peculiar treasure. You
   have not any notion how much God loves you! Dear Brother, dear Sister,
   you have never, yet, had half an idea, or the tithe of an idea, of how
   precious you are to Christ! You think, because you are so imperfect,
   and you fall so much below your own ideal, that, therefore, He does not
   love you much. You think that He cannot do so. Have you ever measured
   the depth of Christ's agony in Gethsemane and of His death on Calvary?
   If you have tried to do so, you will be quite sure that, apart from
   anything in you or about you, He loves you with a love that passes
   knowledge! Believe it. "But I do not love Him as I should," I think

   1 hear you say. No, and you never will unless you first know His love
   to you. Believe it! Believe it to the highest degree, that He so loves
   you that when there is no one who can commune with Him but the Father,
   even then Their talk is about Their mutual estimate of you--how much
   They love you! "All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine."

   Only one other thought under this head and I but put it before you and
   leave it with you, for I cannot expound it tonight. All that Jesus says
   is about all His people, for He says, "All Mine are Yours, and Yours
   are Mine." These high, secret talks are not about some few saints who
   have reached a "higher life," but about all of us who belong to Him!
   Jesus bears all of us on His heart and He speaks of us all to the
   Father--"All Mine are Yours." "That poor woman who could never serve
   her Lord except by patient endurance, she is Mine," says Jesus. "She is
   Yours, great Father." "That poor girl, newly-converted, whose only
   spiritual life was spent upon a sickbed and then she exhaled to Heaven,
   like a dewdrop of

   the morning, she is Mine, and she is Yours. That poor child who often
   stumbles, who never brought much credit to the sacred name, He is Mine
   and He is Yours. "All Mine are Yours." I seem as if I heard a silver
   bell ringing out! The very tones of the words are like the music from
   the harps of angels! "My--Yours. Yours-- Mine." May such sweet risings
   and fallings of heavenly melodies charm all our ears!

   I think that I have said enough to show you the intensity of the sense
   of property which Christ has in His people-- "All Mine are Yours, and
   Yours are Mine."

   II. The next head of my discourse is THE INTENSITY OF UNITED INTEREST
   BETWEEN THE FATHER AND

   THE SON CONCERNING BELIEVERS.

   First, let me say that Jesus loves us because we belong to the Father.
   Turn that Truth of God over. "My Father has chosen them, My Father
   loves them. Therefore," says Jesus, "I love them and I lay down My life
   for them, and I will take My life, again, for them, and live throughout
   eternity for them. They are dear to Me because they are dear to My
   Father." Have you not often loved another person for the sake of a
   third one upon whom all your heart was set? There is an old proverb and
   I cannot help quoting it just now. It is, "Love me, love my dog." It is
   as if the Lord Jesus so loved the Father that even such poor dogs as we
   are get loved by Him for His Father's sake! To the eyes of Jesus we are
   radiant with beauty because God has loved us.

   Now turn that thought round the other way, the Father loves us because
   we belong to Christ. At first, the Father's love in election was
   Sovereign and self-contained, but now, today, since He has given us
   over to Christ, He takes a greater delight in us. "They are My Son's
   sheep," He says, "He bought them with His blood." Better still--"That
   is My Son's spouse," He says. "That is My Son's bride. I love her for
   His sake." There was that first love which came fresh from the Father's
   heart, but now, through this one channel of love to Jesus, the Father
   pours a double flood of love on us for His dear Son's sake. He sees the
   blood of Jesus sprinkled on us. He remembers the token and, for the
   sake of His beloved Son, He prizes us beyond all price! Jesus loves us
   because we belong to the Father--and the Father loves us because we
   belong to Jesus!

   Now come still closer to the central thought of the text, All Mine are
   Yours." All who are the Son's are the Father's. Do we belong to Jesus?
   Then we belong to the Father! Have I been washed in the precious blood?
   Can I sing, tonight--

   "The dying thief rejoiced to see That fountain in his day! And there
   have I, though vile as he, Washed all my sins away"?

   Then, by redemption I belong to Christ! But, at the same time, I may be
   sure that I belong to the Father--"All Mine are Yours." Are you
   trusting in Christ? Then you are one of God's elect! That high and deep
   mystery of predestination need trouble no man's heart if he is a
   believer in Christ. If you believe in Christ, Christ has redeemed you
   and the Father chose you from before the foundation of the world! You
   may rest happily in that firm belief, "All Mine are Yours." How often
   have I met with people puzzling themselves about election! They want to
   know if they are elect. No man can come to the Father but by Christ--no
   man can come to election except through redemption! If you have come to
   Christ and are His redeemed, it is certain beyond all doubt that you
   were chosen of God and are the Father's elect. "All Mine are Yours."

   So, if I am bought by Christ's precious blood, I am not to sit down and
   say how grateful I am to Christ as though He were apart from the
   Father, and more loving and more tender than the Father. No, no! I
   belong to the Father if I belong to Christ--and I have for the Father
   the same gratitude, the same love, and I would render the same service
   as to Jesus, for Jesus puts it, "All Mine are Yours."

   If, tonight, also, I am a servant of Christ. If, because He bought me,
   I try to serve Him, then I am a servant of the Father if I am a servant
   of the Son. "All Mine, whatever position they occupy, belong to You,
   great Father," and they have all the privileges which come to those who
   belong to the Father. I hope that I do not weary you. I cannot make
   these things entertaining to the careless--I do not try to do so. But
   you who love my Lord and His Truth ought to rejoice, tonight, to think
   that, in being the property of Christ, you are assured that you are the
   property of the Father! "All Mine are Yours."--

   "With Christ our Lord we share our part In the affections of His heart.
   Nor shall our souls be removed

   Till He forgets His First-Beloved."

   But now you have to look at the other part of it--"and Yours are Mine."
   All who are the Father's are the Son's. If you belong to the Father,
   you belong to the Son. If you are elect, and so the Father's, you are
   redeemed, and so the Son's. If you are adopted, and so the Father's,
   you are justified in Christ and so you are the Son's. If you are
   regenerated, and so are begotten of the Father, your life is still
   dependent upon the Son. Remember that while one Biblical figure sets us
   forth as children who have, each one, a life within himself, another
   equally valid figure represents us as branches of the Vine which die
   unless they continue united to the Stem. "All Yours are Mine." If you
   are the Father's, you must be Christ's. If your life is given you of
   the Father, it still depends entirely upon the Son.

   What a wonderful mixture all this is! The Father and the Son are One
   and we are one with the Father and with the Son! A mystic union is
   established between us and the Father by reason of our union with the
   Son and the Son's union with the Father. See to what a glorious height
   our humanity has risen through Christ! By the Grace of God, you who
   were like stones in the brook are made sons of God! Lifted out of your
   dead materialism, you are elevated into a spiritual life and you are
   united to God! You have not any idea, tonight, of what God has already
   done for you and truly, it does not yet appear what you shall be. A
   Christian man is the noblest work of God! God has here reached the
   fullness of His power and His Grace in making us to be one with His own
   dear Son, and so bringing us into union and communion with Himself. Oh,
   if the words that I speak could convey to you the fullness of their own
   meaning, you might spring to your feet, electrified with holy joy to
   think of this--that we should be Christ's and the Father's--and that we
   should be thought worthy to be the object of intricate transactions and
   inter-communions of the dearest kind between the Father and the Son!
   We, even we, who are but dust and ashes at our very best, are favored
   as angels never were! Therefore let all praise be ascribed to Sovereign
   Grace!

   III. And now I shall only detain you a few minutes longer while I speak
   upon the third part of our subject, that is, THE GLORY OF CHRIST. "And
   I am glorified in them." I must confess that while the former part of
   my subject was very deep, this third part seems to me to be still
   deeper--"I am glorified in them."

   If Christ had said, "I will glorify them," I could have understood it.
   If He had said, "I am pleased with them," I might have set it down to
   His great kindness to them. But when He says, "I am glorified in them,"
   it is very amazing. The sun can be reflected, but you need proper
   objects to act as reflectors--and the brighter they are, the better
   will they reflect. You and I do not seem to have the power of
   reflecting Christ's Glory. We break up the glorious rays that shine
   upon us. We spoil, we ruin so much of the good that falls upon us. Yet
   Christ says that He is glorified in us! Take these words home, dear
   Friend, to yourself, and think that the Lord Jesus met you, tonight,
   and as you went out of the Tabernacle, said to you, "You are Mine. You
   are My Father's and I am glorified in you." I dare not say that it
   would be a proud moment for you, but I dare say that there would be
   more in it to make you feel exalted for Him to say, "I am glorified in
   you," than if you could have all the honors that all the kings can put
   upon all men in the world! I think that I could say, "Lord, now let
   Your servant depart in peace, according to Your Word," if He would but
   say to me, "I am glorified in your ministry." I hope that He is. I
   believe that He is, but, oh, for an assuring word, if not spoken to us
   personally, yet spoken to His Father about us, as in our text, "I am
   glorified in them"!

   How can this be? Well, it is a very wide subject. Christ is glorified
   in His people in many ways. He is glorified by saving such
   sinners--taking these people, so sinful, so lost, so unworthy. When the
   Lord lays hold upon a drunk, a thief, an adulterer. When He arrests one
   who has been guilty of blasphemy, whose very heart is reeking with evil
   thoughts. When He picks up the far-off one, the abandoned, the
   dissolute, the fallen, as He often does, and when He says, "These shall
   be Mine. I will wash these in My blood. I will use these to speak My
   Word." Oh, then, He is glorified in them! Read the lives of many great
   sinners who have afterwards become great saints and you will see how
   they have tried to glorify Him, not only she who washed His feet with
   her tears, but many another like her. Oh, how they have loved to praise
   Him! Eyes have wept tears, lips have spoken words--but hearts have felt
   what neither eyes nor lips could speak--of adoring gratitude to Him. "I
   am glorified in them." Great sinners, Christ is glorified in you! Some
   of you Pharisees, if you were to be converted, would not bring Christ
   such Glory as He gets through saving publicans and harlots! Even if you
   struggled into Heaven, it would be with very little music for Him on
   the road, certainly no tears and no ointment for His feet, and no
   wiping them with the hairs of your head! You are too respectable ever
   to do that. But when He saves great sinners, He can truly say, "I am
   glorified in them," and each of them can sing--

   "It passes praises, that dear love of Yours, My Jesus, Sa vior: yet
   this heart of mine Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
   Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me, Near unto God."

   And Christ is glorified by the perseverance which He shows in the
   matter of their salvation. See how He begins to save and the man
   resists. He follows up His kind endeavor and the man rebels. He hunts
   him, pursues him, dogs his footsteps. He will have the man, but the man
   will not have Him! But the Lord, without violating the free will of
   man, which He never does, yet at length brings the one who was most
   unwilling to lie at His feet and he that hated most begins to love! And
   he that was most stout-hearted bows his knees in lowliest humility. It
   is amazing how persevering the Lord is in the salvation of a
   sinner--yes, and in the salvation of His own, for you would have broken
   loose long ago if your great Shepherd had not penned you up within the
   fold! Many of you would have started aside and have lost yourselves if
   it had not been for constraints of Sovereign Grace which have kept you
   to this day and will not let you go! Christ is glorified in you. Oh,
   when you once get to Heaven, when the angels know all that you were and
   all that you tried to be. When the whole story of Almighty, Infinite
   Grace is told, as it will be told, then will Christ be glorified in
   you!

   Beloved, we actively glorify Christ when we display Christian Graces.
   You who are loving, forgiving, tender-hearted, gentle, meek,
   self-sacrificing--you glorify Him--He is glorified in you. You who are
   upright and who will not be moved from your integrity. You who can
   despise the sinner's gold and will not sell your conscience for it. You
   who are bold and brave for Christ. You who can bear and suffer for His
   name's sake--all your Graces come from Him! As all the flowers are bred
   and begotten of the sun, so all that is in you that is good comes from
   Christ, the Sun of Righteousness! And therefore He is glorified in you.

   But, Beloved, God's people have glorified Christ in many other ways.
   When they make Him the object of all their trust, they glorify Him.
   When they say, "Though I am the chief of sinners, yet, I trust Him.
   Though my mind is dark and though my temptations abound, I believe that
   He can save to the uttermost, I trust Him." Christ is more glorified by
   a sinner's humble faith than by a seraph's loudest song! If you
   believe, you glorify Him. Child of God, are you, tonight, very dark,
   dull and heavy? Do you feel half dead, spiritually? Come to your Lord's
   feet and kiss them--and believe that He can save--no, that He has saved
   you, even you, and thus you will glorify His holy name. "Oh," said a
   Believer, the other day, "I know whom I have believed. Christ is mine!"
   "Ah," said another," that is presumption." Beloved, it is nothing of
   the kind! It is not presumption for a child to acknowledge his own
   father. It might be pride for him to be ashamed of his father--it is
   certainly great alienation from his father if he is ashamed to
   acknowledge him. "I know whom I have believed." Happy state of heart,
   to be absolutely sure that you are resting upon Christ, that He is your
   Savior, that you believe in Him, for Jesus said, "He that believes on
   Me has everlasting life." I believe on Him and I have everlasting life!
   "He that believes on Him is not condemned." I believe on Him and I am
   not condemned! Make sure work of this, not only by signs and evidences,
   but do even better--make the one sign and the one evidence to be
   this--"Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. I, a sinner,
   accept His great Sacrifice and I am saved."

   Especially, I think that God's people glorify Christ by a cheerful
   conversation. If you go about moaning and mourning, pining and
   complaining, you bring no honor to His name. But if, when you fast, you
   appear not unto men to fast. If you can wear a cheerful countenance
   even when your heart is heavy. And if, above all, you can rally your
   spirit out of its depths and begin to bless God when the cupboard is
   empty, and friends are few, then you will, indeed, glorify Christ!

   Many are the ways in which this good work may be done--let us try to do
   it. "I am glorified in them," says Christ. That is, by their bold
   confession of Christ. Do I address myself to any here who love Christ,
   but who have never acknowledged it? Come out and come out very soon! He
   deserves to have all the glory that you can give Him. If He has healed
   you, be not like the nine who forgot that Christ had healed their
   leprosy. Come and praise the name of the great Healer and let others
   know what Christ can do! I am afraid that there are a great many here,
   tonight, who hope that they are Christians, but they have never said
   so. What are you ashamed of? Ashamed of your Lord? I am afraid that you
   do not, after all, love Him! Now, at this time, at this particular
   crisis in the history of the Church and the world, if we do not
   publicly take sides with Christ, we shall really be against Him! The
   time has now come when we cannot afford to have go-betweens. You must
   be for Him or for His enemies and, tonight, He asks you, if you are
   really His, to say it! Come forward, unite yourself with His people and
   let it be seen by your life and conversation that you belong to Christ!
   If not,

   how can it be true, "I am glorified in them"? Is Christ glorified in a
   non-confessing people, a people that hope to go slinking into Heaven by
   the by-roads or across the fields, but dare not come into the King's
   Highway and travel with the King's subjects, and confess that they
   belong to Him?

   Lastly, I think that Christ is glorified in His people by their efforts
   to extend His Kingdom. What efforts are you making? There is a great
   deal of force in a Church like this, but I am afraid that there is a
   great deal of wasted steam, wasted power here. The tendency is, so
   often, to leave everything to be done by the minister, or else by one
   or two leading people, but I pray you, Beloved, if you are Christ's,
   and if you belong to the Father, if, unworthy though you are, you are
   claimed with a double ownership by the Father and the Son, try to be of
   use to Them! Let it be seen by your winning others to Christ that He is
   glorified in you! I believe that, by diligent attendance to even the
   smallest Sunday school class, Christ is glorified in you. By that
   private conversation in your own room. By that letter which you dropped
   into the post with many a prayer. By anything that you have done with a
   pure motive, trusting in God in order to glorify Christ, He is
   glorified in you!

   Do not mistake my meaning with regard to serving the Lord. I think it
   exceedingly wrong when I hear exhortations made to young people, "Quit
   your service as domestics and come out into spiritual work. Business
   men, leave your shops. Workmen, give up your trades. You cannot serve
   Christ in that calling, come away from it altogether." I beg to say
   that nothing will be more pestilent than such advice as that! There are
   men called by the Grace of God to separate themselves from every
   earthly occupation and they have special gifts for the work of the
   ministry, but to ever imagine that the bulk of Christian people cannot
   serve God in their daily calling is to think altogether contrary to the
   mind of the Spirit of God! If you are a servant, remain a servant! If
   you are a waiter, go on with your waiting! If you are a tradesman, go
   on with your trade! Let every man abide in the calling wherein he is
   called, unless there is in him some special call from God to devote
   himself to the ministry. Go on with your employment, dear Christian
   people, and do not imagine that you are to turn hermits, or monks, or
   nuns! You would not glorify God if you did so!

   Soldiers of Christ are to fight the battle out where they are. To quit
   the field and shut yourselves up would be to render it impossible that
   you should get the victory. The work of God is as holy and acceptable
   in domestic service, or in trade, as any service that can be rendered
   in the pulpit, or even by the foreign missionary! We thank God for the
   men specially called and set apart for His work, but we know that they
   could do nothing unless the salt of our holy faith should permeate the
   daily life of other Christians. You godly mothers--you are the glory of
   the Church of Christ! You hard working men and women who endure
   patiently, "as seeing Him who is invisible," are the crown and glory of
   the Church of God! You who do not shirk your daily labor, but stand
   manfully to it, obeying Christ in it, are proving what the Christian
   religion was meant to do! We can, if we are truly priests unto God,
   make our everyday garments into vestments, our meals into sacraments
   and our houses into temples for God's worship! Our very beds will be
   within the veil, and our inmost thoughts will be as a sweet incense
   perpetually smoking up to the Most High. Dream not that there is
   anything about any honest calling that degrades a man, or hinders him
   in glorifying God! But sanctify it all till the bells upon the horses
   shall ring out, "Holiness to the Lord," and the pots in your houses
   shall be as holy as the vessels of the sanctuary!

   Now, I want that we should so come to the Communion Table, tonight,
   that even here Christ may be glorified in us. Ah, you may sit at the
   Lord's Table wearing a fine dress or a diamond ring and you may think
   that you are somebody of importance, but you are not! Ah, you may come
   to the Lord's Table and say, "Here is an experienced Christian man who
   knows a thing or two." You are not glorifying Christ that way--you are
   only a nobody! But if you come, tonight, saying, "Lord, I am hungry,
   You can feed me"--that is glorifying Him! If you come saying, "Lord, I
   have no merit and no worthiness. I come because You have died for me
   and I trust You"--you are glorifying Him! He glorifies Christ most who
   takes most from Him and who then gives most back to Him! Come, empty
   pitcher, come and be filled! And, when you are filled, pour all out at
   the dear feet of Him who filled you! Come, trembler, come and let Him
   touch you with His strengthening hands, and then go out and work--and
   use the strength which He has given you! I fear that I have not led you
   where I wanted to bring you--close to my Lord and to the Father--yet I
   have done my best. May the Lord forgive my feebleness and wandering,
   and yet bless you for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN17.

   Verses 1, 2. These words spoke Jesus and lifted up His eyes to Heaven,
   and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son
   also may glorify You: as You have given Him power over all flesh, that
   He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him. Here the
   Doctrines of a General and a Particular redemption sweetly blend, "As
   You have given Him power over all flesh," they are all under Christ's
   mediatorial government by virtue of His matchless Sacrifice. But the
   object in view is specially the gift of everlasting life to the chosen
   people--"that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given
   Him."

   3. And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent. No man has life eternal,
   then, who is in ignorance of God and of His Son, Jesus Christ. But once
   we know God and Christ, we have sure evidence that we possess a life
   that can never die--"This is life eternal."

   4-6. I have glorified You on the earth: I have finished the work which
   You gave Me to do. And now, O Father, glorify You Me with Your own
   Self, with the Glory which I had with You before the world was. I have
   manifested Your name unto the men which You gave Me out of the world:
   Yours they were, and You gave them to Me; and they have kept Your Word.
   Is not that sweetly put on the part of our Divine Lord? These chosen
   men had been poor creatures at the very best--very forgetful and very
   erring--yet their Lord brings no charges against them but He says to
   His Father, "They have kept Your Word."

   7. Now they have known that all things whatever You have given Me are
   of You. "They have learned to link the Father and the Son. They know
   that though I am the channel of all blessing, yet You, O My Father, are
   the fountain from which

   it flows."--

   "Jesus, we bless Your Father's name! Your God and ours are both the
   same! What heavenly blessings from His Throne Flow down to sinners
   through His Son!"

   8. For I have given unto them the Words which You gave Me; and they
   have received them, and have known surely that I came out from You, and
   they have believed that You did send Me. He is looking at them in
   contrast with the world which utterly rejected Him--in contrast with
   that world, the disciples had received and known Christ. Oh, what a
   blessed distinction does the Grace of God make between men! We were all
   blind by nature, but now that we see, it is because the sacred finger
   of Christ has touched our eyes and opened them! Let Him have all the
   glory for it, yet let us note how well He speaks of His people. "For I
   have given unto them the Words which You gave Me; and they have
   received them, and have known surely that I came out from You, and they
   have believed that You did send Me."

   9. 10. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
   You have given Me; for they are Yours. And all Mine are Yours, and
   Yours are Mine; and I am glorified in them. Oh, the blessed union of
   interests between Christ and the Father! How surely do we belong to the
   Father if we, in very deed, belong to Christ! And what a holy unity is
   thus established!

   11. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and
   I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your own name those whom You
   have given Me, that they may be one, as We are. Here is a prayer, then,
   for the preservation and the unity of the people of God--two very
   necessary petitions. Would God that they might be fulfilled in us, that
   we might be kept, and kept even to the end--and then kept in living
   union with all the people of God, and with the Father and with the Son!

   12, 13. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name:
   those that You gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the
   son ofperdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I
   to You and these things I speak in the world, that they might have My
   joy fulfilled in themselves. In this wondrous prayer, note the special
   design of the Words of Christ--not only that we might have joy, but
   that we might have Christ's joy--and not merely have a little of it,
   but might have it fulfilled in ourselves.

   14-16. I have given them Your Word; and the world has hated them,
   because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I
   pray not that You should take them out of the world, but that You
   should keep them from the Evil One. They

   are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Jesus puts twice
   over this most special and important fact, which we must never
   forget--"They are not of the world." Let us never live as if we were of
   the world, but where such a vivid distinction has been made, God grant
   that there may be an equal distinction in our lives! Now comes the
   prayer for sanctifi-cation.

   17, 18. Sanctify them through Your Truth: Your Word is Truth. As You
   have sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the
   world. Christ was the great Missionary, the Messiah, the Sent One. We
   are the minor missionaries, sent out into the world to accomplish the
   Father's will and purpose.

   19, 20. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be
   sanctified through the Truth. Neither pray I for these, alone, but for
   them, also, which shall believe on Me through their word. That shows
   that Christ's prayer embraces us, also, who have been brought to
   believe on Him through the word which the Apostles declared. Christ,
   with prescient eyes, looked on every one of us who believe on Him and
   prayed for each one of us as much as He did for John, and Peter, and
   James.

   21,22. That they all may be one; as You, Father, are in Me, and I in
   You, that they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that
   You have sent Me. And the glory which You gave Me I have given them;
   that they may be one, even as We are One. Unity is the glory of the
   Church of Christ! It shall be the very crown of the Church of the
   living God and when she puts it on, then will the wondering world
   acknowledge and accept her Lord!

   23. I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
   that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as
   You have loved Me. Wonderful words! How shall we dive into their
   depths? To think that the Father should have loved us even as He loved
   His only-begotten Son! Oh, the heights and depths of this wondrous
   love!

   24, 25. Father, I will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with
   Me where I am; that they may behold My Glory, which You have given Me:
   for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. O righteous
   Father, the world has not known You: but I have known You, and these
   have known that You have sent Me. Do you notice the division that there
   is here. There are two parties--there is the world and there is the
   Church. What is it that divides them? Read these two clauses--"The
   world has not known You." "These have known that You have sent Me."
   What stands between? "But I have known You." It is Christ, Himself,
   coming in between the two parties, like the cloudy-fiery pillar, black
   with darkness to the Egyptians, but bright with light to the
   Israelites! Oh, to have Christ between You and the world! It is the
   best form of separation--"I have known You, and these have known that
   You have sent Me."

   26. And I have declared unto them Your name, and will declare it. I
   read it to you as it stands. Our good translators were always afraid of
   using a word too often, for fear of falling into tautology. So, for
   what they considered the beauty of the language, they used the word,
   "declared," instead of, "I made known." But why should they have done
   so? Who were they that they should have needed to improve on Christ's
   Words? It should be the same Word right on--"The world has not known
   You: but I have known You, and these have known that You have sent Me.
   And I have made known unto them Your name, and will make it known."

   26. That the love wherewith You have loved Me may be in them, and I in
   them. Oh, that this love may be in us, for Christ's sake! Amen.

Lessons From the Manna

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, OCTOBER 29, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 12, 1889.

   "Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from Heaven
   for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every
   day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My Law, or no."
   Exodus 16:4.

   IT seems to us that it must have been a very difficult thing to supply
   food for the hundreds of thousands, I shall not be incorrect if I say
   the millions who were in the wilderness. But, difficult as that was,
   the commissariat was not so difficult as the education. To train that
   mob of slaves into a nation under discipline--to lift up those who had
   been in bondage and make them fit to enjoy national privileges--this
   was the Herculean task that Moses had to perform. And their God, who
   loved the children of Israel and chose them--and determined to make
   them a peculiar people unto Himself, undertook to teach them--and He
   used their food as part of the means of their education. Animals are
   often taught through their food. When they cannot be reached in any
   other way, they have been instructed by their hunger, by their thirst
   and by their feeding. And the Lord, who knew of what a coarse nature
   Israel was composed, and how the people had degenerated from the old
   stock during their long bondage, took care to teach them by every
   means, not only by the higher and the more spiritual, by the typical
   and symbolical, but He also taught them by their hunger and by their
   thirst, by the supply of water from the Rock and by the manna which He
   rained from Heaven.

   We will try to see, tonight, what the Lord taught them, but we will do
   more than that--we will try to learn what they learned and somewhat
   more. May the Holy Spirit, Himself, be our Teacher and as He has often
   taught us the most Divine lessons by the bread and wine, preaching to
   our very hearts by what seemed the lowly ministry of food and drink, so
   may He, tonight, teach us by that angels' bread which with Israel was
   fed in the wilderness long years ago!

   First, I invite you to consider how the Lord taught these people by His
   gift. And next, how He taught them by making this gift a test to them.
   Thirdly, I shall have to show how He teaches its lessons as to temporal
   things. And lastly, how He instructs us as to our spiritual food.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, let us Consider HOW THE LORD TAUGHT THESE
   PEOPLE BY HIS GIFT.

   He wanted them to know Him. His great desire was that they should know
   Jehovah, their God. If they knew God, they would know all else, for,
   after all, "the proper study of mankind" is God. And when man knows his
   God, he knows himself. But if he thinks that he knows himself while he
   knows not his God, he is greatly mistaken.

   God desired, then, to teach them, Himself, by the gift of the manna.
   And He taught them, first, His care over them, that He was their God,
   and that they were His people and that He would lay Himself out to
   provide for them. Think of the care that God had over them, over each
   one of them, for each man had his own omer of manna. No woman, no child
   was forgotten. Every morning there was sufficient quantity for every
   man, according to his needs for that day. There was no more and there
   was never any less, so carefully did God watch over each individual.
   The individuality of the Divine Love is a great part of the sweetness
   of it. God thinks of every separate child of His as much as if He had
   only that one. The multiplicity of His elect does not divide the loaf
   of His affection. He has an infinite affection for each one and He will
   take care of the details of each chosen life. He will see your omer
   filled, precisely, to the ounce! He will give you all you can possibly
   need, but He will give you nothing that you can lay by to minister to
   your pride.

   And this care was shown every day. The Lord taught them the continuity
   of His remembrance by its coming every day. If He had sent one great
   rain of liberalities to refresh His inheritance and had told them
   gather up the vast store and

   carry it with them in all their journeying, they could not so well have
   learned His care as when He sent it fresh every morning. Besides, they
   would have had the burden of carrying it and they were free from that,
   for the heavenly supplies were always close at hand, exactly at the
   spot where they pitched their tents and tarried. Every morning, there
   was the manna precisely where they needed it, and that without any
   man's shoulder being made raw by carrying his food in his
   kneading-trough. The Lord teaches you and me in the same way, that He
   not only cares for each one, but cares for each one each day and each
   moment, tracking our footsteps and meting out the full supply of the
   hour according as the peculiar necessity arises. "He is always
   thoughtful, always thoughtful of me," you may say of your Lord--"always
   thoughtful of all the brotherhood, of the whole company of the
   redeemed, but none the less thoughtful of each one because there are so
   many myriads to be cared for every moment of every day." Was not that a
   sweet lesson for the children of Israel to learn as they gathered their
   daily bread?

   But Jehovah taught them, next, His greatness. He had taught them that
   in Egypt by His mighty plagues and, at the Red Sea, when He branded the
   breast of the waters with His mighty rod. But now He gently taught them
   His greatness, His exceeding greatness, first, by the quantity of the
   manna. There was enough for them all. How much it required, I leave
   arithmeticians to calculate--I cannot go into that question tonight.
   And remember, that quantity fell every morning for 40 years! What a
   great God is He who could feed the canvas city of His chosen people for
   40 years at a stretch and yet without His stores being ever drained!
   His greatness was also seen by the mode in which He fed these myriads.
   Usually our bread springs up from the soil, but these people were in a
   waste land--a howling wilderness! Wonder of wonders, their bread came
   down from the sky! Shall men live on air? Will you sustain a population
   on mist, cloud and dew? Yet out of a seeming vacuum came a constant
   plenty! Every morning the earth was covered with the heaped-up food of
   all that multitude and they had nothing to do but to go out and gather
   it. What a God is this whose marching through the wilderness were so
   marvelous! Jehovah, Your paths drop fatness! Wherever You place your
   feet, the wilderness and the solitary place are glad! If You lead Your
   people through a desert, it is no desert to them! The heavens supply
   what the earth denies. Behold, the greatness of your God, you who are
   fed by His care!

   And, next, they learned His liberality combined with His greatness, for
   everyday they were fed, but not fed as Joseph supplied the people in
   Egypt, when he took from them all their stores to buy the corn and, at
   last, took themselves to be bondsmen unto Pharaoh--and their lands to
   be Pharaoh's freehold that they might live. No, there was never a
   pretense of paying for that daily bread. The richest man had his omer
   filled, but he paid not a penny for it. And the poorest man had his
   omer just as full at the same price! There was "nothing to pay"--no
   manna-tax was ever exacted of the Israelite's hand. Oh, the liberality
   of God! His cry is, "Ho, everyone that thirsts, come to the waters, and
   he that has no money; come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk."
   Do you notice how Jehovah's invitation grows? He says at first, "Come
   to the waters," but He corrects Himself before He gets through with it,
   and says, "Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."
   The Lord is infinitely good, essentially. He is growingly good,
   experimentally. The more we trust Him, the more we discover of His
   liberality! He "gives liberally and upbraids not." He scarcely
   upbraided Israel despite their frequent murmuring and the manna fell
   continually--and the abundance of it must always have struck the
   people. God's liberality never stinted them. Oh, yes, I have no doubt
   that it is quite right to weigh out the bread and to weigh out the
   meat--so much bone and so much fat to be allowed to every prisoner in
   the jail--and possibly to every pauper in the poor house! But that is
   not God's way of going to work. Though we deserve to be in prison and
   though we are, all of us, pensioners on His bounty, yet He gives each
   one his omer full. If a man has a large appetite, he may eat as much as
   he likes and the manna seems to grow while he is eating. And if he has
   a small appetite, though he may have gathered much, yet he will still
   have nothing left over. God supplied the manna bountifully, yet exactly
   according to the capacity of the receiver.

   This brings me to say that the children of Israel also learned God's
   Immutability, for they had been fed with manna all through the
   wilderness. Some old man may have said, "I remember going out the first
   time to gather my omerful. I was astonished at it! And my neighbors
   kept calling out, 'Man-hu? Man-hu? Man-hu?' They were all wonderstruck!
   They did not know what to call it, so they asked, 'What is it?' They
   called it, 'Manhu?' And now," he said, "I have been out all these
   years. Thank God, I have never had a swollen foot so that I could not
   go out to gather it! It has always been just as white and just as round
   and just as plentiful and just as near my tent as at the first! I used
   to live over on the left side of the camp and I moved to the right, but
   I always found that the manna was equally plentiful in every direction
   wherever I

   went. And it is so now," the old man would say, "it is so now and it is
   just as sweet, and just as plentiful, and just as freely to be had for
   nothing by every man who chooses to go out and gather it. Blessed be
   God, He changes not and, therefore, we sons of Jacob are not consumed!
   If He had changed, the manna would have failed us and we would have
   been consumed with hunger."

   Jehovah still lives, O child of God! You have just buried one very dear
   to you, but the Lord still lives--He never fails. It may be that your
   income is getting shorter--the Brook Cherith is drying up and the
   ravens have not been with the bread and meat lately. Jehovah still
   lives--and there is a widow over at Zarephath who will have her
   commission to take care of the Lord's servant. Jehovah lives! His eyes
   are not dim, His ears are not heavy, His arms are not short! Therefore
   trust in the unchanging God and be not afraid! The manna shall fall
   from Heaven till you shall eat the old corn in Canaan!

   Do you not think, Beloved, that from this gift the children of Israel
   also learned God's wisdom? If they were not sensible enough to know it,
   He had given them the best food that He could give them. In that hot
   climate, if they had eaten meat continually, they would often have been
   ill. When the Lord did allow them quail in answer to their cravings,
   while the meat was yet in their months they were taken with deadly
   sickness. It was unwholesome for them to have meat--this manna from on
   high was the best thing for people living in tents, journeying from
   place to place, over a burning sand, beneath a scorching sky. The Lord
   had adapted the food to the people, yet they said, "Our soul loathes
   this light bread." The very name they gave to it showed that it was
   just the right sort of food for them, easy of digestion. God had
   adapted their food to their position in the wilderness--no doctor could
   have drawn up a dietary table that was equal in wisdom to the one
   prepared by God for His people while they were in that condition!

   And He showed His wisdom, too, in the quantity provided--it was always
   the right measure. "He that gathered much had nothing over." The manna
   seemed to shrink to the right quantity. "He that gathered little had no
   lack." The manna seemed to swell and increase so that there was exactly
   enough to an ounce for all those multitudes. Oh, the infinite wisdom of
   God! How I have often admired His promptness to a moment, His exactness
   to a drachma, for with Him there are no more small mistakes than great
   ones! He never errs in any sense or way, but He hits the mark precisely
   in all that He does!

   And then, once more, the Israelites must have learned His goodness
   because He had not supplied them with tasteless food. According to the
   Apocrypha, which is not to be received as Scripture, but still is often
   valuable in some respects, each man tasted the manna according to his
   own liking. There was something about it that enabled the mouth to give
   its own flavor to it. And their marching through the wilderness, their
   weariness, would often add a sauce to it that made it exceedingly sweet
   to them. It was like wafers made with honey, not at all unpalatable. It
   was, as I have already told you, like fresh oil, by no means
   disagreeable to an Eastern. God did not give them beggar's food, spare
   scraps and broken victuals. He had said, "I will rain bread from Heaven
   for you," and He kept His Word. The least bit of Heaven's bread must be
   delicious to the taste. "Man did eat angels' food," said the Psalmist,
   and that cannot be bad food which falls from the table of cherubim and
   seraphim, such food as spirits might partake of if they might partake
   of any--light, and pure, and ethereal, and spiritual--as far removed
   from the grosser forms of materialism as food well could be! It was a
   godlike food for a godlike race if they had but been worthy of their
   destiny and had been willing to learn what God was so ready to teach
   them.

   II. Notice, dear Friends, in the second place, HOW THE LORD TAUGHT
   THESE PEOPLE BY MAKING THIS MANNA A TEST TO THEM.

   Their position was, in many respects, a very pleasant one. They had not
   to work for daily bread--they had only to go out and gather it. There
   it was, but here is the point for us to observe. It was given every
   day--they never had any store. A man who gathered manna for 20 years
   might say, in language that I have often heard, "I ain't a bit
   forwarder. I am just where I was 20 years ago," as if it were not
   getting forwarder to be 20 years older and to have had 20 years of
   mercy! Yet there was no store of manna--all up and down the wilderness
   there was not a single bank in which people could put their money!
   There was no such thing as a dividend to be received by anybody and
   nobody could be laying up anything. Each Israelite had what he needed
   for the day--he kept on having just so much and no more--and this was a
   test. Could he endure that test?

   And then, again, as there was no store for the whole of them, and they
   did not get any richer, so there was no opportunity for greed, for it
   was given to every man. He who thrust out his two hands to rake up the
   manna, when he returned to his tent, had an omerful for himself, his
   wife and his eight children, but he had not any more. He thought the
   next day, perhaps, that he would sweep away by the half-hour together
   if he could, as long as the dew was remaining, and get an extra
   quantity--but when he examined it, he had exactly as much as he and his
   family could eat and no more! The rest was all gone, evaporated, and
   nothing was left over and above what he needed. And his poor palsied
   neighbor, who could only get a little together in his basin with his
   one good hand, found that, somehow, he had enough, for God made it to
   grow in the basin! And when he looked at it, there was just enough for
   the day's supply.

   "Oh," says one, "I would like that." Well, I agree with you. I would
   like that, too. But how long would you like it? I dare say about as
   long as these Israelites did and you would begin grumbling, just as
   they did. Here was God's test of them--every day and no store--every
   man and no greed! It is so with Grace--God gives us as much Grace as we
   need, but there is nobody here who has any Grace laid up. Oh, yes, I
   heard one person say that she had so much Divine Grace that she had not
   sinned for months. Ugh! I thought I smelt something! I did not say
   anything, but I remembered what manna does when it is kept and there I
   left the subject. I hope none of you think that you have more Grace
   than you need, because you have not! You may, possibly, have as much
   Grace as will last you through today, but you will need as much as that
   tomorrow morning, if not more. Oh, yes, I know that you have an iron
   safe and you go and rattle your keys and you say, "Look here! I have
   Grace enough locked up for the next six weeks."

   Go again and you will be glad to run away from the stench, for you will
   find that you have locked up so much pride, and nothing else! We do not
   need dying Grace till we come to die! Be satisfied to have living Grace
   while you live! You do not need Grace to preach, tonight, dear
   Friends--you need Grace to sit and listen. That may, perhaps, require
   as much Grace as I need for preaching, but do not ask for my Grace, as
   I will not ask for yours. Eat your own manna! Eat it--do not lay it
   up--it is not meant to be stored up, it must be eaten. This gift of the
   manna, everyday for every man, was a test by which the Lord taught the
   children of Israel.

   So was that Friday storing, when they said to themselves, "We get into
   the habit of gathering our food every morning, but here comes this
   Friday, when we have to gather twice as much." I do like consistency,
   always doing the same thing, but here is a command to do twice as much,
   once a week--here is a law that shifts a bit. I like systematic
   theology, but here is a sliding seat. Here is a double supply for
   Friday and I have to store half of it up. So one man did not store it
   up when he was told to do so and another man tried to store it up when
   he was told not to do so. Thus the Lord tested and tried them. It is a
   wonderful thing, that testing to which God puts us! Sometimes, when we
   think that we have such a surplus of faith in Him, He just tests us and
   we find that we have not any! The most grand life is a life of
   dependence upon God, for that is true independence! If you wholly
   depend upon God, then you have risen to independence. He who has
   nothing but what God gives him, day by day, has a competence. He is the
   man who has saved most who has least, for he is saved from the worry of
   taking care of it! If he is still dependent upon God's Providence and
   faith can keep her hold, he is the best off man after all!

   You said that you envied the Israelites. Ah, well, you may, but you
   need faith, or else what might be a theme of envy becomes a subject of
   discontent. So I leave that point.

   III. My time has pretty well gone, so I will only hint at what I would
   have said had there been time. Observe, HOW THE LORD TEACHES US BY THIS
   MANNA AS TO TEMPORAL THINGS.

   First, He teaches us that our supplies depend upon Him. Where did all
   the manna come from? It all came from God. Child of God, all your
   supplies must come from God! Learn that. Whatever the second causes,
   whatever the intermediary sources, all you are to have will come when
   all you have had has come, namely, from God.

   Learn, next, that our supplies are sure to faith. If the manna did not
   fail for 40 years, neither will the Lord fail to supply your needs.
   Your God will give you your livery if you are His servant. He will give
   you your daily rations, also, if you serve Him. "Seek first the Kingdom
   of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
   you." He who carves for himself will cut his fingers and get an empty
   plate. But he who waits for the great Host of all the chosen family to
   carve for him shall have enough and that of the best. "My God shall
   supply all your needs according to His riches in Glory by Christ
   Jesus."

   But learn from the children of Israel that our supplies will have to be
   gathered and prepared by ourselves. God sent the manna from Heaven, but
   the people had to go out every morning and get it--and when they had
   gathered it--we read that they used to beat it in mortars, or grind it
   in mills, bake it in pans and make it into cakes. God is not the patron
   of idleness. He will have His people work and His rule is, "If any man
   will not work, neither shall he eat," a rule He often carries out with
   those who are idlers. But, Beloved, we thank God for opportunities for
   diligence. Though labor came at first as a curse, God has turned it
   into a blessing.

   And, once more, our supplies ought to content us, for the children of
   Israel had enough for all their needs. They had no superfluities, but
   they had all-sufficiency. They had no luxuries, but yet, if they chose
   to think so, their daily mercies became luxuries to them. Oh, that God
   might teach us to trust Him as to temporals!

   IV. Now for my last point and I beg your patience for a few minutes
   only. HOW THE LORD TEACHES US BY THIS MANNA AS TO OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD.
   Here, also, I will only give you hints.

   Every day you and I ought to go forth and find food for our spiritual
   life. Ah, but have you all received spiritual life? Some of you, it may
   be, are dead while you live--without God and without Christ. May the
   Lord quicken you by His life-giving Spirit!

   But if you have spiritual life, you must feed it, and God will give you
   manna from Heaven, that is, Christ, Himself, with which to feed your
   soul! He is that Bread of Life which came down from Heaven and you must
   feed on Him. Take care that you go diligently to work to get this
   spiritual food. The Israelites were up to gather the manna which fell
   morning by morning. Be not idlers with the Word of God--search it. Got
   up early in the morning to read your Bible if you cannot do it at other
   times. Steal from your sleep a happy hour to read the Scriptures.
   Diligently and earnestly seek the Lord, for He has said, "They that
   seek Me early shall find Me."

   Then, as I hinted in the reading, the manna was always encased in dew.
   They took care to gather this, for then it became sweet dew to them.
   May the Word of the Lord always have a dew upon it to you! The critic
   takes God's Word and he treats it as the sun did the manna--he pours a
   dry heat upon it--and it evaporates, and it is gone. Oh, those critics!
   What a mass of manna they have altogether evaporated! But the child of
   God takes care that he loses nothing of what God has revealed. Every
   Word is precious to him, yes, every jot and tittle and, under the
   bedewing influences of the Holy Spirit, he constantly gathers Christ
   fresh, always new, and he finds His flesh to be meat, indeed, and His
   blood to be drink, indeed!

   Again, the manna was to be continually sought. So must your spiritual
   food. Do not try to live on last year's manna. Stale experiences are
   poor food. I know no dish that is worse than cold experience--you need
   to have a daily realization of the things of God. Hourly feed on
   Christ, for the food of years past will be of small account to you.
   Continually go about the meadows and feed, sheep of the Lord! Go again
   and again to the still waters, drink and be satisfied.

   In the case of this manna, the gatherers were pleased with little. It
   was a small, round thing, like coriander seed, or like the hoarfrost.
   So be very thankful to get a little bit out of God's Word. If you only
   find one new thought, one fresh idea, pick it up and put it in the
   omer. A great many of these precious little things will make rare food
   for a hungry spirit. Get the food for your soul, little by little. You
   can imagine how they probably had to gather it. I suppose that they
   went down on their knees to get it, for it was always down low, just on
   the hoarfrost that lay on the desert sand. Look at them all stooping
   down to gather it up! And the bulk of them, I think, were on their
   knees gathering it. That is the way to get the heavenly food--gather it
   on your knees! Stoop low with humility! Bond to the very ground in
   prayerfulness and so gather up the coriander seed--no, I mean the
   heavenly manna--and go your way rejoicing!

   And it was always for immediate consumption. Whenever you get a Divine
   promise, go and pray over it and use it at once. Whenever you see a
   duty, do it. Do not leave one single part of God's Word to lie void. If
   anything in the Word of God is impressed upon your mind, let it get
   into your very soul and let it be carried out in your practice. Eat the
   manna as soon as you get it and use, to God's glory, the strength
   derived from it.

   Lastly, like the Israelites, sometimes you will get double supplies.
   There is a difference between us and the children of Israel, for we
   generally get a double supply on the Sabbath. Oh, how we ought to thank
   God for our Sabbaths, when the Lord is with us, or when He makes the
   manna to lie on the dew and we come up to His House, and go away with
   our omers full! Happy Sabbaths! They become the marked days of the week
   and we go from Sunday to Monday, and Monday

   to Thursday, and Thursday to Sunday, again, thanking God that the
   heavenly bread still comes down to meet our rising prayers and
   thanksgivings!

   God bless you, dear Friends! May He make His Word sweeter to us every
   day we live! May we have good appetites to feed on it! As for you who
   have never known the flavor of the heavenly food, I say again, as I
   said a few minutes ago, may the Lord quicken you by His own life-giving
   Spirit, for Jesus' sake! Amen!

   EXPOSITIONS BY C. H. SPURGEON: EXODUS 16:1-5,11-36; NUMBERS11:1-10.

   Exodus 16:1, 2. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
   congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin,
   which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second
   month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. And the whole
   congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron
   in the wilderness. They have been only about six weeks in the
   wilderness and already they are up in arms against their leaders.
   Remember that we have the same kind of people to deal with as Moses and
   Aaron had. The children of Israel were no better than any other nation
   and I do not think they were any worse. We may take them as a fair
   average of human nature, which is a discontented, rebellious thing in
   the best of circumstances.

   3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died
   by the hands of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the
   fleshpots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought
   us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
   They forgot all about the brick-making, the whips and the iron bondage.
   They remembered nothing but the fleshpots of Egypt. Ah, me, how soon,
   when we escape from a great trial, we forget it! The present much
   smaller one seems far heavier than that which is past.

   4. Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from Heaven
   for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every
   day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My Law, or no.
   See God's answer to man's murmuring? They send up their complaint and
   He promises to rain bread down from above! It is a blessed story on
   God's part all along--a rain of mercy for a smoke of complaining.

   5. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
   that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather
   daily. Now let us read at the 11th verse.

   11, 12. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying, I have heard the
   murmurings of the children of Israel. "I have heard them." God always
   hears. Oh, His wonderful patience! If He took no notice of the
   murmurers, or punished them for their wickedness, we would have no
   cause for wonder, but He is long-suffering, even to those who do not
   deserve His pity.

   12. Speak unto them, saying, At even you shall eat flesh, and in the
   morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am
   the LORD your God. "There shall be no mistake about who I am. I will
   work this miracle in such a Godlike style and on such a Divine scale,
   that you shall know that I am Jehovah your God."

   13-16. And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
   covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
   And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
   wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on
   the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said, one to
   another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said
   unto them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat. This
   is the thing which the LORD has commanded, gather of it every man
   according to his eating, an omer for every man. About two pints and a
   half, I think. But according to some calculations, two quarts, or
   thereabouts. There would be more sustenance in it than in a
   half-quartern loaf of bread per diem--"An omer for every man."

   16-18. According to the number of your persons; take you every man for
   them which are in his tents. And the children of Israel did so, and
   gathered, some more, some less. And when they did measure it with an
   omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered
   little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
   God meant it to be so. Not every man according to his avarice, that he
   might save any of it, but "every man according to his eating." God took
   care that neither should feebleness be stinted, nor should greed have
   any excess.

   19-22. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
   Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of
   it until the morning and it bred worms and stank: and Moses was angry
   with them. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to
   his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. And it came to pass,
   that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for
   one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told

   Moses. He had told them that it would be so, but they evidently did not
   accept the message that he had delivered to them as the very Word of
   Jehovah, their God, so that, when it was fulfilled, it struck them with
   wonder--and they "came and told Moses."

   23. And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD has said. How
   often could that answer be made to us! God hears our prayer and we run
   and say, "What a wonderful thing! God has heard my prayer!" "This is
   that which the Lord has said." Is it a strange thing that what Jehovah
   has said is proved to be true? And is it a subject for surprise that He
   should keep His promise? You dishonor God when you talk after this
   fashion!

   23. Tomorrow is the rest of the Holy Sabbath unto the LORD. And yet the
   Sabbath had not been instituted according to the Law of God, which
   proves that its foundation lay deeper and earlier than the promulgation
   of the Ten Commandments! It is bound up with the essential arrangement
   of time since the creation--"This is that which the Lord has said,
   Tomorrow is the rest of the Holy Sabbath unto the Lord."

   23-27. Bake that which you will bake today, and churn that you will
   churn, and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the
   morning. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses said and it did
   not stink, neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said, Eat that
   today for today is a Sabbath unto the LORD: today you shall not find it
   in the field. Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day,
   which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none. And it came to pass,
   that there went out, some of the people, on the seventh day for to
   gather, and they found none. They might have expected it to be so, but
   they would not believe, and as they would not believe, they must put
   the Word of God to the test. But it endures the trial--it is always
   true! Oh, that men would, in a believing spirit, test the Word of God,
   instead of doing it after this skeptical fashion!

   28-31. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse you to keep My
   Commandments and My Laws? See, for that the LORD has given you the
   Sabbath, therefore He gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days;
   abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
   seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day. And the house of
   Israel called the name thereof Manna. Or, "What is it?" It was
   something too amazing to be understood and they kept the expression of
   their wonderment as the name of their Bread from Heaven. When they
   first saw it, they exclaimed, "Man-

   hu?" "Manhu?" "What is it?" "What is it?" Thus it received its Hebrew
   name, Manna, but God called it, "Bread from

   Heaven."

   31-33. And it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was
   like wafers made with honey. And Moses said, This is the thing which
   the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations;
   that they may see the bread where with I have fed you in the
   wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses
   said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and
   lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. This
   production, which would not keep a single day under ordinary
   circumstances, would keep for two days to supply the needs of the
   Sabbath--and it would keep for generations as a memorial of God's
   goodness to His chosen people during their 40 years' wanderings through
   the wilderness. We may be quite sure that Aaron would not have kept a
   stinking thing laid up before the Lord.

   34-36. As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
   Testimony, to be kept. And the children of Israel did eat manna forty
   years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna until
   they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. Now an omer is the
   tenth part of an ephah. Now I want you to read in the Book of Numbers.
   Further on in the history of the children of Israel, when the people
   had long been in the wilderness--the same kind of thing happened again.

   Numbers 11:1. And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD.
   Interpreters cannot make out what they had to complain of. The curse of
   labor had been removed. They did not earn their bread with the sweat of
   their face, for it fell from Heaven every day. They were at no expense
   for clothing and though they journeyed, their feet did not swell. I
   suppose that they complained of the weather. It was too cold. It was
   too hot. It was too wet. It was too dry. They complained when they
   stood still--they were much too long in a place. They complained when
   they marched--they moved too often. In fact, they were very like
   ourselves! They often complained most when they had least to complain
   of. Discontent is chronic to our humanity and I do not believe that the
   poorest are the most discontented. It is often the very reverse. When a
   man is put in a place where he has nothing to complain of, especially
   if he is an Englishman, he feels quite

   out of place. He must have something to grumble at, something or other
   to be a grievance or else he is not happy. "When the people complained,
   it displeased the Lord."

   1. And the LORD heard it; and His anger was kindled; and the fire of
   the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost
   parts of the camp. He could hear their first murmuring, as they were
   new to the wilderness-- they were hungry, they were thirsty--and the
   Lord pitied them. But now, when there was no reason for their
   complaining, His fire in terrible judgment visited His people on
   account of their rebellion and murmuring against the goodness of

   God.

   2-4. And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
   LORD, the fire was quenched. And he called the name of the place
   Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. And the mixed
   multitude that was among them fell a lusting. All evil seems to begin
   there, among "the mixed multitude," as it does among those church
   members who are unconverted, and among those people who try to hold
   with the hare and run with the hounds--those who want to be Christians
   and worldlings, too!

   4. And the children of Israel also wept, again, and said, Who shall
   give us flesh to eat? Even the true people of God caught the infection
   of the scum that was mixed with them and they fell a-weeping and said--

   5. We remember the fish which we did freely eat in Egypt; the
   cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
   garlic. Fine stuff to remember! "Why," you say, "you have read
   something before very much like that." I am reading another record, but
   there is no originality in grumbling--it is always the same old thing
   over again. You might well suppose that I was reading in the Book of
   Exodus, but I am not--there are many years in between. He who sits down
   with a discontented hand to paint a picture will paint the same picture
   that he painted before. There is no originality in the murmuring,
   although they put in a few new touches. Before, it was the flesh pots
   that they remembered--now, in addition to the flesh, there are these
   savory vegetables--"the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and
   the onions, and the garlic."

   6. But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all beside this
   manna before our eyes. Here they pour contempt upon the bread of
   angels, upon the Food of Heaven, upon the benison of God! Oh, what will
   men not complain of?

   7. And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the
   color of bdellium. A fine white color, like a pearl.

   8. And the people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
   or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and
   the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. At first they thought it
   was like wafers made with honey. Getting more used to it, they,
   perhaps, described it quite as accurately, but not quite so
   sweetly--they said it was like fresh oil, and there is no better taste
   than that. Oil, by the time it comes to us, has usually a rank and
   rancid taste, but in the oil countries it is delicious, and he who has
   bread and a drop or two of oil will find himself not ill supplied with
   a dinner--

   "The taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil."

   9. And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
   upon it. God took care to preserve His precious gift, encasing each
   single particle of it within a drop of dew, which gave it freshness.
   And when the Grace of God comes to us encased in the dew of the Spirit,
   how sweet is its taste! May it be so to us whenever we feed on Christ!

   10. Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every
   man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled
   greatly; Moses also was displeased. And no wonder! Meek man as he was,
   they vexed his gracious spirit by their perpetual murmuring. As we read
   this sad story, let us, as in a glass, see ourselves--and let us deeply
   repent of our murmuring and complaining, and henceforth sing--

   "I will praise You every day! Now Your anger's turned away." Perhaps
   our next hymn (Number 697) will help us that way.

The Whole Band Against Christ

   (No. 2333)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 15, 1889.

   "Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Common Hall and
   gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers." Matthew 27:27.

   I HAVE not observed that anyone has turned to account the fact that
   "the whole band of soldiers" gathered in the Praetorium, or Common
   Hall, for the purpose of mocking our Lord. That they did mock Him has
   often been noticed and preached upon, but that they should have
   gathered unto Him the whole garrison--that all should have been
   there--is mentioned both by Matthew and by Mark. And this being twice
   recorded cannot have been without some meaning and some lesson for us.

   To begin, then, our blessed Lord, being condemned to die, was given
   over to the brutal soldiers who garrisoned Jerusalem. They lived in
   quarters round about the palace of the governor and when the Savior was
   delivered to them to be put to death, they made Him the center of their
   mockery and derision before they executed the terrible sentence upon
   Him. Does it not strike you that any man condemned to die ought to be
   protected against such usage as that? If he must die, some respect
   should be paid to one who is about to endure the death penalty. I think
   that there should be great indulgence shown in such a case--at any
   rate, nothing should be done or said to hurt the feelings, or to wound
   the sensibilities. Pity seems to say, "If the man must die, then so be
   it, but let us not, for a single moment make jest of him. Let there not
   be mirth--that is a brutality not to be thought of at such a time as
   this! And to make a man, about to die, the subject of scorn is a
   superfluity of cruelty and wickedness." I think that even a devil might
   be ashamed of such savagery as this!

   But there was no law to protect the Savior from these soldiers. Every
   man's heart seems to have been steeled against Him--the common dictates
   of the most ignorant humanity appear to have been violated. They said
   by their actions, if not in words, "He shall not only die, but He shall
   be stripped of all His honor. He shall be robbed of every comfort. He
   shall become the butt and target of all the cruel arrows of contempt
   that we can shoot at Him."

   Still, why is it said that, in order to make Him the object of
   derision, they gathered together, "the whole band"? I do not know how
   many soldiers constituted the garrison, or how many were barracked
   round about the governor's palace, but they gathered together, "the
   whole band"--not merely a few of them who were on duty that day, but
   all were summoned to make a mockery of Christ. It was not because He
   needed to be guarded lest He should escape, for He had no desire to be
   set free. It was not because the soldiers would have needed to keep Him
   securely guarded lest the people should attempt to rescue Him, for the
   Jews did not want Him to be rescued. On the contrary, it was by their
   clamor that He was doomed to die. They had cried, "Crucify Him! Crucify
   Him!" He had no friends to stand up for Him, no band of disciples to
   come and force the soldiers away and set Him free. Therefore these
   soldiers did not guard Him with the whole strength of the band on that
   account.

   Nor were they all needed to execute the death sentence. With a people
   eager for His death, four soldiers, a single quaternion, sufficed. He
   carried His own Cross and they had but to drive the nails into His
   hands and feet and fasten Him to the tree. That could have soon done it
   to a Victim so defenseless, so inoffensive--it did not need that they
   should gather together, "the whole band," and so we are told it as a
   remarkable circumstance which did not rise necessarily out of the
   narrative. It must have a meaning of its own, "They gathered unto Him
   the whole band of soldiers."

   I shall speak thus upon it. First, it would appear that the soldiers
   were unanimous in mocking their Prisoner. Secondly, so are men united
   in opposing Christ. And, thirdly, what shall we say of both the facts
   of which we are to speak tonight?

   I. First, then, it is clear that THE SOLDIERS WERE UNANIMOUS IN MOCKING
   THEIR PRISONER.

   Upon this, I remark, first, that men are very apt to go together when
   they go wrong. You notice, in a workshop, how the religion of Christ
   will be despised and how certain men will lead the way in uttering
   calumnies against it. And then the rest will follow. When men go
   astray, they are like a flock of sheep--one gets through the hedge and
   all the rest go after it. We have heard of one sheep leaping the
   parapet of a bridge into a river--and the whole flock went after it and
   all were destroyed. Men are such curious beings, not only the creatures
   of their own habits, but the imitators of other men's example! I know
   not how it is, but persons who, alone and apart, would seem to have
   some good inclinations, will shake them all off when they get into evil
   company. At home, they will talk reasonably, but, in the crowd, they
   speak madly. At home and alone, they are amenable to rebuke and
   conviction. But when they got with other men, they will not hear a word
   of it--they shut their ears to anything like good teaching--and they
   run greedily to do mischief. I do not, therefore, so much wonder that
   when our Lord was given over to the soldiers, they gathered together
   the whole band, for it is so usual for men to go together when they go
   wrong.

   Frequently, too, it will happen that there is not one man to bear his
   protest. Would you not have expected that, in a large band of soldiers,
   there would have been at least one man of noble spirit who would have
   said, "No, do not torture Him--He is about to die"? Would it have been
   at all amazing if one man had stood forward, and said, "This Man has
   done nothing amiss. Our governor has said that he finds no fault in
   Him. Why, therefore, do you set Him in that chair and robe Him, and bow
   the knee in mockery, and spit upon Him?" It would not have been very
   surprising if there had been among the Roman soldiers some one or two
   who had espoused Christ's cause, for, truth to tell, those valiant men,
   although they grew brutalized by living amidst scenes of blood, were
   capable of deeds of high virtue. One has but to read the old Roman
   story to stand amazed, sometimes, that such fair flowers of virtue and
   benevolence could grow on such a dunghill as the Roman State was then.
   Yet you see that not one out of the whole band of soldiers would say a
   word for Christ, or absent himself from the ring when their comrades
   mocked Him.

   Perhaps I address some men here who work together and who are in the
   habit of scoffing at the Cross of Christ. I hope that there is not a
   workshop in London without one man, at least, who will stand forward
   and defend his Master's cause. But if I speak to one to whom that
   thought has occurred and yet he has said, "I dare not! I would be,
   myself, the subject of so much persecution that I could not stand forth
   alone," now, listen, Sir, if a Caius, or a Fabius, or a Julius had
   stood forth alone to defend the Lord's cause, we would have had his
   name here! And if he had even suffered death for it, he would have been
   among the brightest of the martyr host! And you know not what honor you
   lose if you conceal your testimony. If you allow the whole drift of the
   talk to be infidel and atheistic and never put in your good word for
   Him whom you call Master and Lord, you dishonor yourself! But if you
   could have the courage and I hope that you may, to say, "He, of whom
   you speak thus ill, has saved my soul, snatched me from habits of vice
   and renewed my character"--if you could stand forward, and bear such
   testimony for Him--I know that it were a short road to Glory, honor and
   immortality! It is not likely that you would have to suffer as the
   martyrs did, but suppose that you did? The more of suffering, the
   brighter that ruby crown which would be set upon your head in the day
   of your Lord's appearing! I hope that Christian men are still made of
   that grand old stuff which defied the Roman emperors and made them
   weary of slaughter, for they could not mow down the crops of the Church
   as fast as they grew! The blood of the martyrs was the seed of the
   Church and the more copiously it was shed, the more the Church
   multiplied!

   But, once more, the number of those who thus mocked Christ made their
   conduct all the baser. When you, young fellow, get in with 50 more, and
   in the workshop you mock at some solitary Christian youth. When you,
   each one, have your jibe--when you give him what you call, "chaff,"
   which is sport to you, but cruel enough to be death to him--did it
   never occur to you that it was a most cowardly thing and altogether
   unworthy of you, that ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, should all set
   upon one? What if a man believes in religion? Has he not a right to do
   so if he likes? Some of you who talk so much about freedom are the
   biggest bullies in the world! You boast loudly of religious liberty,
   but to you it means liberty to be irreligious! Surely I have as much
   right to worship Christ as you have to despise Him--and if my

   views of religion should seem to you to be peculiar, yet, if peculiar,
   have I not as good reason to hold them as you have to reject them?

   I speak thus plainly because I know of many, many cases where, if men
   were men at all, they would cease to persecute Christians, seeing that
   they persecute one or two wherever they can if they, themselves, happen
   to be in the majority. Think of this lot of howling dogs around this
   one gentle Lamb of God, the Christ who had never even a hard word for
   them, whose mightiest weapon was silence and patience! Think of Him
   surrounded by all these men of war from their youth up, these Roman
   legionaries with their imperial eagles! It was a cruel shame. The more
   there were of them, the meaner it was of them thus, as a whole band, to
   gather together to mock the Savior.

   But I suppose that their number accounted for the excess to which they
   went. If there had only been two or three of them, they would not have
   thought of all the cruel things that they did to our Lord. To put an
   old cloak upon Him and to call Him the purpled Caesar is commonplace
   enough, but one cries, "Let us make a crown for Him," and they plait
   the thorns with cruel hands, piercing His temples with the sharp
   spines. Another says, "Fetch a scepter and put it in His hand. Set Him
   in that chair and let us bow before Him! Let us cry, 'Hail, King of the
   Jews!'" They would have stopped at that point had there not been so
   many of them. But, being so large a band, one coarse fellow must go
   still further and he spits into that blessed face!--

   "See how the patient Jesus stands, Insulted in His lowest case! Sinners
   ha ve bound the Almighty hands, And spit in their Creator's face." I
   hardly think that one, two, three, or even half-a-dozen, by themselves,
   could have been guilty of such detestable, loathsome conduct to Christ!
   But the whole band being together, they thought of fresh insults.

   Take heed of sinning in a crowd! Young man, abandon the idea that you
   may sin in a crowd! Beware of the notion that because many do it, it is
   less a guilt to any one of them. Remember that the broad way was always
   the wrong road and that it leads to destruction, none the less because
   many walk in it. "Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be
   unpunished." Though you finish up the day's work of sin with three
   cheers for your noble selves, you shall find yourselves arraigned, each
   one, before the Judgment Seat of God--each one to give account for the
   deeds done in his body according to what he has done, whether it is
   good or whether it is evil. Oh, the pitiful story, a whole company of
   soldiers united against Christ, with not one to quit the ranks and say,
   "No, comrades! Do not do this!" But all wallowing in their cruelty,
   like swine in the mire!

   II. That leads me to talk to you, secondly, about another point. As
   these soldiers were unanimous in mocking their illustrious Prisoner, SO
   ARE MEN UNITED IN OPPOSING CHRIST.

   Like these soldiers, many do not pass Christ by with neglect. I should
   have thought that many a brave man of that Roman legion would have
   said, "Pshaw! I shall not go to taunt the poor Jew who has been hunted
   down by the priests. Nobody gives Him a good word--even His own
   followers have fled from Him. I heard one of them declare that He did
   not know Him, though I knew that man was a liar, for I saw Him in the
   Garden with his Master. My comrades are going to the Praetorium to mock
   Him, but I shall not go. Such mirth is unworthy of a man, especially of
   a Roman." Instead thereof, they were all there! Curiosity fetched them
   up--they must all come to see this Man of whom they had heard so
   much--and an evil conscience made them bitter against Him, for, because
   they were evil, His being good was a protest against their wicked
   deeds.

   So they were all united against Him and they came up, every one of
   them, to show their scorn. It is a strange thing, but if Christ is
   fully preached, somehow men cannot be indifferent to Him. If they can
   get away and never hear of Him, they may be indifferent. But the true
   Gospel either offends men, or else it charms them. I believe that you
   may preach a certain sort of gospel, from the first of January to the
   end of December, and everybody will say, "Yes, that is very good, very,
   very good, perfectly harmless." Yes, a chip in the porridge, with no
   flavor in it. But if it is the real out-and-out Gospel of a Crucified
   Savior, there will be someone who will say, "Ah, that is what I need! I
   like that," but there will be others who will grind their teeth and
   say, "I will never hear that man again! I cannot bear his talk. I hate
   it."

   Do not be surprised when I say that, if I hear that So-and-So was very
   angry at one of my sermons. I state as my belief, "That man will go to
   Heaven. I have the hook in that fish and I shall yet catch him!" But
   when I hear people simply say, "Oh, yes, we heard the sermon!" and they
   make some trifling remark about it and go their way, nothing good comes

   of it. It is better that a man should be in a downright rage against
   Christ than be utterly indifferent to Him! And where He really comes so
   that men are obliged to see Him, they cannot long be indifferent. "That
   the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed," is one of the objects of
   His death.

   The Cross of Christ is the great detector of men. Fix it up and men
   straightway go to the right or to the left of it. It is the parter and
   divider of the ways. Jesus, Himself, said, "He that is not with Me is
   against Me; and he that gathers not with Me scatters abroad." Men
   cannot pass by utterly with neglect after once hearing the story of the
   Cross. They must gather up for Christ or against Him, and, alas, many
   of them do gather up to pour their scorn upon Him!

   Many ungodly men feel an inward contempt for Christ's claims. "No,"
   says one, "I have no such contempt for Christ." I would not wish to
   charge you wrongfully, but if you are not a believer in Him. If you
   have never accepted Him to be your Savior and your Lord, I venture to
   repeat the charge--you have an inward contempt for His claims, my
   Hearers. Whether you are Christians or not, you are the subjects of
   King Jesus. God has put you into His hands and you will have to stand
   before His Judgment Seat at the last. The Man, Christ Jesus, who died
   on Calvary and rose again, and went to Heaven, will judge every one of
   you at the Last Great Day--and He claims that you now should become His
   servants, and yield obedience to Him!

   Now, I know that you will say in your hearts, "We shall not do anything
   of the kind!" Just so, and have I not proved what I said? "The carnal
   mind is enmity against God," and that carnal mind may be in a man who
   always goes to Church, or to Chapel. If he has not been renewed, he
   does not believe in Christ as King and, as far as his heart is
   concerned, he mocks at the idea of his being a servant of Christ and
   Christ being Lord over him. In his very soul he thinks this to be a
   preposterous claim, that he should be obedient to Christ in everything.
   Besides, the mass of men do not seek to know what Christ's claims are.
   They are ignorant of His Royalty and Sovereignty--and it is in this way
   that their minds are filled with an indistinctly expressed, but still
   very powerful, contempt for Him.

   And so it happens, in the next place, that men invent different ways of
   showing their derision. It is very curious that you find very learned
   men opposed to Christ and they go to work, usually, by destructive
   criticism, trying to get rid of this part of the Bible and that. But an
   ignorant man cannot do that, so he says that he does not believe in the
   Bible at all. Here you find a rich man despising Christ, sneering at
   "the common people," as he calls Christ's followers, and there you see
   another man who is very poor, despising Christ by wishing to overthrow
   all the rules of His sacred Kingdom. Herod and Pilate hate one another
   till Christ comes--and then they join together in reviling Him.

   These Roman soldiers, having all come together, found employment in
   mocking Christ. First, some of them stripped Him. Oh, have I not seen
   men at it in these days, stripping Christ of His Deity, stripping Him
   of His Priesthood, stripping Him of His Sovereignty, stripping Him of
   His Righteousness, stripping Christ of everything that makes Him
   Christ? Is not that the way with many of the rich, the great and the
   "advanced" theologians of the present day? They show their hatred of
   Christ by stripping Him!

   There are others who go to work the other way--they put a scarlet robe
   on Him. I have seen them do it--put other men's garments upon Him, make
   Him out to be what He never was--travesty the Doctrines of Grace,
   caricature the Gospel and hold it all up to contempt, imputing to
   Christ the faults of all His followers and even laying at His door the
   sin of men who, like Judas, have betrayed Him! That is another method
   of showing enmity to Christ. Then we see all around us men who mock at
   Christ's Royalty. They crown Him with a crown of thorns by their harsh
   speeches against His people. By their persecutions of those who love
   Him, Christ is often crowned, again, with thorns. The husband has done
   it in his unkindness to his believing wife. Parents have done it in
   their objection to their children following Christ. The man or woman
   who has given the cold shoulder to a pious friend, has thus put another
   crown of thorns upon the Savior's head.

   And have we not seen them put the reed into His hand by representing
   Christ as being a mere myth and His Doctrine as a dream, a holy fancy,
   a proper thing to keep the people quiet, but with no matter of fact or
   truth in it? So they put into His hand the reed-scepter to mock Him and
   He regards it as mockery. And thus, around the Christ, today, I seem to
   see, with eyes closed, but by the vision of faith, a multitude kneeling
   before Him and pretending to worship Him-- hypocritical
   worshippers--those who even by their bedsides are hypocrites, repeating
   a form of prayer and yet never really praying! They are drawing near to
   Him with their lips, while their hearts are far from Him. Oh, how do
   sinners thus prove their unanimity of enmity to Christ! Even in their
   pretended worship, they do but show the opposition of their hearts to
   Him.

   Here and there, also, I see one coarser than other men who spits upon
   Jesus and smites Him. You cannot live long in London without hearing
   from men who are opposed to the Cross of Christ, expressions that
   disgust you. I have given up all idea, now, that we are living in a
   Christian country. Believers in England are a band of Christ's soldiers
   who are holding the fort against deadly odds! Ours is a heathen country
   with an admixture of Christian people and a smear, a varnish of
   pretended religion, but still a heathen country! And every now and then
   some outspoken heathen, by his awful profanity, makes us wish that we
   could not hear at all! This is how they spit on Christ. One does it
   very politely with a bow. Another comes forward and abuses both the
   Christ and His Cross. He has spat in His face and honestly lets us know
   where he stands. One will undermine the Truth of God--another brings
   the battering ram, in open day, to beat down the citadel--but they are
   so united together that, with one accord, the whole band of soldiers is
   gathered against Christ.

   Dear Friends, if men attacked any one Doctrine, you would find only one
   band of men opposing it, but when Christ, Himself, is the object of
   mockery, the whole band gathers round Him! If I preach some of the
   Doctrines of Calvinism, I shall find men who are fatalists, and
   necessitarians and the like, who will agree with me. But if I preach
   the whole Gospel of Christ, these very men who might have been my
   friends under one form of doctrine, will be my enemies against the
   whole of it! Only let Jesus appear, and Jews and Gentiles, rich and
   poor, learned and unlearned--until they are renewed by Grace--count His
   Cross to be a stumbling block and His Doctrine to be foolishness!

   Now notice that men who could mock Christ like this were capable of
   doing anything evil. If they could revile Christ, it was no wonder that
   they cast lots for His clothes just at His feet when He hung on the
   Cross. I am often astounded at things that I read about gamblers and
   what they have been known to do. It is 50 years ago since there was a
   story told by a policeman--and I do not doubt its truth--of two men at
   Hampstead who, having bet with one another all that they had, at last
   had a wager as to which should hang the other. And one of them did hang
   the other. The policeman came along just in time to save him and when
   the man was cut down, what do you think he said? Why, he said that he
   would have hung the other man, if he could, to win the bet!

   That was thought to be very extraordinary, but it is not so very long
   ago since, at the laying of the first stone of a chapel, a friend of
   mine stood behind two gentlemen from Newmarket and, when one whom I
   know stood up to pray over the first stone, these two made a bet about
   how long he would be praying! Men will do anything for a wager. That
   mischievous vice which is becoming so common, nowadays, leads to an
   extraordinary hardness of heart beyond anything else! And I cannot so
   much wonder that men who were brought up as these Roman soldiers were,
   were capable of mocking Christ and of anything else that was evil.

   III. I have finished when I have asked and answered this question, WHAT
   SHALL WE SAY OF BOTH THE FACTS WHEREOF WE HAVE SPOKEN TONIGHT?

   These cruel soldiers unanimously came together to see Christ as a
   prisoner and to put Him to extraordinary scorn-- yet out of this band
   Christ found witnesses. Their chief officer, "the centurion, and they
   that were with him," as they stood and saw Christ die, said, "Truly
   this was the Son of God." And some of these soldiers, being appointed
   to watch the tomb of Christ, came and declared that He had risen from
   the dead. They were fine witnesses, were they not? Men who were too
   rough to lie to help a sect. They came forward to bear testimony to the
   Christ. O God, if there are any here who have blasphemed You, who have
   cursed Christ to His face, who have persecuted Christ's people, save
   them, tonight, and make them witnesses of Your power to bless! When
   such a man gets saved, he is a good witness for Christ. He says, "I
   know what Christ can do, for He has changed my heart, He has appeared
   to me by the way and manifested Himself to me. And I know and am sure
   of that which I testify, that, verily, this is the Son of God."

   Next, learn another lesson. All this mockery should rebuke the
   backwardness among Christ's friends. When He was to be mocked, all the
   soldiers came up. Some of them were down in the canteen, but they left
   their wine and came up to mock Him. Some of the soldiers, perhaps, had
   furlough for that day, but they gave up their holiday to go to mock
   Christ. Now, then, Brothers and Sisters, if His enemies could gather
   together the whole band against Him, let us gather together the whole
   band for Him. Why, just look at some of you on the Lord's-Day! There
   are a few drops of rain that might spoil your best bonnets, or wet your
   new clothes, so you cannot go to Chapel. You would have gone to market,
   you know, rain or shine! How many there are who will not be able to
   come to the Prayer Meeting tomorrow night! One pleaded, some time ago,
   at the Prayer Meeting, "Lord, bless those that are at home on beds of
   sickness!" "Yes," said the preacher, "and, Lord, bless those that are
   at home on sofas of wellness!" There are plenty of that kind, who stay
   at home because

   they have not enough of the hearty spirit that ought to be in them to
   let the whole band gather together to confess Christ. Do you love Jesus
   Christ, my dear Sister? Then come and confess it! Do you love Jesus
   Christ, my Brother? Then out with your avowal of it! Do not try to go
   to Heaven behind the hedges. Get on the King's High Road and travel in
   broad daylight as a soldier of Christ should. Say--

   "I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,

   Or to defend His cause."

   Next, I think that these mockers chide the uninventiveness of many
   Christians. See how they brought out the old red cloak, plaited the
   crown of thorns and cried, "Put them on Him!" Then they brought the
   scepter of reed, saying, "Stick it in His hand and shout, 'Hail, King
   of the Jews!"' Then came the spitting and the smiting--they could not
   have made the mockery more complete. They soon rigged up all that
   mimicry of royalty. Come, then, Brothers and Sisters, let us be
   inventive in honoring Christ--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all."

   See, is there not some new plan to be tried, some method that you have
   not yet attempted by which you could make Jesus loved and honored in
   the soul of somebody, be it only a poor child, a servant girl, or the
   most humble man in the street? Surely, if enmity was so quick to deride
   Him, love ought to be equally alert and inventive to find out ways by
   which to honor Him!

   But, once more, all this mockery should excite our admiration of our
   patient Lord. Remember that as He sat there, flouted and made a jest
   of, He might with one glance of His eyes have flashed Hell into their
   souls and slain every one of them! Had He only opened those lips, He
   could have spoken thunderbolts that would have destroyed them at once!
   But He sat there and patiently bore it all. As a sheep before her
   shearers, He was dumb. He opened not His mouth because He was bearing
   all this to save you and to save me. Blessed Savior! Oh, come, let us
   worship and adore and love Him!

   The last lesson is, let us summon all our faculties to honor Christ
   tonight. Gather together the whole band, your memory of all His
   goodness, your judgment of all His greatness, all your hopes and all
   your fears--your quieted conscience, your soul at rest--come, and with
   the whole band of faculties that God has given you, from the highest to
   the lowest, bow down in grateful adoration before Him who bowed so low
   that He might lift us up to be with Him forever! Dear Hearers, are you
   trusting Christ? There is no other trust that will do for a soul for
   time and for eternity! On a dying bed, it must be none but Jesus--let
   it be none but Jesus on your bed, tonight, before you fall asleep. Do
   not dare to close your eyes till you have committed your soul into the
   keeping of Him who still holds out His hands, as He did upon the Cross,
   that He may receive you with open arms and save you with an everlasting
   salvation! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW27222-50.

   Our Lord was brought before the Roman governor, Pilate. He was anxious
   to let Jesus go, but he was a weak-minded man, easily swayed by the
   noisy cry of the people, prompted by the chief priests and elders.

   Verses 22, 23. Pilate said unto them, What shall I do, then, with Jesus
   which is called Christ? They all said unto him, Let Him be crucified.
   And the governor said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out
   the more, saying, Let Him be crucified. A blind, unreasoning hate had
   taken possession of the people. They gave no answer to Pilate's
   wondering enquiry, "Why, what evil has He done?" for He had done
   nothing amiss. But they only repeated the brutal demand, "Let Him be
   crucified! Let Him be crucified!" The world's hatred of Christ is shown
   in similar fashion today. He has done no evil, no one has suffered harm
   at His hands, all unite to pronounce Him innocent, and yet they
   practically say, "Away

   with Him! Crucify Him!"

   24. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
   tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
   multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just Person: see
   you to it. Ah, Pilate, you cannot rid yourself of responsibility by
   that farce! He who has power to prevent a wrong is guilty of the act if
   he permits others to do it, even though he does not actually commit it
   himself. If you are placed in positions of power and responsibility, do
   not dream that you can escape from guilt by merely allowing other
   people to do what you would not do yourself.

   25. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on
   our children. All the people willingly took upon themselves the guilt
   of the murder of our dear Lord--"His blood be on us, and on our
   children." This fearful imprecation must have been remembered by many
   when the soldiers of Titus spared neither age nor sex and the Jewish
   capital became the veritable Aceldama, the Field of Blood.

   26. Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
   Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified. Why scourge Him before
   delivering Him up to be crucified? Surely this was a superfluity of
   cruelty! The Roman scourging was something which I scarcely care to
   describe--it was one of the most terrible punishments to which anyone
   could be subjected--yet Pilate first scourged Jesus and then gave Him
   up to die by crucifixion.

   27. 28. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Common
   Hall, and gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers. And they
   stripped Him, and put on Him a scarlet robe. Some old soldier's coat
   that they found lying about, they cast upon Christ in imitation of the
   royal robes of Caesar or Herod.

   29-31. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
   His head, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee before
   Him, and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit upon
   Him, and took the reed, and smote Him on the head. And when they had
   mocked Him, they took the robe off from Him, and put His own raiment on
   Him, and led Him away to crucify Him. By that fact, though they did not
   intend it, our Lord was recognized in the street as the same Person who
   had been taken into the Praetorium by the soldiers. Had Jesus been
   brought forth in the scarlet robe, persons looking at Him might not
   have known Him to be the same Man who wore the garment woven from the
   top throughout--but in His own seamless raiment, they readily
   recognized the Nazarene.

   32. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
   him they compelled to bear His Cross. I wonder if He was a black man.
   There was a Simon in the early Church and it certainly was the lot of
   the Ethiopian to bear the Cross for many and many an age. This Simon
   was a stranger, anyway, and a foreigner--he was truly honored to be
   compelled to bear the Cross after Christ.

   33. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
   say, a place of a skull. From its shape. There appears to be to this
   day a hill, still in the form of a human skull, outside the gate of
   Jerusalem. When they came to that common place of execution, the Tyburn
   or Old Bailey of the city,

   34. They gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when He had
   tasted thereof, He would not drink. A stupefying draught was given to
   the condemned--that is the only mercy that there was about the whole
   thing. The Romans did give to the crucified a draught of myrrh to take
   away something of the agony of crucifixion, but our Lord came not to be
   stupefied--He came to suffer--therefore He would not take anything that
   would at all impair His faculties. He drank even to the dregs the
   bitter cup of grief and woe.

   35. And they crucified Him. Horrible scene, to see those blessed hands
   and feet pierced with nails, and fastened to the Cross!

   35. Andparted His garments, casting lots. Rattling the dice at the foot
   of the Cross! Gambling is the most hardening of all vices. I believe
   that crimes have been committed by persons under the influence of
   gambling, which never could have been committed by them in any other
   condition of mind--"They parted His garments, casting lots." See here,
   you gamblers! With Christ's blood bespattering them, these soldiers
   still dared to raffle for His robe.

   35, 36. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet,
   They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture did they cast
   lots. And sitting down they watched Him there. His enemies gloating
   their cruel eyes with the sight of His sufferings. His friends with
   many tears watching His amazing griefs. It is for us, tonight, with
   humble faith and grateful love, to mark the incidents connected with
   His painful death.

   37, 38. And set up over His head His accusation written, THIS IS JESUS
   THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were there two thieves crucified with Him,
   one on the right hand, and another on the left. Giving Him the place of
   honor, which means, in this case, the place of dishonor. He was the
   apex of that terrible triangle.

   39, 40. And they that passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads, and
   saying, You that destroys the Temple, and builds it in three days, save
   Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the Cross. This is
   the cry of the Socinians, today, "Come down from the Cross. Give up the
   atoning Sacrifice and we will be Christians." But, by rejecting His
   vicarious Atonement, they practically un-Christ the Christ, as those
   mockers at Golgotha did!

   41, 42. Likewise also the chiefpriests mocking Him, with the scribes
   and elders, said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the
   King of Israel, let Him now come down from the Cross, and we will
   believe Him. Just so. Get rid of a crucified Savior, then they will
   believe in Him! Atonement, Substitution, vicarious Sacrifice--this
   staggers them. They will have Christ if they can have Him without His
   Cross.

   43-46. He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now, if He will have Him:
   for He said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which were
   crucified with Him, cast the same in His teeth. Now from the sixth hour
   there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the
   ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama
   Sabachthani? that is to say, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
   Every word in this terrible cry from the Cross is emphatic! Every
   syllable cuts and pierces to the heart!

   47. Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This Man
   calls for Elijah. They knew better, yet they jested at the Savior's
   prayer

   48. And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge, It always seems
   to me very remarkable that the sponge, which is the very lowest form of
   animal life, should have been brought into contact with Christ, who is
   at the top of all life! In His death, the whole circle of creation was
   completed.

   48-50. And filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him
   to drink. The rest said, Let Him be, let us see whether Elijah will
   come to save Him. Jesus, when He had cried again with a load voice,
   yielded up the ghost. Christ's strength was not exhausted! His last
   Word was uttered, "with a loud voice," like the shout of a conquering
   warrior! He need not have died on account of any infirmity in Himself,
   but voluntarily, for your sake--for your sake and mine--He "yielded up
   the ghost." Blessed be His holy name!

Our Service For Christ Never Finished

   (No. 2334)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 19, 1889.

   "But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say
   unto him, by-and-by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to
   meat? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup,
   and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunk; and
   afterward you shall eat and drink? Does he thank that servant because
   he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. So likewise
   you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you,
   say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty
   to do." Luke 17:7-10.

   THESE words are not addressed to the general congregation. You notice
   that the chapter begins, "Then said He unto the disciples." Even they
   felt as if Christ's words were too heavy for them and so, when you get
   to the fifth verse, you read, "And the Apostles said unto the Lord,
   Increase our faith," as if only the very strongest of them were able to
   receive His teaching just then--He was describing such difficult duties
   and prescribing so peculiar a path. Mark you, He was not laying down
   the way of salvation, but pointing out a path of service for those who
   were already saved. We must be saved, first, and must serve afterwards.
   To hope to serve Christ so as to win salvation is a fallacy, a delusion
   of our proud hearts. But to be saved by His Grace as a matter of pure
   favor and then, afterwards, to serve Him, having gratitude for our
   great motive, is the right order and a very different thing from
   self-righteousness. It is to disciples, then, that the words about
   which I speak, tonight, are addressed.

   We must not start back at the sight of the service which is required of
   us. It is our highest honor that we are allowed to be the servants of
   our Savior and, being servants, unless we are so only nominally, and
   not really, we must not be offended at anything that is demanded of us.
   We must try to fill up the word, "servant," and show the world what a
   servant can be! It is the duty of every Christian to turn each common
   silver word into a golden one. Whatever "husband," or "father," or
   "son," may mean in reference to ordinary society, it must mean
   something more when it gets into the Church of God! We must fulfill it,
   we must fill it full! We must make something more of it than it used to
   be. So with regard to servants, if we are servants of Christ, let us be
   servants, as the mathematicians say, "to the nth degree"--to the very
   highest possible degree! Let us elevate and enlarge our calling till,
   if men want to know what a servant is, they will only have to ask
   Christ, our Master, and He will point to us and say, "These are the
   kind of servants that My love and My Grace can produce. Money could not
   buy such and no rate of wages could secure such service as they are
   prepared to freely render."

   With those two thoughts on your minds, that, being saved, you are
   servants, and being servants, it is your intense desire to make that
   word mean all it possibly can mean, follow me while I try to bring out
   the teaching of the passage before us.

   I. First, WE ARE, ADMITTEDLY, THE SERVANTS OF CHRIST.

   If the word, doulos, is interpreted here, "slave," as it certainly
   might be, we are quite willing to be known as the bond-slaves of Jesus
   Christ. Like Paul, we have no objection, even, to be branded with the
   mark of a slave, and with him we dare to say, "From henceforth let no
   man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."

   We are the servants, the slaves of Christ, and we rejoice to be so
   because in this lies our deliverance from the bondage of sin. No man
   can really be his own master--he will serve either one lord or another.
   We are such dependent creatures that we must give ourselves up to be
   either the servants of sin, or the servants of righteousness. We were
   once the servants of sin. We were "children of wrath, even as others."
   We found ourselves born into hereditary bondage which we also freely
   chose, for the iron entered into our will and our will chose the
   bondage of evil passions and corrupt desires. One way or another,
   though each of us differently, we resolved to be the servants and the
   serfs of the Prince of Darkness, that Evil One who still rules over the
   children of disobedience! Now that we have become the servants of
   Christ, we are freed from the bondage of sin--His service is our
   freedom! There was no other method of setting us free from the bondage
   of the black prince than that of bringing us under a Divine and blessed
   servitude to Immanuel, the Prince of Holiness and Peace. We therefore
   rejoice in being His servants because it means deliverance from an
   older servitude, even the service of sin and Satan!

   Our being Christ's servants is the absolute result of redemption. We
   are bought with a price--therefore we are not our own. Standing on
   Calvary and gazing with wonder at those purple founts from which flow
   our salvation and eternal life, we feel that, "if One died for all,
   then all died," and that, inasmuch as Jesus Christ there bought us with
   His precious blood, we are His inalienable property and belong to
   Him--body, soul and spirit--forever. Such a price, paid by such an One,
   in the midst of such circumstances of shame and derision, binds us as
   His forever and ever! We do not want to be our own--our purchase by
   Christ is our delight and we willingly yield ourselves up to Him who
   has paid for us a price infinitely more than we could ever be conceived
   to be worth! Hence our service is founded upon our deliverance from the
   bondage of sin and it is also the direct result of our redemption by
   the blood of Christ.

   Moreover, as you sang just now, you helped me to another point--we are
   Christ's by our own pledge. You remember your declaration--

   " 'Tis done! The great transaction's done; I am my Lord's and He is
   mine."

   You added to that the further resolve--

   "High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily
   hear-- Till in life's latest hour I bow, And bless in death a bond so
   dear." If we were not Christ's, tonight, we would not rest an hour
   until we were! We wish to be His, we wish to be perfectly His--our
   prayer is that every thought may be brought into captivity to Him. Our
   soul pines after the perfect liberty of complete subjection to the will
   of God in Christ Jesus! Is it not so, Brothers and Sisters? Have you
   not lifted your hand to Heaven so that you cannot go back? And what is
   more, has not every desire to go back ceased out of your heart? If you
   had been mindful of the place from where you came out, you might have
   had abundant opportunity to return--but you desire something
   beyond--your motto is, "Onward, upward, homeward, heavenward." You want
   to get away from the place from where you came. You belong to Christ!
   You confess the impeachment, tonight, wondering much that you should
   have the joy of daring to feel that you belong to Christ! Have you any
   sweeter hymn in the whole repertoire of your heart than this--

   "Oh! I am my Beloved's, And my Belo ved's mine"?

   Do you not sing that in your happiest moments, in the quiet of your
   spirit? If so, then you are admittedly the servant of Christ.

   We regard this service as a great gift of the Free Grace of God. We
   look back to the eternal counsels and we see the Father choosing us in
   Christ Jesus--and giving us to His dear Son before the foundation of
   the world! We see our Lord Jesus undertaking, on our behalf, to present
   us faultless to the Father in the day of His appearing--and it is a
   great delight to us to feel that it is because God willed it that we
   are now the property of Christ. God decreed it. God laid plans for it.
   It was in the purpose and Covenant of unchangeable Grace that we should
   belong to Christ. In this we rejoice, not as a bondage imposed, but as
   a Grace given! Oh, what would we not have given, years ago, when first
   we were awakened, if we could have even hoped that we belonged to
   Christ? And now that we know that we are His, and none other's, and
   that He will keep us to the end--it is the highest delight of our
   spirit! Do not think, dear Friends, any of you, that we consider
   ourselves demeaned by submitting to a very slavery to Christ! We wish
   to make the bondage as tight as it can possibly be--we desire not to
   have any will, or any wish, or even any imagination that would go
   flying over the Divine boundaries of God's will! We would be wholly
   His--that is our honor, our crown--God's best gift to us!

   More than that, we find that the service of Christ is its own reward.
   What if He never smiled on me? If He would let me serve Him, I would
   count the fact of service to be a smile! If He should drive me from His
   Presence, if He would only let me glorify Him, I would be satisfied to
   make that my Heaven! To be completely given up to live for God and to
   glorify Christ--what larger happiness could a redeemed creature desire?
   There is reward enough to us in being permitted to unloose the laces of
   His shoes, or to be engaged in His farm-work, as the text says,
   plowing, or feeding cattle, so long as it is but done for Him!

   Besides, there is a rich reward in store for the righteous and we may
   look for it. We remember how Moses "had respect unto the recompense of
   the reward" and, without being mercenary, we may anticipate our reward.
   God will not let His people work for nothing and though the reward is
   not of debt, but of Grace, yet verily there is a reward for the
   righteous! In that day when Christ shall come in the Glory of His
   Father, He will award to His saints their several crowns. To those who
   have been faithful, He will give according to the measure of their
   faithfulness. "You have been faithful over a few things, I will make
   you ruler over many things." We count it a high honor not to be in the
   civil service, but to be in the Divine service! How ardently some young
   men are looking forward for a place, "under government." That is
   exactly what I have--it is just what every child of God has--a place
   under Divine Government! We do not wish for anything better than this.
   O you glorified saints, if we may but come among your thrones, or even
   lie at your feet, we will make no choice, so that we may but see our
   Lord's face and, meanwhile, if it shall be our lot to do the
   dishwasher's work in Christ's kitchen, we will count it most honorable
   employment--and we will do it as unto Him.

   This servitude to Christ is to us unutterable freedom. We are never
   free till Christ binds us. Here I stand, tonight, He has bound my heart
   and fastened it to Himself! He has bound my hands and they must serve
   Him! He has bound my feet and they must run in the way of His commands.
   He has bound my tongue, too. It sometimes speaks amiss, but yet it
   longs to speak only and wholly for Him. My Master, tie my eyes and my
   eyelids, too, and bind every filament of my nature, every nerve, and
   every muscle of my body, and every hair of my head--and let me be
   wholly Yours--in absolute bondage unto You and then shall I cry, "O
   God, truly I am Your servant! I am Your servant, You have loosed my
   bonds!" We never have our bonds loosed until, like the Psalmist, we can
   twice over mark the absolute servitude to Himself into which Christ has
   brought us.

   That is my first remark on the text and there is much in it--we are,
   admittedly, the servants of Christ.

   II. Secondly, OUR SERVICE IS NOT FINISHED--"Which of you, having a
   servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him, by-and-by, when
   he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"

   Observe, first, that our service may have been long and arduous. We may
   have been plowing. I speak to some here who have had a very hard bit of
   plowing--instead of breaking the soil, you have, sometimes, thought
   that you would break the plow and many a time the bullocks,
   unaccustomed to the yoke, have been very difficult to drive--and some
   of them that are accustomed to the yoke have taken to kicking every now
   and then. You have not found plowing to be playing! I am sure no
   plowman ever does. He finds that it is tough work. He earns his living
   well who earns it by his plowing and, if some of the gentlemen in
   London who quarrel with their wages, had to do a plowman's work, and to
   get a plowman's wages, I guarantee you that they would think themselves
   better off at the work they have to do now! A good day's plowing is
   about as hard a day's toil as a man can have.

   Well, some of us have been plowing, for the Master has given us
   difficulties. He has given us trials, He has given us cares and we have
   also had to feed cattle. I cannot say that I have been literally
   feeding cattle but I have found it more trouble to feed some of you
   than I should have had in feeding cattle! I had an old friend who was
   40 years a shepherd and he lived to be 80 years old. During the last 40
   years of his life he was a minister and he said, one day, "I have had
   two flocks. The first 40 years I fed sheep and the second 40 years I
   fed men--and the second flock was a deal more sheepish than the first."
   I can vouch for the latter part--not that all of you are like sheep,
   for there are some of you who are easily fed--but there are others who
   are not. I remember a young man who left the Church because he said
   that I never gave him a bit of bone on which he could try his teeth.
   Well, now, I thought that if I took out the bone and gave meat, alone,
   I was doing the best thing possible. But this foolish youth wanted a
   bit of gristle, not that he could digest it, but he wanted something
   that he could not digest. I could have given him plenty of that sort of
   stuff--I had no end of it at home--but I save that for my dogs and
   bring the meat for the people I have to feed.

   You can never please everybody and there are some people who are like
   those described in Psalm Sixty-Seven. I think that David said that they
   were fools, but I will not say that. And further he says of them,
   "Their soul abhors all manner of meat." There was no feeding them! I
   would rather feed cattle than feed them. Cattle will eat what you give
   them, as a general rule, but we have some in our congregations, dear
   souls, that are afraid to feed on the promises of God, afraid to feed,
   even, on the Bread of Life. They are not worthy, they say, which is
   quite true--but then we are not fed according to our worthiness in the
   Covenant of Grace! This feeding of cattle, this feeding of men, is not
   the easiest thing in the world.

   The text also teaches that our service may change its form. Some of you
   have been at Sunday School work. Others of you have been at slum work.
   Some have been visiting the lodging houses--others have stood in the
   streets and preached for Christ. You have had a good long day of
   plowing and feeding cattle, but your work is not done. Oh, by no means!
   When the man mentioned by our Lord had been out all day in the field
   and then came home, he had just to tidy himself up and do a little
   domestic service, for, in the East, the manservant, after plowing in
   the field, had to gird his loins and prepare his master's dinner--and
   serve at the table waiting upon his lord. Well, now, dear Friends,
   after a good long day's work you shall have a change of occupation, but
   you shall still go on working! You have not finished your service yet.
   Have you had 40 years of it? Well, that is a long day, but you have not
   done work yet--there is something else for you to do! If you cannot go
   out plowing, you shall go down into the kitchen and do some cooking!
   And if you cannot feed the cattle, you shall bring up a dish of food
   for your master. This is a change of work for you, but you are to keep
   on as long as you live.

   I said, one Sabbath morning, that I feared I might not be able to keep
   on preaching, meaning that I feared that I should soon be laid aside by
   illness, which I hope may not now occur--and somebody said that I was
   not going to preach anymore, I was going to retire. I shall "retire"
   when four men carry me on their shoulders to the grave, but not till
   then, by God's Grace! As long as there is breath in our body and we are
   able to say a word for Christ, we certainly shall not give up our
   service! Nor will any of you, I hope, ever talk about retiring from
   your Master's work. If any of you young men ever think of doing so, I
   beg you to remember what came to Jonah when he "retired" from his
   Master's business-- and whales are scarcer, now, than they were then!
   You had better go down to Nineveh and work away in your Master's
   service as long as you have health and strength. There may be change of
   service, but no retiring from service!

   Next, the servant came to service which required greater care. When he
   was only plowing, or feeding cattle, he could do that in a rough way,
   with unwashed hands. But now that he has to wait on his master, do you
   not see how he smartens himself up, how he has washed his hands and
   face? He would not be properly waiting on his master if he had any
   filth on his clothes or on the plates. And he attends to this service
   with all his wits about him--he does not fall asleep over it. If the
   Lord calls you to be His body-servant, to wait upon Him in close
   attendance and high communion with Him--if He gives you more to do with
   the souls of men, more to do with the Church of God, as He may do,
   promoting you to higher service--yet remember that you are still a
   servant and you are to prove that you are still a servant by working
   with greater care, with more of the spirit of a servant than you ever
   had before.

   Dear Friends, is it not a mercy for us that our service is not ended?
   Why should it be finished? Our dependence upon our Master is not ended.
   We burn His candles, so we ought to do His work. Every morning's
   breakfast and every day's meals are His gifts to us--and the clothes on
   our back are from Him--should we not, then, continue to serve Him? When
   you can do without Christ, He can do without you. But that will not be,
   "by-and-by." You are always depending upon His daily bounty, therefore
   be thankful that your service is not ended.

   And remember this, also--it is a blessed thing that our service is not
   ended because it shows that the Lord still has pleasure in His servant.
   There is a prayer put into verse, that you and I may constantly offer--

   "Dismiss me not Your service, Lord!" Suppose that He had dismissed us
   and said, "Go and sit down to meat, I do not need you anymore. I have
   no poor child for you to nurse, I have not even anymore cattle for you
   to feed--there is not even a lamb among My flock for you to carry in
   your bosom"? That would show that He did not love us with the love of
   complacency, or take such delight in us as He once did. But as long as
   He gives us something to do, we will gratefully do it, because we will
   take it as a token of His continual delight in us and, therefore,
   delighting in us, He gives us something to do for Him. That is my
   second point--our service is not ended.

   III. And next, WE DO NOT WISH TO BE TREATED AS IF IT WERE--"Which of
   you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him,
   by-and-by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"

   That would show that his service was ended. But we do not wish our
   Master to treat us so. I mean this--we do not expect freedom from
   trial. Do you? We read of Abraham as being sorely tried and wonderfully
   prevailing. And then we come upon this text, "And it came to pass after
   these things, that God did tempt (that is, try, or test) Abraham." Yes,
   and after all your years of service, after you have been honored in
   bringing souls to Christ, you will have to still be tried. He will not
   say, "Go and sit down to meat," but He will bid you gird yourselves and
   come and serve Him.

   Also, dear Friends, we are not to expect honor here. After many years
   of preaching the Gospel, one might be tempted to say to himself, "I
   have a name and some esteem among men. I must take care of them." That
   is a temptation from Satan--throw it all away. Serve your Lord and care
   nothing about your honor, or your reputation, for it is not for Him to
   say to you, "Go and sit down to meat." If He still calls you to do some
   service for Him in the defense or proclamation of His Truth, do not ask
   Him to treat you otherwise.

   Then, we are not to think that we cannot do anymore. Do I speak to any
   Christian who has come in here, tonight, saying, "I really think that I
   must give up this service and give up that"? Do no such thing, I pray
   you! Hold on to it as for dear life. Your engagement to your Master is
   not a five years' service, like that of a soldier, but you are His for
   life. Yours is a lifelong bondage to Him, a happy apprenticeship to
   your Lord and Master throughout the whole term of your natural--no, of
   your spiritual life! Say not that you can do no more--there is much yet
   remaining for you to do! Pick up a new thread and begin to spin, and He
   will find you more. Take up a bit of iron you have never tried to
   fashion, put it in the fire, and see whether you cannot make some fresh
   instrument there. Give yourself up continually to serve your Lord yet
   more and more, and think not that your work is finished.

   And, Beloved, we must not be beginning to look for our reward here. If
   you think to have Heaven this side the Jordan, you are greatly
   mistaken. Heaven is to be hereafter, but Heaven is not, "by-and-by."
   This is the place for fighting--out with your sword! This is the field
   for labor--get you to your plow! If such a wish could come to you in
   Heaven, you might desire to get back, again, to the service of earth,
   that you might do still more for your Lord. When I get to Heaven and
   you get to Heaven, if we know that false doctrine is spreading in the
   world, we shall long to go back and confront the adversary, again, if
   such wishes are permitted in Heaven. While souls are perishing for lack
   of knowledge, let none of us want to be away from the earth--so long as
   men need us to tell them the way of salvation, let us gladly continue
   at our work--let us serve God, my Brothers and Sisters, while we have
   the opportunity--

   "In works which perfect saints above And holy angels cannot do."

   Now is our time for preaching! Now is your time for teaching the
   children! Brothers, seven heavens could not find us another pulpit when
   once we get to Glory--we might almost wish that they could. What
   opportunities of praying with the sick and instructing ignorant
   children you now have! You will not have them when once you are in the
   other world. Therefore use the golden hours you have while you are here
   below. Your service is not finished, so do not wish to be treated as
   though it were. Ask not honor from men. Ask not even for honor from
   God, if that were meant to exempt you from further shame, from further
   suffering, from further reproach for Christ's dear sake. The further we
   go in His service, the more resolved we are to give up everything for
   Him. When we first started, we may have thought of making some reserve,
   but now we have gone so far into the river of consecration that we find
   "waters to swim in" and we can truly say--

   "Yet if I might make some reserve, And duty did not call, I'd love my
   God with zeal so great That I should give Him all." May you not only
   sing it, but may you mean it and practice it, for Christ's sake!

   IV. Now we go a step further. WE ARE ALWAYS TO PUT OUR MASTER FIRST. We
   are servants and our work

   is not done--neither ought we to wish to be treated as though it were.
   We are not ourselves to sit down to meat, but we are to hear our Master
   say, "Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve Me,
   till I have eaten and drunk; and afterward you shall eat and drink." I
   will very hurriedly mention these points.

   First, we are to prefer service to rest. Service is feeding our
   Master--rest is refreshing ourselves. If we may have a choice, we must
   always choose that which will be for His Glory. If it is necessary to
   rest for His Glory, rest. But if you can better serve Him by continued
   activity--even unto death--select the service.

   Next, we must put His pleasure before our own. I must not want what
   will please me, but what will please Him. It ought always to please us
   to have the opportunity of pleasing Him. Did not Abraham run unto the
   herd, to fetch a calf, tender and good, that he might feed the blessed
   ones when, under the tree, they came to favor him with a visit? What an
   honor is put upon us when we are permitted to feed Christ and to wait
   upon Him till He has eaten and drunk! I can hardly conceive of myself
   as having the high honor, on bended knee, of waiting on my Lord. If He
   would but once come to my house, what would I not do for Him? So have I
   often said, yet the whole of our life should be an entertainment of
   Christ, our blessed Prince. We should always be seeking to gratify Him,
   to give Him to drink that which He thirsts for in the salvation of the
   souls of men--and to give Him to eat of that which He delights in,
   namely, the holiness and consecration of His people. His pleasure is to
   be put before our pleasure.

   And, next, His people are to be preferred before ourselves. His people
   are His body--therefore think more of His body than of your own body.
   Let the poor saints be very near your heart--let the man in whom you
   see anything of Christ be loved because of your Lord's likeness which
   you see in him. Always put Christ's people before yourself.

   And put His name before your own name. I want you to dwell upon that.
   There is always a tendency among us to want to keep up our own
   respectability and, if we are ministers, to keep up our own name. The
   temptation has come to men who have been eminently useful to found a
   denomination for the preservation of their name. George Whitefield was
   saved from that--when some people wanted him to set up a new sect to be
   called by his name, he said--"No, let my name perish, but let Christ's
   name stand forever." So say I, let sect go, and let my name go, and let
   everything go--but let Christ and His Truth be preserved! Make no
   reckoning between a grain of Christ's Glory and a ton of your own.
   Always think that everything you have has already gone and that you,
   yourself, have gone, a living sacrifice, wholly given up to your Lord.
   If you must be made as the offscouring of all things, as the rubbish on
   the dunghill, so let it be, so that Christ Jesus may be glorious and
   every particle of His Truth may be set on high in the hearts of men!

   This is the meaning of the text here--you are not to sit down to meat
   as yet. You are to gird yourself and serve your Lord and your eating
   and your drinking shall be glorious, indeed, "by-and-by." This same
   Gospel has a phrase in it which has often staggered me. I mean that
   passage where Christ says that He will gird Himself and come forth and
   serve His servants who girded themselves to serve Him. The high reward
   reserved for you ought to brace you up to the most arduous service as
   long as you live! God help you to render such service for Christ's
   sake!

   V. I close with this remark, WE ARE TO TAKE OUR PLACE LOW DOWN. Read
   the latter part of the text-- "Does he thank that servant because he
   did the things that were commanded him? I think not." I feel inclined
   to laugh as I read this verse, "Does he thank that servant?" Only
   imagine the Lord Jesus Christ thanking you or thanking me for anything
   that we might do, even if we did all that He commanded us! For Him to
   thank us for what we do, even if we did all we ought, seems utterly
   absurd!

   And then, how could He thank us for what we have not done, for we have
   not done the things which were commanded us? We have left many of them
   undone and we have done the things we ought not to have done. What
   thanks do we deserve? None, I think. Then, besides, dear Friends, if we
   had done all, Christ's thanks, if they were given to us, would be for
   so little service compared with His due. We are, at our best,
   unprofitable servants. Think of what He has done for us and do not set,
   side by side with that, anything that we have ever done for Him who
   loved us to the life and to the death--who loved us eternally and
   infinitely. What have we done for Him compared with what He has done
   for us? Our service put beside Christ's is like one single grain of
   dust put in comparison with the mighty orb of the sun! There is but
   poor comparison there, but there is no comparison at all between the
   little we do for Christ and the great, the immeasurable service that He
   has rendered to us! Truly, we are unprofitable servants to Him.

   And then, Beloved, whatever we have done has all been done in us by
   Him. Whatever fruit we have, Christ can say to us, "From Me is your
   fruit found." If there is any virtue, if there is any praise, if there
   is any love, if there is any faith, if there is any zeal, if there is
   any holiness--was it not all given to us? Are we not all the greater
   debtors to God, the more we have done? What have we ever profited Him?
   Growing saints think themselves nothing. Full-grown saints think
   themselves less than nothing! You may guess your real weight by the
   depths to which you sink in self-abasement. You

   may estimate your true value in the market of Heaven by the low
   estimate you put upon yourself. May the Lord give us, therefore, to be
   His willing, ardent, earnest servants!

   Oh, never let us have a single lofty thought as to the service that we
   have rendered, because, you know, if we once begin to think that we are
   very fine servants, we shall not like to do some of the work which He
   puts upon us. We shall be too proud for that service and there is many
   a servant of God who is too tall, too big for his place and, therefore,
   he is not likely to do much for his Master. There is much to be done
   that flesh and blood will not do, especially in dealing with some of
   the Lord's people who are ill-mannered and foolish. But we must learn
   to clean the saucepans, to do the drudge's work, the servile work, if
   we are to be true servants for Christ. We must even select that sort of
   service and prefer it, if we would be like our Master and desire to
   take the highest place in the ranks of the Believers. "These are hard
   things," you say. They are, to flesh and blood, but the Lord can give
   us of His Spirit that we may conquer flesh and blood.

   Do any of you here say, "I am no servant of Christ and I do not want to
   be one"? The day will come when you would give your eyes to be His
   servants, even though you had to serve Him in the dark throughout your
   life! I would sooner be the Lord's dog than the devil's darling! It is
   better to have the lowest place in Christ's house than to have the
   highest place in the tents of wickedness. If any here are unconverted,
   I can tell them that the sorrows of Christ are better than the
   pleasures of sin. Christ's blacks are whiter than your whitest things.
   Christ's servitude is more heavenly than the world's heaven. A blow
   from Christ is better than a kiss from the lips of sin. Oh, if you had
   but one glance, if you could even have but a glimpse at the Glory that
   Jesus has, you would come to Him and beg Him, first, to save you, and
   then to let you serve Him, for it is better to serve Christ in the
   meanest capacity than to be the Czar of all the Russias, or even
   empress of the whole world!

   God give me but to have a place where, washed in His blood, I may wear
   the white garments of an everlasting servitude to Him and He shall have
   the praise for it, world without end! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE171-10.

   Verse 1. Then said He unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
   offenses will come. We are so strangely made that even good men do not
   always agree and there are so many bad men about that they will cast a
   stumbling block in our way if they can.

   1,2. But woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him
   that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea,
   than that he should offend one of these little ones. To do grievous
   damage to the soul of the very least of Christ's people is a great and
   ruinous sin--nothing can be worse. God grant that we may not do this
   even inadvertently! Let not the strong indulge in that which would be
   unsafe for the weak, lest the weak be led into sin through that which
   the strong Brother might find lawful, but which certainly would not be
   expedient. May none of us ever willfully grieve any child of God!

   3. Take heed to yourselves: If your brother trespass against you,
   rebuke him; and if he repents. You shall not believe in His penitence?
   "No, surely," you say, "that is incorrect." Yes, it is incorrect, but
   that is what many of you do. I was only reading as things generally
   are--but that is not Christ's direction.

   3. 4. Forgive Him. And if He trespass against you seven times in a day.
   That is seven times too often.

   4. And seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent; you
   shall forgive him. Do you say, "That is too many times in a day to
   forgive him"? Let me ask--"How many times in a day have you sinned? How
   many times in a day does God forgive you?" Ah, the seven times a day
   that you have to forgive your brother are but a small number compared
   with the innumerable forgivenesses granted to you by our ever-gracious
   God.

   5. And the Apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. For this
   kind of patient forgiving seemed too much for them, unless they had a
   larger stock of faith and, therein, they were right. Strength of faith
   gives strength of love and strength of love makes forgiveness easy.

   6. And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you
   might say unto this sycamore tree, Be you plucked up by the root, and
   be you planted in the sea; and it should obey you. Now, if faith as a
   grain of mustard seed can do this, what cannot strong faith do? What a
   mercy it is for us that there is so much power in such little faith! A
   very small piece

   of dynamite can work great wonders. And within the tiniest morsel of
   faith--if it is no bigger than a grain of mustard seed--there lies
   concealed almost Omnipotent force! Why do we not exercise that faith
   more? Nothing is impossible to him that believes. We could blast the
   very strongholds of Satan with this powerful powder if we would but try
   it!

   7, 8. But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
   will say unto him, by-and-by, when he is come from the field, Go and
   sit down to meat? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready
   wherewith I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten
   and drunk; and afterward you shall eat and drink? See, Brothers and
   Sisters, our position as Be-lievers--we are here as servants. It is not
   yet the time for feasting. Whatever work we have done, even if it is
   getting towards the evening of our life's day, we must not think of
   sitting down and expecting our Master to wait upon us. No, we must go
   on with our service and reckon it to be our highest privilege, still,
   to gird ourselves and wait on Him. This is not the place of resting or
   of feasting--this is the day of our holy servitude. Let us work on,
   plowing while we have strength for it, and when the sun goes down at
   eventide, then waiting, like servants, at the table of their lord.

   9. Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were
   commanded him? I think not. Do you take off your hat to your servants
   and say, "I am very grateful to you for doing your duty"? Not so. And
   even he who serves God best, may he expect honor as his due? Ah, no--he
   shall have honor because of the Grace of his Master--but it is not his
   place to look for it, much less is it right for him to expect it as his
   due.

   10. So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which
   are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that
   which was our duty to do. And who shall praise us for that? The most
   self-denying servant of the Savior, the most ardent laborer for the
   Lord will expect nothing of God except to be blessed by His abounding
   Grace! What can we deserve of the dear hands of Him who bought us with
   His blood? Are we not the bondservants of Christ? "You are not your
   own; you are bought with a price." Therefore, whatever service you can
   render is due to Him! And unto Him let it be freely given without one
   thought of self-praise or pride because it is done so well.

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 22, 1889.

   "In the shadow of Your wings will I make my refuge." Psalm 57:1.

   "Cast your burden upon the LORD, and He shall sustain you." Psalm
   55:22.

   "Let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God." Isaiah
   50:10.

   IT is the preacher's business to endeavor to make plain to the people
   the meaning of the word, FAITH. Inasmuch as salvation comes by
   believing, it is most important that men should know what believing
   is--and though we have to preach upon many topics and take the whole
   range of the Word of God--yet it often behooves the minister of Christ
   to dwell especially upon the way whereby men are saved and to explain
   what is that step by which they enter into eternal life. You may think
   that it is very easy to explain faith and so it is, but it is still
   easier to confuse people with your explanation. There is nothing
   simpler in the world than to believe in Christ Jesus, yet probably
   there is nothing more difficult than to explain to a man what it is to
   believe in the Lord Jesus--not that the thing, itself, is difficult,
   but the explaining of it is not so easy.

   You remember the story, perhaps, of Mr. Thomas Scott, a very excellent
   commentator, who brought out an edition of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's
   Progress, to which he had written very excellent and, I think that I
   must add, very dull notes. On going round his parish, he called on an
   aged person and found her studying the book. "Well, my good woman,"
   said he, "I see that you are reading Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress."
   "Yes, Sir," she replied, "I always enjoy that book." "And, pray, do you
   understand it?" "Yes, Sir, I understand it very well and I think that,
   by the Grace of God, I shall one day understand your explanation of
   it"--which was not very complimentary to Mr. Scott! So, I have no doubt
   that there are many who better understand what faith is without our
   explanations. It is so easy to darken counsel by words without
   knowledge and to give illustrations which, themselves, need to be
   illustrated, and definitions which need to be defined. I am afraid of
   doing that, tonight--I see my difficulty and I cry to God to help me to
   put faith very plainly before every sinner here--that you may all know
   what it is and may at once exercise it.

   I have met with a large number of persons who have believed in Christ
   who were accustomed to hear the Gospel preached and to have faith
   explained to them, but in almost every case they have told me that they
   did not know what faith was till they, themselves, believed and,
   although they were told a hundred times over that it was simply
   trusting in Christ, they still did not get a hold of the right
   idea--they still entertained the thought that there was something to be
   felt, something to be done, something to be endured, something or other
   more than the simple casting of themselves upon Christ for eternal
   salvation! I have also noticed how, when I have tried to use
   illustrations, the friend to whom I have spoken has not been affected
   by them and has not understood my illustrations.

   Speaking to a young man, once, I quoted to him that verse of Dr. Watts
   which begins--

   "A guilty, weak and helpless worm, On Your kind arms I fall."

   "But," he said, "I cannot fall." "Oh, my dear Friend," I replied, you
   do not catch the idea at all, because it is not a thing that a man can
   do. He falls because he cannot help it--there is no effort in falling,
   it is cessation from effort." Still,

   though I put it, as I thought, so that he ought to understand it, he
   did not comprehend it. It was sometime later when the Holy Spirit
   revealed it to him, that he came to understand what faith was. Perhaps
   you ask, "Are we such dolts that we do not even understand plain Saxon
   language when it has to do with spiritual things?" Ah, my Hearers, sin
   has made fools of us! Sin has so befooled us that even God's Word,
   itself, does not convey God's meaning to our stupid minds until the
   Spirit of God comes and teaches our reason, reason--and takes the film
   from our eyes and helps us to see what is, in itself, plain as a
   pikestaff--but is not plain to us by reason of our sinful and corrupt
   nature! Before I try, then, to preach about what faith is, may I ask
   you to pray the Holy Spirit to come and open men's eyes, that they may
   see what faith is? For truly, as we know not what we should pray for as
   we ought, we know not how to believe as we ought! And we make mistakes
   on this simplest of all subjects until the Holy Spirit sets us right.
   Divine Spirit, we believe in You, but we do not believe in ourselves!
   We see, in some measure, how stupid, how ignorant we are. Come, we pray
   You, and teach us even the first lesson of the Doctrines of Christ,
   teach us to believe in Jesus!

   If you want to cut a diamond, you must cut it with a diamond--so, if
   you want to explain Scripture, you must explain it with Scripture. I
   thought, therefore, that I would take three expressions from the Old
   Testament which may help to set forth what faith really is.

   I. The first expression you will find in the 57th Psalm, and the first
   verse. It shows that faith is HIDING IN God-- "Be merciful unto me, O
   God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusts in You: yes, in the shadow
   of Your wings will I make my refuge."

   See then, trusting in God, that is, faith, is the same thing as hiding
   under the shadow of God's wings by way of refuge. Let me explain that
   figure, first, as relating to birds beneath their mother's wings. There
   is a hawk in the sky, the hen sees it, she begins to give her warning
   "cluck." The little chickens hardly know what the danger is, but they
   understand the mother's call and they see her crouching down on the
   ground. Have you ever seen her close to the earth, with her wings
   outspread and calling and calling again till every one of her chicks
   comes and hides beneath her wings? They are out of sight of the bird of
   prey--if that hawk comes down at all, it will have to attack the hen
   and kill her before it can reach her chicks. The pecks of its bill, the
   tearing of its talons will have to be, first, upon the mother bird, for
   her little ones are all hidden beneath the cover of her wings.

   Now, that hiding is an illustration of faith. Here is Christ, the
   Savior, and I hide myself under Him. The justice of God must strike the
   sinner, or One who is able and willing to suffer in the sinner's place.
   It is imperative, as a first Law of the universe, that sin cannot go
   unpunished. As Justice approaches, with drawn sword, I find Christ
   coming and interposing between me and the sentence of the Law--and if
   the avenger seeks me, I hide away under Christ and all the blows must
   be dealt upon Him. You know how He was wounded, beaten, torn, that you
   and I, hiding beneath Him, might escape. It sometimes happens, on the
   sides of the Alps, that a mountain goat or a wild gazelle may be
   feeding there and an eagle spies out a kid close by its mother--and the
   powerful bird thinks to devour that kid and down it flies! But the
   little creature crouches as low as it can at its mother's side and
   there stands the mother with horns ready to meet the eagle, and to
   fight against it for the life of her beloved little one. So the little
   kid is hidden away behind its mother and she valor-ously contends for
   it. In that way we must hide behind the Savior. We sang just now--

   "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee!"

   I put myself behind my Savior. I say to God, Deal not with me--deal
   with my dying Savior! My God, I interpose between Your wrath and my
   guilty head, the Sacrifice which He presented on the Cross, when He
   bowed His head and said, 'It is finished!'"

   The act of the chickens hiding away beneath the hen's wings is a very
   good description of the act of faith.

   It may be further illustrated by travelers hiding beneath a rock.
   Journeying through hot countries, they find towards noon that the air
   is very sultry and that the sandy soil beneath them reflects the heat
   of the sun. They seem to be traveling in a hot bath and they feel faint
   and weary. But yonder there is a great rock cropping out of the soil
   and under its shadow the heat is not felt. I have often been struck
   with the singular coolness that there is just by the side of a great
   rock. I have, myself, sometimes stood out in the sunshine in the South
   of France and it has been so hot that I have felt ready to faint-- and
   I have just stepped back within the shadow of a rock and found it
   almost as chilly as a vault! Refreshing, indeed, has it been to get
   into the cooler atmosphere!

   Well, now, Christ is the shadow of a great Rock in a weary land--and if
   you and I come to Him, and let His shadow come between us and the
   burning heat of the sun of Divine Justice, the heat will fall on the
   Rock--not on us. We shall be safe and refreshed and the Rock will
   screen us from all evil. Come and put Christ between you and God! He is
   the Inter-poser between God and man and that is true faith which gets
   to the side of the Rock, Christ, and hides away beneath His sheltering
   shade!

   Take another Biblical metaphor, that of the manslayer hiding in the
   City of Refuge. That was a part of the Law, you remember. If one had
   killed a man inadvertently and not of malice, the next of kin of the
   man killed could seek revenge and he followed up the manslayer--and the
   poor man's only hope of life was to hurry away as quickly as ever he
   could to a refuge city belonging to the priests. If he could once pass
   through the gate of a City of Refuge, he was sure of a fair trial and
   could not be put to death by the avenger of blood. Oh, how he hurried!
   How his feet seemed to fly over the soil, especially if he saw the
   avenger at some little distance following him with hot feet! But once
   let the city gate be shut, he breathed freely within the sacred
   streets--he was safe! Come, guilty souls, and fly away to Christ, as
   the manslayer fled away to the City of Refuge and, once safe in Him,
   with Jesus as the great Gate between you and the avenger of blood, you
   are perfectly safe! Do you comprehend and catch the thought? It is
   hiding away in Christ, from the pursuit of vengeance, from the
   righteous wrath of God, that brings safety.

   Another illustration comes in here, it is that of the conies hiding in
   the rocks--"The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their
   houses in the rocks." A coney was not exactly like a rabbit--a rabbit
   hardly dwells among rocks--but this creature was always found in holes
   and crannies of the rocks. Poor little coney, a dog is after it and the
   sportsman seeks to destroy it. But there is an opening in the rock and
   he slips in there and is perfectly safe. The dog barks and the coney's
   little heart beats fast, but barking will not kill conies! The
   sportsman looks up and down, but he cannot see the coney--he can see
   the rock, but he cannot see the coney within the rock. The coney has
   hidden right away from the keenest sight of the man who would destroy
   him.

   Now, just hide in that way in Christ, who died for guilty men! Trust
   Him. Believe Him. Believe that He will save you. Hide yourself in the
   Rock of Ages and then, though you may feel some fears, you will have no
   need of any. Once safe in Christ, all is well with you! You know that
   when a ship has been driven by a storm and the winds are out, the
   mariners hasten to the harbor. When they got into port, down goes the
   anchor! The rattle of the chains is one of the most pleasant sounds
   ever heard when one is seasick and worn out with a tempest-tossed
   voyage. Down goes the anchor--well, but when the motion of the ship
   still keeps on, she rocks to and fro--yes, but the anchor is down, the
   fear is all over! No matter how the vessel rocks, the winds cannot
   drive her out of the harbor. She is safe in port and the anchor is
   down--all is well with her. Oh, if tonight you can let the anchor go
   right down into the deeps and trust Christ--get a grip on Christ and
   hold on to Christ--you may have some fears and there may be some
   tossing for you yet to endure, but all is well! As the ship hides
   itself in the harbor, so do you hide away in Christ, saying with David,
   "In the shadow of Your wings will I make my refuge." This is faith.

   I cannot preach as I would. I have been learning to preach for ever so
   many years, but I cannot do it as I want to. But I wish that, instead
   of my preaching to you, you would practice what I bid you and hide away
   under the shadow of Christ's wings--

   "Come, guilty souls, and flee away Like doves to Jesus' wounds! This is
   the welcome Gospel-Day, Wherein Free Grace abounds."

   I remember when I first hid away in that Rock. I have been tempted many
   times to come out, but I never will. I cannot fight the hawk, I cannot
   kill the eagle, but I can squeeze myself further back into my Rock and
   hide away there and even--

   "When my eye-strings break in death,

   When I soar through tracks unknown," and see Christ on His Judgement
   Throne, I hope, still, to shelter in the Rock of Ages! Do the same,
   dear Sister! Do the same, dear Brother! May the Holy Spirit lead you to
   do it now! Remember that you have to believe for yourself--the Holy
   Spirit will not believe for you--He cannot believe for you. How can He?
   He has nothing to believe. It is you who have to believe and though He
   works in you to will and to do, He works, but you believe. It is only
   personal faith that

   saves--it could not be the faith of the Holy Spirit--it must be the
   sinner's own faith though it is worked in him by the Spirit of God.
   Therefore, believe and live unto God!

   II. Having dwelt on that illustration long enough, I ask you, now, to
   notice another expression in Psalm 55, verse 22--"Cast your burden upon
   the Lord and He shall sustain you." This passage sets forth faith as
   ROLLING OUR BURDEN UPON GOD.

   I believe that this text might be rendered, "Roll your burden upon the
   Lord." The similar passage in Psalm 37, verse five, "Commit your way
   unto the Lord," is, in the margin, "Roll your way upon the Lord."

   Faith, then, is the leaving of our burdens with God. When a man
   believes in Christ, he shifts his burden from his own shoulders onto
   the shoulders of Christ--

   "My soul looks back to see The burdens You did bear, When hanging on
   the cursed tree, And hopes her guilt was there." There you are,
   stooping down beneath a crushing load, heavy as that which Atlas was
   supposed to bear when the whole world was on his back--and Christ comes
   in and says, "Roll your burden from off your shoulders on to Mine. Let
   Me bear it for you."

   Well, then, if the burden is laid upon Christ, then we have not to bear
   it ourselves. Notice that. Some will say, "We trust Christ, but yet we
   are not at ease." How is that? If you have trusted Christ, you have
   rolled your burden upon Him--it is no longer upon you. I do not know
   whether there are still, near Ludgate Hill, as there used to be,
   certain rests for burden bearers. You might have seen the porter come
   toiling up to that spot and, as he shifted his burden onto the rest, he
   was, himself, relieved of the load. I have often looked at one of those
   rests at Mentone and seen the women come along the road with huge
   baskets of lemons or oranges on their heads and, as soon as they have
   reached this kind of table, they have put their burden on it, sat down
   and rested a while.

   Now, when they put their basket of oranges there, it is not on their
   head, is it? There is the beauty of rolling your burden upon Christ!
   When He takes it, it is not on you any longer. A thing cannot be in two
   places at one time! And when, by faith, I lay my burden down at Jesus'
   feet, I do not have it anymore! If my sin is laid on Him, it does not
   any longer lie on me! Come, poor Soul, here is the act of faith--to
   take the mighty burden that will crush you lower than the lowest
   Hell--and lay it on Christ, your Savior!

   When the burden is on Him, and not on us, the burden is not ours to
   take up again. I have heard that some of our rests in London were done
   away with because porters were known to come and put their loads on
   them, and sit down a while and, afterwards, get up and go home without
   them. You would hardly believe they could be so forgetful, but people
   do strange things. However, that is a mistake that I want you to make
   with regard to Christ, for there is no mistake in it! Lay your sin on
   Him by an act of faith, but do not take it up again! I never can
   believe, as some do, in God forgiving our sin and afterwards laying it
   to our account. I believe that in the day when our sin was laid on
   Christ, it was all laid there, and taken away from His people, never to
   be charged against them again! "As far as the East is from the West, so
   far has He removed our transgressions from us." How far is the East
   from the West? If you could travel, like a ray of light, as far
   eastward as you pleased--while another went as far westward as he could
   desire--you might go on forever and forever, and yet not meet. The
   distance, so far as created things can be, is infinite--and so far has
   the Lord removed our transgressions from us. If we, by faith, lay our
   sins upon Christ, God Himself forgets them and casts them behind His
   back, so that He says that if they are searched for, they shall not be
   found anymore forever.

   And here is one of the greatest mercies of all, that the burden is not
   even on Christ now. Roll your burden upon Him and, if you do, that
   burden is not on Him now. He died on the Cross and they laid Him in the
   sepulcher. Your sin rolls into His sepulcher and it is buried. Christ
   has left it as a dead and buried thing and He has risen from among the
   dead. He took your debt upon Himself, but when He paid that debt, it
   was not anymore due from Him, neither was it due from you! Therefore,
   we rightly sing--

   "Now both the Surety and sinner are free." The atoning Sacrifice of
   Christ is so complete a satisfaction to the Lord that even the sin that
   was laid on the Lamb of God is gone forever! It has ceased, even, to
   be, so that a Believer in Christ may, indeed, rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory!

   Now then, roll your burden upon the Lord. I really think that if a
   number of friends all stood here, tonight, groaning under a great load,
   and I said, "Just roll your burdens off," they would understand me.
   What a lot of rolling off would be done very soon! That is all that is
   required with your sin. Jesus is willing to take it! Jesus is willing
   to obliterate all the black record against you! Let it go to Him. Tell
   the devil that you have been answering him long enough and you are not
   going to talk to him any longer, for you have an Advocate in whose
   hands you are going to leave your case. When a man has an advocate, he
   does not go and do his legal business, himself--he refers everybody to
   his advocate. "Go and settle with him," he says. And tonight, when the
   devil says, "You are a sinner," I reply, "I know I am and so are you."
   "Ah," says he, "but you deserve death." "Yes," I answer, "but there is
   One who stood in my place--go and settle my account with Him. He
   undertook my business and He said that He would see me through with it
   if I would but trust Him, and I do trust Him! I must refer you to my
   Advocate, He can settle with you, I cannot."

   Do that, I pray you! Roll your burden upon the Lord. Trust in Him--to
   roll your burden upon Him is to trust Him! I do not know a better
   figure by which to set faith forth. Oh, that God the Holy Spirit may
   use it, tonight, to the unburdening of many poor souls!

   III. I said that we would have three of these Old Testament
   diamonds--the third is found in the 50th chapter of Isaiah, and the
   10th verse, where faith is likened to STAYING UPON GOD. I read it to
   you just now, but we will read the verse again--"Who is among you that
   fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of His servant, that walks in
   darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and"
   (here is the same thing as trusting in the name of the Lord, the
   explanation of it) "stay upon his God."

   The word, "stay," means, "lean." If I cannot stand, if I feel giddy, I
   naturally put out my hand. And if I feel faint, I lean upon some
   support and, the more faint I am, the more I lean. At this moment, I
   lean my whole weight upon this platform rail, just so. If this rail
   gives way, I must go down. I am leaning, staying myself wholly here.
   Now that is what you have to do with Christ--lean on Him with all your
   weight of sin and sorrow--lean on Jesus Christ and lean hard! Do not
   try to hold yourself up, now--throw yourself right on Him, lean on Him,
   rest on Him, let Him bear the whole of your weight. Stay yourself upon
   Him.

   In order to do that, you must believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is
   able to bear you up. Do you not believe it? He is God as well as Man.
   He has offered an all-sufficient Atonement to God. He is well-pleasing
   to the Father. He is the Lord, strong and mighty--a Savior--and a great
   One! Lean on Him and lean hard. Did anyone say, "I am afraid to trust
   Christ lest He may not be able to bear me up"? Oh, dear Friend, do not
   talk so! It seems so absurd. I remember a good old lady who would never
   go over the Saltash bridge at Plymouth. She looked up at it and said
   that she did not believe that it would ever bear her weight. There were
   great luggage trains that went rolling over it, but, still, she always
   said that it would not bear her. You smile, do you? Now, just think
   that you are that old woman--you are doing a more foolish thing than
   she did if you cannot trust Christ with your weight! Christ who is
   Omnipotent to save! How foolish you must be! He is able to save you. He
   is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him!
   Therefore stay yourself upon Him.

   Then, lean all your weight on Him. If you do that, you no longer have
   to support yourself. The sinner says, "I do not think that I could ever
   get to Heaven." Lean upon Christ to get there. "Oh, but if I were to
   leave my sins, I am afraid that I would go back to them!" Lean upon
   Christ to keep you from going back. "Oh, but if I lived here many
   years, I would be tempted and I might fall!" Lean upon Christ to
   preserve you from falling. "Ah, but you do not know what a temper I
   have!" Lean upon Christ to conquer your temper. "But, Sir, I have gone
   back so many times." Lean upon Christ to keep you from going back
   anymore--stay yourself upon Him! I cannot possibly mention all your
   weaknesses, all your doubts and all your fears, but whatever they are,
   lean upon Christ, lean hard on Him, like one of our female
   missionaries, when sustained by one of her converts in the hour of
   death. The convert said, "Lean on me, Missionary. Lean on me, Sister,"
   and as she thought that the missionary had a delicacy in resting all
   her weight, she said, "If you love me, lean hard, for the harder you
   lean, the more I shall feel that you love me." And Christ says to you,
   "Sinner, if you love Me, lean hard." Lean hard on Him and He will bear
   you up. You do not need strength for leaning on Christ--

   "True belief and true repentance," perseverance, and every Grace that
   you need to make you meet to be a partaker of the inheritance of the
   saints in light, Christ will give it all to you! Depend upon Him for it
   all! You will never have ease of mind, you will never know what full

   salvation means till you just give yourself up, as though you were
   dead, that He might be your life. Resign yourself to Christ, as a
   wandering sheep has to do to the shepherd when he takes it by the legs
   and throws it on his shoulders and carries it home, rejoicing. Christ
   can save--He will save--therefore, stay yourself upon Him!

   If you do, you shall have perfect peace. "You will keep him in perfect
   peace, whose mind is stayed on You: because he trusts in You." I should
   like to begin preaching, again, with that for my text, "You will keep
   him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You: because he trusts in
   You." If you have not perfect peace, it is because you are not staying
   yourself on God as you ought to do. There is no other way of coming to
   a perfect rest but by a perfect leaning upon Christ. Will you do that
   tonight? If a man were to get one foot on a rock, he might stand very
   well. Suppose that he puts the other foot on the sand? The sea comes
   up, the sand is treacherous and his foot begins to sink. I should
   recommend him to get wholly on that bit of rock and to stand there. Do
   so, then--stay yourself wholly upon Christ. Have no confidence in
   yourself, in Baptism, in sacraments, in prayers, in good works, in
   anything but the finished work of Christ--and when you get there, you
   are on a foundation that can never be moved!

   I would like to say, as I finish, that I have now served the Lord Jesus
   Christ for about 40 years and I have preached His Gospel, I can say,
   with all my heart. Neither have I cared for anything but to win souls
   to my Lord Jesus, but when I came to Him at first, I had no hope but in
   His blood and merits and I have no more hope, now, apart from His blood
   and merits, than I had at the beginning! I stand on the same foundation
   as I stood upon then. I have heard of a good man who said, as he was
   dying, that he was sorting over his life, putting his good works in one
   bundle and his bad ones in the other. At last he said to his wife, "It
   is no use sorting them out, for the good ones are so bad that I think
   that I will fling them all away and cling to Christ, alone."

   There was a famous cardinal, in Luther's day, who fought tremendously
   against the Reformer, but he said, in the course of the discussion,
   that, seeing that there is much in our good works that is faulty, and
   no man can be quite sure that he has done enough good works to save
   him--upon the whole it is better to trust only to the merits of Christ.
   Well, the best of everything always suits me and if that is the best, I
   will let other people have the second best and I will just trust in
   Christ, and trust in Christ, alone. Oh, that you would all do so
   tonight! Have done with yourself! Have done with your good works! Have
   done with your bad ones--have done with any reliance upon self,
   whatever--and just come as you are and trust Christ who died for the
   guilty and undeserving!

   O bankrupt Sinner! O Sinner without a hope, come and just stay yourself
   upon the immovable foundation of the atoning Sacrifice of Christ and
   you shall find eternal life tonight! Yes, even tonight! God grant it,
   for Jesus' sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ISAIAH50.

   Verse 1. Thus says the LORD. There is always something weighty coming
   when you have this preface. If God speaks, we ought to hear with
   reverence, with attention.

   1. Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put
   away? Or which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you? God is
   here addressing His ancient people. They had been given up, as it were,
   left, forsaken. They compared themselves to a wife who had been
   divorced by her husband, or to children who bad been sold by their
   father because of his extreme poverty. The Lord says, "Now, tell Me,
   have I really put away My chosen people as a man in a pet puts away his
   wife? Have I really sold you to profit by you? What benefit is it to Me
   that you are carried away captive and that you are left without
   comfort?"

   1. Behold, for your iniquities have you sold yourselves, and for your
   transgressions is your mother put away. It was not God's
   changeableness, but their own sinfulness that had brought upon them all
   their sufferings. The Jews might have remained a nation in possession
   of their own land to this day if they had not turned aside unto idols.
   It was not that God cast away His people whom He did foreknow, but they
   cast Him off, they sold themselves. Now, if any child of God has fallen
   into trouble of heart and has lost his comfort, let him not blame
   God--his sorrow is caused by his own acts and deeds. And if any man or
   woman here should be in deep trouble brought on by sin, let them not
   set it down to their destiny, let them not call God unkind, but let
   them take the blame to themselves--"For your iniquities have you sold
   yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away."

   2. Therefore, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there
   none to answer? It is Christ who is speaking here by the mouth of the
   Prophet. When He came, there was "no man." He could not find in all the
   nation any faithful one to help Him in His great redemptive work. "He
   came unto His own and His own received Him not." He preached repentance
   and faith throughout the land, but they cried, "Crucify, Him! Crucify
   Him!" They loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were
   evil.

   2. Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no
   power to deliver? If you are in the worst plight in which you can be,
   God can still help you. Despair of yourself, but do not despair of Him!
   If you have come to the very bottom of all things and the last ray of
   hope is quenched in midnight darkness, God is still the same! Hear what
   He says to you, "Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or
   have I no power to deliver?" Can He not break the bonds of drunkenness?
   Can He not deliver the unchaste from their vile passions? Can He not
   pick up from the dunghill the outcast and the offcasts? Is anything too
   hard for the Lord? Is the salvation of the greatest sinners impossible
   for Him to accomplish? That can never be, for He is "mighty to save."

   2. Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I Make the rivers a
   wilderness, their fish stink because there is no water, and they die of
   thirst. God divided the Red Sea, He parted the Jordan asunder and made
   a way for His people to pass over. He who has done this can do
   anything! When God takes up the case, impossibility is not in the
   dictionary. However great your sorrow, however deep your misfortune, or
   however grievous your sin, if God comes to deal with it, He will make
   short work of all your troubles and all your despair.

   3, 4. I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their
   covering. The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of the learned, that I
   should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: He
   wakens morning by morning, He wakens My ears to hear as the learned.
   This is Christ speaking again. When He came here, though He found no
   man able to help Him, none to come and join Him in the redemption of
   His people, yet He gave Himself up to the tremendous task. He became
   instructed of the Father. He was taught to speak a word to weary ones.
   "Never man spoke like this Man." There is no gospel like His Gospel, no
   doctrine like His Doctrine. He went to God in private "morning by
   morning." He received His message from His Father and He came and
   delivered it to the people. Oh, what a glorious Christ we have!

   5. The Lord GOD has opened My ears and I was not rebellious, neither
   turned away back. He had His ear bored as slaves had when they would
   not go out free, but meant to remain with their master. Christ had a
   bored ear, an opened ear. He never rebelled against God's will. He was
   obedient to the Father, even unto death. If you want to know how
   obedient He was, hear me read the next verse--

   6. I gave My back to the smiters, and My checks to them that plucked
   off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting. Now let me go
   back a little and read, again, the third verse--"I clothe the heavens
   with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering." "I gave My back
   to the smiters, and My checks to them that plucked off the hair." It is
   the same Divine Person who musters the hosts of Heaven till the very
   skies are blackened with the artillery of God, who here says, "I gave
   My back to the smiters, bowing down to the brutal Roman scourge, and My
   cheeks to them that plucked off the hair." You remember the scene that
   I pictured last Sunday night, the whole band of soldiers mocking Christ
   and even spitting upon Him? [ Sermon #2333, Volume 39--The Whole Band
   Against Christ.] That was the fulfillment of these words, "I hid not My
   face front shame and spitting." That same Christ, without whom was not
   anything made that was made, whose face is the sun of Heaven, whose
   Glory is matchless and unsearchable, says, "I hid not My face from
   shame and spitting." Do not say, then, that God has no love to you! Do
   not say that He has cast you away as a husband divorces his wife. Talk
   no more as if there were no help for you, no means of your deliverance.
   Behold how low your Savior stooped, how gracious He was to suffer so
   much for guilty men--and be encouraged to trust Him. He who gave His
   back to the smiters says to you, "The chastisement of your peace was
   upon Me, and with My stripes you are healed."

   7. For the Lord GOD will help Me. This is Christ still speaking. Though
   God, Himself, yet as the God-Man, looking to His Father for help in the
   dread struggle through which He went to save us, He declared, "The Lord
   God will help

   Me."

   7. Therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set My face
   like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. And He was
   not--He went through with all that He had undertaken. He drank our
   bitter cup till none of the dregs re-

   mained. He bore the terrible wrath of God, which otherwise would have
   rested on us forever! God helped Him and He bore it all.

   8, 9. He is near that justifies Me; who will contend with Me? Let us
   stand together: who is My adversary? Let him come near to me. Behold,
   the Lord GOD will help Me; who is he that shall condemn me? Lo, they
   all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up. Will any
   now come to battle against Christ and hope to conquer Him? Voltaire
   used to say, "Crush the Wretch!" but where is Voltaire now? And those
   who agreed with Voltaire, where are they now? But Jesus always lives
   and reigns and God is with Him! He who shall once come to battle with
   our glorious Lord shall soon know the power of Christ's weakness and
   the Omnipotence of His death!

   10. Who is among you--Here is a very blessed question. Christ, having
   passed through all the trouble that could be passed through, and having
   come out of it triumphant, now looks round on all His followers, on all
   the children of God, and He says, "Who is among you"--

   10. That fears the LORD, that obeys the voice of His servant, that
   walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the
   LORD, and stay upon his God. Do you see the drift of it? Our Savior
   trusted and He was not confounded. He stayed Himself upon God even when
   He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" and He came off a
   conqueror! Trust in God and you, also, will be victorious! Let your
   strength be drawn from that strong and mighty One who is pledged to
   help all who trust Him and you shall triumph even as Jesus did! Do you
   refuse to trust God? Then listen to this--

   11. Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about
   with sparks: walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that you
   have kindled. If you think to make yourselves happy in sin, go and do
   it! If you fancy that your own righteousness will save you, go and try
   it!

   11. This shall you have of My hand; you shall lie down in sorrow. Your
   fire shall not warm you! Your sparks shall not enlighten you! You will
   have to lie down to die and you shall lie down in sorrow. O my dear
   Hearers, the time will come when each one of us must put off this body
   and lie down to die! God grant that we may, none of us, have to lie
   down in sorrow, but instead thereof, having trusted in God, may He
   light our candle for us in the last moment, that we may fall asleep in
   Jesus and wake up in His likeness in the everlasting Glory! May God
   bless to us the reading of His Word! Amen.

The Love Of Jonathan and the Love Of Jesus

   (No. 2336)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 29, 1889.

   "Your love to me was wonderful, surpassing the love of women." 2 Samuel
   1:26.

   DAVID was a poet and when he found that his best-beloved friend had
   fallen by the arrows of the Philistines, he wept greatly and then he
   cheered his heart by writing the very fine elegy which, in later years
   was called, "The Song of the Bow." Even if David's lamentation is
   judged according to the canons of literary taste, it must be placed
   among the first of poetical compositions. Thus David tried to keep his
   friend's memory green--the song was meant to be a memorial of him. Such
   friends as Jonathan are not common and when we have had them, we must
   not forget them. It is sad that, in these days, friendship is
   proverbially a frail thing. Friends are like swallows that are with us
   in our summertime and gone when the damps of autumn begin to gather.
   When a man has a faithful friend, let him grapple him to his side with
   hooks of steel! And when he loses him, let him know that he has lost
   what will be very hard to replace and let him not forget his friend
   though he is buried beneath the sod. True friendship likes to fashion
   memorials of the departed. We keep mementos of the loved ones we have
   lost. We like to think of the happy days of communion we have had
   together and we will not allow the cherished name to be blotted out
   from the memory of men.

   When I thought of this subject, I said to myself, "I shall see many,
   tonight, who are lovers of the Lord Jesus Christ. I shall be face to
   face with thousands who love Him as they love their own soul." I
   believe that is my happiness now. Well then, beloved Friends, let us
   who love Christ keep Him always in memory. If you can speak of His
   name, be not silent. If you can make melody in honor of Jesus, in the
   great congregation, take down the minstrel's harp and lay your fingers
   among the strings and bring out sweetest music to His dear name that
   thousands may hear! But if you have a feebler instrument, sing or play
   to the two or three and let those who love you know that you love your
   Lord best of all! Or if your tongue fails you, use your pen to let men
   know who Jesus is. Say, with the Psalmist, "My heart is inditing a good
   matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the King."

   What shall we do to keep Christ's name before the sons of men? Let us
   be inventive and often make the winds and waves to bear the story of
   His life and love to those who know it not. I would whisper in the ear
   of someone, "If you love Jesus, how is it that you are never at His
   Table?" If there is anyway of keeping Him in memory, which is better
   than every other, it is the one which He has, Himself, chosen--"This do
   in remembrance of Me." How do you excuse yourselves, you lovers of
   Christ, who have never kept up this feast of love? This is one of His
   dying requests, "Meet and remember Me." And yet, though you say that
   you love Him, and I will not challenge the truth of what you say, you
   have never yielded obedience to His loving request and come to eat the
   bread and drink of the cup which are the memorials of His broken body
   and His poured-out blood. David, you could sing of Jonathan, though
   there was no law that you should do so! What will you say of some who
   love the Christ of God better than you loved Jonathan and yet have
   never remembered Him in the way in which He asked to be remembered, but
   have cast behind their back the sweet forget-me-not of the Communion
   Table?

   Let that stand as a preface. May the Lord put our hearts in tune, now,
   while we think upon two things! The first is the small type, Jonathan's
   love to David. The second is the infinite anti-type, Christ's love to
   men. Perhaps it will be sweetest, tonight, if we can, each one, say,
   "Christ's love to me. He loved me and gave Himself for me." That
   expression will be in harmony with the words of the text, "Your love to
   me was wonderful."

   I. First, then, we have to think a little about JONATHAN'S LOVE TO
   DAVID.

   Jonathan's was a singular love, because of thepureness of its origin.
   Jonathan loved David out of great admiration of him. When he saw him
   come back with the head of Goliath in his hand, he loved him as a
   soldier loves a soldier, as a brave man loves another brave man. He
   felt that there was the right kind of metal in that young man and
   though Jonathan was the king's son, and heir-apparent to the throne, we
   find that he, "stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave
   it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and
   to his belt." He felt that such a hero, who could so trust his God, and
   so expose his life, and come off so victorious, deserved his utmost
   love. It did not begin in self-interest--it did not begin in
   relationship--but it began in the likeness that Jonathan saw between
   his own nature and that of David. It was one brave man loving another
   brave man.

   Jonathan's love proved, also, to be most intense. It is said that, "he
   loved him as his own soul." He would at any moment have sacrificed his
   life to preserve the life of David. In fact, I do not doubt that
   Jonathan thought David's life much more valuable than his own and that
   he was quite willing to expose himself to peril that David might be
   preserved. Jonathan's was a very intense love. May we see more of this
   kind of love among Christian men! May they love each other for Christ's
   sake and because of the love of God which they see in one another--and
   may they be intense in their affection!

   Jonathan's love was very disinterested because, as I have said,
   Jonathan was heir-apparent to the throne, but David had been anointed
   king by Samuel. The kingdom was to be taken from the house of Saul and
   given to the house of David. Very naturally, the young prince Jonathan
   might have felt, first, envy, and then hatred of David, who was to
   supplant him. But instead of that, he said to him one day, very
   touchingly, "You shall be king over Israel and I shall be next unto
   you." He meant to be his friend and his helper, taking joy in seeing
   David wear the crown which might have adorned his own brow. Happy
   Jonathan, to be able to put himself in the background like that and to
   feel that, if David was first, it was what he, himself, desired! That
   friendship, in which a man can set himself on one side for the sake of
   another, is not yet so common that we can have it in the streets.

   Jonathan's was a love which bore up under all opposition, for he soon
   found that Saul, his father, in his black heart, hated David. Saul
   could not bear the thought that another man would take the place which
   he coveted for himself, though he did not, himself, deserve to keep it.
   He wished to see David dead and because Jonathan took David's part,
   Saul was exceedingly angry and made Jonathan's lot hard to bear. Yet
   Jonathan did not cast off his friend--he clung to David through good
   report and through evil report. Jonathan "is faithful to his father and
   very obedient to him, but still, he would not give up his friend,
   David, and he would sooner be in jeopardy of the javelin of Saul than
   end the friendship that existed between himself and God's chosen
   servant.

   And this love was very active, for you know how he pleaded for David
   with his father. He went out into the field and took counsel with
   David. He arranged plans and methods for David's preservation and, on
   one occasion, we find that he, "went to David in the wood and
   strengthened his hand in God." Yes, his love was not a matter of mere
   talk--it was real, practical, active--it was a love which never failed.
   When the arrow of the Philistine went through the heart of Jonathan on
   Mount Gilboa, it struck the name of David that was engraved there--

   "He loved him long, and loved him well, And loved him to the death," so
   that David could truly say, "Your love to me was wonderful, surpassing
   the love of women."

   Now, dear Friends, do you not think that when we read a story like that
   of Jonathan and David, it should stir up in us the desire, not so much
   to have such a friend, as to be such a friend as Jonathan was to David?
   Any man can selfishly desire to have a Jonathan, but he is on the right
   track who desires to find a David to whom he can be a Jonathan! There
   is great joy in life with real friendship on both sides. Some people
   expect friendship to be always heaping its treasures upon them, but
   true friendship has two hands, two feet and two eyes. You cannot have a
   real friendship that is all for taking, and never for giving. David
   loved Jonathan as Jonathan loved David. May that blessed Spirit of God,
   who teaches us to love even our enemies, help us to cultivate
   sanctified friendships and to be willing to help those who are our
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ in time of need!

   I shall say no more upon that part of my subject, but I hope it will
   rebuke some who are no friends at all. Oh, how often have we met with
   such! They are very friendly when their legs are under your mahogany,
   but they are not so friendly when you have no mahogany and have hardly
   a deal table left. They think all the world of you while you can be a
   ladder

   by which they climb the wall of prosperity, but when they are on the
   top of the wall, they too often say that they never saw that ladder in
   all their lives--and you may take it away! We continually see that kind
   of thing among men of the world. May it not be so among Christians! May
   we be true to all who are our friends, as we would be generous even to
   any who are our foes, if such persons are in existence!

   II. But I want, now, to talk of something more sweet and more sure. THE
   LOVE OF CHRIST TO ME. Using the first personal pronoun, because it is
   in the text--"Your love to me was wonderful."

   I hope that many here will be helped to use that same pronoun, each one
   for himself, or for herself. I do not wish to preach tonight--I want,
   rather, to be a sort of guide, just to go through the exercises that
   others may do the same. I am to speak of love which I trust many feel,
   which I hope they may feel even more than the speaker does--and let it
   be the ambition of every one of us to love Christ more and more. Let us
   think of Christ as present here, tonight, for so He is, according to
   His promise, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world." There He stands! With closed eyes, faith perceives Him and she
   cries, "Your love to me was wonderful."

   I think that we feel this most when we see our Savior die. Sit down at
   the foot of the Cross and look up. Behold that sacred brow with the
   thorny wreath upon it. See those blessed eyes, red with weeping. Mark
   those nailed hands that once scattered benedictions. Gaze on those
   bleeding feet which hurried on errands of mercy. Watch till you can
   peer into that gaping side--how deep the gash--how wide the breach!
   Look how the water and the blood come streaming forth! This is the Lord
   of Life and Glory who thus dies amid derision and scorn--suffering, the
   Just for the unjust--to bring us to God! Oh, if you can picture Christ
   on the Cross, and believe that He died for you, you will be led to cry,
   "Your love to me was wonderful, surpassing the love of mothers or of
   wives! Your love to me was--I cannot describe what it was--it was
   wonderful--as full of wonders as the heavens are full of stars, or as a
   forest is full of leave? Your love, as I see it in Your death, was
   wonderful."

   Do you picture David saying this as he thinks of the body of Jonathan
   pierced with the arrows of his enemies? "Your love to me was
   wonderful." Will you not stand so, tonight, in imagination, over your
   Savior's body, as you see it wrapped in spices and laid in the tomb of
   Joseph of Arimathaea? Ere yet the stone is rolled to the cave's mouth,
   will you not look on that mangled form and say, "In very truth, Your
   love to me was wonderful"?

   Beloved Friends, sometimes we feel as if our love to our departed ones
   would know another great flood if they could come back again. You have
   lost--no, I will not harrow up your feelings--have all lost those most
   dear and your sorrow was great as you laid them in the grave. But if,
   tonight, when you reached your home, you should find, sitting in that
   room of yours, the beloved one come back, I think that your love would
   suddenly leap up into an ecstasy and it would be greater than it ever
   was before! "Has my husband returned to me? Has my spouse come back to
   me? Has my mother, my child, been restored to me?" Oh, what a feast of
   love our souls would have if there could be such a reunion in our
   bereaved households! Well, remember that He who died for us rose
   again--

   "He lives, the great Redeemer lives," lives with our love still within
   His heart! He lives to love us as much in His eternal Glory as He did
   in the shame and spitting while He was on earth! Come, give your love
   room, tonight, as you remember Him as dead, but rejoice in Him as
   living!

   I think, also, that we sometimes feel the greatest love to dear friends
   when we find others doing them despite. When David found that
   Jonathan's body had been dishonored by the Philistines, that they had
   taken away the bodies of King Saul and his sons to hang them on the
   wall of Bethshan, then was he sorely troubled and his love broke forth,
   again, in sighs, cries and tears. And I must say, tonight, that I love
   my Lord all the more because of the insults others heap upon Him. When
   I have lately seen books written against His atoning Sacrifice. When I
   meet with men calling themselves Christians, who speak lightly of the
   sacred Expiation and even of the Divine Person of the great Sacrifice,
   my heart first burns with indignation against the traitors--true
   successors of Judas--and then my soul cries, "My Savior, by the
   dishonor that they put on You, I love You all the more! By the shame
   that they again cast on You, as though You were a hundred times
   crucified, I vow to serve You with a hundredfold energy and force of
   concentrated love, for Your love to me was wonderful." Some can speak
   lightly of Christ. Perhaps they never knew such love as He has shown to
   me. Some can despise His blood. Possibly they were never washed from
   such sins as mine. Some think lightly of His faith. Perhaps

   they have never had such communion with Him as my heart has known. I
   must say of Him, "Your love to me was, is, and always shall be
   wonderful, passing all loves supposable in Heaven or earth besides."

   Now let me briefly tell the story of that love--it is a long story--the
   love of Christ to me. Part of its wonder lies in the object of this
   love, that it should be bestowed upon me! "Your love to me." Dear
   Brother, dear Sister, will you talk about it, just now, to yourself?"
   It is a wonder that Christ should love anybody, but is it not the
   greatest wonder of all that He should love me? Who am I, and what is my
   father's house, that Christ should love me?"--

   "What was there in you that could merit esteem, Or give the Creator
   delight?"

   Your love to me! There was special undesert--there were many reasons
   why love should have passed me by, but Your love to me was wonderful
   that You should single me out. Tell it in Heaven that there is no
   greater wonder there than that Christ should love me! And when you get
   there, say to all the bright spirits before the Throne of God, "There
   is no greater wonder in the salvation of you all than there is in my
   salvation. Your love to me, my Lord," and you will bow adoringly at
   Christ's feet as you say it, "Your love to me was wonderful."

   Then throw the emphasis on the first word, "Your love to me," and you
   have another part of the wonder, that is, in the Giver of this love.
   For a man to love me, well, should not men love their kind? But for God
   to love me, for the Infinite, for the inconceivably lovely One, whose
   ideal of that which is loveable must be far beyond human conception,
   for Him to love me, this is a miracle, indeed! Can you imagine it, that
   God, who is greater than immensity, whose life is longer than time,
   that God the all-boundless One, should love you? That He should think
   of you, pity you, consider you, this is all very well--but that He
   should love you, that His heart should go out to you, that He should
   choose you, that He should have engraved you on the palms of His hands,
   that He should not rest in Heaven without you, that He should not think
   Heaven complete until He brings you there, that you should be the bride
   and Christ the Bridegroom, that there should be eternal love between
   Him and you--oh, as you think of it, lift up your hands with adoring
   wonder and say, "Your love to me was wonderful."

   Now begin, if you can, to consider the commencement of this love. When
   did God begin to love His own elect? There was a time when He began to
   make the worlds, but from eternity He has loved His chosen. Before the
   first flash of light illuminated the primeval darkness, God loved His
   people! Before the first pulsation of life came into human bodies, long
   before there were such beings as men and women, He loved His own. He
   saw them in the glass of predestination and foreknowledge and He loved
   them. His delights even then were with the sons of men. His love had no
   beginning, it was like Himself, self-existent, starting from itself,
   and there never was a time when God did not love His own people. Think
   of that wonder of Grace, that such a speck of dust as you are should
   have been loved from eternity! That such a handful of ashes as I am
   should have been loved from before all worlds! Tell it as with voice of
   trumpet, for God has said it, "I have loved you with an everlasting
   love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you."

   Christ's love, then, is wonderful in its beginning and when it began to
   work on me, it was still wonderful, for what did I do? I refused it.
   When Christ came in robes of love to me and presented Himself as a
   candidate for my heart's acceptance, I told Him that I would not have
   Him! There was a wanton world that had my heart. There was the devil,
   himself, in all manner of sinful shapes--and he had my hand--and I was
   his. Was it not so with some of you, that Christ wooed you many a year
   and you would not have Him? He came to you, sometimes, threatening, and
   sometimes inviting. He came to you by Providences, by preachers, by
   books, by His good Spirit. Yet though you turned your back on Him, He
   never turned His back on you. He would not take, "No," for an answer--

   "Determined to save, He watched o'er my path When, Satan's blind slave,
   I sported with death." Think of a man who used to come staggering out
   of a public house late at night, yet He is loved of God! Or of a thief,
   whose hair was cut short in the prison, yet He was loved of God--and
   here he is, tonight, sitting at Jesus' feet, rejoicing in that love!
   Oh, what songs there will be in Heaven concerning the love of Christ to
   His own and the rebuffs which the dear Lover of our souls received by
   the sad, sad usage of ungodly, willful men! "Your love to me was
   wonderful."

   And when Christ's love led Him to come here and take our Nature, was it
   not wonderful? He reigned enthroned in Heaven. Seraphim and cherubim
   gladly did His bidding. He was God and yet He came down from yonder
   royal palace to that stable at Bethlehem, and to the manger where the
   horned oxen fed. 'Tis He! 'Tis He! But as George Herbert reminds us, He
   has unrobed Himself and hung His azure mantle on the sky, and all His
   rings upon the stars--and there He lies, a

   babe in swaddling bands, taking human nature into union with His
   Divinity because He loved us! Truly, You blessed Child, whom I would
   take into my arms as Simeon did and say, "Lord, now let You Your
   servant depart in peace, according to Your Word: for my eyes have seen
   Your salvation." Your love to me was wonderful! Behold Christ with the
   scepter of Heaven in His hand, and then see Him sitting on the edge of
   a well, talking to an adulterous woman! Gaze on Him with the harps of
   angels ringing out His praise and then see Him with all the riff-raff
   of Jerusalem scoffing at Him and bidding Him come down from the Cross!
   If He stooped to become a Man like ourselves, and stooped lower, still,
   even unto death, truly may each saved one cry to Him, "Your love to me
   was wonderful."

   There is one thing that makes the love of Christ more wonderful than
   anything else and that is that He not only took our Nature, but He took
   our sin. There, scrape it up together, the filthy stuff that has made
   God, Himself, to sicken at the thought of man--I mean the sin and the
   pollution of our lives! Behold, the Lord has gathered it up together in
   one foul heap, enough to putrefy the universe--and He has laid it all
   on Christ! And the great Sin-Bearer takes it upon Himself as though it
   were His own--but it was not! He suffers for it, He bears the sentence
   of Justice on account of it and then He hurls it all away into the
   abyss of oblivion where it shall never be found, again! My Savior, did
   You bear my sin in Your own body on the tree? Were you condemned for my
   condemnation? Then, in very deed, Your love to me was wonderful!

   I do not know how to break my text up so as to bring it home to each
   Believer. I wish that everyone here, who really has known Christ's
   love, would help me by a personal thought upon the brotherly and
   condescending character of this love. Times have been when we, who love
   Christ's name, have been in trouble and He has been very near to us.
   Times have been when we have been misrepresented and abused--and He has
   smiled, oh, so sweetly on us! Times have been when bodily pain has made
   us very faint and He has put underneath us the everlasting arms. Speak
   as you find, Beloved--how have you found the Lord Jesus in your dark
   days, in your heavy days, in your weary days? Have you not found Him a
   matchless Friend? I can bear my own witness that there is no comfort
   like His comfort! There is no smile like His smile! There is no touch
   of help like His delivering hand. "Your love to me was wonderful."

   Sometimes, when I have told the story of God's goodness to me, a
   Christian friend has said, "Have you not written all that down?" "No, I
   have not," I have replied. "Will you not take care, before you die,
   that it is all written down?" I have said, "No, I do not know that I
   shall." Now perhaps your life's story will die out with yourself, yet
   have there not been very marvelous touches of Christ's love in it? Have
   there not been windows of agates and gates of carbuncle through which
   you have seen your Lord's face and can you not say, tonight, looking
   over your pilgrim path from the first day until now, "Lord, You have
   been always with me. Your love to me was wonderful in condescending,
   helpful fellowship in the time of my need"?

   Think, also, of the comforting and thoughtful provisions of Christ's
   love. Sometimes you have been well-near slipping, not merely as to
   trouble, but as to sin. Our lives are not all to our credit--there have
   been sad moments when unbelief has crept in on the back of
   thoughtlessness and you have been almost a skeptic. There have been
   evil moments when sin has insinuated itself into the imagination and
   you have almost done that which would have been your ruin. Have there
   not been times in your life when you have been struck and, if there had
   not been Someone to hold you up, you would have fallen, almost
   unconsciously fallen, and there have lain down to die? But oh, how
   Jesus has watched over you and cared for you! Never mother nursed her
   babe with such care as Christ has given to you! When you look back,
   sometimes, and see the pit from which you have been preserved, into
   which you might have fallen--when you meet with some old friend who
   used, years ago, to be singing at your side, and is now a drunk or
   profane--you may ask, "Why should he be like that anymore than I
   should? Who has made me to differ? What but the Grace of God has kept
   me until now?" Ah, then you see how Christ's love to you has been
   wonderful, surpassing the love of women!

   But the love of Christ to us is most of all wonderful in its plans for
   the future. You know not, and you cannot conceive, what He will yet do
   for you! You are in trouble, are you? Well, joy comes in the morning.
   But now, you have to drink the bitter cup and God gives you pills that
   you do not like. Take them at His hand, for they are meant for your
   good. 'Tis but a little while and then sorrow and sighing shall forever
   flee away! Has any redeemed man here any notion of what God has
   prepared for them that love Him? You shall stand among the perfected
   and go in and out among the holy! You shall be where no trouble shall
   ever reach you, or even the noise and dash of a wave of sorrow ever
   reach your ears. You shall be where it shall be your joy to serve God
   without mistake, without transgression and without omission. You shall
   behold the face of the King in His beauty, not now and then, but
   forever, without a cloud or a veil between!

   You shall find it your delight to praise Him and your voice shall be
   heard amid the choirs of the glorified as you adore the Lamb whose love
   to you has been so wonderful. And what will be your employments in
   Heaven? Ah, that I cannot tell you, but they shall be employments that
   shall be equally honorable and delightful!

   I have told you before what I sometimes dream shall be my lot in
   Glory--to stand not here and preach to a handful of people, though it
   is truly a large handful--but to stand upon some starry orb and preach
   of Christ to whole constellations at once and thunder out my
   remembrances of His sweet love to myriads of beings who have never
   heard of Him as yet, for they have never sinned, but who will drink in
   all the tidings of what Jesus did for sinful men! And each of you,
   according to your training for it, shall make known to angels,
   principalities and powers, the manifold wisdom of God! There is plenty
   of room for you all, for God's universe will need millions upon
   millions of messengers to go through it all and tell out the story of
   redeeming love. And we, I believe, are here in training for that
   eternal work of making known to illimitable regions of space and
   countless myriads of intelligent beings whom God has created, but who
   have never fallen, the story of this little planet and of the God who
   loved it so that He came here and died that He might save His people
   from their sins.

   Get ready, Brothers and Sisters, for the eternity which is so near!
   Within about a hand's breadth, you and I shall be in eternity! Even if
   we live to be 80 or 90, or fulfill the count of a hundred years, it is
   but a little while and we shall have quitted these dark shores and
   landed in the everlasting brightness of endless glory, that is, if we
   know the love of Christ, today, and trust in Christ today. We shall go
   on and on forever and forever experiencing more and more of this great
   Truth of God, "Your love to me was wonderful."

   Now let each one answer this question-- Can you say, "He loved me and
   gave Himself for me"? If not, you are an unhappy man. God make you even
   more unhappy until you come and look to Jesus Christ as men looked to
   the bronze serpent--and as by their looking they were healed, so by
   your looking may you be made to live tonight! Remember that--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One! There is life at this
   moment for thee! Then look, Sinner--look unto Him and be sa ved-- Unto
   Him who was nailed to the tree."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 SAMUEL 20.

   Verse 1. And David fled front Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
   Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin
   before your father, that he seeks my life? David had an enemy upon the
   throne and God gave him a friend in the heir to the throne. If you have
   an enemy, you have also a friend--God sets the one over against the
   other in His Providence. Set the one over against the other in your
   thoughts and be you comforted thereby. David might have been very heavy
   at heart about Saul and so he was, but Jonathan came in to be the
   makeweight on the other side and turn the scale in favor of the son of
   Jesse. Of him David enquired, "What is my iniquity? And what is my sin
   before your father, that he seeks my life?"

   2. And he said unto him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my
   father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it
   me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so. One
   admires Jonathan for defending Saul--he will not believe anything bad
   of his father. Children should never believe anything evil of their
   parents unless it is forced upon them--this rule is a part of the
   command, "Honor your father and your mother."

   3. And David swore moreover, and said, Your father certainly knows that
   I have found grace in your eyes; and he says, Let not Jonathan know
   this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul
   lives, there is but a step between me and death. He wanted Jonathan to
   believe the truth, namely, that Saul was seeking to kill him, and that
   he was in great danger from the wrath of the king. Therefore he took a
   double oath that it was so. It is not for Christians to imitate David
   in this respect, for our Lord's command to His disciples is, "Swear not
   at all, but let your communication be, Yes, yes; no, no: for whatever
   is more than these comes of evil."

   4. Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatever your soul desires, I will
   even do it for you. Love promises large things. One is reminded, here,
   of the love of Christ and of how He says, "Ask what you will, and it
   shall be done unto you."

   5, 6. And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,
   and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that
   I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even: If your
   father at all misses me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me
   that he might run to Bethlehem, his city: for there is a yearly
   sacrifice there for all the family. The family of David was a godly
   household and they had a meeting, not for pleasure, but for
   sacrifice--a special family gathering for worship and David must be
   there. He spoke no untruth--he did desire to go to Bethlehem.

   7, 8. If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if
   he is very angry, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
   Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought
   your servant into a Covenant of the LORD with you: notwithstanding, if
   there is in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me
   to your father? These two men had entered into a solemn Covenant before
   God that they would be friends for life, so David pleaded with
   Jonathan. He was innocent--he knew that he had done no evil and,
   therefore, he put it to Jonathan, "If I am what your father thinks me
   to be, slay me yourself."

   9-11. And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly
   that evil were determined by my father to come upon you, then would I
   not tell you? Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? Or what
   if your father answers you roughly? And Jonathan said unto David, Come,
   and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into
   the field. Quite alone, away from their troops, where they could talk
   together without being overheard. These two good men sought private
   fellowship and do you not think that if we love Christ, we shall want
   to get alone with Him? Shall we not say to Him, "Let us go out into the
   field"? Where there is no private devotion, there is no devotion at
   all. If we never get alone with Christ, we are altogether strangers
   both to Him and also to His love.

   12-15. And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have
   sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and,
   behold, if there is good toward David, and I then send not unto you,
   and show you; the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it
   pleases my father to do you evil, then I will show you, and send you
   away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as He has
   been with my father. And you shall not only while yet I live show me
   the kindness of the LORD, that I die not: but also you shall not cut
   off your kindness from my house forever: no, not when the LORD has cut
   off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth. In
   Jonathan's great love, he wished not only to be David's friend,
   himself, but that all his children should be in love with the same
   valiant hero. Brothers and Sisters, our love to Christ makes us long to
   see our children love Him, too. I will not believe that you have any
   love to Christ unless you pray that your boys and your girls may also
   love Him. Dear children of godly parents, our heart's desire and prayer
   to God for you is that you may love your mother's God, and trust your
   father's Savior.

   16-18. So Jonathan made a Covenant with the house of David, saying, Let
   the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies. And Jonathan
   caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as
   he loved his own soul. Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new
   moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty. David
   was not a nobody--if he was away, he was missed. I wish that all
   attendants at the house of prayer would remember that when they are
   away, they are missed. Perhaps some of you have come, tonight, from
   some little chapel where you will be greatly missed. I am not going to
   thank you for coming here because I am possibly unconsciously causing
   pain to your pastor and I do not want to rob him of one of his sheep.
   David's seat is empty, tonight, and he will be missed.

   19-23. And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down
   quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the
   business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel. And I will
   shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
   And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I
   expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you,
   take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as
   the LORD lives. But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the
   arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away. And
   as touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD
   be between you and me forever. Thus He arranged how to let David know
   in case he was in danger. Love is thoughtful. Love would keep its
   object out of harm's way. Therefore, as we love any, let us try to
   preserve them from sin--let us endeavor to warn them when temptation is
   near, that they may not fall by the hand of the enemy.

   24-27. So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
   come, the king sat him down to eat meat. And the king sat upon his
   seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan
   arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and

   David's place was empty. Nevertheless Saul spoke not anything that day:
   for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he
   is not clean. And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second
   day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
   Jonathan his son, Why comes not the son of Jesse to meat, neither
   yesterday, nor today? David was the son of Jesse, but he was Saul's own
   son-in-law, yet, out of contempt, the angry king calls him, "the son of
   Jesse."

   28-30. And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to
   go to Bethlehem: and he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has
   a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be
   there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I
   pray you, and see my brethren. Therefore he comes not unto the king's
   table. Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
   him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you
   have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and unto the
   confusion of your mother's nakedness? He was in such a passion that he
   began to abuse his own wife, the mother of his own son! In the East, if
   you want to sting a man most severely, give evil names to his mother,
   and surely, in the West as well, if anyone has anything to say against
   a man's mother, it cuts her son to his heart if he is what he ought to
   be.

   31. For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, you shall
   not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him
   unto me, for he shall surely die. Saul knew that David, and not
   Jonathan, was to succeed him on the throne. He gives Jonathan warning
   of that fact, and seeks his rival's life.

   32. And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Why shall
   he be slain? What has he done? Very reasonable questions, very properly
   put.

   33-42. And Saul cast a javelin at him to strike him: whereby Jonathan
   knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. So Jonathan
   arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second
   day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had
   done him shame. And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went
   out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad
   with him. And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which
   I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. And when the
   lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot,
   Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?
   And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And
   Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. But the
   lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. And
   Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry
   them to the city. And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a
   place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
   himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept, one with
   another, until David exceeded. And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace,
   forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying,
   The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed
   forever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
   Behold the love of Jonathan and David! Here was a brother born for
   adversity who clung to his friend in the day of danger, and even
   jeopardized his own life that he might defend David. Let us see, here,
   a faint emblem of what our great Friend, the Lord Jesus, has done for
   us.

The Physician Pardons His Palsied Patient

   (No. 2337)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 3, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER
   3, 1889.

   "And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a
   bed: and Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the sick of thepalsy;
   Son, be of good cheer;your sins are forgiven you. And, behold, certain
   of the scribes said within themselves, This Man blasphemes. And Jesus,
   knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts? For
   which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise,
   and walk? But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth
   to forgive sins, (then He said to the man sick of thepalsy), Arise,
   take up your bed, and go to you house. And he arose, and departed to
   his house." Matthew 9:2-7.

   I REMARKED in the reading that the Gospel of Matthew is especially the
   Gospel of the Kingdom and of the King. All through Matthew's writing,
   the title of King constantly occurs in connection with Christ, and His
   kingliness is prominent from the opening chapter to the close. Here we
   see the King exercising His royal prerogatives. In this passage we have
   several instances of Christ acting as He could not have acted if He had
   not possessed a royal and Divine Power.

   I. I will go at once to my text and note, first, that JESUS DEALT WITH
   THE PALSIED MAN IN A TRULY ROYAL AND DIVINE WAY.

   The bearers of the man sick of the palsy, had broken through the
   tiling, whatever that may have been, to get him near the Savior. They
   had dropped him down over the heads of the eager throng and there he
   lay upon his pallet before Christ, unable to stir hand or foot, but
   looking up with that gaze of eager expectancy which Christ so well
   understood.

   You will notice that our Lord did not wait for a word to be spoken--He
   simply looked and He saw their faith. Matthew writes, "Jesus, seeing
   their faith." Who can see faith? It is a thing whose effects can be
   seen--its signs and tokens are discernable and they were eminently so
   in this case--for breaking up the roof and putting the man down before
   Christ in so strange a way, were evidences of their belief that Jesus
   would cure him. Still, Christ's eyes not only saw the proofs of their
   faith, but the faith, itself. There stood the four men, speaking with
   their eyes, and saying, "Master, see what we have done! We are
   persuaded that we have done the right thing and that You will heal
   him." There was the man, lying on his bed, looking up, and wondering
   what the Lord would do, but evidently cheered by the belief that he was
   now in a position of hope where, in all probability, he would become a
   man favored beyond everyone else. Christ not merely saw the looks of
   this man and his bearers, but He saw their faith.

   Ah, Friends, we cannot see one another's faith! We may see the fruit of
   it. Sometimes we think that we can discern the lack of it, but to see
   the faith, itself--this needs Divine sight, this needs the glance of
   the eye of the Son of Man! Jesus saw their faith and now, tonight,
   those same eyes are looking upon all in this audience and He sees your
   faith. Have you any that He can see? "Oh, yes!" some of you can reply,
   "we have a humble, trembling faith--not such as it ought to be, but
   such as we are very thankful to possess." Some of you, it may be, are
   conscious of your sin, tonight, and all the faith you have is just a
   faint hope, a feeble belief that if He will but speak to you, you shall
   be forgiven. You believe that He is able to save to the uttermost them
   that come unto God by Him, but you have, in the background, a fear that
   you cannot come, or that you may not come in a right way. Still, if it
   is ever so little faith in Him that you have, my Master sees it and, as
   in our early days we used to look for a single spark in the tinder that
   we might get a light on the cold mornings, so does the Lord look for
   the tiniest gleam of faith in any human heart, that out of it may come
   a flame of spiritual life! "Jesus, seeing their faith."

   Now then, my dear Hearer, Christ's eyes are looking at you, tonight.
   Whatever faith you have, exert it now! Believe in Jesus! He is the Son
   of God--believe in Him as able to save you, for He is able, and He is
   willing as well as able--and now trust your soul to Him, sink or swim.
   Determine that if you must die, you will die at the foot of Christ's
   Cross, and you will go nowhere else for salvation! "Jesus, seeing their
   faith." His royal and Divine sight could perceive that which was hid
   from all mere mortal men.

   But then, when Jesus saw their faith, observe, next, that He dealt,
   first, with the chief evil which afflicted this man. He did not begin
   by curing him of the palsy. That was bad enough, but sin is worse than
   the palsy! Sin in the heart is worse than paralysis of every single
   muscle! Sin is death and something worse than death--therefore Christ,
   at the very beginning of this miracle, to show His Lordship, His royal,
   his Divine Power, said to the man--"Son, be of good cheer; your sins
   are forgiven you." This was laying the axe at the root of the man's
   evil nature! This was hunting the lion, the biggest beast of all the
   foul creatures that lurked in the dense forest of the man's being.
   Christ's words drove the unclean animal from his lair and, by His
   Almighty Power, tore him as though he had been a kid!

   Now, at this time, you may have many troubles and, perhaps, you are
   eager to spread them before the Lord. That sick child. Your dear
   husband who is at home ill. That business which is flagging and likely
   to fail. That disease of yours which is weakening you and which makes
   you scarcely fit to be in the Lord's House, tonight. Now, waive all
   those things, for heavy as they are, they are inconsiderable compared
   with sin! There is no venom as poisonous as that of sin! Sin is the
   wormwood and the gall--this is the deadly fang of the serpent whose
   sting infects and inflames our whole being! If this evil is removed,
   then every ill has gone and, therefore, Christ begins with this, "Your
   sins are forgiven you." Breathe a prayer to Him, now, for the
   forgiveness of your sin--"Jesus, Master, forgive me! With a word You
   can pardon all my sin. You have but to pronounce the absolution and all
   my iniquities will be put away at once and forever. O my Lord, will You
   not put them away, tonight?"

   Notice, also, that Jesus did absolutely forgive that man--"Son, be of
   good cheer; your sins are forgiven you." He did not say, "They shall be
   forgiven," but, "They are forgiven; I absolve you from them all.
   Whatever they may have been, your youthful sins, your manhood sins,
   your sins before the palsy laid hold upon you, your sins of murmuring
   since you have been upon that bed--put them all together into one great
   mass and though they be multitudinous as the stars of Heaven, or as the
   sands on the seashore--Son, your sins are forgiven you." And the man
   felt that it was so. He believed that it was so--a load was taken from
   his heart and his whole spirit was lifted up by that gracious word--"Be
   of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you." I pray my Master to deal
   thus with some who are sitting in these pews who are very heavy at
   heart. May He speak right into the depths of your spirit, "Son,
   Daughter, your sins are forgiven you! They are blotted out, they are
   all gone." Oh, what a dreadful time that is to a man when first he sees
   his sin! It is the darkest moment of his life, but it is a blessed
   moment when he sees that Christ has put away his sin and has said to
   him, "You shall not die in your iniquities; for they are all forgiven."
   Everything grows light and bright round about him! He, himself, is like
   one who comes up out of a well, or out of a horrible pit, out of the
   miry clay, yes, out of the very belly of Hell! He seems to leap, all at
   once, up to the Throne of Heaven as he sings, "My sins are all
   forgiven! I am a miracle of Grace!" Wonder not if the man can scarcely
   contain himself--marvel not if he runs and leaps, and dances for very
   joy!

   This is how Christ behaves towards poor, palsied, sin-bound men and
   women. He sees their faith and then puts their sin away where it shall
   be seen no more, forever, for He is King, He is God and He is able to
   forgive and blot out all iniquity. I have heard of one who, having been
   under a great sense of sin and being relieved of it, could, for a long
   time, only cry out, "He is a great Forgiver!" When there were other
   things to be attended to, he could not see to them, nor speak of any
   other kind of business but this, "He is a great Forgiver!" I do not
   feel as if, tonight, I need to say anything else to you but this, "He
   is a great Forgiver! I have found Him so. Many here have found Him so
   and all who will trust His great atoning Sacrifice shall also know that
   He is a great Forgiver."

   II. The second division of my subject diverges a little from the first,
   but it follows the text, and so it is no real divergence. By His royal
   and Divine Power, CHRIST READ AND JUDGED MEN'S THOUGHTS. See those
   scribes, those

   students of the letter of the Word, who know how many letters there are
   in every Book of the Old Testament and have counted them so accurately
   that they can tell which is the middle letter! Wonderfully wise men,
   those! Do you see them? They are very vexed and angry and they think
   hard thoughts of Christ. They did not dare to speak out what they
   thought--the people would not have listened to them, just then, if they
   had spoken, so they held their tongues, but they

   did not hold their hearts. But there was a thought-reader there--not
   one who professed the art, but One who possessed it-- and He heard
   where the quickest ear would have failed to detect the faintest sound!
   Jesus heard the scribes mentally say, "This." If you look at your
   Bibles, you will find that the word, "Man," is printed in italics and
   that the scribes said within themselves, "This," they meant, "fellow"--
   they meant any evil name that you like to put in--"This blasphemer."
   They would not say what they thought of Him--they did not like to call
   Him anything but just, "This. . . This offscouring."

   Thus, Christ read their contempt of Himself. They had not uttered it,
   but He had heard it. It is an awful thing to have a silent contempt of
   Christ. You may pride yourself on saying, "I have never spoken anything
   against religion. I have never used a profane expression." No, but if
   you do not call Jesus your Lord. If you do not acknowledge Him as your
   Savior, He knows what the contemptuous omission means! What you do not
   say, though you only say "This ..." and leave a blank space, He reads
   it all. If there are any here who have such thoughts of my Lord and
   Master, I do not wish to know them--and I hope that they will never let
   any other creature know them--but let them remember that Jesus knows
   all about them, for He is a King who reads the secrets of all hearts
   and, in due time, He will lay them bare.

   But, next, Jesus marked their charge of blasphemy. They said in their
   heart that He blasphemed, for He had taken to Himself the prerogative
   of God. According to Mark and Luke's accounts, they asked, "Why does
   this Man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God, only?"
   Now, mark you, we who worship Christ as God can never have any
   fellowship with those who deny His Godhead, nor can they have any
   fellowship with us, for if He is, indeed, the Son of God, then they
   blaspheme Him who deny it! And if He is only a man, then we are clearly
   idolaters and man-worshippers and He did blaspheme. We are obliged to
   confess that, and we do confess it--if He was not the Son of God, if He
   had not power to forgive sins--then they rightly judged that He was a
   blasphemer. Ah, my Hearer, when you are afraid that Jesus cannot
   forgive your sins, you are trembling on the very verge of blasphemy!
   There is such a crime as constructive treason and there is such a sin
   as constructive blasphemy. To deny Christ's power to save is to make
   Him but a man--and if you put Him down as only man, you blaspheme! Even
   though you may not intend to utter blasphemy, there is the shadow of
   its dark presence even in that unbelief of yours.

   Notice, also, how Jesus judged their thoughts. He said to them, "Why do
   you think evil in your hearts?" It was their hearts rather than their
   thoughts that were evil! Intellectual error generally springs from an
   unrenewed heart. And what evil had these men thought? They had thought
   Him a blasphemer! They had also thought contemptuously of Him. But the
   greatest evil of all was that they had limited His power--they did not
   believe that He could forgive. They thought it blasphemy on His part to
   profess to have the power to forgive the sins of men!

   Now, my dear Hearer, I know that you would shrink from openly
   blaspheming Christ, that is, if you are the person I think you are.
   Then, however great your sin at present is, do not make it more by
   insinuating that He cannot forgive you, for of all sins, this must be
   the most cruel--to think that He is unable to forgive. This stabs at
   Christ's Saviorship, which is His very heart! If you say, "I am very
   guilty," say it again, for you say the truth. But if you say, "I am so
   guilty that He cannot forgive me," I pray you to withdraw that wicked
   word lest you should limit the Holy One of Israel and He should have to
   say to you, "Why do you think evil in your heart?" It is thinking evil
   of Christ to imagine that He cannot forgive! I mean this word for the
   very worst man in the world. If you are now the blackest soul out of
   Hell, if you are at this moment the most guilty and the most condemned
   of all the myriad offenders of our ruined race, yet I charge you not to
   add to your past sin this further evil of doubting Christ's power to
   save even you! But come as you are and cast yourself at His feet, and
   say, "Let all Your power to save be shown in me. I am the chief of
   sinners and here You have an opportunity of showing the greatness of
   Your power to pardon."

   And observe, once more, that, in dealing with these scribes, our Lord
   spoke right royally and Divinely to them, for He revealed the
   unreasonableness of their thoughts. He said to them, "Why do you think
   evil in your hearts?" I ask you who are here, tonight, if you know any
   reason why Christ cannot forgive sin? Will anyone here who doubts His
   power to pardon, find a reason for that doubt? If you believe (and I
   will assume that you do believe), that He is the Son of God, can He not
   forgive sin? If you believe that He did heal the lepers, the paralyzed
   and even raised the dead, can He not forgive sin? Further, if you
   believe that He died for sin--that on the Cross He offered no less a
   victim than Himself--why do you think that He cannot forgive? If you
   believe that He rose again from the dead--and I know that you believe
   this--if, indeed, He rose again from the dead for the justification of
   the ungodly, how is it that He cannot forgive? And

   if He has gone into Glory, and you know that He is at His Father's
   right hand, and is there making intercession for the transgressors, how
   can you say that He cannot forgive you? "Why do you think evil in your
   hearts" in limiting my Master's power? He can forgive everyone here
   present! He can forgive every soul in whom He sees faith in Himself,
   whoever He may be and however dire his guilt!

   III. Now we come back to the palsied man and our Master and notice, in
   the third place, that right royally JESUS OPENLY DECLARED HIS
   COMMISSION. He seems to me to read the letters patent which His Father
   gave Him when He sent Him on His errand of love and mercy--"The Son of
   Man has power on earth to forgive sins."

   First, Jesus is the Son of Man. He does not conceal that fact. One
   would have thought that He would have said, "I am the Son of God," but
   here He still chooses to hold His Godhead in abeyance, so He says, "The
   Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. I, the Son of Mary. I,
   the carpenter's Son. I who dwelt at Nazareth 30 years. I who have gone
   up and down among you, worn with sufferings, pained by your hostility,
   wearied by labor for you, I, the Son of Man, have power to forgive
   sins." Think of that! He puts Himself on His very lowest standing and
   declares that as the Son of Man there is bestowed upon Him, by reason
   of His Godhead, the power to forgive sins!

   And having thus declared His title, He goes on to say that He forgives
   sins as the Son of Man on earth. He was on earth and He had power on
   earth--that is, in His earthly life, in His humiliation when He had
   made Himself, for a while, to be less than the Father, so that He could
   say, "My Father is greater than I"--higher in office, just then, when
   He had humbled Himself and taken upon Himself the form of a servant, He
   could say, "The Son of Man has power on earth, at His lowest, divested
   of Glory, here as a Man among men--the Son of Man has power on earth to
   forgive sins." Oh, how I love this word, for if He had power on earth,
   what power He has in Heaven! And if He had power as the Son of Man,
   what power He has as God and Man in one Person! Oh, how fully you may
   trust Him! Even the Christ whom they could see, the Son of Man--for you
   know that there was a Christ whom they could not see--that Son of God
   whom carnal eyes could not behold, who must reveal Himself spiritually
   or be unperceived by mortal sense. Even He whom they could see, the
   Christ whom you poor weeping ones can see, though you cannot see the
   half of Christ, no, you cannot see the hundredth part of Christ--the
   Christ whom you poor doubters can see, the Christ whom you who are all
   but blind can only see out of the corners of those eyes of yours when
   you see men as trees walking--even that Christ, the Son of Man, in His
   weakness on earth, was able to forgive sins! I do not seem as if I
   ought to try to preach about this glorious Truth of God, but I feel
   that I ought to state it and leave it as a solemn fact for you to
   reject at your peril if you dare--or to receive with glad joy--for,
   believe me, your only hope lies here! O guilty sons of Adam, here is
   the way of escape for you! Your father, Adam, has ruined you, but the
   Son of Man has come to seek and to save you--and He declares that He
   has power on earth to forgive sins!

   Now, notice, in this blessed unrolling of His commission as the Son of
   Man, how Jesus cheers the sad. He said to the poor palsied man, "Son,
   be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you." How this should comfort
   you who are sad on account of sin! It is the Son of Man who can forgive
   you! You tremble at the greatness of God. You are afraid of His
   Majesty. But this Son of Man, your Brother, whose hands were pierced
   with the nails and whose feet still wear the nail-prints--whose side
   has the gash that the spear of the soldier made--He it is who can
   forgive sins! How tenderly He comes to you! How gently does He deal
   with you! Here is a hand fit for a surgeon of whom it is said that he
   must have an eagle's eye and a lion's heart, but a lady's hand. Here is
   a hand of flesh--a dainty, tender hand of love that brings pardon to
   you! You have not to encounter God, absolutely, but the one Mediator
   between God and men. He who is bone of your bone and flesh of your
   flesh, says to you, "The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive
   sins." And this makes our hearts cheer up when they are sorrowing on
   account of sin!

   Beside that, Jesus assures the forgiven that He has forgiven them. How
   I love to think of that blessed fact, that Christ does not forgive us
   and keep His forgiveness in the dark, but He says, "Son, your sins are
   forgiven you," giving the assurance of forgiveness to the sinner whom
   He forgives! The realization of pardon is a delightful feeling. It is
   not worthwhile to sin, whatever comes of it. I cannot say, with
   Augustine, "Beata culpa! Blessed fault!" but oh, if there is a joy
   outside of Heaven that is higher than all others, it is the joy of a
   sinful soul when Divine forgiveness is granted, making the forgiven one
   whiter than the driven snow and fresher than the morning dew! I am a
   forgiven man, wonder of wonders! I, who have broken all God's Laws and
   brought upon me Jehovah's wrath, am pardoned for all my transgressions!
   God's Son has said it and His Word is sure and steadfast, "Son, your
   sins are forgiven you."

   I think that men would readily give up all the pleasures of this world
   and count them as nothing if they could but know the bliss of forgiven
   sin. Oh, if any man who says that he loves a merry laugh, did but once
   know what it is to be reconciled to God, he would count that he never,
   before, enjoyed real merriment, or understood true mirth! Our Lord
   Jesus Christ, as I have said, makes us drink of the sweetness of
   forgiveness. It is not merely that He burns the books that recorded our
   indebtedness, but He tells us that He has done so! He says, "Your sins
   are forgiven you."

   Thus it was that Christ publicly unrolled His Divine commission,
   declaring that He had power on earth to forgive sins. He came here on
   purpose to forgive human guilt--not to condemn, no, not even to condemn
   her who was caught in the act of adultery--"Neither do I condemn you,"
   He said--"Go, and sin no more." Jesus came not to condemn the thief who
   was dying on the Cross and confessing that He deserved to die. No, He
   said to him, "Today shall you be with Me in Paradise." It is Christ's
   business to pardon! It is His bliss to pardon! It is His glory to
   pardon! He came here on purpose that He might pardon the guilty. Oh,
   that all sinful ones would go to Him for forgiveness!

   IV. After having thus declared His commission, let us note, in the
   fourth place, that JESUS EXHIBITED HIS CREDENTIALS.

   Since the scribes disputed His power to pardon, He gave them a
   practical proof that He could forgive--and I need your special
   attention to this point. He said to them, in effect, "To forgive sin is
   a Divine act. Now, which is easier to say, Your sins are forgiven you,
   or to say, Arise, and walk?" I put it to you, dear Friends, which is
   the easier of the two? Mark that Jesus does not ask, "Which is the
   easier, to forgive sin, or to heal the palsy? No. He said, "Which is
   easier to say, Your sins are forgiven you or to say, Arise, and walk?"

   Well, now, the first is much the easier because there are a great many
   who can say, "Your sins are forgiven you," and you cannot see whether
   the sins are forgiven or not. Look at the number of those who call
   themselves priests, who say, after they have heard the penitent's
   confession, "I absolve you." It is easy enough to say that--but who is
   to know whether that person who has professed penitence is absolved or
   not? There is no apparent change to the observer--the poor sinner who
   is told that he is absolved may credulously derive some delusive
   comfort from his fellow sinner's words--but those who look on cannot
   see any difference in the man or woman coming back from the
   confessional from what they were when they went there.

   It is very easy to say, "Your sins are forgiven you"--any fool can say
   it, any knave can say it--but then, if you say, "Arise, and walk,"
   suppose they do not rise and walk--what then? Anybody can stand there
   and say to the man sick of the palsy, "Arise, and walk," and the man
   may make an effort to rise, but falls back as helpless as ever, so
   that, although both miracles are, in themselves, equally impossible to
   man and equally require Divine Power, yet the saying of the one is easy
   enough, but the saying of the other is more difficult! Many an impostor
   would shrink from saying, "Arise, and walk," for he would be mightily
   afraid that it would be found one thing to say it, and quite another
   thing for the patient to really rise and walk! Thus Christ said to the
   scribes, "I will prove to you that I am Divine and, therefore, that I
   have the power to forgive sins, for I will now perform a miracle which
   you shall see and which you shall be quite unable to dispute. It shall
   be worked before you all and then you shall know that as I could do
   what was evidently the harder thing, that is, say, 'Arise, and walk,' I
   had the right to say what has become the easier thing, 'Your sins are
   forgiven you.'"

   "Then He said to the man sick of the palsy," while he lay there,
   "Arise, take up your bed, and go to you house." Thus Jesus marked out
   the miracle in detail. It was necessary to pile up the argument to make
   it complete and overwhelming. First, "Arise, sit up, stand up." The man
   could not do that if the palsy was still upon him--but at once, "He
   arose." "Now roll up your mattress." He stoops down and you can see him
   rolling it up. He now has it under his arm, or on his shoulder. "Now,"
   is Christ's next command, "Go to your house," and he walks, straight
   away, off to his home. Of course, in modern times, we make exhibitions
   of converts, and we would have taken this man up and down the streets,
   to show him off as a trophy! But the Savior does much better than that.
   For him to go home to his house was a clearer proof of being cured than
   for him to remain with Christ, for it might be supposed that while he
   was with the Savior, some strange influence emanating from the great
   Physician kept him in a state of excitement and up to the mark. So
   Christ says, "Go home to your house, to everyday life, just as anybody
   else might do. Go along with you, bed and all." And off he goes! Every
   point of detail was necessary to make it clear that this was a real,
   radical, complete cure--and that the Christ who could work such a
   miracle was able, also, to forgive sin!

   I remark, next, that change of nature is the best proof of the pardon
   of the sinner. You may come to me, tonight, and say, "Sir, I am
   forgiven." I am glad to hear it, but how will you behave at home,
   tonight? "I am forgiven," cries one, all of a sudden, under a sermon,
   as if electrified. Yes, yes, and you want to stay with us, do you, and
   never go home again? That will not do because such a cure as that could
   not be a perfect, business-like, commonsense cure! Go home to your
   family. Your moral actions, your temperance, your honesty, your
   chastity, your obedience to parents, your good conduct as a servant,
   your generosity as a master--these will not save you--but unless we see
   them, how are we to know that Christ has worked a miracle upon you? And
   if He has not worked a miracle upon you in raising you up from the
   palsy of sin, how do we know that He has forgiven you? In fact, we do
   not know it and we do not believe that He has, for these two things go
   together--the one as the evidence of the power that worked the other!

   If you have been forgiven, you have been renewed. Sitting in this
   place, tonight, you may be forgiven all your sin. But if you are, you
   will not be, tomorrow, what you have been today. The drunk's cup will
   not be lifted to his lips anymore. The company of the lascivious will
   not be pleasant to you. No oath, no profane speech, no foolish talk
   will come out of your mouth again. Christ forgives you outright, not
   because you are cured of your evil habits, but He forgives you while
   you are still palsied--and the evidence that you are forgiven--the
   harder thing as the world will always judge it to be, is your taking up
   your bed and walking home, quitting all your former sloth, for it will
   be sloth from this time on! The bed which you could not help lying
   upon, once, will become the couch of sloth to you if you are on it any
   longer. You will take that up and you will walk back--and be a man of
   activity at your daily labor, in your own house--from now on as long as
   you live.

   Do notice this, dear Hearers. We do not preach to you salvation by
   works, but when you are forgiven, then the good works come! The same
   Christ who makes you a new creature, pardons your sin--you cannot have
   half a Christ--you must have Christ the Healer as well as Christ the
   Forgiver. If Christ could be cut up into lots, we could sell Him off
   immediately. But if He is to be taken all at once as a Sin-killer as
   well as a Sin-forgiver, there are always some who will fight shy of
   Him. I pray that not one of you may be of that kind.

   I think, also, that the detailed obedience that the Savior required was
   the best evidence that He had forgiven the man's sin. "Arise, take up
   your bed, and go to your house." Henceforth, to do everything that
   Christ bids you do, in the order in which He bids you do it, because He
   bids you do it--to do it at once, to do it joyfully, to do it
   constantly, to do it prayerfully, to do it thankfully--this shall be
   the token that He has, indeed, dealt with you as a pardoning God! O my
   dear Hearers, I am afraid that there are some who profess to have been
   forgiven who are not as obedient to Christ as they ought to be! I have
   known them neglect certain duties. I even knew a man, once, who would
   not read some parts of the Word of God because they made him feel
   uneasy! But be sure of this, that when you and the Word of God fall
   out, the Word of God has right on its side! There is something rotten
   in the state of Denmark when you cannot read a chapter without feeling
   that you wish that it was not there! If there is any verse that you
   would like left out of the Bible, that is the verse that ought to stick
   to you, like a blister, until you really attend to its teaching. There
   is something wrong with you whenever you quarrel with the Word of God.

   I say, again, that detailed obedience is the surest evidence that the
   Lord has forgiven your sin. For instance, "He who believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." Do not omit any part of that precept. And if
   Christ bids you come to His Table and thus remember Him, do not live in
   neglect of that command. At the same time, remember to live soberly,
   righteously, honestly, godly in this present evil age, for if you do
   not, if there is not a detailed obedience, there may be a fear that,
   after all, the Lord has never said to you, "Your sins are forgiven
   you."

   And, last of all, the best evidence is always seen at home. "Take up
   your bed and go to you house." If there is a place where piety is best
   seen and best judged, it is at the family altar. What a man is at home,
   that he really is. What a woman is in her own house--that she truly is.
   It is very easy, you know, to masquerade in society--to seem to be
   something very wonderful upon the boards of the world's theater--and
   then not to be, in reality, the king that you seemed to be, but, after
   all, to be only a very sorry specimen of humanity! "Arise, take up your
   bed and go to you house." One said to me, this very day, of a certain
   man, "Do you think, Sir, that he was a good man?" I said, "Well,
   Brother, I think that he was a good man of a very bad sort." I did not
   know how to put the truth more charitably.

   I remember an old woman who went to hear a minister of a certain creed
   that she did not like, though he preached uncommonly well. And when she
   came out, they asked her how she got on with the preacher. She replied,
   "Well, he is one

   of the best of a very bad make." Now, I do not like to have to say that
   of anybody who professes to be a Christian and it should not be so. No,
   and I do not want you to be the worst of a good make, either, though
   that, perhaps, is better than being the best or the worst of a bad
   make! We need to be such that we can bear the closest inspection.

   "Ah!" says one, "I came here seeking the pardon of sin and now, Sir,
   you have got off to moral conduct." Quite so and that is where I want
   you to get off, too! Seek the pardon of sin, tonight--it is to be had,
   as I have told you, by faith. "Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the
   sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you."
   But if you want to make sure that Christ is really able to forgive your
   sin, the very best evidence to you, and the only evidence to the
   outside scribes, will be that you take up your bed and walk. "Oh," you
   say, sometimes, "I still have many sins, but I am not what I used to
   be. I am a changed man at heart. I could not bear what I once enjoyed.
   I could not do what I once commonly did and the things that I loathed
   and despised are now delightful to me." I am glad that it is so with
   you and I pray that it may be so with all my hearers. May God work that
   great and gracious change in many who are in this Tabernacle tonight,
   for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW8223-34,9:1-13.

   Matthew's Gospel is the Gospel of the Kingdom, and of the King. Here
   you see the King amid the storms of Nature.

   Matthew 8:23, 24. And when He was entered into a boat, His disciples
   followed Him. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea,
   insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but He was asleep.
   In the quiet confidence of faith, resting upon His God.

   25, 26. And His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Lord, save
   us: we perish. And He said unto them, Why are you fearful, O you of
   little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
   there was a great calm. As great a calm as there had been a tempest!
   After great trouble, expect deep, delightful rest and peace if you are
   a child of God.

   27. But the men marveled, saying, What manner of Man is this, that even
   the winds and the sea obey Him! Now see the King in conflict with the
   powers of darkness.

   28-31. And when He was come to the other side into the country of the
   Gergesenes, there met Him two possessed with devils, coming out of the
   tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And,
   behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with You, Jesus, You
   Son of God? Are You come here to torment us before the time? And there
   was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. So the
   devils besought Him. How the demons crouched at His feet! The dogs of
   Hell knew the power of His tongue--that was a whip whose lash they had
   felt before.

   31, 32. Saying, If You cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd
   of swine. And He said unto them, Go. He never wastes words on demons.

   32-34. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine
   and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place
   into the sea and perished in the waters. And they that kept them fled
   and went their ways into the city, and told everything, and what was
   befallen to the possessed of the devils. And, behold, the whole city
   came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw Him, they besought Him that
   He would depart out of their coasts. A sad prayer, yet Jesus granted
   their request. Men may once too often ask the Holy Spirit to depart
   from them. They may grieve Him once more and then He will have done
   with them forever. Now we shall see the King in conflict with the
   diseases of mankind and with human sin.

   Matthew 9:1, 2. And He entered into a boat, and passed over, and came
   into His own city. And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick of the
   palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus, seeing their faith--The faith of the
   bearers and the faith of the palsied man, himself--

   2. Said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins
   are forgiven you. It was remarked, by a mediaeval writer, that we do
   not find Christ calling any of the Apostles, not even the very chief of
   them, by the name that He gave to this palsied man, "Son." This is the
   title that He gives to a sin-sick sinner, lying on a bed before Him,
   waiting to be healed. Oh, the tenderness of Christ to sin and misery!
   He puts a kind of sonship upon this man which he had not possessed
   before.

   3. And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This Man
   blasphemes. "He arrogates to Himself the prerogative of God. Who can
   forgive sins but God only?"

   4-8. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in
   your hearts? For which is easier to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or
   to say, Arise, and walk? But that you may know that the Son of Man has
   power on earth to forgive sins, (then He said to the sick of the
   palsy), Arise, take up your bed, and go to you house. And he arose and
   departed to his house. But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled,
   and glorified God, which had given such power unto men. They rightly
   saw in this miracle, worked by Christ, power given to man, for, as you
   observe, Christ said, "The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive
   sins." And these people magnified God that one Man should have such
   power granted to Him! There is an elevation to the whole of manhood in
   the alliance of Christ with it. Through Him the Lord has given great
   power unto men.

   9. And as Jesus passed forth from there. The King is now going to show
   His power over the human will.

   9. He saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, and
   He said unto him, Follow Me. And he arose, and followed Him. Everything
   bows before Him. Is He not King of Kings and Lord of Lords? Have we
   ever comprehended the true measure of His Divine and Human Nature? Even
   when He was on earth and known as the Son of Man, what gleams of His
   Divine Glory shone forth in these truly royal acts of His! Yet how
   condescending was our King! Where is His court? Who are His attendants?
   Listen--

   10. And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,
   many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Him and His
   disciples. Lord of the sea, Conqueror of demons, Healer of the sick,
   Forgiver of sin and now He has, for His company, publicans and sinners!
   When the Pharisees saw it, they did not see condescension in it--but
   they saw wickedness in it.

   11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto His disciples, Why
   does your Master eat with publicans and sinners? Ah, why, indeed? You
   and I know--that is a secret that has made us love Him better than
   almost anything else!.

   12. But when Jesus heard that, He said unto them, They that are whole
   need not a physician, but they that are sick. He has come here on
   purpose that He might heal our sicknesses! Oh, you who feel, tonight,
   sick with sin, and sick of sin, come and sit down with Him! He added,
   "Him that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out," and He will not
   cast you out, notwithstanding your sin, if you come to Him by faith!

   13. But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance. Let us never forget that Jesus is the sinner's Savior. He
   does not come to save saints--He comes to save sinners, and the saints
   who are saved are kept from becoming sinners by His almighty love. May
   God bless this reading of the Scriptures to us! Amen.

The Crisis Of This World

   (No. 2338)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 10, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 6, 1889.

   "Now is the judgment of this world: nowshall theprince of this world be
   cast out. And I, if Iam lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
   unto Me. This He said, signifying what death He should die." John
   12:31-33.

   OUR Lord passed through His passion in a kind of rehearsal before it
   came. He saw those Greeks who came to Philip and whom Andrew and Philip
   brought to Him, and His heart was flushed with joy. This was to be the
   result of His death, that the Gentiles would be gathered to Him! That
   thought reminded Him of His approaching decease. It was very near--
   only a few days would elapse and then He would die upon the Cross. In
   anticipation of Calvary, His soul was full of trouble--not that He
   feared death, but His death was to be a very peculiar one. He was to
   die the Just for the unjust. He was to bear our sins in His own body on
   the tree and His pure and holy soul shrank from contact with sin! To
   stand in the sinner's place--to bear His Father's wrath--this
   bewildered Him. He was very faint of heart and He cried, "What shall I
   say? Father, save Me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto
   this hour. Father, glorify Your name." Without any wicked weakness, He
   proved how truly human He was--without any sinful repining at His
   Father's will, He saw how terrible that will was and He shuddered at
   what it included. This was a kind of rehearsal for Gethsemane. It was a
   sipping of that cup of which He was to drink until His sweat was, as it
   were, great drops of blood falling down to the ground, while His whole
   soul poured out the agonized petition, "O My Father, if it is possible,
   let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as You
   will."

   When our Lord Jesus was in this great distress of mind, in anticipation
   of the terrible sufferings He was about to endure, His Father spoke to
   Him. And when you are in your direst distress, God will speak to you.
   If you are His child, when the weakness of your flesh seems ready to
   prevail over your spirit, you, too, shall have a reassuring voice out
   of the excellent Glory even as your Master had. He seemed to recover
   Himself at once and, bracing Himself up, He indulged His heart again
   with a vision of the glorious result of His death. Then He uttered the
   happy words on which we are to meditate, tonight, in which He summed up
   the consequences of His death in these three points--"Now is the
   judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
   And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me."

   Let us, first, tonight, consider the threefold result of Christ's
   death. And when we have done that, let us think about Christ's death as
   it is described in our text.

   I. First, let US CONSIDER THE THREEFOLD RESULT OF CHRIST'S DEATH.

   There is, first, the judgment of the world-- "Now is the judgment of
   this world." If you like, you may read it, "crisis," for that is the
   Greek word used here--"Now is the crisis of this world." The world is
   sick. It grows worse and the physician says that its malady has come to
   a climax--it is a case of kill or cure. There was a crisis in the
   world's disease and that crisis was when Christ died! His death was the
   turning point, the hinge of the world's history. There have been many
   hinges in history--every nation has a hinge in its history--the Cross
   of Christ was the hinge of the world's history--it had reached the
   turning point. I thank God that the death of Christ was the future
   death of sin. When He died, the archenemy received his death stroke.
   That death was the bruising of Christ's heel, but in that death He
   bruised the old serpent's head.

   Now there is hope for the world--its crisis is passed! Now will the
   gods of the heathen fall! Now will the dark ignorance of men yield to
   the Light of the world! After this crisis there shall come a new Heaven
   and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness, for Christ's first coming
   is a pledge of His second coming wherein He will exterminate sin and
   make

   the wilderness and the solitary places to blossom as the rose. Thus we
   may render our Savior's words, "Now is the crisis of this world," the
   turning point, the hinge, on which all its history hangs. Still, I
   greatly prefer to keep to our old version, which is a translation
   whereas mine is only a borrowing of the original word "crisis."

   "Now is the judgment of this world." This means that when Christ died,
   the world that lies in the Wicked One, the ungodly world, was judged in
   this sense--first, it was convicted of being guiltiest of the guilty. I
   daresay you have heard people rise pretty phrases about the dignity of
   human nature and so on. They are lying phrases, for human nature is as
   bad as it can be. If you want the proof of that assertion, behold how
   God, Himself, came here among men, Incarnate Virtue robed in love! Did
   men love Him? Did they fall down before Him and do Him homage? The
   homage of the world was, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" The world hates
   virtue--it cannot bear perfection--it might endure benevolence, but
   absolute purity and righteousness it cannot! Its native instincts are
   wrong. It is not towards the Light of God that men are going--their
   backs are to the sun--they are journeying into the thick darkness.

   And, next, the world was convicted of the stupendous crime of murdering
   the Son of God! I will not call it regicide, but Deicide--and this is
   the crime of crimes. Truly was the world guilty of all that Prophets
   ever charged it with and much more. When wicked men slew the Prince of
   Life, the Holy One and the Just, then was it proven that the world is
   at heart, atheistic, that it hates God and would put God, Himself, to
   death if He were within its grasp. Thus did men put the Incarnate God
   to death when He submitted Himself to their power. You need not talk
   about the virtues of the world--it slew the Christ--and that is enough
   to condemn it. We need no other proof of its guilt. You cannot bring
   evidence more complete and overwhelming than this--they slew the Lord
   of Life and Glory--they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill Him
   and the inheritance shall be ours."

   Christ's death was the judgment of this world, next, by sentencing the
   world, for if Christ, who was perfectly innocent, must die when He
   stood in the sinner's place, what do you think, O guilty men, will you
   not, also, die? If the Well-Beloved of Heaven, bearing nothing but
   imputed guilt--sins not His own--must, nevertheless, be struck of God
   and afflicted and a voice must be heard, "Awake, O sword, against My
   Shepherd, and against the Man that is My Fellow, says the Lord of
   Hosts." If He must die on yonder cruel tree. If He must cry, "My God,
   My God, why have You forsaken Me?" then, be sure of this, there is
   wrath treasured up against the Day of Wrath and no soul of man that
   does evil shall go unpunished! Is there not a God who is the Judge of
   all the earth and who must do right? If it is right to strike the
   Innocent, who assumed the place of the guilty, it must surely be right
   that the truly guilty should die the death! "The soul that sins, it
   shall die." So there was not only the conviction, but also the sentence
   of the world, when Jesus died.

   And more than that, there is the final ending of the trial when the
   world rejects Christ. As long as you are here, my Hearers, and Christ
   is preached to you, there is hope for you. But in that day when you
   reject Christ, finally, and will have none of Him--when you cry, "Away
   with Him, away with Him! We will not be washed in His blood, we will
   not be clothed in His righteousness"--in that day you seal your doom
   and there remains no hope for you! There is one window in Heaven and
   through it streams the Light of Life, but if that is closed, no other
   will ever be opened! "There is none other name under Heaven given among
   men, whereby we must be saved." If you have, for the last time, put
   Christ away. If you have altogether done with Him, you have ended your
   probation, you have finished your trial, you have put out your last
   candle--you are forever doomed! When Christ is so rejected as actually
   to be made away with as He was upon the Cross, then is the judgment of
   this world.

   I wish that I had time to pause here to press these points upon you who
   belong to the world. There are but two parties, the world and the
   Church of God. If you are not of the Church of God, you belong to the
   world--and the world is judged by the death of Christ. If you are not a
   Christian, you are a member of that great corporation called the world.
   Men sometimes speak of a Christian world and an un-Christian world, a
   religious world and an irreligious world, a sporting world, a laughing
   world, a thieving world, a trading world--but all that is really of the
   world is outside the bounds of the Church of God! He who believes in
   Christ has escaped from the world. "They are not of the world, even as
   I am not of the world," said Christ concerning His disciples. But to
   the unbelieving Jews He said, "You are from beneath; I am from above:
   you are of this world; I am not of this world."

   Thus, you see the first result of the death of Christ is the world is
   judged, the world is convicted, the world is sentenced for its
   rejection of Christ. A Christ-rejecting world is a doomed world--may
   none of you belong to that world!

   The second result of Christ's death is the casting out of Satan--"Now
   shall the prince of this world be cast out." He who holds sway over it
   shall now lose his throne. The prince of this world is Satan, the
   archenemy of God and of man, but he is not always to reign as the
   prince of the power of the air, the chief of the rulers of the darkness
   of this world. He is to be cast out of his present dominions.

   By the death of Christ, Satan's accusations against Believers are
   answered. One of the practices in which he most delights is that of
   accusing the people of God and, alas, he has plenty of cause for his
   charges. But whenever he accuses us, our one answer is, "Jesus died."
   He says, "These people have sinned," and we reply, "True, but Jesus
   died for them." And the Cross of Christ stops the mouth of the accuser!
   Even a feeble saint, looking up to His crucified and risen Savior, can
   boldly sing--

   "I may my fierce accuser face, And tell Him you have died."

   Next, Christ's Cross spoils Satan of his universal monarchy. He could
   once lord it over the whole world and he does very much of that even
   now, but there is a people over whom he cannot sway his evil scepter!
   There is a race which has broken loose from him. They are free and they
   defy him to enslave them again. They care not for his threats, they are
   not to be won by his blandishments and though he worries and tempts
   them, yet he cannot destroy them--he can boast no longer of universal
   dominion! There is a Seed of the woman that has revolted from him, for
   Jesus, by His death, has redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy and
   they are free! I heard a story of an old black woman who was waiting
   upon a lady visiting friends in the South some time after the last
   great war in America. The lady said to the black servant, "You may very
   well wait upon a Northerner with great attention, for it is through us
   that you are free." "Free, Missy, free?" exclaimed the Negress, "I's a
   slave. I was born a slave." "Oh, but you are free! Do you not know that
   there has been an Act passed by which you are all free?" "Yes, I did
   hear something about dat and I said to old Massa, 'I hear dat we is all
   free.' He said, 'Stuff and nonsense,' so I's bin stoppin' here workin'
   for Him. Is it true, Missy, that we is all free?" "Oh, yes!" she
   answered, "you are all free, every slave is now free." "Then," said the
   woman, "I don't bin serve old Massa any longer; I bid Him 'Good-bye.'"
   And so it is when Christ sets us free--we do not serve the old massa,
   Satan, any longer--we bid him "Good-bye."

   When we are set free from the dominion of the devil, by the
   emancipating redemption of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Satan's
   tyrannical power is crippled. He still has great influence and he does
   his worst to injure the Kingdom of Christ by persecution, by false
   doctrine and by a thousand other methods, but Christ has broken his
   right arm--he cannot work as he once did and, more and more, as the
   fruit of the Redeemer's passion, Satan's power will be curtailed until,
   at last, he shall be utterly cast out and the triumphant shout shall be
   heard, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!" Let us never
   imagine that the devil is going to conquer in the great battle between
   right and wrong. God's Word tells us plainly enough what his end is to
   be--"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire
   and Brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
   tormented day and night forever and ever."

   Now, if any of you suffer through Satan tempting you to despair. If he
   comes to some of you and entices you to commit a sin which you hate,
   and against which you strive with all the might God gives you. If, by a
   mysterious force that you cannot comprehend, he seems to make you do
   other than you would--take courage and stand up against him, for when
   Jesus died, He said that, by His death, the Prince of Darkness was cast
   out and so He is! Sin shall not have dominion over you, nor shall
   Satan! Only be bold in resisting him, claim your liberty as a child of
   God and fight under the command of Christ, for the Cross is the
   conquering banner for all who would overthrow the power of Satan--

   "By all Hell's host withstood We all Hell's host overthrow! And
   conquering them, through Jesus' blood We still to conquer go."

   The third result of Christ's death is the central attraction of His
   Cross. "I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
   Me." Christ on the Cross has become the great magnet attracting men to
   Himself. What did He mean by this saying? Did He not mean that His
   sphere of influence would be widened? "While I am here," said He, "I
   draw a few men to Me. These fishermen have become My disciples, these
   Greeks have come to see Me, but when I am lifted up upon the Cross, I
   shall draw all men unto Me--men of all sorts, men out of all nations,
   multitudes of men, not only of this one age, but of all ages--till the
   world shall end! I shall become the center of a wider circle, a circle
   wide as the world. I shall

   draw all men unto Me." But why is it that Christ draws men to Himself?
   I answer that it is because, by dying on the Cross, He gave a new and
   brighter display of His love! Men came to Christ because of His love
   while He walked the earth--little children especially did--but after He
   had died that shameful death, how could they help coming to Him?
   "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man
   some would even dare to die. But God commends His love toward us, in
   that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." "Herein is love."
   And to all the ages the masterpiece of love is the dying Christ praying
   for His enemies, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
   do." Christ on the Cross draws sinners to Himself! Christ Crucified
   attracts through the infinite love to men which is displayed in that
   death!

   A part of the attraction lies in the wonderful blessings which come to
   us through Christ's death. We were drawn to Him because we received
   pardon through His wounds. We came to Him because we found eternal life
   through His death upon the tree. Jesus bore the sin of His people, He
   died in our place and, by doing so, He put away all our iniquities,
   blotted them out, cast them into the depths of the sea! Only as He was
   lifted up upon the Cross could that be said to be the case. But when He
   was crucified, He finished transgression, made an end of all, and
   brought in everlasting righteousness. Beloved, this is a great
   attraction to perishing sinners--it is a drawing of love to which they
   must yield. When Jesus thus attracts us, we run to Him because pardon
   and eternal life are to be found through His lifting up on the Cross. I
   would that some here might be drawn to Christ at this moment by the
   mighty magnet of His death. Remember how the poet sings of the
   attraction of the Cross--

   "So great, so vast a Sacrifice

   May well my hope revive.

   If God's own Son thus bleeds and dies,

   The Sinner surely may live!

   Oh, that these cords of love Divine

   Might draw me, Lord, to Thee!

   You have my heart, it shall be Yours,

   Yours it shall ever be!"

   The death of Christ attracted to Him multitudes of the sons of men
   because it expanded the hearts of His people. While He was alive and
   with them, they never burned with such enthusiasm as after He had died.
   One of the first effects of His death was the outpouring of the Spirit
   of God upon them, infusing them with new life, a holy fervor and a
   sacred enthusiasm which made them go unto the utmost ends of the earth,
   publishing among the Gentiles full redemption through His precious
   blood! Christ, when He was lifted up, made His followers disseminate
   themselves throughout all populations of the globe till their line went
   forth to the ends of the earth and, like the sun over every clime, so
   did the Gospel of Jesus Christ enlighten every nation under Heaven. "I,
   if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me." Christ is
   the Center of mankind! He is the Shiloh and unto Him shall the
   gathering of the people be! They shall come away from the abominations
   of Rome. They shall come away from the crescent of the false prophet.
   They shall come away from the idols of the dark places of the earth.
   They shall come away from infidelity and philosophy and shall come
   crowding to His dear feet as they feel the marvelous magnetism of His
   atoning death!

   These three things, then, resulted from the death of Christ--the wicked
   world was judged, the power of Satan was broken and Christ was made the
   central attraction of sinners to Himself--and that attracting power is
   working now! Oh, that these three wonders might be worked in our midst
   tonight, according to our measure!

   II. Now, in the second place, I want you, for a few minutes, to quietly
   THINK ABOUT THE DEATH OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AS DESCRIBED IN OUR
   TEXT.

   How much the Holy Spirit desires that we should read the Scriptures
   intelligently! He had recorded these Words of the Lord Jesus, "I, if I
   am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me." If that had
   been all, we might have asked--Does that lifting up from the earth mean
   Christ's death? Does it mean His ascension, His going up from the earth
   till the cloud received Him? Or does it mean our preaching of Christ,
   when we lift Him up before men, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness? So, to avoid all question, the Holy Spirit added the 33rd
   verse, "This He said, signifying what death He should die." If there is
   anything that the Spirit wishes us to be especially clear about, it is
   all expressions that have to do with our Lord's death. Let us thank Him
   for that comment inserted here, lest we should make any mistake upon so
   vital a subject.

   Now looking at the words, I want you to notice that Christ went to His
   death with a clear view of what it was to be. There is many a man who
   has rushed into the battle and died without any idea of what a gunshot
   wound would be, or what the piercing of a lance would be. But our Lord,
   as it were, took stock of His death and looked it calmly in the face.
   He does not speak of it as barely death, but He describes the manner of
   it--"I, if I am lifted up from the earth." In His own mind, He had gone
   through the nailing to the wood and He had come to the lifting up of
   that wood into the air, the fixing of its socket in the ground and, in
   spirit, He felt Himself already hanging there, lifted up from the
   earth. Just think of this wondrous fact, as Dr. Watts puts it--

   "This was compassion like a God,

   That when the Savior knew

   The price of pardon was His blood,

   His pity no'er withdrew."

   Knowing that His death was to be by crucifixion, He did not turn from
   it--He set His face like a flint to endure all that "the Cross" meant.
   He fully knew what it meant, but you and I do not. There are depths in
   His sufferings that must be unknown to us, but He knew them all and,
   with love that was strong as death, He went through it all for your
   redemption, O Believer! Then, love Him in return with a resolute,
   determined consecration of your whole being! Yield yourself up to Him,
   not spasmodically, but of love aforethought, to be wholly His! Somebody
   said to me, the other day, that all religion, nowadays, either suffered
   from paralysis or convulsions. I do not want you to have either of
   those complaints, though I like the convulsions better than the
   paralysis. Let us not have convulsed religion, but let us have strongly
   fixed principles, knowing what we have to do and why we do it, and
   then, like the Savior, let us go forward, expecting difficulty,
   expecting loss, expecting ridicule--but willingly and willfully facing
   it all for His dear sake, as He, on His part, endured even the Cross
   for our sake!

   Notice, next, that though our Savior knew the bitterness of His death,
   He read its issues in another light. "I, if I am lifted up"--do you
   catch the thought? He does not merely mean lifted up on the Cross, He
   means another kind of lifting up--He means being exalted! When He was
   lifted up upon the Cross, men thought it degradation, but He looked
   into His death as one looks into an opal till He sees wondrous rainbows
   and flames of fire in the precious stone. So Jesus looked into His
   passion till He saw His Glory! Down in the ruddy depths of that
   blood-cup, He saw that He was really being lifted up when men thought
   that He was being cast down. That crown of thorns was a more wondrous
   diadem than monarch ever wore! His Cross was His Throne. With His
   outspread hands, He ruled the nations and with His feet fixed there, He
   trampled on the enemies of men!

   O glorious Christ, when I have had a vision of Your Cross, I have seen
   it, at first, like a common gallows and You were hanging on it like a
   felon! But, as I have looked, I have seen it begin to rise and tower
   aloft till it has reached the highest Heaven and by its mighty power
   lifted up myriads to the Throne of God! I have seen its arms extend and
   expand until they have embraced all the earth! I have seen the foot of
   it go down deep as our helpless miseries are--and what a vision I have
   had of your magnificence, O Crucified One! As Jesus looked forward to
   His death, He saw more than we can even now see in it and He perceived
   that it was His Glory to be lifted up on the Cross of Calvary!

   Further, He beheld in it the supply of our great need. "I, if I am
   lifted up from the earth, will draw." He saw that we were far away and
   could not, of ourselves, come near, so He said, "If I am lifted up, I
   will draw them." He saw that we would not wish to come; that we would
   be so hard-hearted and stiff-necked that we would not come if we were
   called! "But," He said, "I, from the Cross, will draw them. As a magnet
   draws steel, I will attract them." Oh, think of the Cross of Christ in
   that light! Some have thought that if we preach the Gospel, we shall
   always have a congregation. I am not sure of that, but if the Gospel
   does not attract a congregation, I do not know what will. But Christ
   does not say, "I, if I am lifted up, will draw all men to little
   Bethel, or to Salem." He says, "I will draw all men unto Me," that is,
   to Himself--and we only come to Christ because Christ comes to us!

   No man ever comes to Christ unless Christ draws Him and the only magnet
   that Christ ever uses is Himself. I do believe that we slander Christ
   when we think that we are to draw the people by something else but the
   preaching of Christ Crucified. We know that the greatest crowd in
   London has been held together these 30 years by nothing but the
   preaching of Christ Crucified. Where is our music? Where is our
   oratory? Where is anything of attractive architecture, or beauty of
   ritual? "A bare service," they call it. Yes, but Christ makes up for
   all deficiencies! Preach Christ and men will be drawn to Him, for so
   the text says, "I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
   unto Me." They are held back

   by Satan, but the Cross will draw them. They are held back by despair,
   but the Cross will attract them. They are held back by lack of desire,
   but the Cross will breed desire. They are held back by love of sin, but
   the Cross will make them hate the sin that crucified the Savior. "I
   will draw them. All sorts of men I will draw unto Myself," says the
   Crucified Christ. Thus He supplies our great need.

   Observe, too, that Jesus knew that He would live to exercise that
   attraction. He says, "I, if I am lifted up from the earth"--what then?
   "Shall I be dead? No, "I will draw all men unto Me." He lives! Going to
   death, He expects to live, He glories in His life, He tells of what He
   means to do after He is risen from the dead! O glorious Christ, to look
   beyond Your death and find comfort in Your risen life! Cannot you, my
   Brothers, my Sisters, sometimes look beyond the grave and find comfort
   in what you will do in Heaven? Oh, will we not glorify our Lord in
   Heaven? In the anticipation of what we will do in honor of our precious
   Savior, let us now take up arms against our present trouble, borrowing
   our weapons from the armory of the future after our earthly life is
   over!

   Jesus saw, too, (and here I must finish), that the day would come when
   He would be surrounded by a mighty company. Can you not see Him? He is
   lifted up upon the Cross and He begins to draw--and men come to Him, a
   few at Jerusalem--no, did I say, "a few"?--three thousand in one day!
   The Crucified has pierced their hearts; the Crucified has begotten
   faith in them; the Crucified has drawn thousands to Himself! He is
   preached in Damascus. He is preached at An-tioch, Corinth, Rome--and
   everywhere He is preached, He draws sinners to Himself--and great
   companies come to Him! By-and-by He is preached in far-off
   Britain--some pioneer evangelist finds a place in these islands where
   he can preach to the uncivilized, the Gospel of Christ--and Jesus draws
   them to Himself! He draws men till, all over Rome's vast empire, Christ
   crucified is drawing them from Caesar's palace and from Caesar's
   prison! From the slave at the mill to the senator who rules the city,
   Christ is drawing them!

   The kings who wear their crowns by permission of the Roman power--some
   of them bow before King Jesus--He is drawing them! The people on the
   isles of the sea and on every coast, He is drawing them. And today He
   is still drawing them! From the sunny islands of the southern sea, from
   the far north of Greenland, from Africa, from China, from everywhere,
   He draws them more and more! And here, in this, our favored island, He
   has drawn myriads to Himself, but the day shall come when that drawing
   power will begin to operate yet more freely. They shall run to Him!
   They shall fly to Him with swift wings, as doves fly to their cots.
   They shall come to Him as on a sudden, till the Church shall cry in
   astonishment, "Who has begotten me these? These, where had they been?"

   As the drops of the morning dew are seen, glittering like diamonds on
   every hedge, and on every blade of grass, when once the sun is up, so
   shall Christ's converts be, like Abraham's promised seed, "so many as
   the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the
   seashore, innumerable." Christ's people shall be willing in the day of
   His power and the great attraction by which they will be drawn to Him
   will be His death on the Cross! Oh, that He would draw many to Himself
   tonight! Let this be our prayer to Him--

   "Dear Savior, draw reluctant hearts. To You let sinners fly And take
   the bliss Your love imparts And drink, and never die!"

   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 12:19-43.

   Our Lord raised Lazarus from the dead and this miracle made a great
   sensation among the people. They came to meet Jesus, waving palm
   branches before Him, and all Jerusalem was on a stir.

   Verses 19-22. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive
   you how you prevail nothing? Behold, the world is gone after Him. And
   there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the
   feast: the same came, therefore, to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
   Galilee, and desired Him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. Philip went
   and told Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus. These were
   probably Gentiles who were staying at Jerusalem--perhaps proselytes who
   had come up to the feast. They were touched by the common feeling; they
   desired to see this wonderful Man

   who had raised to life one who had been dead four days. They proceeded
   courteously. They went to one of Christ's disciples who, coming from
   Galilee of the Gentiles, would be likely to sympathize with them, and
   they sought an introduction to Jesus. This Philip obtained for them
   with the help of Andrew.

   23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come that the Son of
   Man should be glorified. He knew that the hour was come when He must
   die. Looking through the dark glass of Death, He saw what its result
   would be and He called it Glory! These few Greeks were the advance
   guard of the great Gentile army of the Lord--He regarded their coming
   in that sense.

   24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat falls into
   the ground and dies, it abides alone: but if it dies, it brings forth
   much fruit. Telling them that the source of His Glory would be His
   death. The reason why the people would hear of Him and come to Him, was
   that He would be hanged on the Cross. The grain of wheat, when put into
   the ground, if it remains as it is, will never increase--it must die if
   it is to bring forth fruit. What is death? The end of existence? None
   but thoughtless persons imagine that! Death is the resolution of any
   living substance into its primary elements. It is the division of the
   soul from the body--originally it was the division of the soul from
   God. In a grain of wheat, death is the separation of the particles of
   which it is composed, that the life-germ may feed upon that which was
   provided for it. "If it dies," in the true sense of the word, in being
   separated into its constituent elements, then, "it brings forth much
   fruit." Christ's way to Glory was through the grave. He must go down
   that He might mount to the Throne of God.

   25. He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in
   this world shall keep it unto life eternal. Live for this world and you
   shall lose this world and the next, too! Live for the world to come and
   you shall, in the highest sense, gain both worlds!

   26. If any man serves Me, let him follow Me. That is the best kind of
   service--to do what Christ did and to do what Christ bids you do--"If
   any man serves Me, let Him follow Me."

   26. And where I am, there shall also My servant be: if any man serve
   Me, Him will My Father honor. Follow Christ, then, to the Cross. Follow
   Him to the grave. Follow Him in His humiliation and then the Father
   will honor you even as He honored His Son.

   27. Now is My soul troubled. Or, puzzled. This hour of His Glory was
   the hour of His passion, too.

   27. And what shall I say? Such sorrow was in His heart that He asked,
   "What shall I say?" Great trouble brings astonishment, amazement,
   bewilderment with it--and the human soul of Christ felt as ours feels
   when in great agony.

   27. Father, save Me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this
   hour. Nature suggests the cry, "Father, save Me from this hour." Grace
   comes behind the flesh, being a little slower to speak, but it corrects
   the errors of the flesh and says, "For this cause came I unto this
   hour."

   28. Father, glorify Your name. What a prayer! Jesus swallows up His
   temptation to escape the cup by this all-absorbing petition, "Father,
   glorify Your name."

   28. 29. Then came there a voice from Heaven, saying, I have both
   glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that
   stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered. They only heard the
   sound and it was like thunder in their ears.

   29. Others said, An angel spoke to Him. They distinguished the sound of
   someone speaking, but they did not recognize the voice of God.

   30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of Me, but for
   your sakes. "To make you believe that God is with Me and that I am His
   Son."

   31-34. Now is the Judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
   world be cast out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw
   all men unto Me. This He said, signifying what death He should die. The
   people answered Him, we have heard out of the Law that Christ abides
   forever: and how say You, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this
   Son of Man? As if it could not be true that Christ, in His Divine
   Nature, abides forever, and yet, as Man, could be lifted up to die! It
   was a sneering question, "Who is this Son of Man?" Our Lord did not
   answer it, thus teaching us that some people are not worth answering.
   Instead of replying to their question, Jesus gave them a practical
   admonition.

   35, 36. Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the Light with
   you. Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness come upon you: for he
   that walks in darkness knows not where he goes. While you have Light,
   believe in the Light, that you may be the children of Light. These
   things spoke Jesus and departed, and did hide Himself from them. When
   people determine to reject Christ, He leaves them! Why should He tarry
   where He is rejected? He "departed, and did hide Himself."

   37-41. But though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they
   believed not on Him; that the saying of Isaiah the Prophet might be
   fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to
   whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not
   believe, because that Isaiah said again, He has blinded their eyes, and
   hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor
   understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
   These things said Isaiah, when he saw His glory, and spoke of Him.
   Christ is in the Old Testament in many places where, as yet, even we
   have never seen Him. I doubt not that He lies hidden away in many a
   Psalm, and many a prophetic utterance that has not yet been fully
   expounded, or even comprehended by our finite minds. Oh, for eyes to
   see Him where He sits in His ancient state! What a solemn fact this is,
   though, that God allows men to be given over to blindness of eyes and
   hardness of heart! I sometimes fear that it is so with this age. Men
   will not see--they will not believe! They are desperately set on
   skepticism--it has become a fashion with them. Like a torrent, it
   sweeps through the very churches that bear the name of Christ! My fear
   is God, in His wrath, may give up our land to this curse, and then
   where will our hope be?

   42, 43. Nevertheless among the chief rulers, also, many believed on
   Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they
   should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men
   more than the praise of God. I wonder whether in this throng there are
   any of this kind who believe in Christ, and yet never come out and
   confess Him because they love the praise of men more than the praise of
   God? If so, I venture to say that they are found among what are called
   the more respectable people, the men of light and leading, the chief
   rulers. Among the common people there is very little of this evil. They
   will generally confess what they believe and bravely come forward to
   declare that they belong to Christ! It is the chief rulers, the
   gentlemen of the Sanhedrim, who, if they believe in Christ in their
   hearts, do not confess Him, lest they should be put out of society, for
   they love the praise of men more than the praise of God.

Baptism Essential To Obedience

   (No. 2339)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORDS'S-DAY, DECEMBER 17, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 13, 1889.

   "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." Mark 16:16.

   IF our congregations were what they ought to be, it would be a very
   simple matter to preach, for a sermon would then only need to be like
   the orders given by a commanding officer to his troops--short, sharp,
   plain, clear, distinct! Our hearers would not need illustrations and
   metaphors--they would simply ask to be told what they must do to be
   saved--and the more plainly they could be told, the better pleased
   would they be. I am going to try, this evening, to preach that kind of
   sermon, sinking the preacher into the teller of good news, plainly
   speaking of the way of salvation. If you want to be saved, listen to my
   message. If you do not care for salvation, yet, perhaps, while you hear
   it, you may be set a-longing, and God may bless you. My text is
   preceded and followed by other important words, "Go you into all the
   world and preach the Gospel to every creature. He who believes and is
   baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned."

   The Gospel, then, is for "every creature." Wherever there is a man,
   woman, or child--an intelligent creature--the Gospel is to be preached
   to such a person. You who are gathered tonight are clearly within that
   description and, therefore, the Gospel is to be preached to you. But if
   we are commanded to preach it, it is implied that you are commanded to
   hear it! To hear it without attention--to hear it without resolving to
   obey it--will be useless work. Hear it, therefore, as I desire to
   preach it, remembering that Christ stands here to hear me preach and to
   mark how you accept the message from Himself that I am to deliver.

   This Gospel is sent to every creature because every creature needs it.
   Whether the creature knows it or not, he is lost--lost by nature and
   lost by practice, too--so much lost that he cannot save himself! He
   needs to be saved. Will you all believe that? If you have not believed
   in Christ, you are lost, and you cannot save yourself. Begin by
   believing that fact. But then rejoice that there is sent to you a
   Gospel which can save you, a Gospel which is adapted and meant for the
   salvation ofjust such a person as you are, for to you God says--"He who
   believes and is baptized shall be saved."

   My fellow Christians, you who have believed in Christ, it is time for
   us to bestir ourselves, for we have not preached the Gospel to every
   creature, yet, by any stretch of the imagination! Some persons have
   never preached it to anybody-- some, I mean, of the very persons who
   are commanded to preach it to every creature! A quaint preacher says
   that if some of God's people were paid ten dollars an hour for all that
   they have done for their Lord, they have not earned enough, yet, to buy
   a gingerbread cake, and I am afraid that statement is true. So very
   little have some persons done for the spread of the Gospel that the
   world is none the better for their being in it! Do I speak too
   severely? If I do, you can easily pass over what I say, but if not, if
   it is so that any here have never yet fairly and squarely spoken of the
   Gospel of Jesus Christ, begin at once!

   When you get home, tonight, speak of the Gospel to your nearest
   relative, and go out, tomorrow, to your next door neighbor, or to the
   friend whom you can most easily reach, and tell them of the good news
   that your Lord has revealed to you, and so help to preach the Gospel to
   every creature! An army chaplain once said to the Duke of Wellington,
   "Do you think that it is of any use our taking the Gospel to the hill
   tribes in India? Will they ever receive it?" The duke replied, "What
   are your marching orders?" That was the only answer he gave! Stern
   disciplinarian as that great soldier was, he only needed marching
   orders and he obeyed--and he meant that every soldier of the Cross must
   obey the marching or-

   ders of Christ, his great Commander. Go you, therefore, as far as your
   position and capabilities allow you, and tell to every creature the
   word of the Gospel as it is recorded in my text, "He who believes and
   is baptized shall be saved."

   I want to do my part, tonight, as far as my feeble voice will permit
   me. And I will speak a few words, first, concerning belief. Secondly,
   concerning Baptism. And, thirdly, concerning being saved. We shall get
   the whole text clearly in considering those three points.

   I. First, CONCERNING BELIEVING. This is the main point. This is the
   hinge of salvation, for he that believes in Christ is not condemned--he
   that believes in Him has everlasting life.

   Now, concerning believing, let me, ask, first, What is to be believed?
   Well, you are to believe that you have broken the Law of God and that,
   consequently, you are under condemnation. But that God, in His infinite
   mercy, has sent His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world that you might
   live through Him. His Divine Son--His only-begotten Son--was born of
   Mary, as a Man of the substance of His mother, feeling as we do and
   was, in all respects, most truly Man. Being here, He obeyed His
   Father's will and, when the time came, He gave Himself up as a
   Sacrifice for guilty men. He died, "the Just for the unjust, that He
   might bring us to God." Himself being without sin, He took upon Himself
   the sin of His people-- "Who His own self bore our sins in His own body
   on the tree." Being found with human sin imputed to Him, He suffered in
   the place of those whose sins He bore. On the Cross His blood was
   shed--for without the shedding of blood there is no remission of
   sin--and by that shedding of blood He blotted out the iniquity of all
   those who put their trust in Him. This is what you have to believe,
   that--

   "He bore, that you might never bear, His Father's righteous ire."

   He was laid in the grave and on the third day He came forth from the
   tomb, rising, again, for the justification of His people as He was
   crucified for their offenses. After a while He went up into the highest
   Heaven and He is now enthroned there, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.
   He sits at the right hand of God, even the Father, and there He pleads
   and makes intercession for sinners. Believe this--"Through this Man is
   preached unto you the forgiveness of sins." He is exalted on high, a
   Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and remission of sins. That is
   what is to be believed. I might go into a great many details, but I
   shall not do so tonight. The essence of what is to be believed is that
   Jesus Christ is given of God unto us, that by His death He might put
   away sin and we might be reconciled to God--and that whoever believes
   in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life!

   That I may answer this question better, let me correct it, or turn it
   into another, and then answer that. The question is not so much what is
   to be believed, as Who is to be believed? For, in very deed, the
   believing of a certain thing to be true, though that may be helpful, is
   not the whole of the matter. I, believing a thing to be true, trust
   myself to that truth--there is faith, the act of trust. But if we would
   be saved, we must trust a Person! We must trust the Lord Jesus Christ.
   You are not so much saved by believing a doctrine as by trusting a
   Person--you must believe the dogma, or you will not trust the Person,
   but, believing the doctrine, you then come, and put your trust in the
   Person about whom that doctrine is taught. If you would be saved, trust
   yourself with Jesus Christ! He, who died, lives, and, "He is able to
   save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him." Saving faith
   is trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ--trusting Him truly, wholly,
   solely, constantly--trusting Him now! Behold Him, then, the Son of God,
   enthroned in Glory! Lay your soul and all its sins at His dear feet and
   trust in Him to save you--and He will do it!

   Many will ask a third question--Why is He to be trusted? I should like
   to answer that by another--Why is He not to be trusted? When one said
   to me, the other day, "I cannot trust Christ," I enquired, "Can you
   trust me?" And when the quick reply was, as it ought to be from a
   hearer to a minister, "Yes, Sir, I do trust you," I said, "Well, then,
   you certainly can trust the Lord Jesus Christ, for He is infinitely
   more worthy of being trusted than ever I can be." Cannot trust Christ?
   That is a wonderful piece of Satanic delusion! I can say, tonight, that
   I can not only trust my soul to Christ, but that if I had as many souls
   as there are grains of sand on the seashore, I could implicitly trust
   them all to Him! Why should I not? He is "God over all, blessed
   forever," and He is Man, tender and gentle--therefore He ought to be
   trusted. O my Hearer, can you look the Crucified Christ in the face and
   say that you cannot trust Him? Can you see the bloody sweat in the
   garden? Can you gaze upon the nailed hands and feet and pierced side of
   this suffering Man, who is, at the same time, very God of very God, and
   can you then say that it is hard to trust Him? Oh, no! He is so true,
   so noble, so generous, so faithful that I beseech you to trust Him, and
   to trust Him now!

   That raises another question--When is Christ to be trusted? And the
   answer is, NOW! He was never more worthy to be trusted than He is
   tonight and you never more needed a Savior than you do tonight. You
   are, perhaps, talking about trusting Christ at some future time. You
   tell me that you do not trust So-and-So, but that you hope to trust him
   one of these days. I will not give a penny for such a hope as that! No,
   Friend, if at any future time you should deem Christ worthy of your
   confidence, He is worthy of your trust, tonight, for He is the same
   yesterday, today and forever. Just as you are, in that pew, or sitting
   in the aisle, Christ deserves your confidence--and I pray you to give
   it to Him. Cast your guilty soul on Him this very moment! Live not
   another second in unbelief, for that unbelief is a slander on my Lord,
   a grievous injury to His dear, faithful love. Now, while the word is
   leaving my lips--as it reaches your ears--say and mean it, "I do
   believe. I will trust Jesus. I yield myself to Christ and take Him to
   be my Savior."

   "If I do that," says one, "When will the blessing come?" The text says,
   "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," and the blessing will
   come at once! Swift as the lightning flash is the act which saves the
   soul! One moment a man may be black with accumulated sin--the next
   moment he may be white as the driven snow. It takes no time for God to
   blot out iniquity. We pass in an instant from death to life, from
   darkness into marvelous light! I am praying that while I speak to you
   in feebleness, God may work with His almighty power--with that right
   hand that tore the Red Sea in two--that the ransomed of the Lord might
   cross over dry-shod! May He come and save the people made ready by His
   Grace for this night of His glorious power, leading them immediately to
   believe and giving them, at once, as the result of their faith,
   reconciliation to God and justification by Christ Jesus!

   Here let me correct a mistake into which some people fall. They say,
   "Do you exhort us to believe?" I do, indeed, with all my heart. "But,
   Sir, faith is the work of the Spirit of God." Yes, did I ever say that
   it was not? I insist upon it continually that, wherever there is any
   faith, it is worked in us by the Spirit of God. But listen. Did I ever
   tell you the Spirit of God believed for us, or did you ever read
   anything in Scripture approximating to that statement? No, the Spirit
   of God leads us to believe, but we distinctly believe--and it is our
   faith that saves us--it is not that the Holy Spirit believes instead of
   us and we lie still, like a man under the surgeon's knife. Oh, dear,
   no! Every faculty is awakened and awakened by the Spirit of God! We see
   that Christ can save and we believe it. We believe that He will save
   and we trust Him to save us. It is our own act and deed--it cannot be
   anybody else's act and deed. You cannot believe for another! There can
   be nothing like sponsorship, here, and the Holy Spirit, Himself, cannot
   believe for you! It is not written, "Let the Holy Spirit believe for
   you." That would be absurd! But it is written, "Believe you." "Believe
   on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." With your own proper
   mind and heart you must believe in Jesus Christ if you would be saved.

   I do not know that I need say more concerning believing. I have often
   tried to explain it, but I am afraid that I have not always made it as
   plain as I have intended. Only let me warn you not to say, "I
   understand the plan of salvation very well. Dear Sir, I am sure I do! I
   do not need it explained to me, I understand it perfectly." My dear
   Friend, it is one thing to understand the plan of salvation and quite
   another thing to believe in Jesus Christ to the salvation of your soul.
   It is a pitiless night, the rain is pouring down and here is a man,
   sitting out in the street, exposed to the ill weather, and he has got a
   plan of a house down there on the wet pavement. And He says, "I am all
   right! I understand the plan of a house quite well." You see, he is
   looking at the plan--he has a view of the front of the house--he knows
   where the windows and doors should be. And he has a ground plan, too!
   He can see where the kitchen is and the passage to the kitchen. And he
   knows the arrangement of all the rooms. But, my dear Fellow, you are
   getting wet through and through from the raging storm--why do you not
   go into the house for shelter? "Do not talk to me," he says, "I
   understand the plan of a house very well." The man is a fool if he
   talks like that! Everybody concludes that he is out of his mind and
   what is he who is satisfied with understanding the plan of salvation,
   but who does not come to Christ and put his trust in Him? Come to Him
   now, I beseech you! You who do not know so much about the plan of
   salvation, come to Jesus--come and trust Him--trust Him now!

   II. Now, in the second place, a little CONCERNING BAPTISM--"He who
   believes and is baptized shall be saved."

   Please observe that I did not make the text. Perhaps if I had made it,
   I should have left out that piece about Bap-tism--but I have had no
   hand in making the Bible--I am obliged to take God's Word as I find it.
   And here I read these words of our Lord Jesus Christ, "He who believes
   and is baptized shall be saved." "Do not dwell on the Baptism," says
   one--"leave that out." That is what you say, my dear Sir. I cannot see
   your face, but I do not believe that you are my

   master. My Master is the Lord who taught holy men to write this Book
   and I can only go by the Book! The Book has the Baptism in it, so I
   must stick to the Truth of God as it is in the Book--"He who believes
   and is baptized shall be saved."

   First, let me remind you that our Savior's words teach us that Baptism
   follows faith--"He who believes and is baptized." Never neglect the
   order of things in the Bible! If God puts them one, two, three--do not
   you put them three, two, one. You never had a servant, I hope, who
   twisted your orders out of order. Did you ever say to her, "Mary, now
   go and sweep the parlor, and afterwards take the duster and dust the
   table, and the shelves and the books"? Did she come to you, some time
   later, and say, "Madam, I have done as you commanded me. I dusted the
   table, the shelves and the books, and then I swept the room"? Every
   good housewife here knows what would happen from turning the orders
   upside down in that fashion!

   Now, a great many in the Christian Church at the present day have put
   it thus--"He that is baptized and believes." I am not one of those
   maidservants. I dare not turn my Master's orders upside down! You have
   no right to baptize people till they have believed in Christ as their
   Savior. Remember how Philip put it to the Ethiopian eunuch when that
   worthy man said, "See, here is water; what does hinder me to be
   baptized?" Philip answered, "If you believe with all your heart, you
   may." And if you do not believe with all your heart, you ought not to
   be baptized--you have no right to this ordinance of Christ unless you
   are a Christian! "He who believes and is baptized"--that is the
   Scriptural order. Read the New Testament impartially and you will
   always find that those who were baptized were Believers. They believed
   in the Lord Jesus Christ and then they were baptized into the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

   Next, I would have you notice that this matter of Baptism is often
   linked with faith. Over and over again it is put so in the New
   Testament! There are passages which I will not quote tonight, in which
   Baptism has a peculiar prominence given to it in connection with the
   work of salvation. It might have been put, "He who believes and comes
   to the Communion Table shall be saved," but it is not so written. Some
   churches have exalted what they call, "The Holy Eucharist," into a very
   elevated position, indeed--far beyond what Scripture has ever accorded
   to it--yet the Lord's Supper has never had given to it in the Word of
   God the position of being put side by side with faith as Baptism is in
   this and other passages. I am not going to dwell upon that point,
   tonight. I merely tell you what is the teaching of the New Testament.
   You shall give your own account of it if you please, but our appeal is,
   "to the Law and to the Testimony!"

   This much, also, I must say, that it is not possible that there can be
   anything saving in the Baptism, itself. The act of applying water in
   anyway whatever cannot wash away a single sin! That would be going back
   to the old Covenant of Works, the old ceremonies of the Mosaic Law. All
   the washings under the law--and they were very many--never washed one
   sin away! Nor can any washing in water take away the sin of any man.
   Even the tears of Christ are never spoken of as putting away sin--it is
   His precious blood, alone, that cleanses away the sin of men. In my
   text, while it says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved,"
   yet, when the condemnation is announced, it is simply, "He who believes
   not shall be damned," and the matter of Baptism is not mentioned, for
   there are many who believe, but who are not baptized, and who cannot
   be--as the dying thief, for instance--yet are they assuredly saved.
   Nevertheless, here stands my text and I cannot alter it, "He who
   believes and is baptized shall be saved."

   Why do you suppose that Baptism is put into this prominent position? I
   think that it is for this reason--Baptism is the outward expression of
   the inward faith. He who believes in Christ with his heart confesses
   his faith before God and before the Church of God by being baptized.
   Now, the faith that speaks thus is not a dumb faith. It is not a
   cowardly faith. It is not a sneaking faith. Paul puts the matter thus,
   "If you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe
   in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be
   saved. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation."

   But why is confession so necessary to prove true faith? I answer that
   it is necessary to the very existence of the Church of God, for, if I
   may be a Believer and never confess my faith, you may be a Believer and
   never confess your faith--and all round we should thus have a company
   of men believing, but none of them confessing! And where would be the
   outward ordinances of the Church of Christ at all? Where would be any
   minister? Where would be the setting up and growing of the Kingdom of
   Christ? For a hundred reasons, it is absolutely necessary for Christ's
   Kingdom that the Believer should openly confess his faith. Do you not
   see that? And therefore, Baptism being God's way of our openly
   confessing our faith, He requires it to be added to faith that the
   faith may be a confessing faith, not a cowardly faith--that the faith
   may be an open faith, not a private faith--that so the faith may be a
   working faith, influencing our life and the life of others, and

   not a mere secret attempt for self-salvation by a silent faith which
   dares not acknowledge Christ. Remember those words of the Lord Jesus,
   "Whoever, therefore, shall confess Me before men, Him will I confess,
   also, before My Father which is in Heaven. But whoever shall deny Me,"
   (and in that place it means, "He who does not confess Me"), "before
   men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in Heaven." There
   is, therefore, no regenerating efficacy about water, or about
   immersion, or about Baptism in any shape or form--but it is necessary
   as the outward visible expression of the inward spiritual faith by
   which the soul is saved!

   And, dear Friends, once more, Baptism is often the test of obedience.
   He who believes in Christ takes Him to be his Master as well as his
   Savior. And Christ, therefore, says to him, "Go and do so-and-so." If
   the man refuses to do it, he thereby proves that he does not intend to
   be the disciple of the Master. "Oh!" says one, "you know that Baptism
   is a non-essential." Have I not begged you to cease such idle and
   wicked talk as that? Have you a servant? Do you go to business early in
   the morning? Do you like a cup of tea at six o'clock, before you start
   for the city? The maid does not bring it to you and you ask, "Why have
   I not had my tea brought to me?" "Oh," she answers, "it is
   non-essential. You can do your business very well without that cup of
   tea." Let such a reply as that be repeated, or let it be given only
   once, and I will tell you what will be non-essential! It will be
   non-essential for you to keep that girl any longer in your house! You
   will want another servant, for you will say, "Clearly she is no servant
   of mine! She sets herself up as the mistress of the house, for she
   begins to judge my commands and to say that this one is essential, and
   that one is not essential."

   What do you mean by, "non-essential"? "I mean that I can be saved
   without being baptized." Will you dare to say that wicked sentence over
   again? "I mean that I can be saved without being baptized." You evil
   creature! So you will do nothing that Christ commands if you can be
   saved without doing it? You are hardly worth saving at all! A man who
   always needs to be paid for what he does--whose one idea of religion is
   that he will do what is essential to his own salvation--only cares to
   save his own skin and insinuates Christ may go where He likes! Clearly,
   you are no servant of His! You need to be saved from such a
   disreputable, miserable state of mind--and may the Lord save you!

   Oftentimes, I believe that this little matter of Believers' Baptism is
   the test of the sincerity of our profession of love to Him. It would
   have been all the same, it may be, if the Lord Jesus Christ had said,
   "Pick up six stones off the ground and carry them in your pocket and
   you shall be saved." Somebody would have said, "That stone-picking is a
   non-essential." It becomes essential as soon as Christ commands it! It
   is in this way that Baptism, if not essential to your salvation, is
   essential to your obedience to Christ. If you have become His disciple,
   you are bound to obey all your Master's com-mands--"Whatever He says
   unto you, do it."

   III. Now, lastly, CONCERNING BEING SAVED--"He who believes and is
   baptized shall be saved."

   What is this being saved? Well, it means, of course, what everyone
   wants it to mean, salvation from the punishment of sin. "He who
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." His transgressions shall be
   forgiven him, his iniquity shall be blotted out, he shall not be
   brought into condemnation--and in the Last Great Day he shall be
   justified in Christ. No, he is justified now, as the Apostle says,
   "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ." That is certainly a part of this being saved.

   It means, next, that he that believes and is baptized shall have
   salvation from the dominion of his old nature. When you believe in
   Christ, there shall suddenly spring up in you a new life, a new
   principle--a well shall be dug within your being and a fountain of
   Living Water shall begin to bubble up within you unto life everlasting!
   A miracle shall be worked upon you--there shall come into your heart
   the Holy Spirit who shall dwell there to re-create you, to set up
   within your soul a new throne whereon shall reign a new King! The old
   dominion of sin shall be broken as with a rod of iron and there shall
   be a new order of things within your heart--righteousness shall begin
   to reign there by Jesus Christ.

   "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." That is, he shall
   have salvation from his old sins. He shall no longer be the slave of
   drunkenness. He shall get the love of swearing by the throat. He shall
   have his lying, his anger, his passion under his feet. "He who believes
   and is baptized" shall see all his old adversaries put to the rout and
   what he could not do, through the weakness of his flesh, shall be done
   for him by the power of the Spirit of God! And by Divine Grace he shall
   master his sins. He shall begin to live unto God, under new impulses,
   strengthened with a new power and so he shall be delivered from his old
   sins.

   Listen again, for this is wonderful. "He who believes and is baptized
   shall be saved"--he shall have salvation from going back to his old
   sins. If it were not for the Final Perseverance of the Saints, I should
   think my Gospel a poor Gospel

   to preach, but he who truly believes in Christ shall have such a change
   worked in him that the blessed work shall never be undone! My Lord
   shall light such a candle in your heart that the devil, himself, shall
   never be able to blow it out! Christ shall come to you with such power
   and authority and set up His eternal Throne in your soul with such
   Divine majesty and might that you shall be His in time and throughout
   eternity. We preach about no temporary salvation, no work of Grace
   that, by-and-by, will grow feeble and lose its power! We tell of a work
   of Grace that shall enable you who believe to go on from strength to
   strength, from glory to glory, till every sin in you shall be driven
   out and you shall be made perfectly like your Lord! Then shall you
   behold His face in righteousness and be with Him forever and ever.

   Once more, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved"--he shall
   have salvation from the age in which he lives. "But," says one, "I do
   not want to be saved from that." You don't? "No." But if you go with
   the age and go with the world, you will go down the Niagara which this
   age is just now shooting--down to the destruction to which this world
   is doomed! Cherish not the friendship of the world that slew your Lord,
   for the world and the works that are in it shall be burned up. You
   remember how Peter said, on the day of Pentecost, "Save yourselves from
   this untoward generation"? That is what I want you to do tonight! "With
   many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save yourselves
   from this untoward generation." A man who wishes to be a man and who
   desires to be a saved man, has to take up arms against this evil age!
   He who would prove himself to be alive unto God must swim against the
   current of the times! Dead fish go down stream--can't you see them? I
   see the white bellies of the dead fish floating down by myriads! But
   the living fish goes up the stream, against the current, and finds his
   way to purer waters! Beloved, he who believes in Jesus Christ with all
   his heart shall be made to play the man where men are now so few--and
   to stand fast for God and His Truth where others yield to the Satanic
   power--and to be holy where ungodliness, like a mighty torrent, now
   sweeps down our streets! "He who believes and is baptized" into the
   adorable name of Jesus, swears, as a Red Cross Knight, to follow
   Christ, and Christ, alone--believing in Him though every man is a
   liar--and resolving for Him to live, for Him to die and in Him to find
   hope here and eternal happiness hereafter! He is the man who shall be
   saved from this present evil age to the Glory of God the Father.

   All this great work is worked by faith in Christ--that is the one way
   of salvation! "He who believes on the Son has everlasting life."
   Believe in Him, as men sometimes say, "up to the hilt." Believe in His
   Manhood sympathizing with you. Believe in His Godhead able to help you.
   Believe in His blood cleansing you. Believe in His eternal life
   bringing everlasting life to you. God bless you, everyone, for His dear
   Son's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN3:1-18.

   If you were called in to see a person who was dying and wished to read
   a chapter from the Word of God, but you were afraid that the sick one
   did not know the way of salvation, you could not select a better
   portion than the one we are about to read. I have chosen it in the hope
   that some may now learn from it what they must do to be saved.

   Verses 1, 2. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler
   of the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night. Perhaps he was very busy
   during the day. It is better to come to Jesus at night than not to come
   to Him at all. All hours are convenient to Christ--you may come to Him
   when you are at home tonight. When everybody else is asleep, Jesus is
   still awake. In all probability, however, Nicodemus did not wish to
   commit himself by coming to Christ by day. He had not yet tried and
   tested Him, so he would not be thought to be Christ's follower till he
   had, first, had a quiet private talk with Him. As a ruler of the Jews,
   he was wise in acting thus discreetly.

   2. And said unto Him, Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from
   God: for no man can do these miracles that You do, except God is with
   him. He admitted the truth as far as he could see it. The miracles of
   Christ proved Him to be a Divinely-commissioned teacher. Always be
   willing to go as far as you can go in the pursuit of the Truth of God.
   If you cannot see everything at once, see all that you can see. Be not
   of a caviling spirit--be frank and teachable as this man was.

   3. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Except a man is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. It is
   such a mystery, a thing of such a marvelous character, that his old
   nature cannot see it. He must have new eyes. He must be a new man. He
   must be born again before he can "see the Kingdom of God." Have you
   caught this idea, my dear Hearer? Do you understand that you cannot
   polish yourself up to a certain point and then see the Kingdom

   of God? You must be born again! There must be a radical change in you,
   a new birth, a birth from above, if you are even to see the Kingdom of
   God.

   4, 5. Nicodemus said unto Him, How can a man be born, when he is old?
   Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus
   answered, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man is born of water
   and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. At first
   Jesus said that a man could not see the kingdom of God except he was
   born again. Now He tells Nicodemus that a man cannot enter the Kingdom
   except he is born of water and of the Spirit. There must be a
   cleansing--he must be "born of water." There must be a spiritual
   life--he must be "born of the Spirit," or he cannot enter into the
   Kingdom of God.

   6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. Nothing more. However
   godly your father, however gracious your mother, all that is "born of
   the flesh is flesh."

   6. And that which is born of the spirit is spirit. There must be, then,
   a Spirit-birth, or else you have no spirit--you belong not to the
   spiritual realm--and you cannot see and you cannot enter the spiritual
   Kingdom.

   7. 8. Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born again. The wind
   blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound thereof. The sounding of
   the wind blowing through the trees--

   8. But cannot tell from where it comes, and where it goes. Where it
   begins, where it goes, or where it comes to an end, you cannot tell.

   8. So is everyone that is born of the Spirit. You do not know where the
   spirit-life begins and you cannot tell to what it will lead. There are
   heights to which the spirit-life can carry you, of which you have never
   dreamed--this is a mystery beyond your understanding.

   9. Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these things be? He
   did not deny that they might be, but he asked how they could be. Ah,
   many a man has asked the same question! "How may I be made anew? How
   may I become a new creature?" Only He that makes all things can make
   all things new! The new birth is as great a wonder as creation, itself,
   and there is as much--and a great deal more--to be worked upon you to
   make you a Christian as has been worked upon you to make you a man.

   10. Jesus answered and said unto him, Are you a master of Israel, and
   know not these things? These truths lie on the very doorstep of our
   holy religion! There are deeper and higher mysteries than these.

   11. 12. Verily, verily, I say unto you, We speak what We know, and
   testify what We have seen; and you receive not Our witness. If I have
   told you earthly things. Commonplace things, the lower things of faith.
   "If I have told you these"--

   12. And you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you of
   heavenly things? There are mysteries in our holy religion which we
   would not tell to everybody. It would be casting pearls before swine to
   mention them to unregenerate men. Christ tells Nicodemus that the
   primary Truths of God must be believed before the more advanced
   doctrines can be revealed.

   13. And no man has ascended up to Heaven but He that came down from
   Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven. It is Christ who knows
   everything! He understands all mysteries! He can teach all Truth, for
   He has been in Heaven. He came down to earth and He has gone back again
   to Heaven. Now, perhaps, some of you will be saying, "How are we to be
   saved? If there is no salvation without the new birth, how can we
   obtain the new birth?" Listen. The same chapter which tells you of the
   mystery of regeneration, tells you of the simple way of salvation by
   faith in Christ!

   14. 15. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
   must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whoever believes in Him should
   not perish, but have eternal life. "Whoever." If you believe in Christ,
   you are born again! If you trust Him, you have the new life! This
   simple way of salvation is not contradictory to the way of salvation by
   the new birth-- it is the same thing stated in a form that we can
   comprehend!

   16. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son,
   that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life. This text has saved thousands of souls! The constellation in the
   heavens called the Great Bear, has in it the two pointers which direct
   the eyes of the observer to the pole star--and this verse points to
   Christ so clearly, so distinctly, that many have found Him by it and
   have lived! Let me read it again: "For God so loved the world, that He
   gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life."

   17, 18. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world;
   but that the world, through Him, might be saved. He who believes on Him
   is not condemned: but He that believes not is condemned already. Not,
   "shall be condemned at the last," though that, also, is true, but "He
   that believes not is condemned already"--

   18. Because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of
   God. May the Lord bless to us the reading of this very simple Gospel
   chapter, for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

The Best Christmas Fare

   (No. 2340)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 24, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THE EVENING OF CHRISTMAS
   DAY, 1881.

   "How sweet are Your Words unto my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my
   mouth!" Psalm 119:103.

   THIS is a time of feasting and we may as well have our feast as other
   people have theirs. Let us see whether there is not something for our
   spiritual palate, something to satisfy our spiritual appetite, that we
   may eat, and be content, and rejoice before the Lord. Do you not think
   that two of the words in our text are very strange? If you had written
   them, would you not have said, "How sweet are Your Words unto my ears"?
   The Psalmist says, "How sweet are Your Words unto my palate!" for that
   is the word in the margin. He did not write, "Yes, sweeter than honey
   to my hearing!" but, "sweeter than honey to my mouth!" Are words, then,
   things that we can taste and eat? No, not if they are the words of
   man--it would take many of our words to fill a hungry belly. "Be you
   warmed and filled." It would take many tons of that sort of fodder to
   feed "a Brother or Sister destitute of daily food," for man's words are
   air and airy, light and frothy. They often deceive, they mock, they
   awaken hopes which are never realized. But God's Words are full of
   sub-stance--they are spirit, they are life, they are to be fed upon by
   the spiritually hungry!

   Marvel not that I say this to you! It was God's Word that made us--is
   it any wonder that His Word should sustain us? If His Word gives life,
   do you wonder that His Word should also give food for that life? Marvel
   not, for it is written--"Man shall not live by bread, alone, but by
   every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." God's Words are
   meat, drink and food--and if bodies live not upon words--souls and
   spirits feed upon the Words of God, and so are satisfied and full of
   delight! This is the language of an eater as well as of a hearer--of
   one who heard the words and then ate the words. The expression is
   oriental, but we are not quite strangers to it, even in our western
   talk, for we say, "They seem to eat the man's words," that is, when the
   hearers are very attentive to them, when they enjoy them, when the
   preacher's words seem to comfort them and to minister sustenance to
   their mind and to their spirit.

   I like this way of describing the reception of God's Word as a matter
   of eating, for a man cannot eat God's Word without living! He that
   takes it into himself must live thereby. There is a reality about the
   faith which eats. There is a something there most sure which contains
   the elements of salvation, for tasting is a spiritual sense which
   implies nearness. You can hear at a great distance by means of the
   telephone, but, somehow, I do not think that anyone will invent an
   electrical taster. Nobody knows what may be done, but I fancy that I
   shall never be able to eat anything in New York. I think that we shall
   hardly ever reach such a triumph of science as that! There will always
   have to be a measure of nearness if we are to taste anything and so it
   is with God's Word. If we hear it, it is music in the ears, but still
   it may seem to be at a distance from us. We may not get a grip and
   grasp of it--but if we taste it--that means that we really have it here
   within ourselves! Then has it come very near to us and we enter into
   fellowship with the God who gave it.

   This idea of tasting God's Word contains the thought of receptiveness.
   A man may hear a thing and, as we say, it goes in one ear and out the
   other, and so it often does, but that which a man gets into his mouth
   till he tastes it, and it is sweet to his palate, well, he has truly
   received that. If it is sweet to him, he will not do as they who have
   something lukewarm, which is objectionable, which they cast away out of
   their mouth. But when he finds it palatable, the sweetness will make
   him keep it where it is till he swallows it down into his inward parts.
   So I love this thought of tasting God's Word because it implies
   nearness, an actual reception and a veritable holding-fast of that
   which is so appreciated by the taste.

   Tasting is also a personal matter. "Friends, Romans, countrymen," said
   Mark Anthony, in his oration over the body of Caesar, "lend me your
   ears!" And they go to be lent and numbers of people hear for others.
   But tasting, surely, is a

   personal business--there is no possibility of my eating for you! If you
   choose to starve yourself by a long fast of 50 days, so you must. If I
   were to sit down and industriously attempt to eat your portion of food,
   and my own, too, it would not help you in the least! You must eat for
   yourselves and there is no knowing the value of God's Word till you eat
   it for yourself. You must personally believe it, personally trust to
   it, personally receive it into your innermost spirit, or else you
   cannot know anything about its power to bless and to sustain! I do
   pray, dear Friends, that we may, every one of us, tonight, understand
   what the Psalmist meant when he spoke of tasting God's Words and of
   finding them sweeter than honey to his mouth.

   I. First, tonight, I call your attention to AN EXCLAMATION. The text
   contains two notes of exclamation or admiration--"How sweet are Your
   Words unto my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!" I cannot
   throw the notes of admiration and exclamation into my speech, as I
   would like to do, but this verse is evidently the utterance of one who
   is somewhat surprised and amazed, one who has a thought which he cannot
   adequately express. The thought is also one that gives much delight to
   the writer, for he exclaims, "How sweet are Your Words unto my taste!
   Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!"

   Now, I believe that it is a matter of wonder to many to find the Gospel
   so sweet when the soul first tastes it. Until I believed in Christ, I
   could not have imagined that a man was capable of so much delight as I
   then experienced. When I first looked to Christ and was lightened, the
   ease I felt when my burden rolled from off my shoulders quite
   astonished me. It seemed to me as if a man could never know such rest
   as I then enjoyed! When I beheld my sin all put away through Christ's
   atoning blood and knew myself to be "accepted in the Beloved," I could
   have said, with the queen of Sheba, "Behold, the half was not told me."
   I had heard my father and other Christian men say that blessed are the
   people who trust in the Lord, but I never thought there really was such
   blessedness as I found. I fancied that they would decoy me with some
   sweet declarations of what, after all, might be very commonplace, but I
   did not find it to be so. And I am here to bear my witness that when I
   believed God's promise, I was so amazed and overpowered with joy that,
   even now, I cannot tell you the delight I felt, yes, and I, in the Word
   of a faithful God to all who trust in Jesus Christ, His Son!

   This, then, may be the exclamation of a soul tasting the Gospel for the
   first time, but it may also be the exclamation of a soul cheered by
   still tasting the Gospel--"How sweet are Your Words unto my taste!" "I
   have known the Lord," says one, "these 40 years." Another says, "I have
   known Christ these 30 years, but He is as precious to me as ever He
   was, His Word is as fresh and novel as if I had never heard it, before,
   and His promise comes to my soul with as much of life and power as if
   He had only spoken it yesterday and I had never heard it till this
   moment."

   Are you not surprised, sometimes, you who are getting into middle life,
   or even verging on old age, to find how sweet God's Word still is to
   you? And if, perhaps, you have been away from the House of God
   traveling in foreign lands, or you have been laid aside by sickness,
   or, if, perhaps, you are a preacher and do not often hear a sermon, is
   it not a very delightful thing to sit in your pew and, when you are
   hearing the Gospel, to say, "Oh, it is sweet! It is coming home to me
   now"? I heard a sermon some years ago--I do not often get the
   opportunity of hearing--and when my tears began to flow under a simple
   statement of the Gospel, I said to myself, "Yes, I am not a mere dealer
   in it, who hands it out to others, for I relish the flavor of it
   myself." Why, I have had to stand here, sometimes, like the butchers at
   Christmas time, cutting and chopping off joints of meat for you all,
   and I have not had even a snack, myself, all the while! But when I get
   the opportunity of sitting down at the table and listening, it may be,
   to a poor, humble preacher talking about Christ, I seem to set my knife
   and fork to work and I say, "Yes, that is just the very food for me,
   give me some more of it! My soul can feed upon such fare as that." And
   I have felt glad, with an inward and unspeakable delight, to find how
   sweet it was to my taste--"Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!"
   Rejoice, dear Friends, if you find it so.

   I reckon that this language of exclamation and admiration will also
   come from the most advanced saint, increasing in knowledge of the
   Gospel--the Believer who has studied the Word of God most earnestly and
   who has had the deepest experience in it. Other books are soon done
   with, but the Bible is never fully understood. I think that most
   readers will tell you that the more they read, the fewer books they
   treasure, whereas, to the young, there is a whole library to go
   through! The man who has been a diligent and careful reader all his
   life finds only some few books that he now cares to read. He knows the
   rest--he could write the most of them--perhaps could write them better
   than they are written! Now he keeps on striking out this one from the
   list and that other, for he has gone beyond them--and the book which
   charmed him

   when he was young ceases to have any value to him when he gets beyond
   it in his riper years. He has seen through its mistakes and now he
   yearns for something more accurate.

   But it is never so with the Words of God. It is never so with the Word
   of God, the Incarnate Word, the Christ. The more you know of Him, the
   more you wish to know. And the more you taste of Him, the sweeter He
   becomes till in Heaven the sweetness will be far more intense than it
   is now--and Christ will be more precious and more delightful to us
   through the eternal ages than He is at this present moment! I believe
   that in Glory the saints will often lift up their hands and say, "How
   sweet are Your Words unto my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my
   mouth!" When those words shall have been completely fulfilled, the very
   retrospect of the promise will charm our immortal spirits till Heaven
   shall become as a forest, like that of Jonathan, which dripped with
   honey--and every Word that God spoke to us, when we were here below,
   shall come back to us with matchless sweetness as we remember it in the
   world to come.

   II. But now, secondly, take the text not only with its two notes of
   admiration, but as A STATEMENT, a cool statement of matters of fact.
   David is one who, when his heart boils with holy fervor, and his hand
   wields the pen of a ready writer, still writes accurately. He never
   speaks more than the Truth even when he is most emphatic, so that I am
   sure that David means to tell us, here, that God's Words were truly
   sweet to him.

   First, they were unutterably sweet. "How sweet!" But he does not tell
   us how sweet they were. He says, "How sweet are Your Words unto my
   taste!" as if he could not tell us what delightfulness he found in the
   teachings of God's Word-- it was unutterable! We can tell you, dear
   Hearers, that God's Words of promise are very, very sweet, but we can
   convey to you no sort of idea of how great that sweetness is! Oh, taste
   for yourselves and see that the Lord is good! There is no describing
   the flavors of a royal banquet! There is no picturing to a man who has
   not the sense of smell, the fragrance of a delicious perfume. And you
   must personally know the sweetness of the Word of God, for to us it is
   positively unutterable!

   This much, however, the Psalmist does utter. He tells us that God's
   Words are surpassingly sweet, for he said, "They are sweeter than
   honey." Honey is supposed to be the sweetest of all known substances.
   So David means that if there is anything that can delight the heart of
   man, God's Word could charm his heart better than that! David means
   that if there is anything that could cheer a man, God's Word could
   comfort him better than any other consolation. If there is joy, if
   there is peace, if there is rest, if there is bliss to be found in
   anything else--all that, and more than that--can be found in a higher
   degree in the teachings of God's Word and in the blessings of the
   Covenant of Grace! Sweeter than sweetness, itself. Sweeter than the
   sweetest thing that God, Himself, has made, is God's Word which He has
   spoken! Oh, that we did but know how to taste it!

   The Psalmist also makes this statement, that all God's Words are thus
   unutterably sweet to him. He does not say that they are so to all men,
   but he says, "How sweet are Your Words unto my taste! Yes, sweeter than
   honey to my mouth!" He speaks thus of all God's Words. We know some
   people who love God's promises, but they do not care much about His
   Laws. If God speaks a Word of Grace, they like that. But if it is a
   word of command, they do not care about that. Oh, Brothers and Sisters,
   I hope we have a taste for every Word that God has spoken! A man ought
   not to say, "I do not like a sermon from the Old Testament as much as I
   do a sermon from the New Testament." There must be no picking and
   choosing with God's Word! It is virtually atheism when men begin to set
   one Word of God over against another, for the man who dares to
   criticize God's Revelation makes himself greater than God--and therein
   he has undeified the Deity, and there is no God to him!

   My God is such to me that if I know a Word to be Inspired by His
   Spirit, I value it beyond all conception! It is not for me to say,
   "This Word of my Master is nothing compared with another Word." All
   these Words came from the same mouth and, coming from the same mouth,
   they are all equally true to me. And, if not all alike rich in comfort,
   yet "all Scripture is given by Inspiration of God and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness." From one end of it to the other, it answers some Divine
   purpose--who am I that I should sit in judgment upon it? I pray you,
   Brothers and Sisters, value every Word of God, and let no man lend you
   into the error of setting this one above the other, for, if they are
   God's Words, they are all precious--and you ought to count them so.

   David seems to imply that God's Words were precious to him at all
   times. They were sweet to him when he wrote the text--I cannot tell in
   what condition of body and mind he was at that time--but this I do
   know, lying upon the bed of sickness, racked with pain, many of God's
   saints have said, "How sweet are Your Words to my taste!" And this I
   also know that, lifted up with gratitude for the blessings of
   Providence--health, wealth, friends--yet God's saints have

   found greater sweetness in His Word than in all temporal things and
   they have still said, "How sweet are Your Words unto my taste!" This is
   an abiding mark of a child of God, that God's Words are sweet to him,
   yes, sometimes very sweet even when he is half afraid to partake of
   them! "Oh," he says "would God they were mine! I need nothing sweeter
   than God's Word and, even if I am a little fearful of appropriating it
   to myself, yet still it is very, very dear to me." If the name of Jesus
   is sweeter than honey to your taste, then be glad, for this is a mark
   of a child of God that never failed yet--and never will fail while the
   world stands!

   III. Now, thirdly, look at the text, again, and you will see that it
   contains A REPETITION--"How sweet are Your Words unto my taste!" Well,
   that is all right, David--we understand you. "Yes, sweeter than honey
   to my mouth!" Why do you need to say that? Is not that saying the same
   thing twice? Yes, and intentionally so, because God's Word is sweet to
   His people in many ways and many times over!

   As I have already said to you, it is very sweet in its reception. When
   we first take it into our heart and feed upon it, it is very precious,
   but, spiritually, men are something like ruminating animals--they have
   the power of feeding again, and again, and again--on that which they
   have once received. Look how the cattle lie down and chew the cud. And
   it is when they chew the cud, I suppose, that they get the sweetness
   out of that which they have eaten. And so, spiritually, when men have
   once received Christ, they get increasing sweetness out of Him by
   meditation. Having taken Him into their souls, they afterwards inwardly
   digest the precious Word of God and get the secret juice and latent
   sweetnesses out of the promises of God's most holy Revelation and out
   of Jesus Christ, Himself! It is thus that the Psalmist first says, "How
   sweet are Your Words unto my taste!" And then he rolls them around,
   again, in his mouth by meditation, and so he repeats himself as he
   says, "Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!"

   But do you not think that the repetition in the text means something
   else, namely, that while, first of all, Christ's Word is very sweet to
   our taste, there is another sweetness when we get it into our
   mouth--not so much for our own eating as speaking of it to others?
   There is great sweetness about the declaration of God's Words! Some of
   you who love the Lord have never yet told anybody. You are secret
   Christians--you hide away behind pillar and post. Oh, but God's Word is
   very sweet to you, you say, as you eat your morsel of bread in the
   corner! So it is, but you would have another and a greater sweetness if
   you would come out and avow that you love the Lord! I am sure you
   would. In fact, there is many a child of God who never enjoys the full
   sweetness of religion because he has not had the courage to confess
   Christ before men. I wish that some of you halting ones, you who are
   much afraid and fearing, would obey the whole of the Gospel. You know
   the Gospel--"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." "With the
   heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is
   made unto salvation."

   Now, obey the whole of the Gospel and then you shall get the whole of
   its sweetness. But, perhaps, there is some peculiar flavor in the Word
   which you have never known as yet because you have been disobedient
   children. Did you ever notice that saying of our Lord, "Come unto Me,
   all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"? Yes,
   you know all about that, you say. Christ says to you, "Come unto Me and
   I will give you rest." Now go a little farther-- what is the next
   verse? "Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; and you shall find
   rest." Why, that is another rest! I thought you had rest--did not Jesus
   say that He would give you rest? Yet in the next verse He says, "You
   shall find rest." Yes, that is another rest, a still deeper one which
   you find when you willingly take Christ's yoke upon you and become His
   disciples, learning of Him. So I believe my text means just that. God's
   Word is very sweet to the taste when you receive it by faith, but it
   has another and a special and deeper sweetness when you bring it into
   your mouth and confess Christ before men.

   And let me add to this that there is a very special sweetness about
   preaching Christ--in the public proclamation of His Word. It may be
   that some Brother, here, has the gift of speech, but has never used it
   for his Master. Let me put in my witness here. God's Word has been
   unutterably sweet to my own heart, as I have believed it--it has been
   remarkably precious to me as I have confessed it as a Christian
   man--but still there is a something, I cannot tell you what, of
   singular delight about the preaching of this Word. Oh, sometimes, when
   I have prepared my sermon, it has been bitter in my belly, but it has
   been as honey in my mouth when I have preached it to the great
   congregation gathered here! If I might choose my destiny and if I had,
   even, to stay out of Heaven for the purpose, it would be Heaven to me
   to be permitted to always be preaching Christ and the glories of His
   salvation! And I do not know that I should have any choice between that
   and Heaven--if I might be privileged to be, without ceasing, lauding
   and praising and extolling that dear Word of

   God--the Christ who was born at Bethlehem. If I might proclaim to
   sinners everywhere that God is in him making reconciliation, no, that
   He has made reconciliation for all who believe in Him, this might be
   Heaven enough, at least for one poor heart, world without end.

   "How sweet are Your Words unto my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my
   mouth!" Try, Brother, whether it will not sweeten your mouth if you
   begin to preach Christ! Perhaps you have been too quiet and too silent.
   Get up and speak for Jesus and see whether the honey does not come into
   your mouth at once! In the olden times they pictured the orator with
   bees buzzing round his lips, storing up the honey that dropped from his
   sweet utterances. This may be but a fable concerning the human talker,
   but certainly it is true of the man who preaches Christ--that his lips
   drop honey, and the more he speaks of his dear Lord and Master, and the
   less he tries, with human eloquence, to magnify himself--the more of
   sacred sweetness shall there be in every word that he utters!

   So I think I have accounted for the repetition, have I not? It is no
   repetition after all. At least it is no tautology--it is only a right
   and necessary repetition.

   IV. And now I am going to wind up, in the fourth place, with AN
   EXAMINATION--the examination of everybody here present, tonight. It is
   the close of the year and one may not object to a few personal
   enquiries at such a time.

   The first and chief enquiry is this--Are God's Words sweet to me? Is
   Christ, Himself, the Master-Word of God, the Logos? Is He sweet to me?
   For, if not, what is the reason?

   First, may it be that I have no taste? Have I spiritual taste? It would
   be a sad thing to be wholly without natural taste. I do know one such
   person, who has no taste at all. The poet Wordsworth was for years
   without the power of smell. His was a very remarkable case, with a mind
   so dainty, so delicate, so beautiful. Once upon a time, for a very
   short season, the power of smell came to him among the heather and you
   know how every primrose by the river's brim had words for Wordsworth
   and talked with him--and when the sweet perfume came from the dear May
   flowers, the poet was quite enraptured, as if he had, for a little
   while, entered into Heaven! But the power of smell soon went away and
   he was, again, unhappily bereft of it. The richest flower, the sweetest
   shrub could be nothing to the man whose nostril was not sensitive to
   its perfume.

   And what if that should be so with me spiritually? Perhaps, my dear
   Hearer, you have heard all we have been saying about Christ and you
   have heard many rich and rare hymns about Him. But you never felt that
   there was any sweetness in Him. Then I beg you to enquire whether you
   may not be lacking in a sense which others have. If a person were to
   say to me, "How lovely is that Italian sky! What a deep blue it has!"
   and if I turned my face that way and said, "I see nothing at all." If,
   when he pointed to the sea, or to the green fields, I looked in that
   direction, and saw nothing, what should I infer? Why, that he possessed
   a power called sight, which I did not possess! Of course I might be
   foolish enough to say, "There is no blue sky. There is no such thing.
   There are no green fields. There is no ocean. There is no sun. I am
   sure there is not, for I never saw them."

   One day I saw a man sitting at a table with his napkin under his chin,
   enjoying his dinner, and he overheard an observation that I made about
   a sinner, and he said, "I never had a spiritual sensation in my life
   and I do not believe that there is anything spiritual in this world."
   Now, if I had been standing near a sty and a pig had made that
   observation, I should not have contradicted him--and I did not
   contradict this man--for I thought that he spoke the truth! I believed
   that he had never experienced a spiritual sensation in his life! And
   when some men say, "I perceive no sweetness in Christ and, therefore,
   there is none," I wish that they would draw another
   inference--"Therefore I have not that taste which would enable me to
   perceive His sweetness"--for that is the truth. A man who has never
   been born again is dead as to all spiritual things and he cannot hear,
   or see, or taste anything that is spiritual. He is not alive unto God
   as yet. I put this solemn enquiry to everyone who says, "I see no
   beauty in Christ"--may it not be that you have no eyes? If you say, "I
   hear no music in His voice. In fact, I do not hear that voice," may it
   not be that your ears are sealed? And if you say, "I taste no sweetness
   in the Word of God, or the Christ of God," may it not be that you are
   still dead in trespasses and sins? If so, may God quicken you in His
   infinite mercy!

   Still, there is another answer to the question which I beg to put by
   way of examination. If the Word of God is not very sweet to me, have I
   an appetite? Solomon says, "The full soul loathes honeycomb, but to the
   hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet." Ah, when a soul is full of
   itself, of the world and of the pleasures of sin, I do not wonder that
   it sees no sweetness in Christ, for it has no appetite! Oh, but when a
   soul is emptied. When a soul hungers and thirsts after God.

   When it is conscious of its needs and miseries, as I hope some here
   present are, then is Christ sweet, indeed! O hungry ones, take Him into
   your souls, suck down His precious Word! Christ has come on purpose to
   feed hungry spirits. If you need Him, you may have Him--and the more
   you need Him, the more free He is to you--and the more freely may you
   partake of Him! He is just such a Christ as you need. May God make you
   ravenous after Him--so ravenous that you may never rest till you have
   received Him as altogether your own!

   Yet there is another answer. If I do not taste sweetness in Christ, am
   I in health? When a man is ill, his soul "abhors all manner of meat."
   Nothing tastes nice to a man whose palate is out of order through
   sickness. Now, does it happen, tonight, that some of you do not feel
   any joy in Christ? Then you are ill! Brothers and Sisters, put out your
   tongue, let us look at it. Ah, it has got furred up with the world, I
   am sure! Something ails you if Christ is not sweet. Sometimes you have
   sat in these pews, some of you, and you have heard Christ preached till
   you hardly knew how to keep your seats. You have been ready to stand up
   and clap your hands to the praise of His dear name--but now you do not
   feel anything at all. You can almost go to sleep, if you do not
   actually slumber. The preacher is quite willing to share the blame with
   you, for he is not all he ought to be. But he does not mean to take all
   the blame of it, for, as far as he knows how, he preaches the same
   Savior, now, as always, and tries to preach Him with as much
   earnestness as ever. May it not be possible, Brother or Sister, that
   you are not quite right spiritually, that you are getting ill, that
   your heart is growing feeble? Go home and pray the Lord to set you
   right. Oh, that He would cleanse you, purify you, make you yet to be
   strong and vigorous--and then this would be one of the first tokens of
   it--that Christ would once more become inexpressibly sweet to you!

   I must also get you to ask yourself this question--Have I savored the
   world or sin? People sometimes lose their appetite for sweetness by
   eating something sour. You may have had one flavor in your mouth, but
   when you have eaten something with a different flavor, you cannot taste
   the first. If a man gets fond of the leeks, the garlic and the onions
   of Egypt--strong things, those--if he once gets the savor of them into
   his mouth, he is not likely to have any very dainty tooth for the
   precious things of God. Spiritual flavors have need of great
   spirituality to enjoy them, I know not what other word to use. They
   need that the palate be kept clean, for otherwise, if the world is
   sweet to us, if sin has any hold upon us--to that extent and degree
   shall we be incapable of appreciating the sweet things of God.

   This is my last question--Have I habituated myself to this food? All
   earthly sweetness spoils--he who eats honey for a long while will care
   no more for honey. But it is very different with the Christ of God. The
   sweetness of Christ is not fully known except to those who have known
   Him long, who by reason of constant use have had their senses fully
   exercised. There is none so greedy after Christ as the man who has had
   most of Him. Paul had been a Believer at least 15 years and yet he said
   this was his ambition, "That I may know Him." Had he not known Christ
   before? Yes, but the more he knew Him, the more he longed to know Him.
   Come, Brother, if you do not taste the sweetness of Christ, tonight, in
   the preaching of the Word of God, surely it must be because you have
   not of late been feeding upon Him. Make haste and come along--and let
   your soul be filled with Him, even from this glad hour.

   I have done when I have reminded those here present who see no
   sweetness in the Words of God, that there is a time coming when they
   will be compelled to hear the Word of God in a very different way from
   that in which they hear it tonight. One of the first works of the
   Resurrection will be the creation of the ear. I do not know by what
   process we shall be raised from the dead, except that the Lord Jesus
   said this, "The hour is coming in which all that are in the graves
   shall hear His voice and shall come forth; they that have done good,
   unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
   resurrection of damnation." When the voice of the Son of God shall
   strike upon that ear of yours, what a sensation it will cause! God has
   spoken to you, now, by the voice of one like yourself, and He has
   spoken according to the printed page--and you have chosen not to hear
   it.

   But when, in that Last Day, He shall speak by the angel's trumpet and
   by the voice of His Son! You will be obliged to hear and, rising from
   your grave, bursting your cerements, you must obey and you must
   stand--willing or unwill-ing--before that last dread tribunal, to
   answer for every deed done in the body, for every idle word that you
   have spoken, yes, and for every thought that you have imagined against
   the Most High God! It may be a thousand years before that will happen,
   it may be ten thousand years, I cannot tell, but it will happen in
   God's time--and that space between will be but as the twinkling of an
   eye--and there will you be before the face of the great Judge and you
   will not be able to say with David, "How sweet are Your Words unto my
   taste!" But, you will cry out, in the agony of your spirit, "Oh, the
   gall and wormwood!" Oh, the fire that shall burn into your very soul
   when God shall say, "Because I have called, and

   you refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but you
   have set at nothing all My counsel, and would none of My reproof: I,
   also, will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes."
   "Depart from Me you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
   devil and his angels."

   God grant that you may not be told so to depart! And, that you may not,
   I pray you to now listen to the voice of God which bids you trust Jesus
   and live! I can only speak with these poor feeble lips and there is no
   power in anything that I can say--but God the Holy Spirit can speak
   with irresistible might to your hearts and constrain you to taste of
   Christ, tonight, by hearing the Word of God, in your very soul! I pray
   that He may do it, for His dear name's sake! Amen and Amen

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 119:89-112.

   Verse 89. Forever, O LORD, Your Word is settled in Heaven. Other things
   come and go, and change. Moons wax and wane, tides ebb and flow,
   everything earthly is changeable. But, "Your Word is settled--settled
   in Heaven," with the eternal settlements. No truth of it can fail, no
   promise of it can be broken. What a joy this is to our hearts tonight!
   There is something sure, after all--"Forever, O Lord, Your Word is
   settled in Heaven."

   90. Your faithfulness is unto all generations: You have established the
   earth, and it abides. That is, God has spoken to Nature and that Word
   has established the earth, and made it to stand securely.

   91. They continue this day according to Your ordinances: for all are
   Your servants. It was God's Word that made the sun, and the moon, and
   the stars. And it is God's Word that bids creation still exist. And
   that is the almighty Word upon which you and I are resting if we are
   truly trusting in the living God--

   "His very Word of Grace is strong As that which built the skies!

   The voice that rolls the stars along Speaks all the promises."

   92. Unless Your Law had been my delights, I should then have perished
   in my affliction. Let us remember how God's Word has kept some of us
   alive when we had nothing else to live upon. Hope would have quite
   failed and we should have been driven to despair if it had not been for
   the precious, priceless Word of God.

   93. I will never forget Your precepts: for with them You have quickened
   me. Nothing sharpens the memory like having been quickened. If we have
   been at death's door and the Word of God has brought us renewed life,
   we shall never forget it.

   94-96. I am Yours, save me; for I have sought Your precepts. The wicked
   have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider Your testimonies.
   I have seen an end of all perfection. No matter who it is that boasts
   of being perfect, "I have seen an end of all perfection."

   96. But your Commandment--There lies the perfection--

   96. Is exceedingly broad. Covering the whole life--covering the
   thoughts, the intents, the desires of the inner and secret nature.

   97, 98. O how I love Your Law! It is my meditation all the day. You,
   through Your Commandments, have made me wiser than my enemies for they
   are always with me. If we have God's Law always with us, we shall be
   wiser than the most crafty of our enemies, for, after all, there is
   nothing that puzzles and baffles cunning men like simple honesty. Do
   that which is right and you will cut through the nets in which men
   would entangle you. They cannot trip you up if your feet are settled in
   God's ways.

   99, 100. I have more understanding than all my teachers: for Your
   testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients
   because I keep Your precepts. There is more wisdom in obeying God than
   in all the ethics of heathen philosophers. It matters not from where
   they take their precepts and maxims--there is no wisdom like yielding
   one's heart to God.

   101-104. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
   keep Your Word. I have not departed from Your judgments: for You have
   taught me. How sweet are Your Words unto my taste! Yes, sweeter than
   honey to my mouth! Through Your precepts I get understanding: therefore
   I hate every false way. The man who cannot hate does not love. But he
   who

   loves that which is right is, by no means, indifferent to the wrong and
   to the false--he hates it and the more intensely he loves God, and
   loves right--the more intensely does he hate every false way.
   Especially does he hate it in himself. Oh, to be delivered altogether
   from every trace of falsehood!

   105. Your Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. It
   shows me the way. It cheers me in the way. It reveals to me the
   difficulties of the way.

   106, 107. I have sworn and I will perform it, that I will keep Your
   righteous judgments. I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD,
   according unto Your Word. Are any of you afflicted tonight? I commend
   this prayer to your use. One would have expected that David would have
   prayed, "I am afflicted very much: comfort me, O Lord." Or, "Relieve
   me, O Lord." Instead of praying so, he cries, "Quicken me, O Lord," and
   he did well. Let us imitate him, for if we get more spiritual light and
   life, we shall, by that means, get more comfort, and the trouble from
   which we are suffering will soon cease to vex our spirit.

   108-112. Accept, I beseech You, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
   LORD, and teach me Your judgments. My soul is continually in my hand:
   yet do I not forget Your Law. The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet
   I erred not from Your precepts. Your testimonies have I taken as an
   heritage forever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. I have
   inclined my heart to perform Your statutes always, even unto the end.
   Oh, that everyone of us might be able to make this declaration of the
   Psalmist our own! God grant it, for Christ's sake! Amen.

The Underlying Gospel for the Dying Year

   (No. 2341)

   INTENDED FOR READING ON LORD'S-DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1893.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   OCTOBER 20, 1889.

   "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly." Romans 5:6.

   BELOVED Friends, whatever the condition of a child of God is, he is not
   without hope. A believer in the Lord Jesus Christ may be very sorely
   tried. His afflictions may be multiplied and they may be very keen,
   but, even in that condition, he has hope. It is not possible for him to
   be forsaken of God--his God must help him. If the worst comes to the
   worst, and he is altogether forsaken of men and sees no way of escape
   out of his tremendous difficulties, still, his God must help him. He
   has no right whatever to be afraid!

   The argument of our text is this--since the Lord Jesus Christ saved us
   when we were ungodly and came to our rescue when we were without
   strength--we can never be in a worse condition than that! And if He,
   then, did the best thing possible for us, namely, died for us, there is
   nothing which He will not do. In fact, He will give us all things and
   He will do all things for us, so as to keep us safely and bear us
   through. The argument is that, looking back, we see the great love of
   God to us in the gift of His dear Son for us when there was nothing
   good in us--when we were ungodly, when we had no power to produce
   anything good--for we were without strength. At such a time, even at
   such a time, Christ came on wings of love and up to the bloody tree He
   went--and laid down His life for our deliverance! We, therefore, feel
   confident that He will not leave us, now, and that He will not keep
   back anything from us whatever we may need. He has committed Himself to
   the work of our eternal salvation and He will not be balked of it. He
   has already done too much for us to ever run back from His purpose and,
   in our worst estate, if we are in that condition, tonight, we may still
   confidently appeal to Him and rest quite sure that He will bring us up
   even to the heights ofjoy and safety! That is the drift of the text and
   of the sermon tonight.

   There are three grand points of consolation suggested by the text. The
   first lies in this one line, "Christ died for the ungodly" The second
   lies in this sentence, Christ died for us "when we were yet without
   strength." And there is a rich vein of comfort in the third statement,
   that Christ died for us "in due time." "In due time Christ died for the
   ungodly." Time is often a very important element when one is in
   trouble. In the nick of time Christ came for our deliverance--and so He
   will again.

   I. The first point of consolation in our text is this--if any child of
   God, here, is in sore dismay and bowed down by reason of trouble,
   fancying that God will leave him--let him first meditate on this word,
   "CHRIST DIED FOR THE UNGODLY."

   I should like to have this sentence put up at the corner of every
   street, "Christ died for the ungodly." I am afraid that it would cause
   a great many observations to be made. Some would kick at it very
   heavily, but there are others who would leap very joyfully at the sight
   of it. "Christ died for the ungodly." Does it mean what it says? The
   common notion, not expressed in so many words, but harbored in many
   minds, is that Christ died for the godly--that Christ died for good
   people--but the text says, "Christ died for the ungodly." "This is a
   faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners." I say again that the current notion,
   unexpressed but still believed, is that Christ came into the world to
   save saints. This is not true. He came into the world to save sinners,
   or, to come back to the very words of the text, "Christ died for the
   ungodly."

   I remember reading of a young woman who had long been in great distress
   of conscience. She found comfort from an utterance of Mr. Moody Stuart
   in prayer, when he quoted these words of my text, "Christ died for the
   ungodly." She had

   never caught at that idea before--she had always been trying to see
   something good in herself and she thought that if she could spy out
   some good thing in herself, then she would know that Christ died for
   her! It was like a new revelation when she really understood that Jesus
   Christ came into the world to save sinners and that He "died for the
   ungodly."

   Now this must be true, for Scripture puts it so plainly, "Christ died
   for the ungodly." It must be true for, in the first place, there was
   nobody else to die for but the ungodly! In this same Epistle, Paul says
   that all mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, are under sin. As it is
   written, "There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that
   understands, there is none that seeks after God. They are all gone out
   of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that
   does good, no, not one." So he sums us all up with his sweeping
   condemnation, "None righteous, no, not one." And so, if Christ had died
   for anybody, He must have died for the ungodly, since the whole human
   race has degenerated into that condition! And that is the state by
   nature of every man that is born of woman. Some are openly ungodly.
   Many are religiously ungodly, a very dangerous, because very deceitful,
   condition--having the form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.
   This first point is clear, then--Christ must have died for the ungodly
   since there was nobody else for whom to die.

   And, next, only the ungodly needed that He should die for them. If you
   are godly, if you are good, if you have perfectly kept the Law of God,
   what have you to do with Christ? You are already saved! In fact, you
   are not lost, and so you do not need any saving. If you have kept all
   the Commandments from your youth up, you may well say, "What do I
   lack?" If you are so good that you could hardly be better and have a
   most respectable robe of righteousness of your own in which to appear
   before God, I ask again, What have you to do with Christ? Why should He
   die for a man who has not any sins that need washing away? O you
   self-righteous, look to the sparks of your own fire, for Christ will
   kindle no fire for you! O you who believe your own characters to be all
   that they should be, and who rest your hope on that fallacy, I say
   again, why should Christ come to be a Physician to those who are not
   sick? Why should He come to give alms to those who are not poor? Why
   should He lay down His life to bear the sins of those who have no sins?
   "Christ died for the ungodly" because nobody but the ungodly needed
   that He should die for them.

   There is one point that we must mark, Christ did die for the ungodly.
   His form of death was just that which the ungodly deserved--He died by
   sentence of the Law of God. He died nailed to the Cross--He died the
   death of a felon with a thief on either side of Him. He died in the
   dark, crying, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?" He died, not
   as One who had, Himself, sinned, but He died as sinners have to die,
   for He took upon Himself the sins of the ungodly. And being found
   standing in their place, He felt the scourge of God that should have
   fallen upon the ungodly. Scourge, did I say? He felt the sword of God
   that would have slain the ungodly, as it is written, "Awake, O sword,
   against My Shepherd, and against the Man that is My Fellow, says the
   Lord of Hosts." Christ really died for the ungodly. They tell us that
   He died to confirm His testimony, in which respect His death is no
   better than the death of any martyr who dies to confirm His testimony!
   But the text says, "Christ died for the ungodly." They say that He died
   as the completion of His life, which many a good man has done and,
   therein, the Cross has no pre-eminence. But the text says, "Christ died
   for the ungodly" and we shall stand to it that this is true. "Who His
   own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." "The chastisement
   of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed." They
   turn around and say, "That is your theory of the Atonement." I beg your
   pardon--it is the Atonement. It is not a theory at all and there is no
   other Atonement but the Substitution of Christ in the place of the
   ungodly! He died, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to
   God. This is the true and only Doctrine of Atonement--and he that
   receives it shall find comfort by it--but he that rejects it does so at
   peril of his own soul. "Christ died for the ungodly." I cannot speak
   plainer words than Paul, Inspired by the Holy Spirit, has written!
   There let them stand, "Christ died for the ungodly."

   Now then, I want you, who are the people of God, to pick up the
   argument out of this Truth of God. If Christ did this crowning act of
   dying for the ungodly, do you think that He will ever cast away the man
   who has peace with God? Read the first verse, again, "Therefore being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ." Now, if He died for you when you had no peace with God, when,
   in fact, you had no God at all--when you were ungodly, that is, not
   under the influence of God--when you were enemies to God by wicked
   works. If Christ died for you, then, will He not save you now? If you
   feel within your heart, tonight, a sweet reconciliation to God, your
   heavenly Father, then, whatever your trouble is, do not believe that
   God can leave you! Whatever the deep depression of your spirit,

   do not imagine that He can forsake you! He that died for you as ungodly
   will certainly save you, now that you have peace with God through Him.

   More than that, when you have read those words in the first verse, "We
   have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ," go on to the second
   verse, "By whom, also, we have access by faith." Why, you are one of
   those who can go to God when you will and speak with Him as a man
   speaks with his friend! By faith you are permitted to come to God in
   prayer, in praise and to walk with God in the Light as He is in the
   Light! Come, Beloved, if Christ died for you when you were dead, when
   you were ungodly, will He, can He leave you, now that He has given you
   access to the Father by Himself? You come in and out of His house like
   a home-born son--and if He loved you so as to die for you when you were
   a stranger to God--do you think that He will leave you, now that you
   have access to God through Him?

   Go on a little farther and you find it written, "and rejoice in hope of
   the Glory of God." A little while ago, you know, you had no hope of
   Glory--you had no expectation of ever getting to Heaven. Poor soul that
   you were, your glory was your shame! Your glory was worldly pleasure
   and worldly gain. But now you "rejoice in hope of the Glory of God."
   God has given you that good hope through Grace! Sometimes, when it is
   fine weather with you, you climb to the top of Mount Clear and, looking
   toward the Celestial City, you can almost see the light of it.
   Sometimes, when the wind blows the right way, you have heard some stray
   notes from the harps of angels--and you have wished yourself among
   them! Some of you know that the hope of Heaven has often burned within
   your heart--well, then, Beloved, if the Lord has given you that hope,
   can He disappoint it? If Christ died for you when you had no hope, when
   you did not want a hope, when you were ungodly--think of the weight of
   this argument to you who rejoice in hope of the Glory of God! It is
   mightier than a thousand Nasmyth hammers, for it smashes every doubt to
   shivers! He that died for the ungodly will certainly save those who
   have a good hope of Heaven!

   Once more. You are, at this time, so far from being ungodly that the
   love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit which is
   given to you. You know that it is so--you feel that God loves you. If
   you do not feel it, tonight, you have felt it. You have realized the
   love of God in your heart, as though a bottle of perfume of roses had
   been broken and the perfume had filled all your spirit. You have said
   to yourself, "Jesus loves me." You have been over-joyed with that
   thought and you have also said, "I know that I love Him." You have felt
   the goings forth of your spirit like the melting of the ice in the
   springtime. Every little brook that had been frozen up within your
   nature has leapt in gracious liberty beneath the sunlight of Divine
   Love. Well now, do you think that the Lord has taught you to love
   Him--and has shown you that He loves you--and will yet forsake you?

   You say, "O Sir, you do not know what my trial is!" No, I do not, but
   your heavenly Father does, and if He loved you when you were ungodly,
   will He cast you away, now that He has shed His love abroad in your
   heart? "Oh, but I have lost the very staff of bread! I do not know how
   I am to get a living." No, but you have the living God to depend upon
   and, after giving His Son to save you, He will surely give you bread!
   He will not let you famish. "Ah, but, my dear Sir, the beloved of my
   heart is laid low! There is, in the cemetery, the dearest object of my
   affection." Is it really so? I thought that He left the dead some time
   ago. I thought that the dearest object of your affection had gone up to
   the right hand of the Father! Is it not so? "Ah, that is not what I
   mean, Sir! I mean that I have lost one whom I fondly loved." I know
   that you have, but do you think that the Lord has turned against you
   because He has permitted this trial to come upon you? How can He ever
   desert those for whom He died? And if He died for them when they were
   ungodly, will He not live for them, now that He has shed His love
   abroad in their hearts by the Holy Spirit?

   I cannot work this out for you. I want you to go home and work it out
   for yourselves. If any of you are cast down, here is the first well of
   comfort at which you may drink full draughts of Divine
   consolation--"Christ died for the ungodly." Then He must help those who
   are trusting in Him.

   II. Now we come to a second well, to see whether we can draw waters of
   comfort out of it, also. According to our text, CHRIST DIED FOR US,
   "WHEN WE WERE YET WITHOUT STRENGTH."

   I must only say a word or two, here, because the time will not allow me
   to enlarge. First, we were naturally in a lost condition through the
   Fall, when we were born into this world, and we lived in it for years,
   "without strength" to do that which was right. When we began to wake up
   a little to thoughts of God and Divine things, we heard the Truth of
   God preached, but we were still without power of access even to the
   Gospel. We were told to repent, but our hard heart would yield no
   waters of repentance. We were told to believe in Christ--the preacher
   might as well have commanded the dead

   to rise out of their graves! Christ was set before us in all His
   beauty, yet our blindness was such that we could not appreciate His
   loveliness. The Bread of Life was put on the table before us, but such
   was our obstinacy that we would not believe it to be bread and we would
   not eat of it. We were "without strength."

   And further on, when the will came and the Lord began, by His Grace, to
   work upon us, we had a will to repent, we had a will to believe and we
   had a will to come to Christ--yet we were without the Graces which are
   now our strength. I remember well the time when I had to say, "To will
   is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not."
   "I would, but cannot repent. I would, but cannot believe." A rock was
   in the heart--a stone was laid over the mouth of the well of
   consolation! We were "without strength." But when we were in that sad
   state, without one of the Graces which are now our strength, without
   one of those holy fruits of the Spirit which are now the source of our
   consolation--even then, "when we were yet without strength," Christ
   died for us! When every sinew was snapped, every bone broken, every
   power gone, life, itself, evaporated--for we were dead in trespasses
   and sins--even then Christ died for us! Well now, Brothers and Sisters,
   this is true--do you believe it? I want you to get the argument out of
   this Truth of God, for it is this--if the Lord Jesus loved us enough to
   die for us when we had no strength whatever, then He will certainly
   save us now that He has given us strength!

   Just look and see what kind of strength He has given us. According to
   the context, He has given us peace. What strength is theirs who have
   peace with God! I can do all things when I know that God is on my side.
   Well, has He given me the strength that comes out of confidence in Him,
   perfect reconciliation with Him--and will He now let me be destroyed by
   the enemy? It cannot be!

   In addition to peace, He has given us access to Himself. What a
   strength there is in being able to go to God in prayer! By faith we can
   go to God whenever we are in need! And am I able to go to my heavenly
   Father and tell Him all my trouble and cast my burden upon Him--and did
   His dear Son die for me when I was without strength and will He leave
   me, now that I can go to Him in prayer? O Beloved, it is impossible! I
   cannot imagine His turning against us.

   Moreover, according to the third verse, He has now given us patience.
   We have had a deal of trouble, but it has worked patience. The Lord
   knows that at one time you had no patience at all. You used to, like a
   bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, kick every time He struck you, but
   now you often hold your tongue and quietly endure His chastening rod.
   Patience is a great strength to a man, or a woman--if you can be
   patient, you are strong. Well now, if Christ loved you so as to buy you
   with His blood when you were impatient, has He given you this strength
   to be patient under His hand, and do you think that He will destroy
   you?

   And, in addition to patience, He has given you a good deal of
   experience. I speak to ever so many of God's people, here, who are
   experienced Christians. You have gone up hill and down dale, you have
   tried and proved the faithfulness of God--you have known by experience
   your own weakness and your own folly--but you also know God's
   faithfulness and God's strength. Do you think that the Lord has given
   you all this experience and then that He means to play the fool with
   you? Do you think that He gives and takes away, again, like little
   children in their play? What? Has He put you through all these paces
   and drilled you in this style and is He now going to drum you out of
   the army? No, no! Believe nothing of the kind! He that has given you
   patience and experience will keep you to the end.

   And then, in addition to that, He has given you hope, for patience
   works experience and experience, hope. A hope that makes not ashamed.
   Has God really given you a hope? "Oh! "says one, "it is sometimes a
   very poor hope." Yes, but is it hope in Christ? Do you hope in His
   mercy? Then remember this text, "The Lord takes pleasure in them that
   fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy." The smallest hope, if it
   comes from God, tremble as it may, is better than the proudest
   presumption that ever came from self-righteousness! If the Lord Jesus
   has given you a hope in His blood, a hope in His intercession, a hope
   in His eternal faithfulness, ah, believe me, if He loved you when you
   had no hope, He will never cast you away, now that you have a hope that
   He has, Himself, given you!

   Only once more upon this point. We read in the fifth verse of the "Holy
   Spirit which is given unto us." Now listen. If, when we were yet
   without strength, Christ died for us, will He not save us, now that He
   has given us the Holy Spirit? Think of it, Christian! The Holy Spirit
   has come to live in you! Poor and despised, or illiterate and unknown,
   yet within you dwells the Spirit of God! That body of yours is a
   temple--that is God's Word, not mine--"Know you not that your body is
   the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you?" Well now, if Christ
   bought you with His blood when you were no

   temple, but were a defiled place--I know not to what vile thing to
   compare you--will He let you be broken down, now that He has made you a
   temple and the Holy Spirit has come to dwell in you?

   I know that I must be speaking to somebody, tonight, in great trouble.
   I am sure that I am. I have it upon my soul that I am addressing some
   true child of God who is at his wits' end, driven to the utmost
   extremity of sorrow. Dear Friend, believe in your God! Let not a doubt
   come in about Him. The Son of God died for you upon the Cross when you
   were ungodly and without strength--and He cannot, must not, shall not
   be suspected of any wish to cast you off, or of any possibility of
   change in His love to you. My Brothers and Sisters, I would say to you,
   in your trouble, tonight, what Hopeful said to Christian when He was in
   the Death River and cried out, "I sink in deep waters." Hopeful said to
   him, "Be of good cheer, my Brother, I feel the bottom, and it is good."
   So I feel the bottom, tonight, my Brother, my Sister, even if you do
   not--it is a good bottom and you will never be swept away from it if
   you are trusting in Jesus! He that brought you into the water, if He
   makes the tide rise up to your chin, will teach you to swim! When you
   cannot walk any further, you shall find waters to swim in and there is
   no water so deep that the child of God can drown in it! You may go as
   low as the grave, but you will never go any lower. "Underneath are the
   everlasting arms." There is always One who is ready to catch you when
   you are at your very worst as to circumstances and trials. Therefore,
   be of good cheer! Magnify God in the fire and rest assured that He who
   gave Himself up to die for you, will never lose you, but will keep you
   even to the end.

   Now I come to the last point, which is also full of consolation. I
   think that I heard someone heave a deep sigh and say, "Ah! It may be as
   you say, it may be all true, and I trust that it is, but I am in such
   trouble that if I do not get help directly, I shall be done for. I
   have, to cry, 'Make haste, O God, make haste for my help!' I need a God
   who can do what David's God did when 'He rode upon a cherub and did
   fly: yes, He did fly upon the wings of the wind.'" That is the kind of
   God that you need, yes, and that is the kind of God that you have! He
   will come flying to your deliverance, as I will now try to show you.

   III. Here is the third well of consolation, CHRIST DIED FOR US IN DUE
   TIME--"In due time Christ died for the ungodly."

   I cannot tell you how much marrow I have found in this bone, "In due
   time Christ died for the ungodly." The teaching of this verse seems to
   be something like this. It means, first, that Christ died for us when
   justice required His death. Suppose that I owe a debt? I am thankful
   that I do not, but suppose that I did owe a very heavy debt and that it
   had to be paid, say, on Tuesday morning. And there is a friend who has
   undertaken to pay it for me. The bill is due at 12 o'clock and he says
   that he will pay it for me. Now suppose that my friend goes in on
   Wednesday morning and pays the amount. It is very good of him, but
   still, you see, I lose my reputation for discharging my liabilities "in
   due time." I did not meet the bill on Tuesday at twelve. True, there
   are only 24 hours lost, but still, I am not the man that I was in the
   trade I fol-low--I have been a defaulter. Now, I like to think of this
   fact, that I, a poor sinner, over head and ears in debt to God's
   Justice, have not only paid Him through my great Surety, but I have
   paid Him to the minute! "In due time" my Surety came and discharged my
   debt for me! "In due time Christ died for the ungodly."

   This verse also means that Christ died in due time as to every
   Believer. In God's Book of Remembrance there is no claim for late
   payment or delay against any believing sinner. There is no note, there,
   saying, "This sinner's Surety died late." No, but when Justice demanded
   the debt, Justice received full payment from those dear hands that were
   nailed to the Cross for me. "In due time Christ died for the ungodly."
   It was the time appointed in the eternal decree. It was the time
   arranged in the everlasting counsels of Grace--and Christ was there to
   the tick of the clock. He went up to the Cross on the day when it was
   agreed that He would finish transgression and make an end of sin--and
   bring in everlasting righteousness! He made Atonement--He died for the
   ungodly, "in due time."

   Well, now, do you see what I am driving at? You need help, you say, you
   need deliverance. Very well. The greatest help that you ever needed was
   for someone to stand and be a Daysman for you--and to pay your debts to
   Infinite Justice and your Lord did it--and did it in the nick of time!
   "In due time." Will He not, therefore, deliver you in due time?

   Besides, He has given you patience--"Tribulation works patience." He
   will help you before you have done with your patience. "I cannot hold
   out much longer," says one. You shall not have any need to hold out
   much longer! The Lord is on the way to deliver you and before your
   stock of Grace-worked patience shall quite have run out, He will come
   to you!

   Read the next word--"And patience, experience." Your experience, as
   long as ever it will profit you, will be painful. But when it is no
   longer an experience that will do you good, it will not be painful.
   Remember how Paul writes in this same Epistle, "We know that all things
   work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
   called according to His purpose." And if He has called you, He will let
   you suffer as long as the experience of the suffering will work for
   your good, but no longer! In due time He will bring you out of that
   trying experience.

   And He will bring you out before your hope gets to be ashamed. Read
   those words again--"And experience, hope: and hope makes not ashamed."
   The Lord will not let your trouble go so far that you will have to say,
   "I was deceived; I must give up being a Christian." God will not leave
   you in the hour of need. He will help you in due time, before your
   expiring hope quite gives up the ghost. Be of good courage about that!

   And He will come and help you while your love yet remains. Did I not
   hear you say, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him. He may flog
   me; but I am still His child, and I love Him, and I will kiss His hand,
   and His rod, too"? Well, well, if that is your language, He must come
   to help You in due time! He must deliver you before that love is driven
   out of your heart.

   Yes, and let me say that while you are now without strength, He who
   died for you while you were without strength in the fullest sense, will
   come and help you. I thank God, tonight, as I have done many a time
   before, for being brought into great straits. Sometimes it has been
   very plain sailing for years. I remember once saying to myself, "Well,
   in former days, in the great needs for the College and the Orphanage, I
   have experienced wonderful miracles of deliverance. Then I seemed to
   step, like a giant, from the top of one mountain to another, right over
   the valleys! And now I go along the valleys gently and simply." I have
   half wished to see another lofty mountain and another yawning chasm
   open, that I might see what God would do--and I have had them! During
   the last two years, though I have said little about them, I have had
   many a crevasse open up before me. The ice has seemed to split asunder
   and I have looked down into the blue depths. But I have gone on just as
   steadily and God, in His mercy, has made the way just as easy as if my
   path had all been as smooth as a lawn after the garden roller had been
   over it! It is a glorious thing to have a big trouble, a great Atlantic
   billow that takes you off your feet and sweeps you right out to
   sea--and lets you sink down into the depths, into old ocean's lowest
   caverns, till you get to the foundations of the mountains--and there
   see God and then come up again to tell what a great God He is and how
   graciously He delivers His people! He will deliver you, He must deliver
   you! The argument of the text is this, "In due time Christ died for the
   ungodly," therefore, in due time He must help the godly.

   Now I finish with two observations. First, the Gospel of sinners is the
   comfort of saints. If ever you saints need a bit of real comfort, you
   must just go to God as sinners. I do not think that there is anything
   better or wiser, whenever you really need to be solidly cheered, than
   to begin, again, where you began at first. When the devil says to me,
   "You are no saint," I say to him, "Nor are you, either." "Ah!" he says,
   "You are a deceiver," and I reply, "And so are you." "Ah!" he says,
   "But you are mistaken, your experience has been a delusion, you are no
   child of God." "What am I, then? Tell me, if you know so much about
   me." "You are a sinner," he says. "All right, Satan! I thank you for
   that word, for Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners." So I
   begin again--and if you begin again like that, you will very often find
   that this is a short cut to comfort. If it comes to a question between
   the devil and you whether you are a saint or not, you will have a hard
   battle to fight, let me tell you.

   One of you may say, "I know that I am a saint." Well, well, well, "let
   another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not
   your own lips." "Oh, but I know," says one. Very well, go on knowing
   it, but if the devil once gets you in the sieve in which he had Peter,
   I question whether you will know your head from your heels! Under a
   strong temptation you will very soon begin, almost, to doubt your own
   existence! Instead of arguing the question of your saintship with
   Satan, who is an old lawyer and knows many things that you do not know,
   you had better say, "Whether I am a saint or not, I am not going to
   dispute. But I am a sinner and Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners."

   Believer, when you were a boy, you used to drink at a certain old well.
   How cold the water was, how refreshing! When you feel very thirsty and
   the pumps are dry, go back to the old well, and got a draught of the
   Living Water there. I find that I have to do that every now and then.
   While I thank God for present enjoyments and sweet experiences of
   communion with Himself, I like to go back to the old well, and just
   drink as I drank at the first. I remember how I did drink the first
   time from that well, "Look unto Me, and be you saved, all you ends of
   the earth." I think I drank so much that time that I was like behemoth
   who trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth! There was much in
   that text, but

   there was none too much for me, and I seemed to drink it all in. I
   recommend you to do the same--take a great draught of the Grace of God,
   tonight, thirsty child of God! Stoop down, with your mouth right over
   the well, for the Living Water comes springing straight up to your
   lips! And then drink as a cow drinks in the summertime, all that you
   can take in--and go on your way rejoicing!

   The Gospel of sinners is the comfort of saints! That is one
   observation, and the other is this--the comfort of saints is the Gospel
   of sinners, for, if the Lord has done great things for any one of His
   people, what reason is there, poor Sinner, why He should not do the
   same for you? If the Lord Jesus Christ has loved John Smith, why should
   He not love Mary Smith. And if the Lord Jesus Christ has saved Tom
   Jones, why should He not save Harry Jones? I mean that since He does
   not love because of any worthiness in us, but simply because He wills
   to love us, as it is written, "I will have mercy on whom I will have
   mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion," then
   you may come, you guilty ones, to this Sovereign Dispenser of
   undeserved mercy and touch the silver scepter of His Grace and be saved
   tonight!

   May His sweet Spirit bring you! Do not let any of us raise a question
   about whether we are saints or sinners, but let us all come
   together--let us come en masse to the Cross! Let the whole of us now
   fly to Calvary and stand and look up to Him, the eternal Son of God,
   bleeding and dying on the Cross! And let us all believe, now, that He
   can, that He will, that He does save, no, that He has saved our souls.
   God grant us Grace to do it, for His dear name's sake! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS5.

   Verse 1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God--It
   is a matter of present possession and present enjoyment. Whatever
   tribulation there may be in the world, "we have peace with God."
   Blessed be God for that glorious fact! We may not have peace with all
   men, though we would seek to have that, but, "we have peace with God."

   1, 2. Through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom, also, we have access by
   faith into this Grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the
   Glory of God. So we ascend this golden ladder, from faith to peace,
   from peace to access with God, and from this to joy by the way of hope.
   Happy people, who know this blessed way of climbing out of the sorrows
   of the present into the Glory that shall be revealed!

   3. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations, also. Present trials
   even become subjects for thanksgiving. Surely, they have lost their
   sting when patience accepts them and faith rejoices in them.

   3-5. Knowing that tribulation works patience; and patience experience,
   and experience hope: and hope makes not ashamed; because the love of
   God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto
   us. Like a sweet perfume which enters every room and fills every nook
   and cranny in the house, so does the delightful love of God fill the
   entire soul when, by the Holy Spirit, it is shed abroad in the heart.
   Beloved, may you feel that blessed influence this evening! This next
   verse may help us to love God and to feel the love of God shed abroad
   in our hearts.

   6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
   the ungodly. He did not regard us as saints, but as actually ungodly
   when He died for our redemption! It was not man's righteousness that
   brought Christ from Heaven, but man's sin and the infinite pity of God.

   7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die. Though he were as
   just as Aristides, though he were renowned for justice, nobody would
   die for him. There is no such attraction in the virtue as would win
   anyone's love so as to die for the man who displays it.

   7. Yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die. For a
   benevolent, large-hearted, kindly-disposed man, some might dare to die.
   Such a thing is not likely, but it is possible.

   8. But God commends His love toward us, in that while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us. We were without any attraction, without
   any righteousness, without any goodness, yet Christ loved us! Out of
   the graciousness of His own heart He loved us, according to that text,
   "I will love them freely."

   9. Much more, then. See how the Apostle, when he had uttered a great
   Truth of God, proceeds to say something greater, still. Just before, he
   had written, "And not only so," and now he says, "Much more, then."

   9. Being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath
   through Him. If Christ died for us when we were sinners, will He not
   save us now that He has made us saints? If, when we were condemned, He
   redeemed us, will He not preserve us, now that we are justified? This
   is a strong plea for the final perseverance and ultimate salvation of
   all Believers.

   10. 11. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His
   life. And not only so. The Apostle is again up on the wings--he cannot
   fly high enough to describe all Christ's work. "And not only so,"

   11. But we, also, joy in God--That is a delightful experience, joying
   in God, Himself--in the very Character and Person of God! So perfectly
   reconciled are we that not only do we rejoice in God's gifts, and in
   His mercy, but we swim in a sea of delight in God, Himself--"We, also,
   joy in God"--

   11. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
   Atonement. Now comes an admonition.

   12. Therefore, as by one man, sin entered into the world, and death by
   sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.
   Sinned, that is, in the first man.

   13. 14. (For until the Law, sin was in the world, but sin is not
   imputed when there is no Law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
   Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of
   Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to come. I
   suppose that Paul refers even to little children who "had not sinned
   after the similitude of Adam's transgression," and yet died as the
   result of Adam's sin.

   15-20. But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through
   the offense of one many are dead, much more the Grace of God, and the
   gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto
   many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
   judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
   offenses unto justification. For if by one man's offense death reigned
   by one: much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift
   of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ). Therefore
   as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation;
   even so by the righteousness of One, the free gift came upon all men
   unto Justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were
   made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.
   Moreover the Law entered, that the offense might abound. Just as,
   sometimes, a physician may give a medicine which causes the disease to
   be more fully developed in order to its ultimate cure, so does the Law
   of God make a discovery of our sin to us. And it also excites us to
   greater sin, by reason of the enmity of our nature which is opposed to
   the Law of God, and becomes the more active the more clearly the Law is
   known, even as Paul says, further on in this Epistle, "I had not known
   lust, except the Law had said, You shall not covet."

   20, 21. But where sin abounded, Grace did much more abound: that as sin
   has reigned unto death, even so might Grace reign through righteousness
   unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. Blessed be His holy name!
   Amen.
