PREFACE

   The Epistle to the Hebrews was written by the eternal Spirit for the
   whole Church of God in all ages. It shows us on what footing we are to
   stand before God as sinners; and in what way we are to draw near as
   worshippers.

   It assumes throughout, that the present condition of the Church on
   earth is one continually requiring the application of the great
   sacrifice for cleansing. The theory of personal sinlessness has no
   place in it. Continual evil, failure, imperfection, are assumed as the
   condition of God's worshippers on earth, during this dispensation.
   Personal imperfection on the one hand, and vicarious perfection on the
   other, are the solemn truths which pervade the whole. There is no day
   nor hour in which evil is not coming forth from us, and in which the
   great bloodshedding is not needed to wash it away. This epistle is
   manifestly meant for the whole life of the saint, and for the whole
   history of the Church. God's purpose is that we should never, while
   here, get beyond the need of expiation and purging; and though vain man
   may think that he would better glorify God by sinlessness, yet the Holy
   Spirit in this epistle shows us that we are called to glorify God by
   our perpetual need of the precious bloodshedding upon the cross. No
   need of washing, may be the watchword of some; they are beyond all
   that! But they who, whether conscious or unconscious of sin, will take
   this epistle as the declaration of God's mind as to the imperfection of
   the believing man on earth, will be constrained to acknowledge that the
   bloodshedding must be in constant requisition, not (as some say) to
   keep the believer in a sinless state, but to cleanse him from his
   hourly sinfulness. [1]

   Boldness to enter into the holiest is a condition of the soul which can
   only be maintained by continual recourse to the blood of sprinkling,
   alike for conscious and for unconscious sin: the latter of these being
   by far the most subtle and the most terrible,--that for which the
   sin-offering required to be brought.

   "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
   not in us." The presence of sin in us is the only thing which makes
   such epistles as that to the Hebrews at all intelligible. When, by some
   instantaneous act of faith, we soar above sin, (as some think they do)
   we also bid farewell to the no longer needed blood, and to the no
   longer needed Epistle to the Hebrews.

   "Through the veil, which is His flesh," is our one access to God; not
   merely at first when we believed, but day by day, to the last. The
   blood- dropped pavement is that one which we tread, and the
   blood-stained mercy-seat is that before which we bow. In letters of
   blood there is written on that veil, and that mercy-seat, "I am the
   way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh to the Father but by me":
   and, again, "Through Him we have access, by one Spirit, unto the
   Father."

   Every thing connected with the sanctuary, outer and inner, is, in God's
   sight, excellent and precious. As of the altar, so of every other part
   of it, we may say, "Whatsoever toucheth it shall be holy" (Exo 29:37).
   Or, as the Apostle Peter puts it, "To you who believe this preciousness
   belongs" (1 Peter 2:7, i.e., all the preciousness of the "precious
   stone").

   Men may ask, May we not be allowed to differ in opinion from God about
   this preciousness? Why should our estimate of the altar, or the blood,
   or the veil, if not according to God's, be so fatal to us as to shut us
   out of the kingdom? And why should our acceptance of God's estimate
   make us heirs of salvation? I answer, such is the mind of God, and such
   is the divine statute concerning admission and exclusion.

   You may try the experiment of differing from Him as to other things,
   but beware of differing from Him as to this. Remember that He has said,
   "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Say what you like,
   He is a jealous God, and will avenge all disparagement of His
   sanctuary, or dishonour of His Son. Contend with Him, if you will try
   the strife, about other things. It may not cost you your soul. Dispute
   His estimate of the works of His hand in heaven and earth; say that
   they are not altogether "good," and that you could have improved them,
   had you been consulted. It may not forfeit your crown. Tell Him that
   His light is not so glorious as He thinks it is, nor His stars so
   brilliant as He declares they are. He may bear with this thy
   underrating of His material handiwork, and treat thee as a foolish
   child that speaks of what he knows not.

   But touch His great work, His work of works,-- the person and
   propitiation of His only-begotten Son, and He will bear with thee no
   more. Differ from Him in His estimate of the great bloodshedding, and
   he will withstand thee to the face. Tell Him that the blood of Golgotha
   could no more expiate sin than the blood of bulls and of goats, and He
   will resent it to the uttermost. Depreciate anything, everything that
   He has made; He may smile at thy presumption. But depreciate not the
   cross. Underrate not the sacrifice of the great altar. It will cost
   thee thy soul. It will shut thee out of the kingdom. It will darken thy
   eternity.

   [1] I intended to have said something more upon this point; but room
   fails me. I meant to have noticed the Seventh of the Romans in
   connection with some recent opinions. But I content myself with the
   following letter, which appeared in the London Record of October 19th,
   to show the extreme lengths to which some are prepared to go in
   advocating their tenets. Rather than reconsider their own opinions,
   they will affirm that the Apostle Paul fell from grace, went into
   heresy, and that the Seventh of the Romans is the confession of his
   fall and heresy. An English Clergyman thus writes to the London
   Record:-- "I am surprised that in dealing with Mr. Pearsall Smith's
   errors, no one, so far as I know, has yet called attention to his
   tract, 'Bondage and Liberty,' on the Seventh of Romans. "He asserts
   that St. Paul 'fell from grace,' and became entangled in the Galatian
   heresy! That there may be no kind of mistake, I give his own words:--
   "'But having begun in the Spirit, he had sought to be made perfect by
   the activities of the flesh, the consequences of which were that sin
   revived and "he died," or lost his full communion with Christ, and
   victory through faith over sin. "'You have had now to travel along with
   Paul in the Seventh of Romans, in this passage which is manifestly the
   experience of a Christian, though not a true Christian experience.
   After having once exclaimed, "How shall we that are dead to sin live
   any longer therein?" you have been deceived, mistaking your own efforts
   to keep God's law for the walk of faith; and the result has been that
   sin has been--not conquered, but to a sad extent manifested. "'It is
   this agonising experience of yours of failure in your inward and
   outward walk that was shared by Paul in this parenthesis--following his
   declaration of the death of believers to sin and to the law--to which
   he here limits the pronoun "I," as the acknowledgment of how a
   Christian may fail, rather than as belonging to the proper experience
   of a Christian. It was this experience that made him so zealous in
   warning the Galatians against legalism in their walk. It was the agony
   of this "falling from grace" and coming "under law" in his practical
   ways that brought out the cry of despair, "O wretched man that I am!
   who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" "'But, brother Paul,
   thy agony is ended when, as in a moment, and with a sudden joy that
   precludes explanation, thou again beholdest Jesus dawning on thy soul
   as a Deliverer, not only from wrath, but from sinning. "I thank God
   through Jesus Christ our Lord."' "As may be supposed, there is much
   nonsense and confusion in the little book from which the above is
   taken, but I submit whether there is not something worse, and which
   calls for vigorous treatment at the hands of faithful, sensible,
   Evangelical men?"

  Chapter 1

Open Intercourse with God.

   It does not seem a strange thing that the creature and the Creator
   should meet face to face, and that they should hold intercourse without
   any obstructing medium.

   We may not understand the mode of communication between the visible and
   the invisible, but we can see this, at least, that He who made us can
   communicate with us, by the ear or the eye or the touch. He can speak
   and we can hear; and, again, we can speak and He can hear. His being
   and ours can thus come together, to interchange thought and affection:
   He giving, we receiving; He rejoicing in us, and we rejoicing in Him:
   He loving us, and we loving Him. He can look on us, and we can look on
   Him; He "guiding us with His eye" (Psa 32:8), and we fixing our eye on
   His, as children on the eye of a father, taking in all the love and
   tenderness which beam from His paternal look, and sending up to Him our
   responding look of filial confidence and love. Not that He has "eyes of
   flesh, or seeth as man seeth" (Job 10:4); but He can fix His gaze on us
   in ways of His own, and make us feel His gaze, as really as when the
   eyes of friends look into each other's depths. "He that formed the eye
   shall He not see" (Psa 94:9). He who made the human eye to be "the
   light of the body" (Matt 6:22),--that organ through which light enters
   the body,--in order that He might pour into us the glory of His own sun
   and moon and stars,--can He not, through some inner eye which we know
   not, and for which we have no name, pour into us the radiance of His
   own infinite glory, though He be the "King invisible" (1 Tim 1:17),--He
   "whom no man hath seen nor can see" (1 Tim 6:16),--the "invisible God"
   (Col 1:15). He can touch us; for in Him we live and move and have our
   being: [2] and we can lay hold of Him, for He is not far from any one
   of us; He is the nearest of all that is near, and the most palpable of
   all the palpable. It would seem, then, that open and free and near
   intercourse with the God who made us arose from His being what He is,
   and from our being what we are: as if it were a necessity both of His
   existence and of ours.

   That He should be our Creator, and yet be separated from us, seems an
   impossibility; that we should be His creatures, and yet remain at a
   distance from Him, seems the most unnatural and unlikely of all
   relations. Intercourse, fellowship, mutual love, then, seem to flow
   from all that He is to us, and from all that we are to Him.

   We can conceive of no obstruction, no difficulty in all this, so long
   as we remained what He has made us. There could be nothing but the
   sympathy of heart with heart; a flow and reflow of holy and
   unobstructed love.

   Unhindered access to the God who made us seems one of the necessary
   conditions of our nature; and this not arising out of any merit or
   worthiness on the part of the creature, but from the fitness of things;
   the adaptation of the thing made to Him who made it; and the
   impossibility of separation between that which was made and Him who
   made it. The life above and the life below must draw together; heart
   cannot be separated from heart, unless something come between to put
   asunder that which had by the necessity of nature been joined together.
   Distance from God does not belong to our creation, but has come in as
   something unnatural, something alien to creative love, something which
   contravenes the original and fundamental law of our being.

   The tree separated from its root, the flower broken off from its stem,
   are the fittest emblems of man disjoined from God. Such distance seems
   altogether unnatural. The want of vital connection, in our original
   constitution, or the absence of sympathy, would imply defect in the
   workmanship, of the most serious kind,--and no less would it indicate
   imperfection on the part of the Great Worker.

   God made us for Himself; that He might delight in us and we in Him; He
   to be our portion and we His; He to be our treasure and we His. [3] He
   made us after His own likeness; so that each part of our being has its
   resemblance or counterpart in Himself: our affections, and sympathies,
   and feelings being made after the model of His own. We are apt to
   associate God only with what is cold and abstract and ideal; ourselves
   with what is emotional and personal. Herein we greatly err. We must
   reverse the picture if we would know the truth concerning Him with whom
   is no coldness, no abstraction, no impersonality. The reality
   pertaining to the nature of man, is as nothing when compared with the
   reality belonging to the nature of Him who created us after His own
   image. In so far as the infinite exceeds the finite, in so far does
   that which we call reality transcend in God all that is known by that
   term in man. We are the shadows, He is the substance. Jehovah is the
   infinitely real and true and personal: and it is with Him as such that
   we have to do. The God of philosophy may be a cold abstraction, which
   no mind can grasp, and by which no heart can be warmed; but the God of
   Scripture, the God who created the heavens and the earth, the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is a reality,--a reality for both the
   mind and heart of man. It is the infinite Jehovah that loves, and
   pities, and blesses; who bids us draw near to Him, walk with Him, and
   have fellowship with Him. It is the infinite Jehovah who fills the
   finite heart; for He made that heart for the very purpose of its being
   filled with Himself. Our joy is to be in Him; His joy is in us. Over us
   He resteth in His love, and in Himself He bids us rest. Apart from Him
   creaturehood has neither stability nor blessedness.

   Free and open intercourse with the God who made us, is one of the
   necessities of our being. Acquaintanceship with Him, and delight in
   Him, are the very life of our created existence. Better not to be than
   not to know Him, in whom we live, and move, and have our being. Better
   to pass away into unconsciousness or nothingness, than to cease to
   delight in Him, or to be delighted in by Him.

   The loss of God is the loss of everything; and in having God we have
   everything. His overflowing fulness is our inheritance; and in nearness
   to Him we enjoy that fulness. He cannot speak to us, but something of
   that fulness flows in. We cannot speak to Him without attracting His
   excellency towards us. This mutual speech, or converse, is that which
   forms the medium of communication between heaven and earth. Man looketh
   up, and God looketh down: our eyes meet, and we are, in the twinkling
   of an eye, made partakers of the divine abundance. [4] Man speaks out
   to God what He feels; God speaks out to man what He feels. The finite
   and the infinite mind thus interchange their sympathies; love meets
   love, mingling and rejoicing together; the full pours itself into the
   empty, and the empty receiveth the full.

   The greatness of God is no hindrance to this intercourse: for one
   special part of the divine greatness is to be able to condescend to the
   littleness of created beings, seeing that creaturehood must, from its
   very nature, have this littleness; inasmuch as God must ever be God,
   and man must ever be man: the ocean must ever be the ocean, the drop
   must ever be the drop. The greatness of God compassing our littleness
   about, as the heavens the earth, and fitting into it on every side, as
   the air into all parts of the earth, is that which makes the
   intercourse so complete and blessed. "In His hand is the soul of every
   living thing, and the breath of all mankind" (Job 12:10). Such is His
   nearness to, such His intimacy with, the works of His hands.

   It is nearness, not distance, that the name Creator implies; and the
   simple fact of His having made us is the assurance of His desire to
   bless us and to hold intercourse with us. Communication between the
   thing made and its maker is involved in the very idea of creation. "Thy
   hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may
   learn Thy commandments" (Psa 119:73). "Faithful Creator" is His name (1
   Peter 4:19), and as such we appeal to Him, "Forsake not the work of
   Thine own hands" (Psa 138:8).

   Nothing that is worthless or unloveable ever came from His hands; and
   as being His "workmanship," we may take the assurance of His interest
   in us, and His desire for converse with us. [5]

   He put no barrier between Himself and us when He made us. If there be
   such a thing now, it is we who have been its cause. Separation from Him
   must have come upon our side. It was not the father who sent the
   younger son away; it was that son who "gathered all together and took
   his journey into the far country" (Luke 15:13), because he had become
   tired of the father's house and the father's company.

   The rupture between God and man did not begin on the side of God. It
   was not heaven that withdrew from earth, but earth that withdrew from
   heaven. It was not the father that said to the younger son, Take your
   goods, pack up and be gone; it was that son who said, "Father give me
   the portion of goods that falleth to me," and who, "not many days
   after, took his journey into the far country," turning his back on his
   father and his father's house.

   "O Israel! thou hast destroyed THYSELF" (Hosea 13:9). O man! thou hast
   cast off God. It is not God who has cast off thee. Thou hast dislinked
   thyself from the blessed Creator; thou hast broken the golden chain
   that fastened thee to His throne, the silken cord that bound thee to
   his heart.

   Yet He wants thee back again; nor will He rest till He has accomplished
   His gracious design, and made thee once more the vessel of His love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] 1. It is interesting to notice the way in which the negative
   particle is used in the different designations of God. He is called
   invisible,--He who cannot be seen, He who cannot lie (Titus 1:2)
   incorruptible (Rom 1:23; 1 Tim 1:17) He who cannot be tempted (James
   1:13): He who only hath immortality (1 Tim 6:16). In connection with
   the things of God, and of Christ, we have a similar use of the same
   negative particle:--Thus, "His eternal power and Godhead" (Rom 1:20);
   unfading (1 Peter 1:4); immutability (Heb 6:17); without repentance
   (Rom 11:29); undefiled (Heb 7:26); past finding out (Rom 11:33);
   unchangeable (Heb 7:24). These instances will illustrate the truth that
   very much of what we express of God, is expressed in the form of a
   contrast to the things of man.

   [3] John Howe thus writes on this point, in his treatise on "Delighting
   in God":--"The most excellent portion, in whom all things that may
   render Him such do concur and meet together; all desirable and
   imaginable riches and fulness, together with large bounty, flowing
   goodness, every way correspondent to the wants and cravings of indigent
   and thirsty souls. How infinitely delightful is it to view and enjoy
   Him as our portion...every way complete and full, it being the
   all-comprehensive good which is this portion, God
   all-sufficient...making His boundless fulness overflow to the
   replenishing of thirsty longing souls."

   [4] "How pleasant to lose themselves in Him; to be swallowed up in the
   overcoming sense of His boundless, all-sufficient, everywhere flowing
   fulness! By this dependence they make this fulness of God their own.
   They have nothing to do but to depend; to live upon a present
   self-sufficient good, which alone is enough to replenish all desires.
   How can we divide the highest pleasure, the fullest satisfaction, from
   this dependence! 'Tis to live at the rate of a god; a godlike life; a
   living upon immense fulness; as He lives."--Howe's Blessedness of the
   Righteous, Chapter 8.

   [5] "God's excellency, His wisdom, His purity and love seemed to appear
   in everything; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds and blue sky;
   in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water, and all nature-- which
   used greatly to fix my mind."--Jonathan Edwards

  Chapter 2.

How There Came to Be a Veil.

   There was no veil in Paradise between man and God. There were three
   places or regions; the outer earth, Eden, and "the Garden of Eden," or
   Paradise; but there was no veil nor fence between, hindering access
   from the one to the other. There was nothing to prevent man from going
   in to speak with God, or God from coming out to speak with man.

   It was not till after man had disobeyed that the veil was let down
   which separated God from man, which made a distinction between the
   dwellings of man and the habitation of God.

   Before God had spoken or done aught in the way of separation, man
   betrayed his consciousness of his new standing, and of the necessity
   for a covering or screen. He fled from God into the thick trees of the
   garden, that their foliage might hide him from God and God from him. In
   so doing he showed that he felt two things,-- 1. That there must be a
   veil between him and God; 2. That, now, in his altered position,
   distance from God (if such a thing could be) was his safety.

   Even if God had said "draw near," man could not have responded "let us
   draw near," or felt "it is good for me to draw near to God." For sin
   had now come between, and until that should be dealt with in the way of
   pardon and removal, he could not approach God, nor expect God to
   approach him.

   There was a sense of guilt upon his conscience, and he knew that there
   was displeasure on the part of God; so that fellowship, in such
   circumstances, was impossible. Any meeting, in this case, could only be
   that of the criminal and the Judge; the one to tremble, and the other
   to pronounce the righteous sentence.

   God did come down to man; but not to converse as before; not to commune
   in love as if nothing had come in between them. He came to declare His
   righteousness; and yet to reveal His grace. He came to condemn, and He
   came to pardon. He came to show how utterly he abhorred the sin, and
   yet how graciously he was minded toward the sinner.

   Something then had now come in between the Creator and the creature,
   which made it no longer possible for the same intercourse to be
   maintained as before. Man himself felt this, as soon as he had sinned;
   and God declared that it was so.

   How was that "something" to be dealt with? It was of man's creation;
   yet man had no power to deal with it.

   Shall it be removed, or shall it stand? If it stands, then man is lost
   to God and to himself. For the sentence is explicit, "In the day thou
   eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." [6] If it is to be removed, the
   barrier swept away, and the distance obliterated, God must do it, and
   He must do it immediately, before the criminal is handed over to final
   execution, and He must do it righteously, that there may be no
   uncertainty as to the thing done, and no possibility of any future
   reversal of the blessing or any replacement of the barrier.

   God, in coming down to man, said, "Thou hast sinned, and there is not
   now the same relationship between us that there was: there is a
   barrier; but I mean to remove it; not all at once; and yet completely
   at last." Man was not to be lost to God, nor to himself. He was too
   precious a part of God's possessions to be thrown away. He was too dear
   to God to be destroyed. "God loved the world" (John 3:16).

   Yet there must be a shutting out from God; and this was intimated from
   the beginning. God shuts Himself out from man; and He shuts man out
   from himself: for the way into the holiest for a sinner could not be
   prepared all at once. Not man only, but the universe, must be taught
   long lessons both in righteousness and in grace, before the new and
   living way can be opened.

   Law had said "The soul that sinneth it shall die" (Eze 18:4); Grace had
   said "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked" (Eze 33:11);
   Righteousness had said "The wicked shall be turned into hell" (Psa
   9:17); Mercy had said "How shall I deliver thee up?" (Hosea 11:8). In
   what way are these things to be reconciled? Condemnation is just: can
   pardon be also just? Exclusion from God's presence was righteous, can
   admission into that presence be no less so?

   The solution of this question must be given on judicial grounds, and
   must recognise all the judicial or legal elements involved in the
   treatment of crime and criminals. For law is law, and grace is grace.
   The two things cannot be intermingled. What law demands it must have;
   and what grace craves can only be given in accordance with unchanging
   law. "The reign of grace" must be "the reign of law"; and the triumph
   of grace must be the triumph of law. The grace which alone can reach
   the case of the sinner is the grace of the LAWGIVER, the grace of the
   JUDGE.

   These were truths which man could not fully comprehend. They were new
   truths, or new ideas, which could only be thoroughly understood by long
   training, by ages of education. The method of instruction was peculiar,
   and such as suited man's special state of imperfect knowledge. It was
   twofold, consisting of a long line of revelations extending over four
   thousand years; and a long series of symbols increasing and becoming
   more expressive age after age.

   That there was free love in God for the sinner was a new truth
   altogether, and needed to be fully revealed, "line upon line."
   Reasoning from God's treatment of the angels, man would conclude that
   there was no favour to be expected for the sinner; nothing but swift
   retribution, "everlasting chains." God's first words to man were those
   of grace; intimating that the divine treatment of man was to be very
   different from that of the fallen angels: that where sin had abounded
   grace was to abound much more. Forgiveness, not condemnation, was the
   essence of the early promise.

   But this was only one-half of the great primal revelation. God having
   announced His purpose of grace, proceeds to show how this was to be
   carried out with full regard to the perfection of the law and the
   holiness of the Lawgiver.

   The unfolding of this latter part of His purpose fills up the greater
   part of the Divine Word.

   The announcement of God's free love was made on the spot where the sin
   had been committed and the transgressors arrested. But the unfolding of
   the plan, whereby that free love was to reach the sinner in
   righteousness, was commenced outside--at the gate of Paradise, where
   the first altar was built, the first sacrifice was offered, and the
   first sinner worshipped.

   The blood-shedding was outside, and Paradise was closed against the
   sinner:--Paradise the type of that heavenly sanctuary from which man
   had shut himself out. No blood was shed within; for the place was
   counted holy; and besides, man, the sinner, was excluded from it now,
   and blood was only needed in connection with him and his entrance to
   God.

   To shut out man the sword of fire was placed at the gate: teaching him
   not only that he was prohibited from entering, but that it was death to
   attempt an entrance. Paradise was not swept away; nay, man was allowed
   to build his altar and to worship at its gate; but he must remain
   outside in the meantime, till the great process had been completed, by
   which his nearer approach was secured,--not only without the dread of
   death, but with the assurance that there was life within for him.

   But the flaming sword said, "Not now; not yet." Much must be done
   before man can be allowed to go in. "The Holy Ghost this signified that
   the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest."

   In after ages there was no flaming sword at the gate. But the veil of
   the tabernacle was substituted instead of it. That veil said also, "Not
   now, not yet." Wait a little longer, O man, and the gate shall be
   thrown wide open. These sacrifices of yours have much to do in
   connection with the opening of the gate. Without them it cannot be
   opened; but even with them, a long time must elapse before this can be
   done; man must be taught that only righteousness can open that gate,
   and that this righteousness can only be unfolded and carried out by the
   blood-shedding of a substitute.

   Man had been driven out in one hour; but he must wait ages before he
   can re-enter. In that interval of patient waiting he must learn many a
   lesson, both regarding God and himself; both regarding sin and
   righteousness; both regarding the reason of his being excluded and the
   way of re-admission.

   For man is slow to learn. He cannot all at once take in new ideas as to
   God and His character. He must be fully "educated" in these; and this
   education must be one not of years but of ages.

   God then began to teach man by means of sacrifice. This method of
   teaching him concerning grace and righteousness widened and filled up
   age after age. For this fuller education the tabernacle was set up; and
   there God commenced His school. By means of it He taught Israel, He
   taught man. The text- book was a symbolic one, though not without
   explanations and comments. It is contained in the Book of Leviticus.
   Not till man, the sinner, should master the profound and wondrous
   lessons contained in that book could the veil be removed and access
   granted. Not till He had come, who was to be the living personal
   exhibition or incarnation of all these lessons, could the sinner draw
   nigh to God.

   It seemed a long time to wait, but it could not be otherwise. The
   lesson to be taught was a lesson not for Israel merely, but for the
   world; not for a few ages, but for eternity; not for earth only, but
   for heaven.

   Every fresh sacrifice offered outside the veil was a new knock for
   admission, and a new cry, "How long, O Lord, how long." In patience the
   Old Testament saints waited on; assured that sooner or later the veil
   would rend or be swept away, and the way into the holiest be made
   manifest; the right of entrance to the mercy-seat seemed to the sinner
   for ever.

  Chapter 3.

The Symbolic Veil.

   The veil of the tabernacle was hung between the holy place and the
   holiest of all. Inside of it were the Ark of the Covenant, the
   mercy-seat, and the cherubim; outside were the golden altar of incense,
   the golden candlestick, or lamp-stand, and the table of shew- bread or
   "presence-bread," the twelve loaves that were placed before Jehovah.

   Properly there were three veils or curtains for the tabernacle.

   The outermost hung at the entrance of the tabernacle; and was always
   drawn aside, or might be so by any Israelite that wished to pass into
   the outer court, where the brazen altar and brazen laver were. That
   veil hindered no one, and concealed nothing. It was an ever-open door;
   at which any Israelite might come in with his sacrifice. It was at this
   door that the priest met the comer and examined his sacrifice to see if
   it were without blemish; for no blemished offering could pass the
   threshold; and the bringer of a blemished sacrifice must go back
   unaccepted and unblest. The Priest rejected him and his victim. He must
   go and get another bullock, or else bear his own sin. [7]

   The second veil hung at the entrance of the holy place. It allowed any
   one to look in; but it prohibited the entrance of all but Priests. "Now
   when these things were thus ordained (arranged or set up) the priests
   went always (were continually going) into the first tabernacle (what we
   usually call the second), accomplishing the service of God" (Heb 9:6).
   They fed at the royal table there; they kept the lamps burning; they
   put incense on the golden altar. But they could enter no farther. The
   way into the holiest was not yet opened; the time had not yet come when
   the three places should be made one; all veils removed; all exclusions
   cancelled; all sprinkled with one blood; open freely to each coming
   one: altar, laver, table, candlestick, incense-altar, ark, and
   mercy-seat no longer separated, but brought together as being but parts
   of one glorious whole; divided from each other for a season, for the
   sake of distinct teaching and for the exhibition of sacrificial truth
   in its different parts and aspects; but in the fulness of time brought
   together; as being but one perfect picture of the one perfect
   sacrifice, by means of which we have access to God and re-entrance into
   the Paradise which we had lost.

   The third veil hung before the holy of holies: hiding, as it were, God
   from man and man from God, and intimating that the day of full meeting
   and fellowship had not yet come. It said to Israel, and it said to man
   (for all these things had a world-wide meaning), God is within; but you
   cannot enter now. The time is coming; but it is not yet.

   In heathen temples there were veils hiding their holy places. But these
   pointed to no coming manifestation; no future unveiling of Him who was
   supposed to dwell within. These veils were but parts of the idolatry
   and darkness of the system; not proclamations of truth or promises of
   light. It was not so in the tabernacle. The veil that hid the glory was
   a promise of the revelation of that glory. In pagan shrines it was a
   signal of distress and despair; man's declaration that there was no
   hope of light; that the unknown must always be the unknown; nay, that
   the unknown was also the unknowable; and that the unapproached was also
   the unapproachable. In Israel's shrine the veil was a thing of light,
   not of darkness; it was a covering, no doubt, but it was also a
   revelation. It told what God was; where God was, and how God could be
   approached.

   That it was not a gate,--of iron or brass, of silver or of gold,--said
   much; that it was a veil of needlework, slight and moveable, said more.
   For it intimated that the hindrance in the way of the worshipper's
   nearer approach was slender and temporary. The nature of a tent
   intimated among other things its removeableness: "mine age is departed,
   and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent" (Isa 38:12). The nature of
   a veil in a tent intimates still greater slightness and removeableness.
   It was a thing which could easily be drawn aside, nay, which was, at
   the needed season, to be taken away. It was no wall of obstruction, but
   simply of temporary separation and exclusion, to be done away with in
   due time.

   But while it was slight it was very beautiful. It is thus described:--
   "And thou shalt make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
   fine-twined linen, of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:
   and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood, overlaid with
   gold: their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver"
   (Exo 26:31,32). Of the veil made by Solomon for the temple on Moriah it
   is said, "He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
   linen, and wrought cherubims thereon" (2 Chron 3:14).

   The temple-veil seems to have been thicker and of course larger every
   way, than that of the tabernacle. It is said to have been about twenty
   feet in height, and as much in width, strongly wrought and finely
   woven. It was never drawn, or at least only so much of it was moved
   aside once a-year as to admit the High Priest, when he approached the
   mercy-seat with blood and incense. For ages it stretched across that
   awful entrance, a more immoveable barrier than brass or iron: no
   Priest, or Levite, or Israelite venturing within its folds. Torn down
   again and again in different centuries, by the Babylonian, Persian,
   Grecian, and Roman invader, it was often replaced, that it might hang
   there, to teach its wondrous lessons, till God's great purpose with it
   had been fulfilled.

   To the Jew of old there must have seemed something mysterious about
   that veil. It was not hung up merely to conceal what was within, as if
   God grudged to man the full vision of His glory, or had no desire to be
   approached. Many things connected with its texture and place showed
   that this was not the case. The unspiritual Jew of course was very
   likely to misjudge its use and import; and the historian Josephus is a
   specimen of that class. He seems to have had not the most distant idea
   of its use. [8] But the Israelite who had discernment in the things of
   God would see something far higher and nobler than this, though he
   might not understand it fully in connection with Messiah. Still he
   would see in that veil something glorious; something which both
   attracted and repelled; something which hid and revealed; something
   which spoke of himself and of his Messiah; for he knew that every thing
   pertaining to that tabernacle, and specially these on which cherubim
   were wrought, had reference to Messiah the Deliver, the seed of the
   woman, the man with the bruised heel.

   All the curtains of the tabernacle had more or less the same reference.
   For on all of them the same devices were wrought. "Thou shalt make the
   tabernacle with ten curtains of fine-twined linen, and blue, and
   purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make
   them" (Exo 26:1, 36:8). The cherubim- figure was to be seen everywhere.
   That mysterious device which was first placed in Paradise, and which
   for ages had disappeared, was now reproduced in connection with the
   tabernacle. Since the garden of the Lord had been swept away (probably
   at the flood), the cherubim had not been seen; though doubtless
   tradition had handed down the memory of their appearance, and to Israel
   they were not strangers. Moses is now commanded to restore them. From
   Noah to Moses the Church had been a wanderer, with no sanctuary, only
   an altar to worship at. Yet, doubtless, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew
   well about the cherubim; and when Moses was instructed to replace them
   he does not require to have their nature explained. They are now to be
   inwoven into the sanctuary,--that sanctuary which symbolised nothing
   less than Messiah Himself; teaching us that (whatever these cherubim
   might mean) the cherubim and Messiah were all "of one." The Church is
   represented in the tabernacle as one with Christ, "members of His body,
   of His flesh, and of His bones." Israel was taught that "the Church in
   the wilderness" (Acts 7:38) was as truly the body of Christ as the
   Church at Pentecost.

   But however vague might be the ideas of the old Jew regarding the veil,
   it could not but be viewed as very peculiar, something by itself; part
   of the tabernacle furniture no doubt, yet a singular and unique part of
   it; in texture, in position, and in use, quite peculiar: exquisite as a
   piece of workmanship,--every colour and thread of which it was composed
   being symbolic and vocal. But still it was the frailest part of the
   fabric,--a strange contrast, in after days when the temple was built,
   with the massive marble walls and cedar beams, with which it was
   surrounded. For the temple was in all respects magnificent,--even as a
   piece of architecture. Its enormous foundations were let in to the
   solid rock; its vast stones, each in itself a wall, rose tier above
   tier; its gates were of solid brass, so weighty, that one of them
   required twenty men to open and shut it. It thus presented a solid mass
   to view more like a part of the mountain than a mere building upon it.

   But the veil was a thing which a child's hand could draw aside; and it
   was hung just where we should have expected a gate of brass or a wall
   of granite,-- at the entrance into the holiest of all,--to guard
   against the possibility of intrusion. Its frail texture in the midst of
   so much that was strong and massive, said that it was but a temporary
   barrier,--a screen,--in due time to be removed. The worshipper in the
   outer court, as he looked towards it from the outer entrance of the
   holy place, would see something of its workmanship, and might perhaps
   get some glimpses of the glory within shining through its folds. He
   would learn this much, at least, that the way into the holiest was not
   fully opened; yet it was only stopped by a veil, no more. He would
   conclude within himself, that though shut out now he would one day be
   allowed to enter and worship at the mercy-seat, or at something better
   than that mercy-seat, at the heavenly throne, in the true tabernacle
   which the Lord pitched, and not man, when the High Priest of good
   things to come should arrive, and as his forerunner, lead him into the
   very presence of that Invisible Jehovah who was now by symbols showing
   how He was to be approached and worshipped.

   The veil! It hid God from man; for till that should be done which would
   make "grace reign through righteousness" (Rom 5:21), man could not be
   allowed to see God face to face. It hid man from God; for till this
   "righteousness" was established by the substitution of the just for the
   unjust, God could not directly look upon man. It hid the glory of God
   from man; it hid the shame of man from God. It so veiled or shaded both
   the shame and the glory, that it was possible for God to be near man,
   and yet not to repel him; and it was possible for man to be near God
   and yet not to be consumed.

   The veil! It was let down from above, it did not spring up from below.
   It originated in God, and not in man. It was not man hiding himself
   from God, but God hiding Himself from man, as His holiness required,
   until it should become a right for a holy God and unholy man to meet
   each other in peace and love.

   And it was sprinkled with blood! For though the expression "before the
   veil" (Lev 4:6) does not necessarily mean that it was sprinkled on the
   veil, yet the likelihood is that this was done. "The seven times, (says
   a commentator on Leviticus), throughout all Scripture, intimates a
   complete and perfect action. The blood is to be thoroughly exhibited
   before the Lord; life openly exhibited as taken, to honour the law that
   had been violated. It is not at this time taken within the veil; for
   that would require the priest to enter the holy of holies, a thing
   permitted only once a year. But it is taken very near the mercy- seat;
   it is taken 'before the veil,' while the Lord that dwelt between the
   cherubim bent down to listen to the cry that came up from the
   sin-atoning blood. Was the blood sprinkled on the veil? Some say not;
   but only on the floor close to the veil. The floor of the holy place
   was dyed with blood; a threshold of blood was formed, over which the
   High Priest must pass into on the day of judgment, when he entered into
   the most holy, drawing aside the veil. It is blood that opens our way
   into the presence of God; it is the voice of atoning blood that
   prevails with Him who dwells within. Others, however, with more
   probability, think that the blood was sprinkled on the veil. It might
   intimate that atonement was yet to rend that veil; and as that
   beautiful veil represented our Saviour's holy humanity (Heb 10:20), oh,
   how expressive was the continual repetition of the 'blood-sprinkling'
   seven times. As often as the Priest offered a sin-offering, the veil
   was wet again with blood, which dropped on the floor. Is this Christ
   bathed in the blood of atonement? Yes, through that veil the veil was
   opened to us, through the flesh of Jesus, through the body that for us
   was drenched in the sweat of blood." [9]

   We speak of the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, and the blood-sprinkled
   floor, on which that mercy-seat stood; but let us not forget the
   blood-sprinkled pavement, the "new and living way" into the holiest,
   and the blood-sprinkled veil. For "almost all things under the law were
   purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission."

   Nor let us forget Gethsemane, where "His sweat was as it were great
   drops of blood falling down to the ground." At His circumcision, at
   Gethsemane, at the cross, we see the blood-sprinkled veil. And all this
   for us; that the blood which was thus required at His hands should not
   be required of us.

   [7] The true Priest,--"the High Priest of the good things to
   come"--stands at the gate to receive all who come. He refuses none,
   however imperfect they and their offering may be; for it is His
   perfection and His perfect offering that give the right of entrance to
   the sinner; He receives all comers. "Him that cometh to me I will in no
   wise cast out."

   [8] "The veils, which were composed of four things, declared the four
   elements; for the fine linen was proper to signify the earth, because
   the flax grows out of the earth; the purple signified the sea, because
   that colour is dyed by the blood of a sea shell-fish; the blue is fit
   to signify the air, and the scarlet will be an indication of
   fire."--Antiq. b. iii. chap. 7. sect. 7.

  Chapter 4.

The True Veil.

   All man's thoughts regarding the true meaning of the veil have been set
   at rest by that brief parenthesis of the Apostle Paul,-- "the veil,
   that is to say, His flesh" (Heb 10:20). The Holy Spirit has interpreted
   the symbol for us, and saved us a world of speculation and uncertainty.
   We now know that the veil meant the body of "Jesus." [10]

   Thus Christ is seen in every part of the tabernacle; and everywhere it
   is the riches of His grace that we see. Here "Christ is all and in
   all." The whole fabric is Christ. Each separate part is Christ. The
   altar is Christ the sacrifice. The laver is Christ filled with the
   Spirit for us. The curtains speak of Him. The entrances all speak of
   Him. Candlestick, and table, and golden altar speak of Him. The Ark of
   the Covenant, the mercy-seat, the glory, all embody and reveal Him.
   Everything here says, "Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin
   of the world."

   But the veil is "His flesh,"--His body, His humanity. As the lamb was
   to be without blemish, and without spot, in order to set forth His
   perfection; so the veil was perfect in all its parts, finely wrought
   and beautiful to the eye, to exhibit the excellency of Him who is
   fairer than the children of men. As the veil was composed of the things
   of earth, so was His body; not only bone of our bone and flesh of His
   flesh, but nourished in all its parts by the things of earth, fed by
   the things which grew out of the soil, as we are fed. Christ's flesh
   was perfect, though earthly: without sin, though of the substance of a
   sinful woman; unblemished in every part, yet sensitive to all our
   sinless infirmities. Through the veil the glory shone, so through the
   body of Christ the Godhead shone.

   As in the holy of holies the shekinah or symbol of Jehovah dwelt; so in
   the man Christ Jesus dwelt "all the fulness of the Godhead BODILY" (Col
   2:9). He was "the Word made flesh" (John 1:14); "God manifest in flesh"
   (1 Tim 3:16); "Immanuel," God with us; Jehovah in very deed dwelling on
   earth, inhabiting a temple made with hands; and that temple a human
   body such as ours. For God became man that He might dwell with man, and
   that man might dwell with Him. In Jesus of Nazareth Jehovah was
   manifested; so that he who saw Him saw the Father, and he who heard Him
   heard the Father, and he who knew Him knew the Father.

   In Jesus of Nazareth was seen the mighty God. In the son of the
   carpenter was seen the Creator of heaven and earth. In the Man of
   sorrows was seen the Son of the blessed. He who was born at Bethlehem
   was He whose days are from eternity. He who died was the Prince of
   life, of whom it is written, "In Him was life, and the life was the
   light of men." Of these things the mysterious veil of the temple was
   the fair symbol. He who could read the meaning of that veil could read
   unutterable things concerning the coming Messiah,--the Redeemer of His
   Israel, the Deliverer of man; divine yet human, heavenly yet earthly,
   clothed with divine majesty, yet wearing the raiment of our poor
   humanity.

   In Him was manifested divine strength, residing in and working through
   a feeble human arm such as ours: divine wisdom, in its perfection,
   speaking through the lips of a child of dust; divine majesty seated on
   a human brow; divine benignity beaming from human eyes, and put forth
   in the touch of a human hand; divine purposes working themselves out
   through a human will; divine sovereignty embodied in each act and
   motion of a human organism; divine grace coming forth in human
   compassions and sympathies; and divine grief finding vent to itself in
   human tears.

   The perfection of His holy and glorious, yet true manhood is seen in
   that mysterious veil. Its materials, so choice, so fair, yet still
   earthly, spoke of Him who, though fairer than the children of men, is
   still bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. Its well-wrought texture
   and exquisite workmanship, of purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined
   linen, spoke of His spotless yet thoroughly human body, prepared by the
   Holy Ghost; while its embroidered or interwoven cherubim spoke of the
   Church in Him,--part of Himself; one with Him as He is one with them;
   for "both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of
   one."

   The "flesh of Christ" both revealed and hid the glory. It veiled and it
   unveiled Godhead: it proclaimed the nearness of Jehovah to His
   worshippers, and yet suggested some distance, some interposing medium,
   which could only be taken out of the way by God Himself. For that which
   had been placed there by God could not be removed by man. And yet man,
   in a certain sense, had to do with the removal. In the type, indeed, it
   was not so; but in the antitype it was. For no hand of man rent the
   veil; yet it was man's hand that nailed the Son of God to the cross; it
   was man that slew Him. And yet again, on the other hand, it was God
   that smote Him,--just as it was the hand of God that rent the veil from
   top to bottom. "It pleased the Lord to bruise Him and to put Him to
   grief" (Isa 53:10). The bruising of His heel was the doing of the
   serpent and his seed, yet it was also the doing of the Lord.

   There was the unbroken body, and the broken body of the Lord. The veil
   pointed to the former. It was the symbol of the unbroken body, the
   unwounded flesh of the Surety. It was connected with incarnation, not
   with crucifixion,--with life, not with death. We learn from it that
   mere incarnation can do nothing for the sinner. He needs far more than
   that,--something different from the mere assumption of our humanity.
   The veil said, that body must be broken before the sinner can come as a
   worshipper into the place where Jehovah dwells. The Christ of God must
   not merely take flesh and blood; He must take mortal flesh and die.
   Sacrifice alone can bring us nigh to God, and keep us secure and
   blessed in His presence. We are saved by a dying Christ.

   The veil was, as we have said before, to the holy of holies what the
   sword of fire was to the garden of the Lord. Both of them kept watch at
   the gate of the divine presence-chamber. The flaming sword turned every
   way; that is, it threw around the garden a girdle or belt of divine
   fire from the shekinah glory, threatening death to all who should seek
   entrance into the holiest, and yet (by leaving Paradise unscathed upon
   the earth) revealing God's gracious purpose of preserving it for the
   re-entrance of banished man, or rather of preparing for him a home more
   glorious than the Paradise which he had lost.

   Both the veil and the flame said, "We guard the palace of the Great
   King, that no sinner may enter." Yet they said also, the King is
   within, He has not forsaken man or man's world; you shall one day have
   unhindered access to Him; but for wise and vast reasons, to be shown in
   due time, you cannot enter yet. Something must be done to make your
   entrance a safe thing for yourself and a righteous thing for God.

   That veil then, unrent as it was, proclaimed the glad tidings; though
   it could not, so long as it was unrent, reveal the whole grace, or at
   least the way in which grace is to reach the sinner. That grace can
   flow out only by means of death. It is death that opens the pent-up
   fulness of love, and sends out the life contained in the "spring shut
   up, the fountain sealed." It is the rod of the substitute, the cross of
   the sin-bearer that smites the rock, that the waters may gush forth.

   The antitype of the unrent veil might be said to have been held before
   Israel's eyes from the time that the Son of God took our flesh. It is
   the unrent veil that we find at Bethlehem; it is the unrent veil that
   we find at Nazareth, and all the life long of the Christ of God. The
   miracles of grace wrought during His ministry were like the waving of
   the folds of that veil before men's eyes, and letting some of the rays
   of the inner majesty shine through. So were His words of grace from day
   to day. Men were compelled to look and to admire. "They wondered at the
   gracious words proceeding out of His mouth" (Luke 4:22, literally, "at
   the words of the grace proceeding out of His mouth"); "Never man spake
   like this man" (John 7:46); "He hath done all things well" (Mark 7:37);
   what were these things but the expressions of admiration at the unrent
   veil. It was so beautiful, so perfect! Men gazed at it and wondered. It
   was marvellously attractive; and it was meant to be so.

   Hence many were drawn to the person of Christ by His attractive grace
   without fully understanding either His fulness or their own great need.
   What they saw in a living Christ won their hearts; they acknowledged
   Him as the Saviour without fully understanding how He was to be such.
   The disciples would not admit any necessity for His dying. The unrent
   veil seemed to them enough. "That be far from Thee, Lord," were the
   words of Peter, repudiating the very idea of His Lord's death. He was
   content with a living Saviour. Death seemed altogether inconsistent
   with the character of Messiah.

   Let us mark the scene just referred to, and understand its meaning.
   "From that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples, how that
   He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief
   priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised again the third day"
   (Matt 16:21). It was as if standing in front of the holy of holies, and
   pointing to the veil, He was saying to them, That veil must be rent!
   "Then Peter took Him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from
   Thee, Lord; this shall not be unto Thee" (v 22). What was this but
   saying, Lord, that is impossible; that veil must not and cannot be
   rent! "But He turned and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan;
   thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest not the things that be
   of God, but those that be of men" (v 23). It was as if He had said,
   Peter, thou art speaking like Satan, and for Satan; he knows that
   unless the heel of the woman's seed be bruised, his head cannot be
   bruised; he knows that unless that veil be rent, thou canst not go in
   to God; and he speaks through thee, if it were possible, to prevent the
   rending; the veil must be rent; if I die not, thou canst not live; if I
   die not, I need not have come into the world at all. [11]

   If one might, by a figure, speak of the veil as living and sentient,
   might we not say that it dreaded the rending. What was the meaning of
   Christ's words, "Now is my soul sorrowful"? Was it not the expression
   of dread as to the rending? And still more, what was the meaning of the
   Gethsemane cry, "Father, if it be Thy will, let this cup pass from me"?
   Was it not the same? And yet there was the desire for its being rent,
   the longing for the consummation. "I have a baptism to be baptized
   with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished" (Luke 12:50).

   "A body hast thou prepared me" (Heb 10:5). That body was truly human as
   we have seen, and yet it was prepared by the Holy Ghost. "The Holy
   Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee; therefore also, [12] that holy thing which shall be
   born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35). This body,
   thus divinely prepared out of human materials, was altogether
   wonderful. There had been none like it from the first: nor was there to
   be any such after it,--so perfect, yet so thoroughly human; so
   stainless, yet so sensitive to all the sinless infirmities of man. In
   this respect it differed from the body of the first Adam, which was
   perfect, no doubt, but not in sympathy with us. The kind of perfection
   in the first Adam unfitted him to sympathise with us, or to be tempted
   like as we are. The nature of Christ's perfection fitted Him most fully
   for sympathising with us, and for being tempted, like as we are, yet
   without sin.

   The colour and texture of the temple-veil seem all to have reference to
   the flesh or body; blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined
   linen. Jeremiah's description of the Nazarites may help us to see this:
   "Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; they
   were more ruddy in body than rubies; their polishing was of sapphire"
   (Lam 4:7, or "their veining was the sapphire's," as Blayney renders
   it). The bride in the Song of Solomon thus also speaks of the
   bridegroom, "My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
   thousand" (Song of Sol 5:10).

   All this corporeal perfection and beauty were produced by the Holy
   Ghost. Never had His hand brought forth such material perfection as in
   the body of the Christ of God. It was "without spot and blemish,"
   worthy of Him out of whose eternal purpose it came forth; worthy of Him
   who so cunningly had wrought it as the perfection of divine
   workmanship; worthy of Him in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily. [13]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] In the previous verse he had spoken of the "blood of Jesus,"--so
   here we understand him to say that the veil is the body of Him whose
   name is Jesus; that one name at which every knee shall bow: that one
   name of which all prophecy is the testimony (Rev 19:10). In the above
   passage, in Philippians, it is very noticeable that JESUS by itself
   should be so specially singled out; JESUS as the special name for
   worship and for worshippers. "In the name of Jesus every knee shall
   bow." Of all His many names this is the one which the Father delights
   to honour, and round which the eternal adoration of heaven and earth is
   to gather. It is the name of names:--the name above every name,--JESUS.

   [11] Christ's calling Peter by the name of Satan, and thus identifying
   him, in what he had just been saying, with the old tempter, carries us
   back to the first promise, in which that tempter heard his own doom and
   man's deliverance predicted. If Jesus did not die, if the heel of the
   woman's seed were not bruised, the first promise fell to the ground.
   Satan knew how much turned upon the bruising of the heel of that seed,
   and how necessary it was to the bruising of his own head. Nothing could
   have more identified Peter with Satan than the position he took up here
   as to the non- necessity for his Master's death. Nicodemus did not
   understand the person of the Lord; Peter did not understand His work,
   nor see the necessity for His sacrificial death.

   [12] "Therefore even that which shall be born shall be holy; it shall
   be called the Son of God."

   [13] Dr. Owen dwells at length upon this point, the forming of Christ's
   body by the Holy Spirit. "The framing, forming, and miraculous
   conception of the body of Christ, in the womb of the blessed virgin,
   was the peculiar and special work of the Holy Ghost...It was effected
   by an act of infinite creating power, yet it was formed or made of the
   substance of the blessed virgin."--On the Holy Spirit, b. ii. chap. 3.

  Chapter 5.

The Rending of the Veil.

   The symbolic veil was rent: and at the same moment the true veil was
   also rent. It is this that we have now to consider.

   The following are the words of the evangelist: "Behold the veil of the
   temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom" (Matt 27:51). In
   considering them we must endeavour to realise the scene of which this
   is a part. The passage transports us to Jerusalem; it sets us down upon
   Moriah; it takes us into the old temple at the hour of evening
   sacrifice, when the sun, though far down the heavens, is still sending
   its rays right over turret and pinnacle, on to the grey slopes of
   Olivet, where thousands, gathered for the great Paschal Sacrifice, are
   wandering; it shows us the holy chambers with their varied furniture of
   marble and cedar and gold; it brings us into the midst of the
   ministering priests, all robed for service. Then suddenly, as through
   the opened sky, it lifts us up and carries us from the earthly into the
   heavenly places, from the mortal into the immortal Jerusalem, of which
   it is written by one who had gazed upon them both, "I saw no temple
   therein, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it."

   For we must take the earthly and the heavenly together, as body and
   soul. The terrestrial sun and the sun of righteousness must mingle
   their radiance, and each unfold the other. The waters of the nether and
   the upper springs must flow together. The Church must be seen in
   Israel, and Israel in the Church; Christ in the altar, and the altar in
   Christ; Christ in the lamb, and the lamb in Christ; Christ in the
   mercy-seat, and the mercy-seat in Christ; Christ in the shekinah-glory,
   and the shekinah-glory in Him, who is the brightness of Jehovah's
   glory. We must not separate the shadow from the substance, the material
   from the spiritual, the visible form the invisible glory. What God hath
   joined together, let no man put asunder.

   Even the old Jew, if a believing man, like Simeon, saw these two things
   together, though in a way and order and proportion considerably
   different from what our faith now realises. To him there was the vision
   of the heavenly through the earthly; to us there is the vision of the
   earthly through the heavenly. He, standing on the outside, saw the
   glory through the veil, as one in a valley sees the sunshine through
   clouds; we, placed in the inside, see the veil through the glory, as
   one far up the mountain sees the clouds beneath through the sunshine.
   Formerly it was the earthly that revealed the heavenly, now it is the
   heavenly that illuminates the earthly. Standing beside the brazen
   serpent, Moses might see afar off Messiah the Healer of the nations;
   standing, or rather I should say sitting, by faith beside this same
   Messiah in the heavenly places, we see the brazen serpent afar off.
   From the rock of Horeb, the elders of Israel might look up and catch
   afar off some glimpses of the water of life flowing from the rock of
   ages; we, close by the heavenly fountain, proceeding out of the throne
   of God and of the Lamb, look down and recognise the old desert rock,
   with its gushing stream. Taking in his hand the desert manna, Israel
   could look up to the true bread above; we, taking into our hands the
   bread of God, look downward on the desert manna, not needing now with
   Israel to ask, "What is it?"

   But let us look at

   The rending of the veil. This was a new thing in its history, and quite
   a thing fitted to make Israel gaze and wonder, and ask, what meaneth
   this? Is Jehovah about to forsake His dwelling?

   1. It was rent, not consumed by fire. For not its mere removal, still
   less its entire destruction, was to be signified; but its being
   transformed from being a barrier into a gate of entrance. Through it
   the way into the holiest was to pass; the new and living way; over a
   pavement sprinkled with blood.

   2. It was rent while the temple stood. Had the earthquake which rent
   the rocks and opened graves, struck down the temple or shattered its
   walls, men might have said that it was this that rent the veil. But now
   was it made manifest that it was no earthly hand, nor natural
   convulsion, that was thus throwing open the mercy-seat, and making its
   long-barred chamber as entirely accessible as the wide court without,
   which all might enter, and where all might worship.

   3. It was rent in twain. It did not fall to pieces, nor was it torn in
   pieces. The rent was a clean and straight one, made by some invisible
   hand; and the exact division into two parts might well figure the
   separation of Christ's soul and body, while each part remained
   connected with the temple, as both body and soul remained in union with
   the Godhead; as well as resemble the throwing open of the great folding
   door between earth and heaven, and the complete restoration of the
   fellowship between God and man.

   4. It was rent from the top to the bottom. Not from side to side, nor
   from the bottom to the top: which might have been man's doing; but from
   the top to the bottom, showing that the power which rent it was from
   above, not from beneath; that the rending was not of man but of God. It
   was man, no doubt, that dealt the blow of death to the Son of God, but,
   "it pleased the Lord to bruise him; He hath put him to grief."
   Beginning with the roof and ending with the floor, the rest was
   complete; for God, out of His own heaven, had done it. And as from roof
   to floor there remained not one fragment of the old veil; so from
   heaven to earth, from the throne of God, down to the dwelling of man,
   there exists not one remnant nor particle of a barrier between the
   sinner and God. He who openeth and no man shutteth has, with His own
   hand, and in His own boundless love, thrown wide open to the chief of
   sinners, the innermost recesses of His own glorious heaven! Let us go
   in: let us draw near.

   5. It was rent in the presence of the priests. They were in the holy
   place, outside the veil, of course, officiating, lighting the lamps, or
   placing incense on the golden altar, or ordering the shewbread on the
   golden table. They saw the solemn rending of the veil, and were no
   doubt overwhelmed with amazement; ready to flee out of the place, or to
   cover their eyes lest they should see the hidden glories of that awful
   chamber which only one was permitted to behold. "Woe is me, for I am
   undone; I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of
   unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts" (Isa
   6:5). They were witnesses of what was done. They had not done it
   themselves; they felt that no mortal hand had done it; and what could
   they say but that God Himself had thrown open His gates, that they
   might enter in to precincts from which they had been so long debarred.

   6. It was rent that it might disclose the mercy- seat, and the
   cherubim, and the glory. These were no longer to be hidden, and known
   only as the mysterious occupants of a chamber from which they might not
   go out, and into which no man might enter. It was no longer profanity
   to handle the uncovered vessels of the inner shrine; to gaze upon the
   golden floor and walls all stained with sacrificial blood; nay, to go
   up to the mercy-seat and sit down beneath the very shadow of the glory.
   Formerly it was blasphemy even to speak of entering in; now the
   invitation seemed all at once to go forth, "Let us come boldly to the
   throne of grace." The safest, as well as the most blessed place, is
   beneath the shadow of the glory.

   7. It was rent at the time of the evening sacrifice. About three
   o'clock, when the sun began to go down, the lamb was slain, and laid
   upon the brazen altar. Just at the moment when its blood was shed, and
   the smoke arose from the fire that was consuming it, the veil was rent
   in twain. There was an unseen link between the altar and the veil,
   between the sacrifice and the rending, between the bloodshedding and
   the removal of the barrier. It was blood that had done the work. It was
   blood that had rent the veil and thrown open the mercy-seat: the blood
   of "the Lamb, without blemish, and without spot."

   8. It was rent at the moment when the Son of God died on the cross. His
   death, then, had done it! Nay, more, that rending and that death were
   one thing; the one a symbol, the other a reality; but both containing
   one lesson, that LIFE was the screen which stood between us and God,
   and death the removal of the screen; that it was His death that made
   His incarnation available for sinners; that it was from the cross of
   Golgotha that the cradle of Bethlehem derived all its value and its
   virtue; that the rock of ages, like the rock of Rephidim, must be
   smitten before it can become a fountain of living waters. That death
   was like the touching of the electric wire between Calvary and Moriah,
   setting loose suddenly the divine power that for a thousand years had
   been lying in wait to rend the veil and cast down the barrier. It was
   from the cross that the power emanated which rent the veil. From that
   place of weakness and shame and agony, came forth the omnipotent
   command, "Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye
   everlasting doors." The "It is finished" upon Golgotha was the
   appointed signal, and the instantaneous response was the rending of the
   veil. Little did the Jew think, when nailing the Son of the carpenter
   to the tree, that it was these pierced hands that were to rend the
   veil, and that it was their being thus pierced that fitted them for
   this mysterious work. Little did he suppose, when erecting a cross for
   the Nazarene, that that cross was to be the lever by which both his
   temple and city were to be razed to their foundations. Yet so it was.
   It was the cross of Christ that rent the veil; overthrew the cold
   statutes of symbolic service; consecrated the new and living way into
   the holiest; supplanted the ritualistic with the real and the true; and
   substituted for lifeless performances the living worship of the living
   God.

   9. When the veil was rent, the cherubim which were embroidered on it
   were rent with it. And as these cherubim symbolised the Church of the
   redeemed, there was thus signified our identification with Christ in
   His death. We were nailed with Him to the cross; we were crucified with
   Him; with Him we died, and were buried, and rose again. In that rent
   veil we have the temple-symbol of the apostle's doctrine, concerning
   oneness with Christ in life and death,-- "I am crucified with Christ."
   And in realising the cross and the veil, let us realise these words of
   solemn meaning, "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."

   The broken body and shed blood of the Lord had at length opened the
   sinner's way into the holiest. And these were the tokens not merely of
   grace, but of righteousness. That rending was no act either of mere
   power or of mere grace. Righteousness had done it. Righteousness had
   rolled away the stone. Righteousness had burst the gates of brass, and
   cut in sunder the bars of iron. It was a righteous removal of the
   barrier; it was a righteous entrance that had been secured for the
   unrighteous; it was a righteous welcome for the chief of sinners that
   was now proclaimed.

   Long had the blood of bulls and goats striven to rend the veil, but in
   vain. Long had they knocked at the awful gate, demanding entrance for
   the sinner; long had they striven to quench the flaming sword, and
   unclasp the fiery belt that girdled paradise; long had they demanded
   entrance for the sinner, but in vain. But now the better blood has
   come; it knocks but once, and the gate flies open; it but once touches
   the sword of fire, and it is quenched. Not a moment is lost. The
   fulness of the time has come. God delays not, but unbars the door at
   once. He throws open His mercy-seat to the sinner, and makes haste to
   receive the banished one; more glad even than the wanderer himself that
   the distance, and the exclusion, and the terror are at an end for ever.

   O wondrous power of the cross of Christ! To exalt the low, and to abase
   the high; to cast down and to build up; to unlink and to link; to save
   and to destroy; to kill and to make alive; to shut out and to let in;
   to curse and to bless. O wondrous virtue of the saving cross, which
   saves in crucifying, and crucifies in saving! For four thousand years
   has paradise been closed, but Thou hast opened it. For ages and
   generations the presence of God has been denied to the sinner, but Thou
   hast given entrance,-- and that not timid, and uncertain, and costly,
   and hazardous; but bold, and blessed, and safe, and free.

   The veil, then, has been rent in twain from the top to the bottom. The
   way is open, the blood is sprinkled, the mercy-seat is accessible to
   all, and the voice of the High Priest, seated on that mercy- seat,
   summons us to enter, and to enter without fear. Having, then, boldness
   to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,--by a new and living
   way which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say,
   His flesh, and having an High Priest over the house of God, let us draw
   near with a true heart, in the full assurance of faith. The message is,
   Go in, go in. Let us respond to the message, and at once draw near. To
   stand afar off, or even upon the threshhold, is to deny and dishonour
   the provision made for our entrance, as well as to incur the awful
   peril of remaining outside the one place of safety or blessedness. To
   enter in is our only security and our only joy. But we must go in in a
   spirit and attitude becoming the provision made for us. If that
   provision has been insufficient, we must come hesitatingly, doubtingly,
   as men who can only venture on an uncertain hope of being welcomed. If
   the veil be not wholly rent, if the blood be not thoroughly sprinkled,
   or be in itself insufficient, if the mercy-seat be not wholly what its
   name implies,--a seat of mercy, a throne of grace; if the High Priest
   be not sufficiently compassionate and loving, or if there be not
   sufficient evidence that these things are so, the sinner may come
   doubtingly and uncertainly; but if the veil be fully rent, and the
   blood be of divine value and potency, and the mercy-seat be really the
   place of grace, and the High Priest full of love to the sinner, then
   every shadow of a reason for doubt is swept utterly away. Not to come
   with the boldness is the sin. Not to come in the full assurance of
   faith is the presumption. To draw near with an "evil conscience" is to
   declare our belief that the blood of the Lamb is not of itself enough
   to give the sinner a good conscience and a fearless access.

   "May I then draw near as I am, in virtue of the efficacy of the
   sprinkled blood?" Most certainly. In what other way or character do you
   propose to come? And may I be bold at once? Most certainly. For if not
   at once, then when and how? Let boldness come when it may, it will come
   to you from the sight of the blood upon the floor and mercy-seat, and
   from nothing else. It is bold coming that honours the blood. It is bold
   coming that glorifies the love of God and the grace of His throne.
   "Come boldly!" this is the message to the sinner. Come boldly now! Come
   in the full assurance of faith, not supposing it possible that that God
   who has provided such a mercy-seat can do anything but welcome you;
   that such a mercy-seat can be anything to you but the place of pardon,
   or that the gospel out of which every sinner that has believed it has
   extracted peace, can contain anything but peace to you.

   The rent veil is liberty of access. Will you linger still? The
   sprinkled blood is boldness,-- boldness for the sinner, for any sinner,
   for every sinner. Will you still hesitate, tampering and dallying with
   uncertainty and doubt, and an evil conscience? Oh, take that blood for
   what it is and gives, and go in. Take that rent veil for what it
   indicates, and go in. This only will make you a peaceful, happy, holy
   man. This only will enable you to work for God on earth, unfettered and
   unburdened; all over joyful, all over loving, and all over free. This
   will make your religion not that of one who has everything yet to
   settle between himself and God, and whose labours, and duties, and
   devotions are all undergone for the purpose of working out that
   momentous adjustment before life shall close, but the religion of one
   who, having at the very outset, and simply in believing, settled every
   question between himself and God over the blood of the Lamb, is serving
   the blessed One who has loved him and bought him, with all the
   undivided energy of his liberated and happy soul.

   For every sinner, without exception, that veil has a voice, that blood
   a voice, that mercy-seat a voice. They say, "Come in." They say, "Be
   reconciled to God." They say, "Draw near." They say, "Seek the Lord
   while He may be found." To the wandering prodigal, the lover of
   pleasure, the drinker of earth's maddening cup, the dreamer of earth's
   vain dreams,--they say, there is bread enough in your Father's house,
   and love enough in your Father's heart, and to spare,--return, return.
   To each banished child of Adam, exiles from the paradise which their
   first father lost, these symbols, with united voice, proclaim the
   extinction of the fiery sword, the re- opening of the long-barred gate,
   with a free and abundant re-entrance, or rather, entrance into a more
   glorious paradise, a paradise that was never lost.

   But if all these voices die away unheeded,--if you will not avail
   yourself, O man, of that rent veil, that open gate,--what remains but
   the eternal exclusion, the hopeless exile, the outer darkness, where
   there is the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth? Instead of the
   rent veil, there shall be drawn the dark curtain, never to be removed
   or rent, which shall shut you out from God, and from paradise, and from
   the New Jerusalem for ever. Instead of the mercy- seat, there comes the
   throne of judgment; and instead of the gracious High Priest, there
   comes the avenging Judge. Yes, the Lord Jesus Christ is coming, and
   with His awful advent ends all thy hope. He is coming; and He may be
   nearer than you think. In an hour when you are not aware He will come.
   When you are saying peace and safety, He will come. When you are
   dreaming of earth's long, calm, summer days, He will come. Lose no
   time. Trifle no more with eternity; it is too long and too great to be
   trifled with. Make haste! Get these affections disengaged from a
   present evil world. Get these sins of thine buried in the grave of
   Christ. Get that soul of thine wrapped up, all over, in the perfection
   of the perfect One, in the righteousness of the righteous One. Then all
   is well, all is well. But till then thou hast not so much as one true
   hope for eternity or for time.

  Chapter 6.

The Removal of the First Sacrifice and the Establishment of the Second.

   The temple was not overthrown till about forty years after the Son of
   God died on the cross. The type was preserved for a season, that the
   antitype might be more fully understood. The shadow and the substance
   were thus for forty years exhibited together. The temple still, in its
   rites, proclaimed what the apostles preached. Every part of it spoke
   aloud and said, "Look on me, and look away from me; look to Him of whom
   I have been bearing witness for these many ages; behold the Lamb of God
   which taketh away the sin of the world."

   But in God's sight the first sacrifice was finished when Jesus died.
   Then the purpose for which the blood had been shed day by day was
   accomplished.

   Thus the apostle writes, "He taketh away the first that He may
   establish the second" (Heb 10:9).

   To a Jew this language must have sounded strange, if not profane; quite
   as much so as did the words, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I
   will raise it up." A first and second what? Does he rightly hear the
   words?

   Is it a second temple, a second altar, a second priesthood; the first
   being set aside? That cannot be! Israel's service is divine; it is one
   and unchanging. Messiah, when He comes, will confirm, not destroy it.
   Israel's service is a first without a second. A second is an
   impossibility, a blasphemy.

   Yet the apostle, a Jew, writing to Jews, announces this incredible
   thing! He announces it as an indisputable certainty; and he expects to
   be believed. Had he announced a second sun or a second universe, rising
   out of the extinction of the first, he would not have been reckoned so
   outrageous in his statement as in declaring the abolition of Israel's
   present service, and the substitution of one more perfect, and no less
   divine.

   1. But what is this first? Speaking generally, it means the old temple
   and tabernacle service; the old covenant made with Israel in the
   desert, from Mount Sinai. But the special thing in this service to
   which he points is the sacrifice or sacrifices; the blood of bullocks
   and of goats, the morning and evening sacrifice of the lamb for the
   daily burnt- offering, in which all the other sacrifices were wrapt
   up,--which was the very heart and soul of all the worship carried on in
   that sanctuary.

   2. By whom was this "first" taken away? By Him who set it up, and
   upheld it for so many ages; "He taketh away the first." He, the Lord
   God of Israel, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It was not man
   who destroyed it, even as it was not man who established it. Long
   before the city was overthrown and the temple perished, the sacrifice
   had come to an end, the temple service had run its course.

   3. When was it taken away? On that afternoon of the passover when the
   Son of God died upon the cross; that awful hour when the sun was
   darkened, and the earth shook, and the rocks were rent. Then, at
   eventide, at three o'clock, the last Jewish sacrifice was laid upon the
   brazen altar. In God's reckoning that was really the last. No doubt,
   for years after this sacrifices continued to be offered up; but these
   could no longer be said to be of divine appointment. The number of
   burnt-offerings according to God's purpose was now complete; their end
   had been served; they passed away. From the day that Solomon laid the
   first lamb on the temple altar; from the day that Moses laid the first
   on the tabernacle altar; from the day that Adam laid his first upon the
   altar at the gate of Paradise, how many tens of thousands had been
   offered! But now God's great purpose with them is served. All is done.
   The last of the long series has been laid upon the altar.

   4. How was this first taken away? Simply by setting another in its
   place; making it give way to something better. Not by violence, or
   fire, or the sword of man. The altar sent up its last blaze that
   evening as brightly as ever. The blaze sank down, and all has since
   been dark. The great end was served; the great lesson taught; the great
   truth written down for man. Then and thus the fire ceased to burn, and
   the blood to flow. No more of such fire or such blood was needed. The
   first was taken away without the noise of axes or hammers, because its
   work was done.

   5. For what end did He take away the first? That He might establish the
   second. The first seemed steadfast; Israel reckoned on it standing for
   ever; it had stood for many an age. Yet it gives way, and another
   comes: one meant to be more abiding than the first; one sacrifice, once
   for all; yet that sacrifice eternal; the same in its results on the
   worshipper as if it were offered up every day for ever; the basis and
   seal of the everlasting covenant. It was to make room for this glorious
   second that the first was taken away; this glorious second through
   which eternal redemption was accomplished for us.

   Besides, it had come to be necessary, on other grounds, that the first
   should be taken away. It was beginning to defeat the very ends for
   which it was set up. Men were getting to look upon it as a real thing
   in itself; and to believe in it instead of believing in Him to whom it
   pointed. It was becoming an object of worship and of trust, as if it
   were the true propitiation; as if the blood of beasts could pacify the
   conscience, or reconcile God, or put away sin. It was becoming an idol;
   a substitute for the living God, and for His Christ, instead of showing
   the way of true approach and acceptable worship. As men in our day make
   an idol of their own faith, and believe in it instead of believing in
   the Son of God, so did the Jews of other days make the sacrifice their
   confidence, their resting-place, their Messiah. And as Hezekiah broke
   in pieces the brazen serpent when Israel began to worship it, so did
   God abolish the sacrifice.

   That sacrifice was not in itself a real thing, nor did it accomplish
   anything real. It was but a picture, a statue, a shadow, a
   messenger,--no more. It was but the sketch or outline of the living
   thing that was to come; and to mistake it for that living thing itself
   was to be deluded with the subtlest of all errors, and the most
   perilous of all idolatries. And what can be more dangerous for a soul
   than to mistake the unreal for the real; to dote upon the picture, and
   lose sight of the glorious Being represented? Ah, we do not thus
   deceive ourselves in earthly things! No man mistakes the picture of
   gold for gold itself, or the portrait of a loved face for the very face
   itself. Yet do we daily see how men are content with religious
   unrealities; the unrealities of a barren creed, or of a hollow form;
   the unrealities of doubt and uncertainty in the relationship between
   them and God. We find how many of those called religious men are
   satisfied with something far short of a living Christ, and a full
   assurance and a joyful hope.

   Nay, they make this unreality of theirs an idol, a god; not venturing
   to step beyond it, not caring to part with it. They have become so
   familiar with it, that though it does not fill their soul, it soothes
   their uneasiness; it gratifies the religious element in their natural
   man; it pleases their self- righteousness, for it is something of their
   own; and it saves them from the dreaded necessity of coming into direct
   contact with the real, the living Christ, of being brought face to face
   with God Himself.

   Thus it comes to pass that a man's religion is often a barrier between
   his soul and God; the unreal is the substitute for the real; so that a
   man, having found the former, is content, and goes no farther; nay,
   counts it presumption, profanity to do so. To be told that the world,
   with its gay beauty and seducing smiles, comes between us and God,
   surprises no man; but to learn that the temple with its sacrifices, the
   Church with its religious services, does so, may startle some, nay, may
   exasperate them, as it did the Jews, to be told that their multiplied
   sacrifices and prayers were but multiplied barriers between them and
   God: not channels of communication, nor means of intercourse. The
   Jewish altar stood between the Jew and God; and that which was simply
   set as the ladder up to something higher became a resting-place. All
   the more, because it looked so real to the eye; while that to which it
   pointed was invisible, and therefore to sense unreal. But real as it
   looked, it was cold and unsatisfying. It was a real lamb, and a real
   altar of solid stone and brass; it was real blood and fire and smoke;
   and to take away these might seem to take away all that was
   substantial. But, after all, these were the unrealities. They could
   accomplish nothing for the filling of the heart, or the pacifying of
   the conscience, or the healing of the soul's deep wounds. Yet they
   pointed to the real; and their very unreality was meant to keep man
   from making them his home, or his religion, or his god. Men might
   admire the holy symbols and majestic ritual; but the true use of such
   admiration was to lead them to reason thus, If the unreal be so
   attractive, what will the real be; if the shadow thus soothes and
   pleases, what will not the divine substance do; if the picture of
   Messiah, thus sketched in these ceremonies, be so fair and goodly, how
   much fairer and goodlier will be the living Christ Himself; if the
   porch of the temple, or the steps leading to that temple, be so
   excellent, what must the inner sanctuary be; and who would stand ths,
   all a lifetime, shivering in the cold without, when the whole interior,
   with all its warmth and splendour and life and vastness was thrown
   open, and every man invited to enter and partake the gladness?

   Thus the "taking away of the first" was not the mere removal of what
   had done its work and become useless; but the abolition of that which
   had become an idol; a barrier between the Jew and God; quite as much as
   if the brazen altar had in the process of time become so enlarged as to
   block up the entrance into the holy place or the holiest of all. We
   read in Jewish history that once and again, during the seventeen sieges
   of Jerusalem, the gate of the temple was blocked up by the dead bodies
   of the worshippers. So did the access into the true tabernacle, not
   made with hands, become blocked up by the very sacrifices that were
   intended to point to the open door; and so in our day (long after that
   altar has been overturned and the fire quenched), is entrance into the
   holiest blocked up by our dead prayers, our dead works, our dead
   praises, our dead sacraments, our dead worship, our dead religion,
   quite as effectually as by our total want of these. A lesson hard for
   man to learn, especially in days when religion is fashionable and forms
   are exalted above measure. Greatly is that text needed amongst us, "If
   the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
   the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more
   shall the blood of Christ purge your conscience from dead works to
   serve the living God?" (Heb 9:14).

   It is then through the "second," not the "first," that the conscience
   is purged and the man made an acceptable worshipper, capable of doing
   good works and doing them in the spirit of liberty and fearless
   gladness. It is with the second, not the first, that the sinner has to
   do in drawing near to God; and it is the second, not the first, that
   God has regard to in receiving the sinner, and receiving him on the
   footing of one whose sins and iniquities are remembered no more.

   How wide the difference, how great the contrast between the first and
   the second! The first drew the veil and shut out the sinner from the
   holiest; the second rent it and bid him enter. The first filled the
   sinner's soul with dread, even in looking on the holiest of all from
   without; the second emboldened him to draw near and go up to the
   mercy-seat. The first made it death to cross the threshold of that
   inner shrine, where the symbol of the glory dwelt; the second made it
   life to go into the very presence of God, and provided the new and
   living way. The first gave no certainty of acceptance and laid the
   foundation for no permanent assurance; the second said, "Let us draw
   near with a true heart in the full assurance of faith"; "let us come
   boldly to the throne of grace." The first was never finished, even
   after many ages; the second was finished at once. The first was
   earthly, the second heavenly. The first was temporal, the second
   eternal. The first was unreal, the second real. The first pacified no
   conscience; the second did this at once, purging it effectually, so
   that the worshippers once purged had no more conscience of sins. The
   first was but the blood of one of Israel's lambs; the second the blood
   of the Lamb without blemish and without spot,--the precious blood of
   Christ!

   Still there was much about that "first" to interest, to solemnise, to
   gladden. It was old and venerable, a true relic of antiquity, such as
   no modern Church can boast of. It was not one death, but many thousand
   deaths; not one victim, but ten thousand victims; each of them
   fulfilling a certain end, yet all of them unavailing for the great
   end,--complete remission of sin and the providing for the worshipper, a
   perfect conscience and reconciliation with the Holy One of Israel.

   And that last Jewish sacrifice, at the hour of the crucifixion, which
   ended the "first" and began the "second"; was there not something
   specially solemn about it? Was there not something peculiar about it as
   the last? Like the last cedar of Lebanon, the last olive of Palestine,
   the last pillar of a falling temple that has stood for ages, the last
   representative of an ancient race, it could not but have something
   sacred, something noble about it.

   An unbelieving Jew, worshipping in the temple, at the time would see
   nothing remarkable about it, save the unaccountable darkness which had
   for three hours covered Jerusalem, and the fearful earthquake, and the
   mysterious rending of the veil, the tidings of which would immediately
   spread both in the temple and the city. What can all this mean, he
   might say; but he knew not what they meant; nor that this was the last
   sacrifice, according to the purpose of the God of Israel. Not
   connecting the first with the second, nor the earthly with the
   heavenly, he would soon forget the darkness, and the earthquake, and
   the torn veil, coming next morning at nine o'clock to assist in the
   celebration of the morning-sacrifice. For the great break in the
   sacrifices was an invisible thing to him. To heaven it was visible, to
   angels it was visible, to faith it was visible; but not to unbelief.
   And unbelief would go on from day to day doting on the old sacrifice
   and admiring the old altar; till the Roman torch set fire to the goodly
   cedar of the holy places, and the Roman battle-axe shivered the altar
   in pieces, and brought to the ground porch, and tower, and wall,- -gate
   and bar, in one irrecoverable ruin; not one stone left upon another.

   But how would a believing Jew view this last sacrifice? With mingled
   feelings in many ways; for as yet his eyes were but half opened; and
   though he might in a measure understand the first, he could not fully
   see the second, nor the first in connection with the second. It would
   still be to him sacred and venerable; though now he saw it, like the
   picture of a dissolving view, passing away and being replaced by
   another. Holy histories of his nation and precious recollections of his
   own experience would come up into view. From that sacrifice he had
   learned the way of forgiveness, perhaps from childhood. Often had the
   sight of it poured in happy thoughts and told him of the love of a
   redeeming God. Often had he stood at that altar with his little ones,
   and taught them from it the way of salvation through blood. Often had
   he seen the fire blazing and the smoke ascending, and the blood
   flowing, and he had mused over all these in connection with the first
   promise of Messiah's bruised heel, and the later prophecies of His
   pouring out His soul unto death. But now he was startled. That
   darkness, that earthquake, that rent veil; and in connection with all
   this, the scene in Golgotha now going on, seemed to say that sacrifice
   has done its work and must pass away. That has come at last which he
   had been long looking for; the better Lamb, the richer blood, the more
   perfect sacrifice. Now he sees the full meaning of the burnt-offering;
   now his faith lays its hand on the head of the true sacrifice; now he
   knows what John meant when he said, "Behold the Lamb of God"; and he
   can say with Simeon, "Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in
   peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation."

   And with what thoughts must the Son of God have seen from the cross the
   smoke of that last burnt- offering ascending? For it was at the ninth
   hour, our three o'clock, when the evening lamb was laid on the altar,
   that Jesus "cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"
   Yes, when the Son of God, the true Sin-bearer, was uttering these
   words, Israel's last sacrifice was offered. It is finished, was the
   voice from the altar; it is finished was the voice from the cross. Now
   the last type is done; and Jesus sees it (for the altar-smoke would be
   quite visible from Golgotha); Israel's long lesson of ages has been
   taught; the type and Antitype have been brought face to face. How often
   had Jesus seen the morning and evening lamb offered up; and in gazing
   on it realised his own sin-bearing work. Now he sees all accomplished;
   sin borne, peace made, God propitiated; and in testimony of this the
   last burnt-sacrifice offered up. All is done. He sees of the travail of
   His soul and is satisfied. He can now tell Jew and Gentile that
   atonement has been made by the better blood. Life has been given for
   life; a divine life for a human. He can say, Look no longer on yon
   altar; its work is done. Look to me, of whom it spoke during so many
   ages; look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.

   And how does the Father view that last sacrifice? For four thousand
   years it had been the witness to the sin-bearing work of the coming
   Messiah. The Father had set it there to bear testimony to the
   propitiation of His Son. It said to Israel, and it said to the world
   before the days of Israel, The seed of the woman is to be man's
   deliverer. He is coming! He is coming to bear sin; to be wounded for
   our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities; to take the
   chastisement of our peace upon Him, and to heal us by His stripes. For
   ages that was the voice that came from the altar. It was the Father's
   voice foretelling the advent of His beloved Son. And now that voice
   from the altar is to die away. The testimony is to cease; for He to
   whom it was given is come. The ages of delay are over; the day of
   expectation has come to an end. The purpose of Jehovah is now
   consummated. The Father now delights in the accomplishment of His
   eternal design. Now grace and righteousness are one. So long as one
   burnt-offering remained unpresented, there was something awanting;
   something unfinished. But now the last of the long series has arrived.
   The type is perfected, the last stone has been laid; the last touch has
   been given to the picture; the last stroke of the chisel has fallen
   upon the statue. The imperfect has ended in the perfect, the unreal in
   the real; the first has become the last and the last first. Now divine
   love can take its unimpeded way; no drag, no uncertainty, no
   imperfection now. Grace and righteousness have become one. The Father's
   testimony to the finished work of His Son now goes forth to the ends of
   the earth. That last sacrifice on Israel's altar was the signal for the
   forthgoing of the world- wide message of pardon,--righteous pardon,--to
   the guiltiest, the saddest and the neediest of the sons of men.

   And how is this last sacrifice viewed by the Church of God? Not with
   regret, nor with disappointment at the thought that there is no such
   altar now; but with rejoicing that the work has been at length
   consummated, and that there is no necessity for the repetition of the
   sacrifice. Whilst to a believing Jew there was satisfaction in each
   recurring sacrifice day by day, there could not but be a feeling of
   uneasiness at that very repetition. If the sacrifice is sufficient, why
   repeat it? Or will the multiplication of imperfections produce
   perfection? If insufficient, what is there to look to for the
   pacification of the conscience? But the termination of the series was
   an unspeakable relief. It was the winding up of a work which had been
   going on for four thousand years. Now, then, God is satisfied. Now
   there is the certainty of remission. Now the conscience is purged. Now
   the soul is at rest. And thus that last burnt-offering gave to the
   Church the assurance that the reconciliation was accomplished. No more
   offering for sin! No more blood! the foundation is now secure. On it
   she stands, in it she rejoices. The "good conscience" is now secured.
   Fear and shame in drawing near to God are at an end for ever. There is
   nothing but boldness now; for by one offering He hath perfected for
   ever them that are sanctified. Not by the blood of goats and calves,
   but by His own blood, He hath entered in once into the holy place,
   having obtained eternal redemption for us. By this blood He hath
   reconciled us to Himself. By this blood He daily cements the
   reconciliation, and keeps our souls in peace. By this blood He washes
   off the ever-recurring sins that would come between us and God, purging
   our consciences from dead works to serve the living God (Heb 9:12,13).

   Round the old altar on Moriah one nation gathered, for the worship of
   Jehovah, during a few earthly ages; but round the new altar is gathered
   the great multitude that no man can number, out of every nation and
   people; for we have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat who
   serve the tabernacle. The first has been taken away, but the second has
   been set up, to stand for ever. Here we worship now; here shall be the
   eternal worship; the Lamb slain is the centre of worship for the
   universe of God, whether on earth, or in heaven, or throughout the wide
   regions which the creating Word has filled with suns and stars. On this
   divine altar shall all creaturehood lay its everlasting praise. From
   this altar shall ascend the never-ending son. This altar shall be the
   great centre of unity between the multitudinous parts or units of
   universal being. Here heaven and earth shall meet; here redeemed men
   and angels shall hold fellowship; here the principalities and powers in
   heavenly places shall learn the wisdom of God; here shall be found the
   stability, not of manhood only, but of creaturehood as well, the divine
   security against a second fall, against any future failure of creation,
   against any future curse, against the possibility of evil or weakness
   or decay. He has taken away the first, but He has established the
   second; and with that He has linked the establishment of all that is
   good and holy and blessed in His universe for evermore.

   From this "second" also there goes forth the message of reconciliation;
   the announcement that peace has been made through the blood of the
   cross; the entreaty on the part of God, that each distant one would
   draw near, each wanderer re-enter his Father's house. To every one that
   is afar off, this great propitiation speaks, and says, RETURN! It bids
   you welcome, with all your worthlessness and unfitness, pointing to the
   ever-open door, and assuring you of reception, and pardon, and free
   love, without delay, without condition, and without upbraiding. From
   this centre the good news of God's free love to the unrighteous are
   going forth. In the simple reception of these by the sinner there is
   everlasting life; but in the non-reception of them there is eternal
   death; for that blood condemns as well as justifies. It speaks peace,
   but it speak trouble and anguish. It contains life, but it also
   contains death. It introduces into heaven, but it casts down to hell.
   He who receives it is washed, and sanctified, and justified; he who
   rejects it is undone,--doomed to bear his own guilt, without reprieve,
   for ever. For you, or against you, through eternity that blood must be.

   There has been a first, there is a second, but there shall be no third!
   The first could not suffice, either for salvation or for destruction;
   it did not save those who used it, nor did it ruin those who used it
   not, or who used it amiss. The second sufficed for both. It is able to
   save and to destroy, to forgive and to condemn. No third is needed, no
   third is possible. The second is established for ever. It is eternal.
   It is an everlasting sacrifice. It is an eternal ransom, an eternal
   redemption, an eternal salvation, an everlasting covenant, and an
   everlasting gospel. Its accompaniments and issues are everlasting life,
   everlasting habitations, everlasting consolation, an everlasting
   kingdom, an eternal inheritance, an eternal weight of glory, a house
   not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Yes; this second is
   established, and shall stand for ever. He who accepts it becomes, like
   it, established, and shall stand for ever; for it has the power of
   imparting its stability to every one who receives God's testimony
   concerning it. This is "the living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but
   chosen of God, and precious; to which coming we, as living stones, are
   built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
   sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 2:4,5).

   There shall be no third! This is the security and the joy of all who
   receive it. He who has taken away the first has established the second.
   Heaven and earth may pass away, but it must remain; and with it remains
   our reconciliation, our sonship, our royalty, and our eternal weight of
   glory. Were it possible that this second altar could be overthrown, or
   crumble down through age; this second blood, and second covenant, and
   second priesthood become inefficacious or obsolete, then should our
   future be shaded with uncertainty. But all these being divine are
   eternal; and in their eternity is wrapt up that of every one who is now
   by faith partakers of them; in their eternity is wrapt up that of the
   inheritance, the city, and the kingdom, which become the possession of
   every one whom the blood has washed and reconciled.

   For the cross is never old. The wood, and nails, and inscription have
   indeed perished long ago; but the cross in which Paul gloried stands
   for ever. That cross is the axle of the universe, and cannot snap
   asunder. That cross is the foundation on which the universe rests, and
   cannot give way. The cross of Golgotha is, in this sense, everlasting;
   and each one who glories in it becomes partaker of its immortality. In
   itself blood is the symbol of death; in connection with the cross of
   Christ, it is the emblem and the pledge of life. It is by blood that
   all that is feeble, and corruptible, and unclean is purged out of
   creaturehood. It is by blood that this race of ours is preserved
   against the possibility of a second fall, and this earth against the
   contingency of a second curse. It is by blood that the Church of God
   has won her victory, and been made without spot, or wrinkle, or any
   such thing. It is the blood that has given such resplendent glory to
   the New Jerusalem, and made its light so pure, for "THE LAMB is the
   light thereof."

   And yet is it not on this very blood that the spirit of the age is
   pouring its contempt, as if it were the great disfiguration of
   Christianity, requiring to be explained and spiritualised, before it
   can be admitted to have any connection with a divine religion? Is it
   not against this blood that the tide of modern progress is advancing,
   to wash out every trace and stain of it? It is against the blood that
   unbelief is now specially declaring war, little supposing, in its
   blindness, what would be the consequences of success in this warfare.
   Take away that blood, and the security of the universe is gone. Take
   away the blood, and the gate of the glorious city closes against the
   sinner; nay, that city itself, with all its beauty, and purity, and
   splendour, passes away like a vision of the night, each stone of it
   vanishing into nothingness, and its light becoming darkness.

  Chapter 7.

Messiah Within the Veil.

   We spoke of Messiah longing for the time when the veil should be rent,
   and when, through Himself, there should be unobstructed access to the
   innermost shrine of God. "How am I straitened till it be accomplished."
   We spoke also of His dreading this rending, this death,--so that "with
   strong crying and tears He prayed to Him who was able to save Him from
   death" (Heb 5:7).

   Let us now see Him looking beyond the veil, surveying the glory, and
   anticipating His own entrance into it, as our forerunner, the first
   fruits of them that slept, the first-begotten of the dead. "For the joy
   set before Him He endured the cross, despising the shame, and is now
   set down at the right hand of God" (Heb 12:2). That to which He looked
   forward was not so much the rending of the veil, as the result of that
   rending,--both for Himself and for His Church, His body, the redeemed
   from among men.

   The veil was rent; rent "once for all"; rent for ever. Yet there was a
   sense in which it was to be restored, though after another fashion than
   before. Messiah could not be "holden" by death, because He was the Holy
   One, who could not see corruption. Death must be annulled. The broken
   body must be made whole; resurrection must come forth out of death; and
   that resurrection was to be life, and glory, and blessedness. Through
   the rent veil of His own flesh, He was (if we may so use the figure) to
   enter into "glory and honour, and immortality." Thus He speaks in the
   sixteenth Psalm:-- "Therefore my heart is glad, Yea, my glory
   rejoiceth: My flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my
   soul in hell; Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
   corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is
   fulness of joy; At thy right hand are pleasures for evermore." Let us
   dwell upon these verses in connection with Messiah's entrance within
   the veil.

   The speaker in this Psalm is undoubtedly Christ. This we learn from
   Peter's sermon at Jerusalem (Acts 2:25). He is speaking to the Father,
   as His Father and our Father. He speaks as the lowly, dependent son of
   man; as one who needed help and looked to the Father for it; as one who
   trusted in the Lord and walked by faith, not by sight; as one who
   realised the Father's love, anticipated the joy set before Him, and had
   respect to the recompense of the reward.

   He speaks, moreover, as one who saw death before Him,-- "Thou wilt not
   leave my soul in hell"; and looking into the dark grave, on the edge of
   which He was standing, just about to plunge into it, He casts His eye
   upwards and pleads, with strong crying and tears, for resurrection, and
   joy, and glory,-- "Thou wilt show me the path of life." For the words
   of the Psalm are the united utterances of confidence, expectation, and
   prayer; not unlike those of Paul, "I am now ready to be offered, and
   the time of my departure is at hand; henceforth there is laid up for me
   a crown of righteousness."

   He speaks too as one who was bearing our curse; as one who was made sin
   for us; and to whom everything connected with sin and its penalty was
   infinitely terrible; not the less terrible, but the more, because the
   sin and the penalty were not His own, but ours. The death which now
   confronted Him was one of the ingredients of the fearful cup, against
   which He prayed in Gethsemane, "Let this cup pass from me"; for we read
   that, "in the days of His flesh He made supplication, with strong
   crying and tears, unto Him that was able to save Him from death." In
   this Psalm, indeed, we do not hear these strong cryings and tears,
   which the valley of the Kedron then heard. All is calm; the bitterness
   of death is past; the power of the king of terrors seems broken; the
   gloom of the grave is lost in the anticipated brightness of the
   resurrection light and glory. But still the scene is similar; though in
   the Psalm the light predominates over the darkness, and there is not
   the agony, nor the bloody sweat, nor the exceeding sorrow. It is our
   Surety looking the king of terrors in the face; contemplating the
   shadows of the three days and nights in the heat of the earth;
   surveying Joseph's tomb, and while accepting that as His prison-house
   for a season, anticipating the deliverance by the Father's power, and
   rejoicing in the prospect of the everlasting gladness.

   The first thing that occupies His thoughts is resurrection. The path of
   death is before Him; and He asks that He may know the path of
   life;--the way out of the tomb as well as the way into it. Death is to
   Him an enemy; an enemy from which as the Prince of life His holy soul
   would recoil even more than we. The grave is to Him a prison-house,
   gloomy as Jeremiah's low dungeon or Joseph's pit, not the less gloomy
   because He approaches it as a conqueror, as bringing life and
   immortality to light, as the resurrection and the life. Into that
   prison-house He must descend; for though rich He has stooped to be
   poor; and this is the extremity of his poverty, the lowest depth of His
   low estate,--even the surrender of that, for which even the richest on
   earth will part with everything,--life itself. But out of that dungeon
   He cries to be brought; and for this rescue He puts Himself entirely
   into the Father's hands, "Thou wilt show me the path of life."

   Very blessed and glorious did resurrection seem in the eyes of the
   Prince of life, of Him who is the resurrection and the life. Infinitely
   hateful did death and the grave appear to Him who was the Conqueror of
   death, the Spoiler of the grave. He had undertaken to die, for as the
   second Adam He came to undergo the penalty of the first, "dust thou art
   and unto dust shalt thou return"; yet not the less bitter was the cup,
   not the less gloomy was the valley of the shadow of death; not the less
   welcome was the thought of resurrection.

   The next thing which fills His thoughts is the presence of God,--that
   glorious presence which He had left when He "came down from heaven."
   His thoughts are of the Father's face, the Father's house, the Father's
   presence. Earth to Him was so different from heaven. He had not yet
   come to the "Why hast Thou forsaken me?" but He felt the difference
   between this earth and the heaven He had quitted. There was no such
   "presence" here. All was sin, evil, hatred, darkness; the presence of
   evil men and mocking devils; not the presence of God. God seemed far
   away. This world seemed empty and dreary. He called to mind the home,
   and the love, and the holiness He had left; and He longed for a return
   to these. "Thy presence!" What a meaning in these words, coming from
   the lips of the lonely Son of God in His desolation and friendlessness
   and exile here. "Thy presence!" How full of recollection would they be
   to Him as He uttered them; and how intensely would that recollection
   stimulate the anticipation and the hope!

   Of this same Messiah, the speaker in the psalm, we read afterwards, "In
   the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God; the same was in the beginning with God" (John 1:1); and elsewhere
   He speaks thus of Himself: "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of
   His way, before His works of old; I was set up from everlasting, from
   the beginning, or ever the earth was...I was by Him, as one brought up
   with Him, and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him"
   (Prov 8:22,30); and again, He, in the days of His flesh, thus prayed:
   "O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self, with the glory which I
   had with Thee before the world was" (John 17:5). Thus we see that the
   "presence" or "face" of God had been His special and eternal portion.
   His past eternity was associated entirely with this glorious presence.
   No wonder then that in the day of His deepest weakness,--when the last
   enemy confronted Him with his hideous presence, He should recall the
   Father's presence; anticipating the day of restoration to that
   presence, and repossession of the glory which He had before the world
   was.

   "Thy presence," said the only-begotten of the Father looking up into
   the Father's face! He speaks as the sin-bearer, on whom the
   chastisement of our sins was laid, and between whom and heaven these
   sins had drawn a veil; He speaks as an exile, far from home, weary,
   troubled, exceeding sorrowful even unto death; He speaks as a Son
   feeling the bitterness of separation from His Father's presence, and of
   distance from His Father's house; He speaks as one longing for home and
   kindred, and the unimpeded outflowings of paternal love. "Thy
   presence," says the Man of sorrows looking round on an evil world;--oh,
   that I were there! "Thy presence," says the forsaken Son of man, for
   "lover and friend hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into
   darkness";--oh, that I were there! "Thy presence," not this waste
   howling wilderness, this region of pain, and disease, and sin, and
   death, and tombs. "Thy presence," not these temptations, these devils,
   these enemies, these false friends; not this blasphemy, this reproach,
   this scorn, this betrayal, this denial, this buffeting, this scourging,
   this spitting, this mockery! "Thy presence,"--oh, that I were there;
   nevertheless, not my will but Thine be done.

   Only through death can He reach life, for He is burdened with our sin
   and our death; and death is to Him the path of life. He must go through
   the veil to enter into the presence of God. Only through the
   grave,--the stronghold of death, and of him who has the power of
   death,--can He ascend into the presence of God; and therefore, when
   about to enter the dark valley, He commits Himself to the Father's
   guidance, to the keeping of Him who said, "Behold my servant whom I
   uphold," the keeping of which He himself, by the mouth of David, had
   spoken: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
   I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff they
   comfort me." Bethlehem, Egypt, Nazareth, Capernaum, Gethsemane,
   Golgotha,--these were all but stages in His way up to "the
   presence"--the presence of the Father; and it is when approaching the
   last of these, with the consciousness of His nearness to that presence,
   only one more dark passage to wind through, that He gives utterance to
   this psalm,--His psalm in prospect of resurrection and glory,-- "I have
   set the Lord always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall
   not be moved: therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth; my
   flesh also shall rest in hope; for Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
   neither wilt Thou suffer Thine holy One to see corruption; Thou wilt
   show me the path of life: in Thy presence is fulness of joy; at Thy
   right hand there are pleasures for evermore."

   Connected with this "presence," this glory within the veil, he speaks
   of "fulness of joy." On earth, in the day of His banishment here, He
   found want, not fulness. He was poor and needy; no house, no table, no
   chamber, no pillow of His own. His was the extremity of human poverty;
   though rich He had become poor; he was hungry, thirsty, weary, with no
   place to lay His head. Though He knew no sin, He tasted the sinner's
   portion of want and sorrow. He was in the far country, the land of the
   mighty famine; and looking upwards to the happy heaven which He had
   left, He could say, "How many servants in my Father's house have bread
   and to spare, and I perish with hunger." Drinking also of the sinner's
   deep cup of wrath, He was the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
   It was as such that He looked up so often as we find Him in the Gospels
   doing, and as we find Him in this Psalm, with wistful eye reminding
   Himself of the joy He had left, and anticipating the augmented joy that
   was so soon to be His when, having traversed this vale of tears, and
   passed through the gates of death, He was to re-ascend to His Father,
   and re-enter the courts of glory and joy. "Fulness of joy" is His
   prospect; fulness of joy in the presence of God. Concerning this going
   to the Father He spoke to His disciples; and then added, "These things
   have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you, and that your
   joy might be full." It is of this same full joy that He speaks in our
   psalm; a joy which was to be the fulness of all joy; a joy which was to
   be His recompense for the earthly sorrow of His sin-bearing life and
   death; a joy which He was to share with His redeemed, and on which they
   too should enter, when they, like Him, had triumphed over death, and
   been caught up into the clouds to meet Him in the air; a joy which
   would be to them, in that wondrous day, infinitely more than a
   compensation for earthly tribulation; even as one of themselves has
   written, "Our present light affliction, which is but for a moment,
   worketh for us a far more eceeding and eternal weight of glory."

   This was "the joy set before Him," because of which He endured the
   cross; and here He calls it FULNESS OF JOY. That which He calls fulness
   must be so; for He knows what joy is, and what its fulness is; just as
   He knew what sorrow was and its fulness. The amount of joy sufficient
   to fill a soul like His must be infinite; it must be joy unspeakable
   and full of glory. The amount of joy reckoned by the Father sufficient
   as the reward of the sorrow of such a Son, must be infinite indeed.
   What then must that be which Messiah reckons the fulness of joy. What a
   day was that for Him when, death and sorrow ended, He entered on life
   and gladness! And what a day will that be, yet in store for Him and for
   His saints, when we, as His joint-heirs, shall enter on all that life
   and gladness; the day of His glorious coming, when that shall be
   fulfilled which is written, "Come forth, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
   and behold King Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned
   him, in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his
   heart."

   Besides the "presence" or "face" of God within the veil, Messiah sees
   the right hand; the place of honour and power and favour,--the right
   hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens; and at that right
   hand there are pleasures for evermore; eternal enjoyments, such as eye
   hath not seen, nor ear heard. For all the things on which Messiah's
   soul rests are everlasting; the life, the fulness, the joy, the
   presence, the pleasures,--all eternal! No wonder, then, that He who
   knows what eternity is,--an eternity of glory and gladness,--should
   feel that "the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
   compared with the glory that shall be revealed"; and should, when going
   up to the cross, and down into the grave, say with calm but happy
   confidence, "Thou wilt show me the path of life, in Thy presence is
   fulness of joy, at Thy right hand are pleasures for evermore." Most
   mysterious are such words as these from the lips of Him who is the
   resurrection and the life; and yet it is just because they come from
   Him,--from this Prince of Life,--that they are so assuring, so
   comforting to us. His oneness with us, and our oneness with Him,
   account for all the mystery. His oneness with us, as our substitute and
   sinbearer, the endurer of our curse and cross and death, accounts for
   all that is mysterious in this Psalm. Our oneness with Him clears up
   all that is wonderful in such words as "I am the resurrection and the
   life, he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."
   Blessed, thrice-blessed oneness,--mutual oneness; He one with us, we
   one with Him, in life, in death, in burial, in resurrection, and in
   glory. Now we can take up His words as truly meant for us, "Thou wilt
   show us the path of life"; for in believing God's testimony to the
   Messiahship of Jesus of Nazareth, we have become one with Him!

   In all this we have,

   1. Messiah's estimate of death. He abhors it. It is His enemy as well
   as ours. He came to conquer it, to destroy it for ever. He conquers it
   by being conquered by it; He slays it by allowing Himself to be slain
   by it. He crucifies it, kills it, buries it for ever. Death is
   swallowed up in victory. "O death," He says, "I will be thy plague; O
   grave, I will be thy destruction."

   2. Messiah's estimate of resurrection. He longs for it; both on His own
   account and His people's. It is the consummation of that which He calls
   life. It is the second life, more glorious than the first; the opposite
   extreme of being to that which is called "the second death." The Son of
   God came into the world as the Prince of Life; He came not merely that
   He might die, but that He might live; and that all who identify
   themselves with Him by the acceptance of the divine testimony
   concerning His life and death and resurrection, might not only have
   life, but might have it more abundantly. Resurrection is our hope, even
   as it was His; the first, the better resurrection; and as we toil
   onwards in our pilgrimage, burdened with the mortality of this vile
   body, and seeing death on every side of us, we take up Messiah's words
   of hope and gladness, "Thou wilt show me the path of life."

   3. Messiah's estimate of joy. He recognises it as a thing greatly to be
   desired, not despised; as the true and healthy, or, as men say, the
   "normal" condition of creaturehood. God Himself is the blessed one; and
   He formed His creatures to be sharers of His blessedness. Heaven is
   full of joy; and all its dwellers are vessels of gladness. Earth was
   not made for sorrow, but for joy; and, before long, that song shall be
   sung over the new creation, "Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth
   be glad." For this day of joy Christ longed, anticipating it as the
   consummation of all that He had come to do. As the eternal Word which
   was with the Father, He knew what joy was; as the Man of sorrows, He
   knew what sorrow was. He was in the true condition and circumstances to
   take the proper estimate of joy. And here He tells us what that
   estimate was. He longed to be done with sorrow, which was as the shadow
   of hell; He "desired with desire" to enter into the joy set before Him,
   the joy of life, the joy of resurrection, the joy of God's presence and
   right hand for ever. Let our eye, like His, be fixed on that coming
   gladness,--that sunrise of eternity for which the Church is waiting and
   creation groans. That hope will cheer, will nerve, will liberate, will
   heal, will animate, will purify; will do miracles for us. As yet, the
   joy has not arrived. It doth not yet appear what we shall be. Not now;
   not here; not on this side of the grave! But the promise of its
   possession, and the assurance that when it does arrive, it will be
   great enough and long enough to make up for all trial and all delay,
   are sufficient to keep us ever looking, waiting, watching. Resurrection
   is coming, with all its light and joy; and then comes the world's
   second dawn, and the Church's long-expected dayspring; the cessation of
   creation's groans, the times of the restitution of all things; the new
   heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.

   4. Messiah's estimate of the Father's love. It is this love that is His
   portion; it is in this love that He abides and rejoices; for it is He
   who says, "Thy loving kindness is better than life." No one knew so
   well as He did the glorious truth, "God is love; and he that dwelleth
   in love dwelleth in God, and God in him." The Father's love! Here His
   soul found its resting-place, in the midst of human hatred and
   reproach. The Father's love! It was with this that He comforted
   Himself, and with this it was that He comforted His Church, saying, "As
   the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you"; "Thou hast loved them
   as thou hast loved me"; "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the
   world"; "that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me may be in them, and
   I in them." Is that love to us what it was to Him? It was His rest, is
   it ours? It was into this hidden chamber, this holy of holies, that He
   retired, when the world's storms beat upon Him; is it in this that we
   take refuge in our evil days? It was sufficient for His infinitely
   capacious soul; it may well suffice for ours. Is, then, His estimate of
   the Father's love our estimate? Is this love our gladness? Is its
   sunshine the brightness of our daily life? And with simple confidence
   in it, like Messiah's, do we look into and look through the future,
   however dark, saying, "Thou wilt show me the path of life; in Thy
   presence is fulness of joy, and at Thy right hand are pleasures for
   evermore?"

   On all that light, and joy, and fulness, and love, Messiah has now
   entered. For eighteen hundred years He has been in that presence, and
   at that right hand, which He longed for; and though yet greater things
   are in store for Him in the day of His promised advent, yet He has now
   for ages been done with sorrow and death, with reproach and hatred. He
   has entered on His rest; He has passed into life; His blessedness is
   now without a shadow. And is not this a thought full of joy to us? He
   whom we love is happy! No second Gethsemane nor Golgotha for Him.
   Whatever may befall us, whatever of tribulation we may have yet to pass
   through, He is blessed; it is all well with Him. He has trodden the
   path of life; He has entered into that presence which He longed for; He
   has sat down at that right hand where there are pleasures for evermore.
   Is this not a joyful thought to us here, even in the midst of our
   weakness and sorrow? And was it not to this He referred when He said,
   "If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said I go unto the
   Father"? and was it not with forgetfulness of this that He reproached
   His disciples, "Now I go my way to Him that sent me, and none of you
   asketh me, whither goest Thou? but because I have said these things
   unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart."

   Should we not rejoice in His joy? Should not the thought of His
   happiness be a continual source of consolation to us? Amid the
   dreariness of the desert, it was a cheering thought to Israel that
   there was such a region as Canaan, over which the barrenness of the
   waste howling wilderness had no power. Amid the griefs and cares of
   earth, it is a blessed thought to us that there is such a place as
   heaven, to which the storm reaches not, and where there has never been
   known, neither shall be, one cloud, one pain, one sin. So amid the
   troubles of our own troubled spirits, or the sorrows of those about us,
   it is a happy thought that there is one heart, once full of grief, that
   now grieves no more; one eye that often wept, which now weeps no more;
   and that this blessed One is none other than our beloved Lord,--once
   the Man of sorrows. He who loved us, He whom, not having seen, we love,
   is now for ever blessed; He has entered that presence where there is
   fulness of joy; He has taken His seat at that right hand, where there
   are pleasures for evermore.

   Does not this comfort and gladden us? What He now is, and what we so
   soon shall be,--this gives vigour and consolation. It lifts us almost
   unconsciously into a calmer region, and gives us to breathe the very
   air of the kingdom. It purifies, too, and strengthens; it makes us
   forget the things which are behind, and reach forward to what lies
   before.

   The prospect of resurrection and glory sustained the soul of our Surety
   here. This was the joy set before Him. Let us set it before ourselves,
   that we may not be moved. We have much to do both with the future and
   the past. In that future lies our inheritance, and we cannot but be
   seeking to pierce the veil that hides it. But in the past we find our
   resting-place. Christ has ascended on high, leading captivity captive;
   he has ascended to His Father and our Father, to His God and our God.
   The work is done. The blood is shed. The fire has consumed the
   sacrifice. It is finished! This is the testimony which we bring from
   God, in the belief of which we are saved. It needs no second sacrifice;
   no repetition of the great burnt-offering. That which saves the sinner
   is done. Another has done it all. Messiah has done it all; and our
   gospel is not a command to do, but simply to take what another has
   done. He who ceases from His own labours, and enters on these labours
   of another, has taken possession of all to which these labours entitled
   Him, who so performed them, even the Messiah of Israel, the Son of God,
   the Saviour of the world.

  Chapter 8.

The Blood Within the Veil.

   The day of atonement brought the three courts of the tabernacle into
   one. On that day the high priest passed from the outmost to the
   innermost; implying that he had equally to do with all the holy places,
   and that they whom he represented had also to do with these.

   He carried the incense from the golden altar into the holiest; and he
   carried the blood from the brazen altar into the same. It was one
   blood, one incense, one priest for all the three.

   The blood, which was sprinkled on the mercy- seat, was from without.
   The sacrifice was not slain in the inner courts, but in the outer. It
   was blood from without that was carried in the priestly basin within
   the veil, sprinkling the veil, the floor, the ark, the mercy-seat, and
   the feet of the cherubim as they stood upon the golden covering. In
   being carried within, it lost none of its expiating virtue and value:
   nay, it seemed to acquire more virtue and more value as it lay upon the
   furniture of the holy of holies.

   Its efficacy, when thus brought within the veil, was enhanced; and it
   did not the less speak to those without because itself was within. It
   had come from without, and its voice spoke to those who were without.
   It spoke but from one small point, yet it goes beyond the tabernacle,
   beyond Israel, beyond Palestine, to the men of every kindred and
   nation, and tongue and people. It contained a world-wide message, so
   that each one hearing of that atoning blood might at once say, Then God
   is summoning me back to Himself; He is saying to me, "be thou
   reconciled to me"; He is sending to me, from the altar and the
   mercy-seat, an invitation of mingled righteousness and grace.

   This propitiation rests on substitution. In all these symbolical
   transactions we have one vast thought,--the transference of guilt from
   one to another, legally and judicially; the presentation of one death
   for another, as perfectly valid for all ends of justice, and quite as
   suitable before God as the judge, to meet every governmental claim as
   the direct infliction of the appointed penalty on the actual
   transgressor.

   There are two things which the whole Levitical service assumes, and
   without which it is simple mockery of man, that Sin is reality, and
   that Substitution is righteousness.

   1. Sin is a real thing. Men do not think so, even when with their lips
   they utter the word. It is but a shadow to them, a mere name, no more.

   Sin is a sore evil. It is not felt to be so, yet it is not the less
   truly such. It is not hated, it is not shunned as an evil,--an evil
   whose greatness no one can measure or tell. When men speak of it they
   do so as painters speak of shade in a scene or picture; as rather a
   needful thing, nay, a thing of beauty in its own way. They have no due
   sense or estimate of it at all. It is not to them what it is to God. It
   is not by any means in their books what it is in the book of God.

   Yet, right views of sin are the key to the Bible, the key to the
   history of the world, and the key to God's purposes concerning it. He
   who does not know what sin is cannot understand the Bible. It must be a
   dark and strange book to him. He cannot solve the difficulties of the
   world's history. All is perplexed and contradictory. He cannot enter
   into God's purposes respecting it either in curse or in blessing,
   either in condemnation or redemption. Sin is not misfortune, but guilt;
   not disease, but crime; not an evil, but the evil, the evil of evils,
   the root of all evils; terrible in itself as fraught with all that we
   call "moral evil," and terrible in its judicial effects as necessarily
   and inexorably bound up with irresistible and irreversible
   condemnation.

   In spite of all the divine teaching, both in God's book and in the
   world's history, man refuses to believe that sin is what God has
   proclaimed it, and what its own development, in the annals of the ages,
   has shown that it really is.

   The first and fundamental lesson of the Levitical service is the
   infinite evil of sin. Sacrifice is God's declaration of His estimate of
   SIN. Strike this thought out of it, and sacrifice is simple
   barbarism,--a coarse emblem of the vengeance of a Jupiter, or a Moloch,
   or a Baal upon helpless creaturehood.

   2. Substitution is righteousness.--I do not argue this question; I
   merely indicate that scripture assumes this.

   Often has the doctrine of substitution been evil spoken of as a slander
   against God's free love. It has been called a commercial transaction, a
   bargain inconsistent with true generosity, a money-payment of so much
   love for so much suffering. Philosophy, falsely so called, has
   frequently, by such representations, striven to write down a truth for
   which it could not find a niche in its speculations, and of which the
   philosopher himself had never felt His need. With any book less buoyant
   than the Bible to float it up, this doctrine must long before this have
   been submerged under the weight of ridicule, which the wisdom of this
   world has brought to bear upon it.

   But it has been seen that the Bible and the truth of substitution
   cannot be sundered. They must sink or float together. The great
   philosophic puzzle with many, who were not prepared to cast off the
   Scriptures, was how to disentangle the two, so as to strike out the
   doctrine and yet preserve the old Book.

   This difficulty has been felt all the more, because in the Bible itself
   there are no indications of any misgivings as to the doctrine, no
   explanations meant to smooth angularities and make the doctrine less
   philosophically objectionable. As if unconscious of the force of any
   such objection, it makes use of figures, once and again, which are
   directly taken from the commercial transactions of life. Even if what
   is branded as the mercantile theology could be proved untrue, it is
   certainly very like what we find in the Bible; nor can one help feeling
   that if the above theology be untrue, it is rather strange that the
   Bible should lay itself so open to the suspicion of favouring it. For,
   after all, the strongest statements and most obnoxious figures are
   those of that Book itself. Eliminate these and we are ready to hear how
   philosophy can argue. We do not say "explain them," we say "eliminate
   them"; for our difficulty lies in the simple existence of such
   passages. Why are they there, if substitution and transference be not
   true? They are stumbling-blocks and snares. Let these passages
   themselves bear the blame, if blame there is. It is idle to revile a
   doctrine, yet leave the figures, from which it is drawn, untouched and
   uncondemned.

   Substitution may be philosophical or unphilosophical, defensible or
   indefensible; still it is imbedded in the Bible; specially in the
   sacrificial books and sacerdotal ordinances. Its writers may be
   credited or discredited; but no one can deny that substitution was an
   article of their creed, and that they meant to teach this doctrine if
   they meant anything at all. We might as well affirm that Moses did not
   mean to teach creation in Genesis, or Israel's deliverance in Exodus,
   as that he did not profess to promulgate Substitution in Leviticus.
   Substitution is in that book beyond all question; along with that book
   let it stand or fall.

   There is then substitution revealed to us beyond mistake in Scripture;
   revealed in connection with Israel's worship, Israel's tabernacle, and
   Israel's Messiah. The special thing in that service, in that sanctuary,
   and in that Deliverer, with which substitution is connected, is THE
   BLOOD. Hence it is with blood that we find atonement, expiation, and
   propitiation connected. For the blood is the life; and it is the
   substitution of one life for another that accomplishes these results,
   and brings with it these blessings to the guilty.

   Let me take two passages, one from the Old Testament, the other from
   the New, in illustration of what the blood is affirmed to be and to do.
   I give but a brief sketch of what I suppose they include; but it will
   suffice to show what Scripture teaches on the subject.

   The first is Zechariah 9:11, "As for thee also, BY THE BLOOD OF THY
   COVENANT I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no
   water." Blood here is declared to be the cause of deliverance,--the
   blood of the covenant; as if without this covenanted blood-shedding
   there could be no setting free of the prisoner. The blood goes in, the
   prisoner comes out. The blood touches his chain, and it falls off. The
   blood drops on the prison-bar, and the gate flies open. It is blood
   that does it all; blood whose virtue is recognised by God; blood whose
   effects and results are embraced in the everlasting covenant; the
   covenant of peace, the covenant of deliverance, the covenant of
   liberty, the covenant of life. But let us look more closely at the
   language of the prophet.

   The words "as for thee also," or "thou also," are the very words of our
   Lord, when weeping over Jerusalem; "Even thou," thou, the guiltiest of
   the guilty, the most undeserving and unloveable of all. Thus our text
   starts with a declaration of the great love of God,--Messiah's love to
   Israel,-- "Yea, He loved the people." "God is love," runs through this
   whole passage; and "where sin abounded grace did much more abound."

   To this passage the apostle seems to refer in Hebrews 13:20, as to the
   bringing up Christ from the dead by the blood of the everlasting
   covenant. The prophet's words were fulfilled in Christ's resurrection,
   as Hosea's (11:1) were in his return from Egypt. (See also Psalm 18 and
   40)

   The words of Zechariah shall yet be fulfilled in Israel. The day of
   deliverance for the beloved nation is surely coming. She shall know the
   power of the covenant-blood to protect, to deliver, to save, to bless.
   It is not simply "blood" expiating sin in general, but
   "covenant-blood," linking that expiation specially to Israel, and
   Israel to it. It is passover- blood, bringing out of Egypt. Passing
   over this, however, let us take up the words in their widest sense. Let
   us see what the covenant-blood can do, not for Israel only, but for us.

   The blood finds us "prisoners," captives, "lawful captives," exiles. It
   finds us righteously condemned, sold to our enemies, under wrath. Let
   us see what it does for us.

   1. It removes the necessity for imprisonment. Such a necessity did
   exist. Law must take its course. Its claims must be satisfied. No
   leaving the prison till the uttermost farthing has been paid. The blood
   has made the satisfaction. It has met the claim. It has provided for
   the payment of the penalty. The necessity for the imprisonment no
   longer exists. The law consents.

   2. It makes it right for God to deliver. Deliverance must be the work
   of righteousness, not of Almightiness alone. It was righteousness that
   sent the sinner to prison, and barred the door against all exit. It is
   righteousness that must bring him forth; and this righteousness is
   secured by the blood of the covenant. It is now as unrighteous to
   detain the captive, as before it would have been unrighteous to bring
   him forth.

   3. It opens the prison-door. That door is locked, and barred, and
   guarded. No skill can open it, no force can unbar it, no money can
   bribe its guards. It cannot be opened by the earthquake, or the fire,
   or the lightning. Only righteousness can open it; and that
   prison-opening righteousness comes through the blood of the covenant;
   the great blood-shedding makes the prison-gates fly open; it rolls away
   the stone.

   4. It makes it safe for the prisoner to come forth. For the avenger
   stands without, on the watch. He has a right to be there. He has a
   right to seize the prisoner, and to take vengeance. But the blood stays
   all this. The covenant-blood conducts the prisoner forth, and the sight
   of it bids the avenger flee. That avenger was the executioner of guilt,
   and the guilt is gone. The blood has removed that which gave him power.
   He sees the blood, and withdraws his hand.

   5. It reconciles to God. It is the blood of propitiation, the blood of
   atonement. It makes up the variance between the sinner and God. It
   removes the ground of distance and dispeace. It brings nigh those that
   were afar off, by making distance no longer a righteous necessity, and
   nearness a thing of which the law approves, and in which God delights.
   It is reconciling blood.

   6. It redeems. "Thou hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood." It is the
   ransom or purchase-money. It was necessary that the sinner, sold and
   imprisoned, should be bought back again at a price such as would
   satisfy law and justice. And the blood has been found to be ample
   payment,--the very ransom needed by those whom death had made captive.

   7. It cleanses. We are washed from our sins in this covenant-blood; our
   robes are washed white in the blood of the Lamb. All that sin had done
   this blood undoes. All its pollution this blood washes away. It is
   purifying blood; and, as such, it fits for worship, for drawing near to
   God.

   8. It pacifies. It comes into contact with the sinner's conscience, and
   removes the sense of guilt,-- takes away the terror. The soul is at
   peace, and is kept in peace by this blood. "He has made peace by the
   blood of His cross."

   Let these things suffice to show the power of the covenant-blood. Such
   it was, such it is, such it will be.

   It is as efficacious as ever. It has lost none of its power. Age does
   not change it, nor repeated use weaken its efficacy. It can still do
   all it once did for the sinner. Its potency is divine.

   It is as sufficient, as suitable, as free, as near as ever. He whose
   blood it is comes up to each of us, and presents it to us in all its
   fulness and power. Take it as it is presented, and all the benefits of
   this covenant-blood forthwith become yours; and though you may be the
   unworthiest of the unworthy, you are reckoned by God clean every whit;
   a forgiven sinner, a delivered prisoner, a saved man.

   The second passage to which I would refer is Hebrews 10:19:-- "Having
   therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest (or literally
   'the holies' 'or holy places') by the blood of Jesus; by a new and
   living way which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is
   to say his flesh; and having an High Priest over the house of God, let
   us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our
   hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with
   pure water."

   As in the former passage, so in this, it is only a brief sketch that I
   can here give; not attempting to expound the words or illustrate the
   argument, but to bring out the emboldening of which the apostle speaks
   in connection with the blood. Deliverance by the blood was the idea of
   the former passage; boldness by the blood is the idea of this. The
   boldness comes to us from what that blood reveals to us of God, and of
   the way in which He has met the sinner and provided for his entrance
   into the sanctuary as a worshipper.

   It is not so much doctrine that the apostle delivers to us in his
   Epistles, as "the fulness of Christ," that fulness as supplying the
   sinner's wants and as bringing him into that relationship to God, which
   God's purpose of redemption designed, and which was needful for the
   sinner's blessedness.

   God's full provision in Christ for us as sinners is continually brought
   before us; and we are invited to avail ourselves of it. The provision
   for the removal of wrath, for pardon, for reconciliation, for service,
   is fully detailed, that we may know the "manifold grace of God" and
   "the unsearchable riches of Christ." For instance:--

   In the Epistle to the Romans we have the provision in Christ fitting us
   for work:--viz., that righteousness of God which delivers us from
   condemnation and sets us free to serve or work for Him who hath
   delivered us: and in the last chapter of that epistle we have the list
   of a noble band of apostolic workers.

   In the Epistle to the Ephesians we have the provision for
   conflict:--viz, the being filled with the Spirit and His gifts, that we
   may wrestle against principalities and powers. The armour and weapons
   for the warfare are described in the concluding chapter.

   In the Epistle to the Hebrews we have the provision for worship. For
   God is seeking worshippers, and He has made provision for making such.
   It is to worship that He calls us in this epistle; and He points to
   that which enables us to become acceptable worshippers:--to that which,
   so soon as it is understood and believed, turns the chief of sinners
   and the farthest off of prodigals into an acceptable and happy
   worshipper.

   He assumes that "boldness" or "confidence" is essential to this: and
   this boldness has been provided. There is, 1. the open door of the
   sanctuary; 2. liberty to enter; 3. boldness in drawing near to God; 4.
   access to all the courts; for the expression is not simply "the
   holiest" but "the holy places"; as if we had the fullest right to every
   part of the sanctuary, the full range of the holy places.

   This boldness is the opposite of dread, and darkness, and suspicion,
   and uncertainty. It is not merely the reversal of Adam's flying from
   God into the trees of the garden, but it is the entire removal of all
   sense of danger, or fear of unacceptableness,-- nay, it is the
   importation of childlike and unhesitating confidence, in virtue of
   which we go in without trembling and without blushing; for God's
   provision is so ample that in going into His courts and going up to His
   throne we are neither afraid nor ashamed. All that would have produced
   such feelings has been taken away. This boldness is effected,

   1. By something without us. It is not anything within us,--our
   evidences, or experiences, or feelings; not even our regeneration, and
   our being conscious of the Spirit's work in us. It is entirely by
   something without us,--the blood of Jesus.

   2. By something in the heavens. It is into the heaven of heavens that
   we are to enter in worshipping God; and that which gives us boldness in
   entering there, must be something which has been presented there, as
   the apostle says,-- "the heavenly things themselves by better
   sacrifices than these." The blood was shed on earth, but presented in
   heaven; Christ entered in with His own blood.

   3. By something about which there can be no mistake. The question as to
   the existence of the blood or its being presented in heaven, is settled
   once for all on the authority of God. We need not reason about it. God
   has told us that it has been done. As to our own feelings there may be
   many mistakes; but as to the presentation of the blood, there can be no
   doubt and no mistake. It is a certainty; and on that certainty we rest.

   4. By something which shows that the ground of dread is removed. The
   dread arose from the thought, 1. I am guilty; 2. God must be my enemy;
   3. I dare not come near him; 4. He must condemn me. The blood of Jesus
   meets these causes of terror, and shows the provision which God has
   made for the removal of them all. The sight of the blood dispels my
   terror and relieves my conscience, and says, Be of good cheer. For it
   shows the penalty paid by a substitute,--the full penalty; a divine
   life given in room of a human life, the wages of sin paid by the death
   of a divine substitute.

   5. By something which God has accepted. God has accepted the blood! He
   raised Him whose blood it is; and this was acceptance. He set Him on
   His throne at His right hand. This is acceptance. He presents him as
   the Lamb slain. This is acceptance. He has testified to His acceptance
   of it. It is blood which God has accepted for that pardon and cleansing
   and reconciling that we preach; blood by which law is magnified and
   righteousness exalted.

   6. By something which glorifies God. That blood- shedding glorifies
   Him. The sinner's admission and entrance glorifies Him,--glorifies Him
   more than his exclusion and banishment and death. The blood by which
   God is thus glorified in receiving the sinner, must give boldness. I am
   going in to glorify God; and my going in will glorify Him, in
   consequence of that blood,--this cannot but embolden me.

   7. By something which tells that God wants my worship. God came down
   seeking worshippers. He wants your worship,--this is His message. That
   tabernacle says He wants you as a worshipper. That laver, blood,
   incense, mercy-seat, all say He wants you as a worshipper. He is in
   earnest in seeking you to worship Him. He wants you to come in and
   serve in His courts,- -as a priest!

   We go in through the open gate, the rent veil: by the new and living
   way, the blood-dropped pavement. Personally we are sprinkled from an
   evil conscience; i.e., at the altar; our bodies are washed, i.e., at
   the laver. Thus there are such things as the following, resulting from
   all this.

   1. Liberty of conscience. I mean liberty of conscience before God. A
   "good conscience" comes to us through the blood upon the mercy-seat. A
   conscience void of offence before men we may have in other ways, but
   only in this can all have a conscience void of offence before the
   Searcher of hearts. It is the blood which purges the conscience from
   dead works, as did the water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer
   cleanse the Israelite who had touched a dead body. By the blood the
   "true heart" comes.

   2. Confident approach to God. Instead of flying from God, we turn to
   Him. Instead of trembling as we cross the threshold of His sanctuary,
   we lift up our heads like those who know that only here are they on
   secure ground,--like the flying manslayer entering the gate of the
   Refuge City. The blood removes the dread, and makes us feel safe even
   under the holy light of the glory. We are protected by the blood; we
   are comforted by the blood: for this blood casteth out all fear.

   3. Happy intercourse. A sinner's fellowship with God must be carried on
   through the blood. That blood was meant to remove everything that would
   have hindered communion; or that would have kept God at a distance from
   the sinner, and the sinner at a distance from God. But it is not merely
   that we are brought nigh by the blood of Christ; we are brought nigh in
   the fulness of a tranquil spirit, which feels that it can now unbosom
   itself to God, in the certainty of confiding love. Fear has been
   supplanted by joy. The intercourse is the intercourse of trusting happy
   hearts, pouring out their love into each other; and the Spirit bears
   witness to the blood in this respect, by imparting the childlike frame,
   and teaching us to cry Abba Father.

   4. Spiritual service. There seems nothing spiritual in the blood; and
   yet without the blood spiritual service is an impossibility. Abel's
   sacrifice seemed a more carnal thing than Cain's offering of the
   choicest fruits of Eden, yet it was in Abel's that God recognised the
   spirituality and the acceptable service. It is the blood which divests
   us of that externalism which cleaves to the service of the
   sinner,--which strips us of a hollow ritualism; which turns death into
   life, hollowness into substance, and unreality into truth. Spiritual
   service has ever been connected with the blood-shedding of atonement,
   which by its appeal to the inner man, draws out the whole spiritual
   being in happy obedience and willing devoted service.

   5. Holy worship. Holiness is not associated with darkness, or gorgeous
   rites, or glittering robes, or fragrant incense, or swelling music, or
   a magnificent temple, or an unnumbered multitude. All these may be
   unholy things, hateful to God. There may be the absence of all these,
   and yet there may be holy worship: the worship of holy lips; the
   worship of holy hands; the worship of holy knees; the worship of a holy
   soul. It is the blood that consecrates; whether it be man or place,
   whether it be voice or soul. That which is presented to God must have
   passed through the blood, else it is unholy, however imposing and
   splendid. If it has come through the blood, it is holy, however small
   and mean and poor. All worship is unclean save that which has been
   sanctified by the blood. All holy worship begins with the blood, and is
   carried on by means of the blood. We go within the rent veil to
   worship, not without blood. For it is the blood which sprinkled on the
   worshipper makes him first, and then his worship, acceptable. This is
   "entire consecration."

  Chapter 9.

God Seeking Worshippers.

   For ages before God sought a temple, He had been seeking worshippers.
   He could do without the former, but not without the latter.

   His first sanctuary was but a tent; and three thousand years had
   elapsed before He said, Build me a house wherein I may dwell. Yet all
   this time He was seeking for worshippers amongst the sons of men. By
   man's sin God had lost the worship of earth, and He had set Himself to
   regain it.

   1. He wants LOVE. Being the infinitely loveable God, He asks love from
   man--from every man; love according to His worth and beauty.

   2. He claims OBEDIENCE. For His will is the fountainhead of all law;
   and He expects that this will of His should be in all things conformed
   to.

   3. He expects SERVICE. The willing and living service of man's whole
   being is what He claims and desires,--the service of body, soul, and
   spirit.

   4. He asks for WORSHIP. He does not stand in need of human praise or
   prayer; yet He asks for these, He delights in these, He wants the inner
   praise of the silent heart. He wants the uttered praise of the fervent
   lip and tongue. He desires the solitary praise of the closet; and still
   more the loud harmony of the great congregation; for "the Lord loveth
   the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob," (Psa 87:2).
   True praise is a "speaking well of God", (1 Peter 1:3), speaking of Him
   in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, according to His excellency.
   "Bless the Lord, O my soul" (Psa 103:1), "Blessed be the God and Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Eph 1:3).

   It was of "worship" that the Lord spoke so much to the woman of Sychar.
   To Nicodemus He said nothing of this; nor indeed to any others. It was
   in regard to "worship" that the Samaritans had gone so far astray,
   therefore He speaks specially of this,--even to this poor profligate.
   He spoke to her of "the Father," and of "the worship of the Father"
   (John 4:21); reminding her that God was a spirit and that "they who
   worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth." And then He adds
   these memorable words, "the Father seeketh such to worship Him."

   It was of the difference between outward and inward religion, between
   the real and the unreal, between the acceptable and the unacceptable,
   that He spoke to the woman. Samaria and Jerusalem, Gerizzim and Moriah,
   these were but external things. There was no religious virtue connected
   with them; God is not the God of the outward, but of the inward; not
   the God of places, but of living creatures; not the God of cities and
   mountains, but the God of hearts and souls. No rites, however numerous
   or gorgeous or beautiful, can be a substitute for the life and the
   spirit. The question is not intellectual, or aesthetic, or pictorial,
   but spiritual; not as to what gratifies our eye or ear, our sense of
   the great or the tasteful, but what is acceptable to God and according
   to His instructions.

   Where am I to worship God? man asks; but he answers it in his own way;
   as all false religions, and indeed some true ones, have done. On
   certain sacred spots, he says, where some man of God has lived, where
   some martyr's blood has been shed, where the footsteps of good men are
   recorded to have been, which have been consecrated by certain priestly
   rites,--there and there only must men worship God. God's answer to the
   question, Where am I to worship God? is, EVERYWHERE: on sea and land,
   vale or hill, desert or garden, city or village or moor,--anywhere and
   everywhere. For certain purposes God set apart Sinai for a season, and
   then Moriah; but not to the exclusion of other places. And even these
   consecrations are at an end. Sinai is but the old red granite hill,--no
   more,--where now no man worships. Moriah is but the old limestone
   platform, now desecrated by false worship. "Woman, believe me, the hour
   cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
   worship the Father" (John 4:21).

   When am I to worship God? man asks; but he answers it in his own way
   also. Only at certain times, he says,--certain hours, and certain days,
   fixed and arranged by priestly authority, or ecclesiastical law, or
   traditional rule. God's answer is, "at all times and seasons": pray
   without ceasing. The naming of certain hours and days is necessary for
   the gathering together of the worshippers; but worship is to be
   perpetual, without restriction of times. All hours are holy; all days
   are holy, in so far as worship is concerned; only one day having been
   specially appointed of God, and that not for restriction but for order.

   How am I to worship God? man asks; and he has answered it also in his
   own way. In the gorgeous temple, in the pillared cathedral, with
   incense, and vestments, and forms, and ceremonies, and processions, and
   postures, he says. [14] But these performances are the will-worship of
   self-righteousness, not the obedient service of men worshipping God in
   ways of His own ordination. Man cannot teach man how to worship God.
   When he tries it he utterly fails. He distorts worship; he
   misrepresents God, and he indulges his own sensuous or self-righteous
   tastes. His "dim religious light" is but a reflection of his own gloomy
   spirit, and an ignorant misrepresentation of Him "who is light, and in
   whom is no darkness at all." God's answer to man's question is given in
   the Lord's words, "they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and
   in truth." The vestments may or may not be comely; that matters not.
   The music may or may not be fine: the knees may or may not be bent; the
   hands may or may not be clasped; the place of worship may or may not be
   a cathedral, or a consecrated fabric. These are immaterial things;
   adjuncts of religion, not its essence. The true worship is that of the
   inner man; and all things else are of little moment. As it is with love
   so it is with worship. The heart is everything. God can do without the
   bended knee, but not without the broken heart.

   It is of the Father that Christ is here speaking;--of Him whose name is
   not only God but Father, [15] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. As the fountainhead of all being in heaven and in earth, the
   paternal Creator, the Father of spirits, the great Father-spirit, the
   God of the spirits of all flesh, whom the heaven of heavens cannot
   contain, yet who visiteth earth in His fatherly love,--as such He is
   here spoken of by our Lord. He is a spirit, yet He is no vague or cold
   abstraction, no mere assemblage of what we call attributes, but full of
   life and love; with the heart of a Father, with the pity and power and
   care of a Father, and also with all a Father's resources and rights.
   Though we have broken off from that Father and gone into the far
   country, that does not change His paternal nature, though it alters our
   relationship to Him and the treatment we are to receive at His hands.
   He made the fatherly heart of man, and He did so after the likeness of
   His own. That fatherly heart yearns over His wandered family; "His
   tender mercies are over all His works."

   It is as Father that he is seeking worshippers, and seeking them here
   on earth among the fallen sons of men.

   He seeketh! That word means more than it seems. He is in search of
   something; of something which He has lost; of something which He counts
   precious; of something which He cannot afford to lose. Great as He is,
   there are many things which He cannot think of letting go. His very
   greatness makes Him needy for it makes Him understand the value, not
   only of every soul which He has formed, but of every atom of dust which
   He has created. When He misses any part of His creation He goes or
   sends in search of it; He will not part with it. Men of common souls,
   when they lose anything, are apt to say, Let it go, I can do without
   it. Men of great minds, when they lose anything, say, I must have it
   back again, I cannot afford to lose it. Much more is this true of the
   infinite Jehovah. It is His greatness that makes Him so susceptible of
   loss. Others may overlook the lost thing. He cannot. He must go in
   quest of it.

   It is the same kind of seeking and searching as the prophet Ezekiel,
   speaking in the name of Jehovah, declares,-- "I will search and seek,"
   (34:11); and to which our Lord so often refers, when He represents
   Himself as "seeking the lost" (Luke 19:10); it may be the lost sheep,
   or the lost piece of silver, or the lost son.

   We must not dilute these expressions, and say that they simply imply
   that God is willing to have us back again if we will come; that He is
   willing to take us as worshippers if we will come. All that comes very
   far short of the meaning. And though we may say, what can the infinite
   Jehovah be in want of; what can He need, to whom belongs not only the
   heaven of heavens but the whole universe;--still we must see how
   anxious He is to show us His unutterable earnestness in seeking and in
   searching.

   Such is the attitude of God! He bends down from His eternal throne to
   seek; as if the want of something here on earth, on this old sinful
   earth, would be a grievous and irreparable loss. What value does He
   attach to us and to our worship!

   Yes, the Father seeketh worshippers! He is in search of many things of
   which sin has robbed Him; affection, homage, allegiance, reverence,
   obedience; but worship,--the worship of man, and of man's earth, He is
   specially seeking and claiming. He so created this world, that from it
   there should arise, without ceasing, wide as the universal air, that
   fragrance of holy worship, from the creatures which He had made and
   placed upon its surface. The command is not merely, "Thou shalt love
   the Lord thy God with all thy heart," but "thou shalt worship the Lord
   thy God and Him only shalt thou serve." Over this broken command He
   mourns; "it grieves Him at His heart"; and He seeks to have it restored
   in man. He loves worship from human hearts and lips, and He will not be
   satisfied without it. It might seem a small thing to lose the worship
   of a creature's heart, here on this low and evil earth. Can He not let
   it go? It will only be the worse for the creature, not for Him, who has
   the worship of heaven, and of ten thousand times ten thousand angels.
   No; He cannot lose that worship. It is precious to Him. He must have it
   back.

   O man, God speaks to you and says, "Worship me." He comes up to each
   sinner upon earth and says, "Worship me." If He does so, He must care
   for you and He must care for your worship. It is not a matter of
   indifference to Him whether you worship Him or not. It concerns Him,
   and it concerns you. Perhaps the thought comes up within you, what does
   God care for my worship? I may praise, or I may not, what does He care?
   I may sing, or I may blaspheme, what does it matter to Him? He cares
   much. It concerns Him deeply. He is thoroughly in earnest when He asks
   you to worship Him. He wants these lips of yours, that tongue of yours,
   that heart of yours. He wants them all for Himself. Will you give Him
   what He wants?

   You say He has enough of praise in heaven, what can he want on earth?
   He has angels in myriads to praise Him, does He really desire my voice?
   Will He be grieved if I refuse it? Yes, He desires your voice, and He
   will be grieved if you withhold it. He has many a nobler tongue than
   yours, but still He wants yours. He has many a sweeter voice than
   yours, still He is bent on having that poor sinful voice. Oh come and
   worship me, He says.

   This answers the question so often put by the inquiring, What warrant
   have I for coming to God. God wants you. Is not that enough? What more
   would you have? He wants you to draw near. He has no pleasure in your
   distance. He wants you to praise Him, to worship Him. He is seeking
   your worship. Do you mean to ask, What warrant have I for worshipping
   God? Rather should you ask, What warrant have I for refusing to worship
   Him? Is it possible that you can think yourself at liberty not to
   worship Him; nay, think that you are not under any obligation to
   worship Him, until you can ascertain your election, or feel within you
   some special change which you can consider God's call to worship Him?

   His search for worshippers is a world-wide one. It goes over the whole
   earth; and His call on men to worship is equally universal. He made man
   to worship and to love; can He ever forego such claims, or can man ever
   be in a position in which that claim ceases, or that obligation is
   cancelled? Can his sinfulness or unworthiness exempt him from the duty,
   or make it unwarrantable in him to come and worship Jehovah?

   Let us hear how He speaks to the sons of men, Jew and Gentile:-- "Make
   a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands! Sing forth the honour of His
   name, Make His praise glorious." (Psa 66:1)

   Again He speaks,-- "O sing unto the Lord a new song; Sing unto the
   Lord, all the earth! Sing unto the Lord, Bless His name! Show forth His
   salvation from day to day." (Psa 96:1)

   Again He speaks,-- "Praise ye the Lord! For it is good to sing praises
   unto our God; For it is pleasant; Yea, praise is comely." (Psa 147:1)

   Nay, He calls on all nature to praise Him. He claims the homage of the
   inanimate creation. "Let the heavens rejoice, And let the earth be
   glad; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be
   joyful, and all that is therein; Then shall the trees of the wood
   rejoice Before the Lord." (Psa 96:11-13)

   Thus is God seeking for worshippers here on earth. And what is His
   gospel but the proclamation of His gracious search for worshippers? He
   sends out His glad tidings of great joy, that He may draw men to
   Himself and make them worshippers of His own glorious self.

   The shepherd loses one of his flock; and he misses it. The shepherd
   misses the sheep more than the sheep misses the shepherd. The sheep is
   too precious to be lost. It must be sought for and found; whatever toil
   or peril may be in the way. Even life itself is not to be grudged in
   behalf of the lost one, "The good Shepherd giveth His life for the
   sheep," as if the life of the sheep were more valuable than that of the
   Shepherd.

   The woman loses one of her ten silver pieces, she cannot afford to lose
   it. She must have it back again. She seeks till she find it. It does
   not miss her, but she misses it. She seeks and finds!

   The father loses his son; and is troubled. The son may not miss the
   father, but the father misses the son; nor can he rest till he has
   taken him in his arms again, and set him down at his table with
   gladness and feasting.

   But the passage we are considering brings before us something beyond
   all this. It is not the shepherd seeking his sheep, nor the woman her
   silver, nor the father his son; it is Jehovah seeking worshippers! and
   He is in earnest. He wants to be worshipped by the sons of Adam. He
   desires the worship of earth no less than that of heaven. He has the
   praise of angels, but He must have that of men. Such is the value He
   sets upon us, and such is His love?

   But it is spiritual worship, and spiritual worshippers that He is
   seeking: "The Father seeketh such to worship Him." The outward man is
   nothing, it is the inner man He is in quest of. The worship must come,
   not from the walls of the temple, but from the innermost shrine. It
   must be something pervading the man's whole being, and coming up from
   the depths of the soul; otherwise, it is but as sounding brass or a
   tinkling cymbal. Forms, sounds, gestures, dresses, ornaments, are not
   worship. They are but

   "Mouth-honour breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny, but dare
   not."

   Instead of constituting worship, these outward things are often but
   excuses for refusing the inward service. Man pleases himself with a
   sensuous and theatrical externalism, because he hates the spiritual and
   the true. God says, "Give me thine heart." Man says, "No; but I will
   give you my voice." God says, "Give me thy soul." Man says, "No; but I
   will give Thee my knee and my bended body." But it will not do. "God is
   a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in
   truth."

   But what provision has God made for all this? It is not enough to say
   to us, "Be worshippers,"--this might be said to the unsinning, and they
   would at once comply. "Let all the angels of God worship Him." But say
   this to a sinner, and he will ask, "How can I, a man of unclean lips
   and unclean heart, approach the infinitely holy One? It would not be
   safe in me to come, nor would it be right in God to allow me to
   approach." There must be provision for this;-- something which will
   satisfy the sinner's conscience, remove the sinner's dread, win the
   sinner's confidence, on the one hand, and satisfy God, vindicate
   righteousness, magnify holiness, on the other.

   For this there is the twofold provision of the blood and the Spirit.
   The blood satisfies God's righteousness and the sinner's conscience.
   The Holy Spirit renews the man, so as to draw out his heart in worship.
   It is the blood that propitiates, and it is the Spirit that transforms.
   God presents this blood freely to the sinner; God proclaims His desire
   to give this Spirit freely.

   "May I use this blood?" perhaps one says. Use it! Certainly. Thou fool,
   why shouldst thou ask such a question? Use it! Yes; for thou must
   either use it, or trample on it. Which of these wilt thou do?

   "May I expect the Spirit?" some one may say. Expect Him! What! art thou
   more willing to have the Spirit than God is to give Him? Art thou so
   willing, and God so unwilling? Thou fool, who has persuaded thee to
   believe such a lie?

   God has come to thee, O man! saying, "I want thee for a worshipper":
   wilt thou become one? Remember, thou must either be a worshipper or a
   blasphemer; which wilt thou be?

   [14] These are defended on the ground that they teach certain truths.
   But worship is not for teaching; it is for the taught. To multiply
   teaching and symbols is to injure worship; for teaching is not worship,
   and worship is not teaching.

   [15] The name Father occurs but seldom in the Old Testament; and not in
   the same sense as that in which our Lord here uses it. In such places
   as Deuteronomy 32:6, Isaiah 63:16, 64:8, Jeremiah 31:9, the word refers
   specially to Jehovah's relationship to Israel, as head of the family;
   but in our Lord's words the reference is to the great spiritual
   Fatherhead inherent in His nature, as the invisible God, Jehovah, the
   being of beings, God over all, head and parent of the universe: not in
   the modern sense of an equal fatherhood, into the possession of which
   every man is born; but in the sense contained in the words "we are His
   offspring" (Acts 17:28), and "in Him we live, and move, and have our
   being."

  Chapter 10.

God Seeking Temples.

   God began with seeking worshippers, but he goes on to seek temples; or
   rather, in the sense which we are now to consider, in seeking
   worshippers he was seeking temples; and in preparing worshippers, he
   was preparing temples.

   The Church is the great temple. Each saint is a temple. In His Church,
   and in each member of that Church, Jehovah dwells. "Ye are builded
   together for AN HABITATION OF GOD through the Spirit" (Eph 2:22).

   Man was made for God to dwell in. Man thrust God out of His
   dwelling-place, and left Him homeless; without a habitation on earth.
   The universe was His; every star was His; every mountain was His: but
   none of these did He count fit to be His habitation. Only in the human
   heart would He be satisfied to dwell.

   Man thrust out God from His dwelling, but God would not be thus driven
   away. He must return; and He must return in a way which would make it
   impossible that He should ever be thrust out again; and He must return
   in a way such as will show not only the hatefulness of man's sin in
   thrusting Him out, but the largeness of His own grace, and the
   perfection of His righteousness.

   Jehovah is bent upon returning to His old dwelling-place. He might have
   created others, and dwelt in them. But He has purposed not to part with
   His old ones. It is as if He could not afford to lose these, or could
   not bear the thought of casting them away. "I will return," He says. He
   casts a wistful eye upon the ruins of His beloved dwelling-place, and
   He resolves to return and rebuild, and re-inhabit. [16]

   When the Son of God was here, He had no place to lay His head. He was a
   homeless man in the midst of earth's many homes. But still He did come,
   seeking a home, both for Himself and for the Father. The home that He
   sought was the human heart; and He came with this message from the
   Father,-- "I will dwell in them." To this closed heart He comes, in
   loving earnestness, seeking entrance, that He may find for Himself and
   for the Father a home. Thus He speaks: "Behold, I stand at the door and
   knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto
   him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Rev 3:20); and again He
   speaks, "We will come unto him, and make our abode with him" (John
   14:23). So that this is our message to the sons of men,--the Father
   wants your heart for His dwelling,--the Son wants your heart for His
   dwelling.

   But it is for more than dwelling that God is seeking. It is for a
   temple. To dwell in us, in any sense, would be infinite honour and
   blessedness. But to take us for His temples, to make us His Holy of
   Holies, His shrine of worship, His place of praise, His very heaven of
   heavens, is something beyond all this. Yet it is temples that God is
   now seeking among the sons of men; not marble shrines, nor golden
   altars, with fire, and blood, and incense, and gorgeous adornings; but
   the spirit of man, the broken and the contrite heart.

   The Church is God's temple. "In whom ALL THE BUILDING, fitly framed
   together, groweth into AN HOLY TEMPLE in the Lord" (Eph 2:21). Each
   saint is God's temple. "Ye are the temple of God" (1 Cor 3:16). Our
   body is God's temple. "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the
   Holy Ghost" (1 Cor 6:19). [17]

   God is seeking temples on earth,--living temples, constructed of living
   stones, founded on the one living stone,-- "built up a spiritual house"
   (1 Peter 2:5).

   Of this temple God is Himself the Architect, and the Holy Spirit is the
   BUILDER. It is constructed after the pattern of heavenly things,
   according to the great eternal plan, which the purpose of the God, only
   wise, had designed for the manifestation of His own glory. As both the
   Architect and Builder are divine, we may be sure that the plan will be
   perfect, and that it will be carried out in all its details without
   failure, and without mistake. It will be beauty, completeness, and
   perfection throughout,--a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle, or
   any such thing; in size, in symmetry, in ornament, in majesty, in
   stability, altogether faultless,--the mightiest and the fairest of all
   the works of Jehovah's hands.

   In another sense, hereafter, when all things are made new, "the Lord
   God Almighty and the Lamb" are the temple (Rev 21:22). But we also are
   the temple; both now and hereafter. Both things are true. He in us, and
   we in Him. We are God's temple, and He is ours for ever.

   The foundation is Christ Himself (1 Cor 3:11; Isa 28:16; 1 Peter
   2:4-6). He is the rock on which we are builded; He is no less the
   foundation-stone which bears up the building, and knits its walls
   together. In the eternal plan of the divine Architect, this
   foundation-stone is grandly prominent,--the chief part of God's eternal
   purpose; framed by God; laid by God in the fulness of time; laid in
   Zion; laid once for all: a sure foundation, a tried stone; one, without
   a rival and without a second. It was this stone, laid by God, which the
   apostle (if we may carry out the figure which he uses in connection
   with his own ministry) carried about with him from place to place, when
   he went through the gentile world founding churches. "According to the
   grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I have
   laid THE FOUNDATION...For other foundation can no man lay than that is
   laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 3:10,11). On this foundation each
   soul rests. From the first saint, downward to the last, it has been and
   it shall be so. There is but one foundation for Old Testament saints as
   well as for new. On this, too, the Church of God rests; the one Church
   from the beginning, the one body, the one temple, filled with the one
   Spirit, for the worship of the one Jehovah. Not two foundations, nor
   two temples, nor two bodies, nor two Churches; but ONE, only one, made
   up of the redeemed from among men, bought with the one blood, justified
   with the one righteousness, saved by the one cross, expectants of the
   one promise, and heirs of the one glory.

   The stones are the saints, (1 Peter 2:5) "Unto whom coming as unto a
   living stone, ye also as lively (living) stones, are built up a
   spiritual house." Of the quarrying, the hewing, the polishing, the
   building, of these living stones I cannot here write. But each has a
   history of his own. Though dug out of one rock, hewn, polished and
   fitted in by one Spirit, yet each has come to be what he is by means of
   a different process, some longer, some shorter, some gentler, some
   rougher. But on the one foundation, they are all placed by the one
   hand, one upon the other, in goodly order, according to the one eternal
   plan in Christ Jesus our Lord; forming the one glorious temple for
   Jehovah's worship and habitation. Many stones, one temple; many
   members, one family; many branches, one vine; many crumbs, one loaf.
   They are "BUILDED TOGETHER for an habitation of God through the
   Spirit." The "unity of the faith," (Eph 4:13), from the beginning is
   the pledge of the unity of the temple; and as this faith has been one
   since the day of the announcement of the woman's seed, so has this
   temple been; the multitude of stones not marring but enhancing the
   unity. The "unity of the Spirit," too, (Eph 4:3), is both the pattern
   and the pledge of the temple's unity. It has been one spirit and one
   temple from the beginning; not two spirits and two temples, but only
   one. "There is one body and one spirit, even as ye are called in one
   hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
   Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all." Thus
   all the "building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in
   the Lord" (Eph 2:21). God is now seeking these stones for His temple
   among the lost sons of Adam. Worthless and unfit in themselves for use
   in any divine building, they are sought out and prepared by the great
   Builder for their place in the eternal building. Yes, God is in search
   of these stones now; just as He has been these many ages, since Adam,
   and Abel, and Seth, and Enoch, and Noah, were sought out nd fitted in
   to form the glorious line or row of stones lying immediately above the
   foundation-stone. God is coming up to each son of man, degraded as he
   may be, an outcast, and saying, "Wilt thou not become a stone in my
   temple? I seek thee: wilt thou prefer thy degradation, and reject the
   honour which I present to thee."

   The temple is holy (1 Cor 3:17; Psa 93:5). It is set apart for God; it
   is to be used for sacred purposes; it is pure in all its parts; its
   vessels, its walls, its gates, its furniture. It is not yet perfect,
   but it shall one day be so. Into it nothing that defileth shall enter.
   And even now God, the inhabitant of the temple, is seeking holiness of
   all who belong to it. "Be ye holy, for I am holy."

   Let us dread the defilement of His temple; for it is written, "If any
   man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy" (1 Cor 3:17). For
   God will not be mocked, nor allow His throne to be polluted. Yet do we
   not defile it by sin, by worldliness, by vanity, by formality, by
   profanity, by our unfragrant incense, our impure praises and prayers?

   Let us rejoice in the honour of being living temples, living stones,
   consecrated to the service of the living God. Let us walk worthy of the
   honour,--the honour of being filled with God, penetrated by His light,
   perfumed by His sweetness, gladdened by His love, and glorified by His
   majestic presence and indwelling fulness.

   [16] "The designation was most apt, of so excellent a creature, to this
   office and use, to be immediately sacred to Himself and His own
   converse: His temple and habitation, the mansion and residence of His
   presence and indwelling glory! There was nothing whereto he was herein
   designed whereof His nature was not capable. His soul was, after the
   required manner, receptive of a deity; its powers were competent to
   their appointed work and employment; it could entertain God by
   knowledge and contemplation of His glorious excellencies, by reverence
   and love, by adoration and praise. This was the highest kind of dignity
   whereto creature nature could be raised,--the most honourable state.
   How high and quick an advance! This moment nothing; the next, a being
   capable and full of God."-- Howe's Living Temple.

   [17] In all these passages the word used signifies the inner part or
   shrine of the building,--the holy place and the holy of holies. We are
   the holy of holies, where the cherubim dwelt, where Jehovah dwelt,
   where He is said to "dwell between the cherubim"; or as it really is,
   to "inhabit the cherubim"; the cherubim being His habitation. Into this
   inner shrine the blood was brought, but not the fire. The effects of
   the fire were there, the smoking incense, but not the fire itself; for
   into this sanctuary no wrath can enter. The wrath has been expended and
   exhausted outside; and this sanctuary is the abode of love and favour;
   they who belong to it have been delivered from wrath for ever. They are
   the monuments of exhausted wrath,--wrath which has spent itself upon
   another, and which has passed away from them for ever. I may notice
   that it was into the holy place, that Judas threw the pieces of
   silver,--going to the gate, and flinging them in among the priest as
   they were carrying on the service.

  Chapter 11.

God Seeking Priests.

   If God has a temple, He must have priests; else were there no song, no
   service, no worship. In His eternal plan, priesthood is provided for; a
   priesthood not of angels but of redeemed men; of those who seemed the
   least likely to fulfil such an office in such a temple.

   It is a "holy priesthood" that he has provided (1 Peter 2:5). It is a
   "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9); for He has made us kings and priests.
   It is a heavenly priesthood like that of His own Son.

   As such we minister at God's altar, we tread His courts, we eat His
   shew-bread, we kindle and trim His lamps, we offer His sacrifices, we
   burn His holy incense.

   God is seeking priests among the sons of men. A human priesthood is one
   of the essential parts of His eternal plan. To rule creation by man is
   His design; to carry on the worship of creation by man is no less part
   of His design.

   He is now in search of priests; and He has sent His Son to prepare such
   for His temple. In order to their being such, He must redeem them; He
   must reconcile them; He must cleanse them; He must clothe them with the
   garments of glory and of beauty. All this He does. "The Son of man came
   to seek and to save that which was lost."

   The embassy of peace which is going forth from the cross is an embassy
   in quest of priests. His ambassadors of peace beseech men to be
   reconciled to God in order to their becoming priests. God Himself in
   His glorious gospel comes up to the sinner and asks him to become a
   priest to Him.

   And what does this priesthood mean? What does it embrace? Let us
   consider this.

   Priesthood is the appointed link between heaven and earth; the channel
   of intercourse between the sinner and God. God and man can only come
   together on the ground of mediatory priesthood. Such a priesthood, in
   so far as expiation is concerned, is in the hands of the Son of God
   alone; in so far as it is to be the medium of communication between
   Creator and creature, is also in the hands of redeemed men,--of the
   Church of God.

   Sin had broken up all direct or open intercourse, as we have seen; and
   the veil declared this. All access to God was to be debarred till a new
   medium should be provided, such as should secure the ends of
   righteousness; such as should make it honourable for the Holy One to
   receive the unrighteous; and such as should make it safe for the unholy
   to stand in the presence of the Holy.

   Priesthood is the link between the sinner and God, between earth and
   heaven,--earth, where all is vile; heaven, where all is pure. Without
   priesthood, God and we are at awful and unremoveable distance from each
   other. Without priesthood, there can be no transference of guilt, no
   remission of sin, no reconciliation to God, no restoration either to
   fellowship or blessing. Priesthood involves and accomplishes all these,
   because it is through it that the substitution of life for life is
   effected. It is the conducting medium through whose agency the exchange
   is brought about between the sinner and the Surety. In nothing less
   than this does its purpose terminate, and wherein it falls short of
   this, it is but a pretext or a name. If priesthood be not the living
   link between God and the sinner, it is nothing.

   All this was exhibited in symbolic rite under the former law. It was
   through priesthood that all intercourse with God was carried on. It was
   the priest that led the sinner into God's presence, that presented his
   offering, that transacted the business between him and God, and that
   received the blessing from God to bestow upon the sinner. God set up
   the Aaronic priesthood on very purpose to exhibit this; to let men know
   what His idea of priesthood was, and what He intended a priest to be.

   True, this ancient priesthood had only to do with the flesh; it
   pertained but to the outward person of the sinner, and the mere visible
   courts of God. It could not reach the inner man; it could not take hold
   of the conscience; it could not lead the worshipper into the true
   presence of the invisible Jehovah. It fell short of these ends, and
   thus far was defective. Still, it did fully accomplish its end as a
   medium of communication, in so far as the outward man and the material
   courts were concerned. It was complete according to its nature; and in
   so far as it went, it established intercourse between the sinner and
   God.

   In so doing, it brought out most fully God's idea of priesthood, as if
   to prevent the possibility of any mistake upon the point. It showed
   God's ultimate design in regard to this; His intention of bringing in a
   perfect priesthood in His own time and way. His object was not to show
   men how to construct and set up a priesthood of their own, but to tell
   them what He Himself meant to do, so as to hinder their attempting such
   a thing. His object was to teach them the true meaning of priesthood,
   in order that when He brought in His own High Priest, they might fully
   understand the nature of His work, and the end to be accomplished. It
   was a new and a great idea that He sought to teach them, an idea which
   would never have occurred to themselves; an idea which it required long
   time to unfold to them; an idea most needful for them fully to grasp,
   as upon it depended the new relationship which grace was to introduce
   between them and God.

   But then when the old priestly ritual had thus served its ends, it was
   of no more use. It behoved to be taken down, as being more likely to
   hinder than help forward the sinner's intercourse with God, as being
   certain to confuse and perplex, and lead to innumerable mistakes in the
   great question of approach and acceptance. It was not to be imitated,
   for any imitation would but mislead men from the true priesthood. It
   was not to be set up in another form, for every part of it was merged,
   and, as it were, dissolved irrecoverably in the priesthood of the Son
   of God. The High Priest of good things to come had absorbed it all into
   Himself, so that any attempt to reconstruct it in any form is undoing
   what God has done; restoring what He Himself has taken to pieces;
   committing sacrilege with His holy vessels; nay, profaning with
   irreverent touch what He has removed out of sight, and forbidden to be
   handled or used.

   So far, then, is the old ritual from being a model or example for us
   now, that it forbids the attempt to imitate its rites. Its very nature,
   so purely symbolic and prospective, forbids such an attempt. Its
   abolition still more strongly prohibits this. For that abolition is
   God's proclamation that its ends are served, and its time accomplished.
   But specially its abolition, through fulfilment in the person of
   Messiah, declares this. Before it was cast away, everything in it that
   was of value was gathered out of it, and perpetuated in Him. Every
   truth that it contained was taken from it, and embodied in Him. It did
   not pass away simply because its time had come, but because the need
   for it had ceased; it had been superseded by something infinitely more
   glorious in its nature, and more suitable to the sinner. Who thinks of
   preserving the sand when the gold that it contained has been extracted?
   or who misses the beacon-light when the sun has risen?

   The coming of the Son of God, the Great High Priest, thus involves the
   abolition of priesthood in the old sense, for He has taken it wholly
   upon Himself: it is now centred in Him. All the ends of priesthood are
   fully met by Him. There is not one thing which we need either as
   sinners or as worshippers which we have not in Him. So that the
   question arises, What end can it serve to set up another priesthood
   apart from His? Has He left anything incomplete which ought to be
   completed by us? Has He left any of the distance unremoved between us
   and God? Has He left the work of atonement, and mediation, and
   intercession, in such a state of imperfection, that we require a new
   priestly order to perfect it? If not, then is it not strange profanity,
   as well as perversity in man, to insist upon setting up what is so
   wholly unnecessary, and what cannot but cast dishonour upon the divine
   priesthood of Messiah as being imperfect in itself, and as having
   failed in its ends?

   In the present age, then, there are none on earth exercising priestly
   functions. There is ministry, but not priesthood. The apostles were not
   priests. They never claimed the office, and never sought to exercise it
   in the Church. Nor did they enjoin their successors to claim it, nor
   give them the slightest hint that, as ministers, they were priests.
   They taught them that priesthood had passed away; that the priestly
   raiment had been rent in pieces; that there was no longer any temple,
   or altar, or sacrifice needed upon earth under this dispensation. The
   epistle to the Hebrews gives the lie to all priestly pretensions, and
   the epistles to Timothy and Titus show how totally different ministry
   is from priesthood.

   Yet we read of the "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9); we read of "kings
   and priests"; we read of those who claimed to themselves the priestly
   name even here. But these were not apostles, nor prophets, nor
   evangelists, but simply saints. As saints, they were priests. As one
   with the Great High Priest, they were entitled to this name. As those
   who were called to share with Him the future honours of the throne and
   altar, they are the "royal priesthood." Other priests upon earth there
   are none. Usurpers of the name and office there are many. Of true,
   God-chosen priests, there are none save these.

   Their priesthood is still in abeyance, so far as the actual exercise of
   it is concerned. They are priest-elect; but, at present, no more. Their
   title they have received, when brought into the Holy of Holies by the
   blood of Christ; but on the active functions of priesthood they have
   not entered. It doth not yet appear what they shall be. They wear no
   royal crown; they are clothed with no priestly raiments; their garments
   for "glory and for beauty" are still in reserve among the things that
   are "reserved in heaven, ready to be revealed in the last time." Both
   their inheritance and their priesthood are as yet only things of faith;
   they are not to be entered on till their Lord returns; they are priests
   in disguise, and no man owns their claim. Yet it is a sure claim; it is
   a Divine claim; it is a claim which will before long be vindicated. The
   day of the MANIFESTATION of those priests is not far off. And for this
   they wait, carefully abstaining from usurping honours and dignities
   which God has not yet put upon them.

   The High Priest whom they own is now within the veil; and till He come
   forth, they repudiate all priestly pretensions, knowing that at present
   all sacerdotal office, and authority, and glory, are centred in Him
   alone. To attempt to exercise these would be to rob Him of His
   prerogative, to forestall God's purpose, and to defeat the end of the
   present dispensation.

   Their priesthood is after the order of Melchizedek. The King of Salem
   and priest of the Most High God is he whom they point to as their type.
   Their great Head is the true Melchizedek; and they, under Him, can
   claim the office, and name, and dignity. Melchizedek's unknown and
   mysterious parentage is theirs, for the world knows them not, neither
   what nor whence they are. Melchizedek's city was Salem; theirs is the
   New Jerusalem, that cometh down out of heaven from God. His dwelling
   was in a city without a temple, and He exercised His priesthood without
   a temple; so their abode is to be in that city of which it is said, "I
   saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
   temple of it." Distinct from Abraham, and greater than he, though of
   the same common family of man, was Melchizedek; so they, "the church of
   the first-born," distinct from Israel, and greater than they, yet still
   partakers of a common nature, are to inherit a kingdom more glorious
   and heavenly than what shall ever belong to the sons of Abraham
   according to the flesh.

   It is in the age to come that they are to exercise their royal
   priesthood. They are the kings, while the dwellers on earth are the
   subjects. They are priests, and, as such, carry on the intercourse
   between earth and heaven.

   For priesthood is not merely for reconciliation, but for carrying on
   intercourse after reconciliation has been effected. It is not merely
   for securing pardon, but for forming the medium of communication
   between the pardoner and the pardoned. Thus priesthood may exist after
   all sin has passed away, and the curse has been taken from sky and
   earth, and all things have been made new.

   For this end shall priesthood exist in the eternal kingdom, both in the
   person of Christ Himself, and of His saints. A link is needed between
   the upper and the lower creation; between heaven and earth; between the
   visible and the invisible; between the Creator and the created. That
   link shall be the priesthood of Christ and His redeemed. They shall be
   the channels of communication between God and His universe. They shall
   be the leaders of creation's song of praise; from all regions of the
   mighty universe gathering together the multitudinous praises, and
   presenting them in their golden censers before Jehovah's throne.
   Through them worship shall be carried on, and all allegiance presented,
   and prayer sent up from the unnumbered orbs of space, the far-
   extending dominions of the King of kings.

   Whether the kingly or priestly offices are to be conjoined in each
   saint, as in Christ Himself, or whether some are to be priests and some
   kings, we know not. The separation of the offices is quite compatible
   with the truth as the Church forming the Melchizedek priesthood: for
   the reference may be to the Church as a body, and not to each
   individual. And is it not something of this kind that is suggested to
   us by the four living ones and the four-and-twenty elders in the
   Revelation? Do not the former look like priests, and do not the latter
   look like kings?

   Yet it matters not. In either way, the dignity is the same to the
   Church; in either way will the "royal priesthood" exercise their office
   under Him who is the Great Priest and King.

   Our priesthood, then, is an eternal one. There will be room for it, and
   need for it hereafter, though the evils which just now specially call
   for its exercise shall then have passed away. We greatly narrow the
   range of priesthood when we confine it to the times and the places
   where sin is to be found. Such, no doubt, is its present sphere of
   exercise; and it is well, indeed, for us that it is so. Did it not
   extend to this, where should we be? Were it not now ordained specially
   for the alienated and the guilty, to restore the lost friendship, and
   refasten the broken link between them and God, what would become of us?
   But having accomplished this, must it cease? Has it no other region
   within which it can exercise itself? Has it not a wider range of
   function, to which, throughout eternity, it will extend, in the
   carrying out of God's wondrous purposes? And just as the humanity of
   Christ is the great bond of connection between the Divine and the
   human, the great basis on which the universe is to be established
   immovably for ever, and secured against a second fall, so the
   priesthood of Christ, exercised in that humanity, shall be the great
   medium of communication, in all praise, and prayer, and service, and
   worship of every kind; between heaven and earth; between the Creator
   and the creature; between the King Eternal, Immortal, and Invisible,
   and the beings whom He has made for His glory, in all places of His
   dominion, whether in the heaven of heavens, or in the earth below, or
   throughout the measureless regions of the starry universe.

  Chapter 12.

God Seeking Kings.

   One great part of God's eternal purpose in creation was to rule His
   universe by a MAN. "Unto the angels hath He not put in subjection the
   world to come, whereof we speak; but one in a certain place testifieth,
   What is MAN, that Thou art mindful of him, or the SON OF MAN that Thou
   visitest him?" (Heb 2:5,6).

   To Adam therefore He said, "have dominion," or "rule." After the words
   of blessing, conveying fruitfulness to man, "be fruitful and multiply,"
   there are three words added, conveying earth over to man as his
   possession and his kingdom, so that he might exercise authority in it
   by "divine right." 1. Replenish or fill. 2. Subdue. 3. Rule.

   Adam's unfaithfulness, by which dominion was forfeited, did not make
   the great purpose of none effect. That purpose has stood and shall
   stand for ever. Instead of the first Adam God brings in the "last
   Adam," the "second Man," the Lord from heaven, as His King, and He
   introduces His offspring as kings under Him, to fill, subdue, and rule
   the earth.

   He has found His King, and has put all things under His feet: placing
   on His head the many crowns, and setting Him on the throne of universal
   dominion,-- though as yet we see not all things actually put under Him.
   He says, "Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion": and He
   gives Him the heathen for His inheritance and the uttermost ends of the
   earth for His possession. He is the great Melchizedec,--the priestly
   King,--into whose hands all things have been put.

   But under Him, or associated with Him, are other kings. These are the
   redeemed from among men,--the chosen according to the good pleasure of
   His will: by nature, sons of the first Adam, but created anew and made
   sons of the second.

   From the ranks of fallen men God is selecting His kings. He has sent
   His Son to deliver them from their death and curse. He has sent His
   Spirit to quicken them and to transform them, not merely into obedient
   loving subjects, but into kings, heirs of the great throne. "Instead of
   thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make PRINCES in all
   the earth" (Psa 45:16).

   These kings, though by nature mortal men, become heirs of immortality,
   and at the resurrection of the just, put on all that is to fit them for
   their everlasting reign. Everything connected with them is of God.

   1. God elects them. It is by His will that they are what they are. He
   finds the race of Adam in the horrible pit, and out of that ruined mass
   He chooses some,--not only to salvation but to glory and dominion.
   These kings are the chosen of God.

   2. He redeems them. They are found in the low dungeon, captives and
   prisoners in the hands of the great oppressor. God sends redemption to
   them,-- redemption through Him who takes their captivity upon Him, that
   they may be set free; who enters their prison-house, and takes their
   bonds upon Him that they may be unbound. In Him they have redemption
   through His blood.

   3. He consecrates them. Their consecration is by blood. It is the blood
   of the covenant that sets them apart for their future work and honour.
   Sprinkled with the precious blood they are "sanctified" for
   dominion;--for that holy royalty to which they have been chosen.

   4. He anoints them. With that same anointing with which Christ was
   anointed, they are anointed too,--anointed for royal
   rule,--priestly-royal rule. The Holy Spirit, dwelling in them, as in
   their Head, coming down on them, as on their Head, fits them for the
   exercise of dominion. The wisdom needed for government is a holy
   wisdom, and this holy wisdom they receive by means of the unction from
   the Holy One.

   5. He crowns them. They are, as yet, only kings- elect. Their
   coronation-day is yet to come. Yet the crown is already theirs by
   right; and He who chose them to the throne will before long put the
   crown upon their head.

   Not out of the ranks of angels is He seeking kings. This would not suit
   His purpose, nor magnify the riches of His grace. Fallen man must
   furnish Him with the rulers of His universe. Human hands must wield the
   sceptre, and human heads must wear the crown.

   To this honour He is calling us. He is sending out His ambassadors for
   this end; and the gospel with which they are intrusted is the glad
   tidings of a kingdom. And this in a double sense. There is a kingdom
   into which they are to enter and be partakers of its glory: and yet, in
   the same kingdom, they are to be God's anointed kings. It is a kingdom
   doubly theirs. They not only "see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3); they
   not only "enter into the kingdom of God"; but they occupy its thrones.
   "The kingdom, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom, under
   the whole heaven, is given to the people of the saints of the Most
   High, and they possess the kingdom" (Dan 7:22,27). "I appoint unto you
   a kingdom," says our Lord, "that ye may sit on thrones" (Luke 22:28).
   "To him that overcometh will I give to sit on my throne, even as I also
   overcame and am set down with my Father on His throne" (Rev 3:21).
   Hence they sing the song, "Thou art worthy, for Thou hast redeemed us
   by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
   and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on
   the earth" (Rev 5:9). Not to be reigned over, but to reign, is the
   honour to which they are called. "They shall REIGN for ever and ever"
   (Rev 22:5).

   O sons of men! This is the honour to which God is calling you. It is
   for the end of making you His kings that He is seeking you. To deliver
   you from wrath is the beginning of His purpose concerning you; to set
   you on His throne is the end. Nothing short of this. Think what the
   riches of His grace must be, and His kindness towards us in Christ
   Jesus our Lord! Where sin has abounded grace has abounded more. Herein
   is love! Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that
   we should not only be called sons but kings; that we should not only be
   lifted to a place in His family, but to a seat upon His throne! To make
   us in any way or in any sense partakers of His glory and sharers in His
   dominion is much but to make us "heirs of God and joint-heirs with
   Christ," is unspeakably more. A throne such as man can give and take
   away seems to many a worthy object of ambition; how much more the
   kingdom which God gives, the kingdom which cannot be moved.

   And if any one asks, How may I share this royalty and win this crown?
   we answer in the well- known words, "As many as received Him, to them
   gave He power (right) to become the sons of God"; for what is true of
   the sonship is true of the kingship too. We obtain it by receiving the
   Son of God. He that takes Christ receives a kingdom, and becomes a
   king. His connection with the King of kings is His security for a
   throne. Oneness with Christ gives him the royal inheritance. To be
   washed in His blood, to be clothed with His raiment, to be quickened
   with His life, to be gladdened with His love, to be crowned with His
   crown,--these are some of the steps of honour, up which He leads those
   who believe in His name.

   For it is a throne that cannot be bought. It is THE GIFT of "the King
   eternal, immortal, and invisible"; and He giveth it to whomsoever He
   will. The invitation which the Son of God gives to us in His gospel is
   an invitation to a throne and crown. He holds it up and bids us look at
   it. He holds it out and bids us take it.

   I know not if all this were ever better described than by John Bunyan,
   in the beginning of the "Pilgrim's Progress," in the dialogue between
   Christian and Pliable:--

   "Pli.--Come, neighbour Christian, since there are none but us two here,
   tell me now further what the things are, and how to be enjoyed, whither
   we are going.

   "Chr.--I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak of them
   with my tongue: but yet, since you are desirous to know, I will read of
   them in my book.

   "Pli.--And do you think that the words of your book are certainly true?

   "Chr.--Yes, verily; for it was made by Him that cannot lie.

   "Pli.--Well said; what things are they?

   "Chr.--There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and everlasting
   life to be given us, that we may inhabit the kingdom for ever.

   "Pli.--Well said; and what else?

   "Chr.--There are crowns of glory to be given us, and garments that will
   make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven.

   "Pli.--This is very pleasant; and what else?

   "Chr.--There shall be no more crying, nor sorrow: for He that is owner
   of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes.

   "Pli.--And what company shall we have there?

   "Chr.--There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims, creatures that
   will dazzle your eyes to look on them. There also you shall meet with
   thousands and tens of thousands that have gone before us to that place;
   none of them are hurtful, but loving and holy; every one walking in the
   sight of God, and standing in His presence with acceptance for ever. In
   a word, there we shall see the elders with their golden crowns; there
   we shall see the holy virgins with their golden harps; there we shall
   see men that by the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of
   beasts, drowned in the seas, for the love that they bare to the Lord of
   the place, all well, and clothed with immortality as with a garment.

   "Pli.--The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart. But are
   these things to be enjoyed? How shall we get to be sharers thereof?

   "Chr.--THE LORD, THE GOVERNOR OF THE COUNTRY, HATH RECORDED THAT IN
   THIS BOOK; THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS, IF WE BE TRULY WILLING TO HAVE
   IT, HE WILL BESTOW IT UPON US FREELY."

   Thus very simply and beautifully does Bunyan put the manner of our
   obtaining the glory. Some would call this too free. Some would say,
   Here is the way made far too easy, without any preparatory alarms and
   repentance. But there stands John Bunyan's idea of the way of a
   sinner's entrance into the kingdom; and let him who can improve or
   correct it do so. "The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded
   that in this book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing to
   have it, He will bestow it upon us freely."

   Bunyan's soundness of doctrine is well known. His Calvinism was of a
   very decided kind. His views of Christ's redemption-work were very
   precise. His belief as to the necessity of the Holy Spirit's work was
   undoubted; yet he delighted to set forth the gospel in all its
   scriptural simplicity, unencumbered with preparatory exercises and
   processes intended to make the sinner "fit for receiving Christ," and
   fit for having the peace of the gospel dispensed to him; and never did
   he state that free gospel more freely, that simple gospel more simply,
   than when, in the manifest fulness of his heart, he wrote the above
   sentence, and put it into the lips of his pilgrim:-- "IF WE BE TRULY
   WILLING TO HAVE IT. HE WILL BESTOW IT UPON US FREELY."

   Such a sentence shines like a star; yes, like a star to a
   tempest-tossed sinner in his night of darkness. He asks, How may I be
   saved? how may I be made a worshipper? how may I become a temple? how
   may I be taken into the royal priesthood? God's answer is not, works,
   and pray, and wait, and get convictions, and bring yourself under the
   stroke of the law; but believe and live; believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and thou shalt be saved. Likest in its naked simplicity to
   these divine utterances is that star- like sentence of the Puritan
   dreamer. It is but another form, in language all his own, of the
   concluding message of gladness dropped from heaven, as the great book
   of truth was about to be closed and sealed:-- "WHOSOEVER WILL, LET HIM
   TAKE THE WATER OF LIFE FREELY."

   Too free! Too easy! Too simple! It will only make skin-deep professors!
   Another gospel! So say some whose idea of the gospel seems to be that
   of a work to be done by the sinner, not of a work which Christ has
   already done; whose exhortations to the inquirer are, Wait, pray, seek,
   wrestle, labour on, and possibly God may drop salvation into our lap;
   whose theory of a sinner's approach to a Saviour turns all upon the
   necessity of some long, laborious preliminary seekings, repentances,
   convictions, terrors, by which he is so humbled and broken, as to be at
   length in a right frame for Christ to bless him, in a right condition
   to be trusted with rest of soul;--whose largest grasp of the glorious
   gospel extends only to this, that it is good news for the qualified,
   for those who have been ploughed deep enough and long enough by the
   law. [18]

   Well: go to; go to, we say to such. Away and dispute the matter not
   with us, but with the Master. Ask Him why He "received sinners" at
   once, without preliminary work, or qualification, or preparation, or
   delay; why He said to the hardened profligate of Sychar, "Thou wouldst
   have asked, and He would have given"; to Zaccheus, "Make haste and come
   down, for today I must abide at thy house"; to the adulteress, "Neither
   do I condemn thee"; to the thief upon the cross, "Today shalt thou be
   with me in paradise." Upbraid Him with allowing three thousand of
   Jerusalem sinners, at one bound, and under one single message, to pass
   into the kingdom, instead of keeping them "waiting at the pool," or
   tortured by the law into gloomy fitness for the glad tidings: express
   your astonishment that He should have set such an example of rearing
   churches out of heathen idolaters in a single day,--Corinth, Ephesus,
   Colosse, Thessalonica, Philippi, without waiting for years before
   calling their members "saints," or permitting them to sit down at the
   table of the Lord; set up your foolishness against His wisdom, your
   presumption against His lowliness, your traditions against His
   commandments, your love of darkness against His joy in light; proclaim
   your amended gospel, the gospel of Galatia, "Except ye be circumcised,
   Christ shall profit you nothing"; but what will be the result of those
   amendments and restrictions on Christ's free gospel? What will all this
   wood, and hay, and stubble come to in the great day of the Lord? What
   will be thought of all these barriers which human self-righteousness
   has reared to check the speed of the flying manslayer, and keep him
   from too easy and too swift an entrance into the city of refuge, when
   "the breath of the Lord, like an overflowing stream" (Isa 30:28), shall
   sweep these barriers and their builders clean away.

   they are not yet qualified and sufficiently fitted for Christ, and that
   they have not seen themselves absolutely lost, not so much burdened
   with sin as they should. And, it is to be feared, that Satan makes use
   of many of God's ministers, as the old prophet mentioned, 1 Kings
   13:11, &c,. to keep off, and drive away souls from Christ, under the
   notion of preaching peremptory doctrine for Christ, and so seek to fit
   men for him, as some have preached many months together this doctrine,
   before they would preach Christ at all; whereas their commission, and
   the example of Christ and His disciples, was to preach glad tidings
   first."--Powel, an old Puritan.
